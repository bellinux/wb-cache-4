This paper considers what meanings {{have been given to}} the term affordability in practice and suggests a range of analytically more useful definitions.

Most researchers have been using a ratio definition. The paper then uses data from a household survey in the Glasgow <b>Travel-to-Work</b> <b>Area</b> in 1988 / 89 to examine the incidence of 'unaffordability ' of housing costs according to a variety of definitions...|$|E

Non-technical Summary In 1999, 39 % of births in Britain were outside marriage. Children born outside marriage spend a longer average time living with one parent than those born within marriage and this appears to have long-term consequences to have long term consequences for the children. This paper studies the impact of employment opportunities on the decision to become a mother outside marriage. There are at least two ways in which economic opportunity may affect childbearing outside marriage. Poor employment opportunities for young men may discourage marriage, thereby increasing the population of young women at risk to have a birth outside marriage and making it more likely that a pregnant woman does not marry the father of the child. In addition, poorer employment opportunities for young women, which tend to go hand-in-hand with poorer opportunities for young men, reduce women’s opportunity cost of childbearing, thereby tending to increase childbearing directly. The present study estimates the impact of employment opportunities in local labour markets on the pre-marital first birth rate in Great Britain. It exploits variation in the unemployment rate in 300 “travel-to-work areas ” over time and space to identify this effect. The data come from matching the first eight years o...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with men's attitudes towards the breadwinner role. A representative sample of 330 men, aged between 17 and 84, and drawn from the Plymouth <b>Travel-To-Work</b> <b>Area,</b> {{participated in the study}} by completing a postal questionnaire. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore attachment to the breadwinner role, and to discover if greater or lesser attachment exists among particular socio-demographic or socio-economic clusters. The quantitative approach and the application of a random sample distinguish this study from those in the literature concerned with 'men and masculinities'. The study applies an empirical perspective to overview the trajectory of the breadwinner family in Britain from the early industrial to the contemporary period. It is argued that although there have been peaks and troughs in the extent to which British families have been financially supported by a sole male provider, the breadwinner role continues to be an important ideological tool. It is suggested that the 'male as provider' doctrine shapes the internal dynamics of various familial arrangements. Only a handful of men are found to support a strict gender-coded division of labour in the household and labour market. The respondent's age is the strongest explanatory factor. Among those demonstrating lesser attachment, attitudes towards the breadwinner role are noted to be contextual and inconsistent. Greater support is also found for the traditional female role than the male role. It is argued that these findings represent new contributions to the debates. They are applied to challenge claims that the growth of the 'dual-earner' family has diminished the relevance of the breadwinner role in contemporary society. In doing so, this study concludes that many men maintain a dominant position in various family types, and a gendered distribution of privilege and inequality continues to shape men's and women's respective experiences of 'the family'.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to analyse the {{function}} fulfilled by the Youth Opportunities Programme (1978 - 1983) in its wider political, economic and historical context. There are three main sections to the work. The first establishes the context from which the Youth Opportunities Programme (YOP) emerged. This includes: {{an analysis of the}} origins and early development of the Manpower Services Commission (MSC); an historical account of government policy and special measures for the relief of unemployment; and a description of the circumstances and manner in which these elements came together {{in the development of the}} MSC's special measures policy, leading to the launch of YOP in April 1978. It is concluded that the initial role of the programme was essentially that of a palliative in the context of the Labour Government's social contract relationship with the trade union movement rather than being a positive element in the MSC's development of a comprehensive manpower policy. The second section is concerned with the actual development and performance of the programme in relation to its original objectives. This includes national level analyses in terms of both quantitative and qualitative objectives, and the conclusions of a case study conducted in the Portsmouth <b>Travel-to-Work</b> <b>Area.</b> The third section examines the significance of the divergences revealed between objectives and results, both in the context of contemporary political and economic developments, and also in a wider historical context which includes the initial progress made by YOP's successor, the Youth Training Scheme (YTS). It is concluded that, although YOP continued to act as a palliative, it developed beyond this towards a new form of active manpower policy consistent with a monetarist macro-economic context.

40|$|A <b>Travel-to-work</b> <b>Area</b> (TTWA) {{theoretically}} {{represents a}} self-contained {{labour market area}} in which all commuting occurs within the boundary of that area. It has been re-defined once a decade when analyses on commuting patterns drawn from the UK Censuses were completed. In December 2015, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) published TTWAs based on the 2011 Census results. TTWAs are used primarily to aid understanding of labour markets across the UK. However, residential location and commuting patterns can also contribute to understanding local housing markets. The conventional assumption is that local labour markets are spatial proxies for housing markets. Indeed, housing professionals have been employing TTWAs in this way in their strategic plans. One of the issues in using existing TTWA s {{in this way is}} that they do not allow for overlap. Consider a household with two earners, one of whom is commuting within the TTWA while the other is commuting to a business hub outside their TTWA. For example, Cambridge TTWA has now expanded as far south as Hertford and Harlow – settlements containing many London commuters. Taking Cambridge as our example we attempt in this paper to experimentally identify commuting areas for Cambridge that lie within the boundaries of other employment hubs, such as Ely. In this way we can start to address the reality that TTWAs, certainly in terms of local housing markets, are not discrete – they overlap. The remainder of this brief report is structured as follows: Section 2 considers various alternative local housing market definitions and compares them to the 2011 Cambridge TTWA. Section 3 selects several employment hubs closest to Cambridge City, and uses Lower Super Output Areas as the basis for identifying the relevant local housing market area for the city and surrounding areas. In Section 4 we consider the housing needs (availability and affordability) of households of two earners, one of whom is commuting to work in the Ely employment hub while the other is commuting to Cambridge employment hub – producing a more complex but more accurate picture of local housing needs. Section 5 discusses the findings and suggests further research in respect of local housing markets in and around the Cambridge TTWA and beyon...|$|E

The Workplace Employee Relations Survey, 1998 (WERS 98) is the fourth {{in a series of}} surveys which began in 1980 (previously known as the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, or WIRS - the name was changed in 1998 to better reflect the content of the present survey). Its primary aim is to provide statistically reliable, nationally representative data on the current state of workplace relations and employment practices in Britain. The WERS 98 Data Dissemination Service was established in October 1999 at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). The Service was funded for a two year period by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), and closed in January 2002. All major activity has now ceased, but the web site will continue to remain live for the benefit of WERS 98 users and those interested in WERS 98. Users may also be interested in WERS 2004 : the WERS 2004 study is held at the UKDA under SN 5294, and a similar analysis and dissemination service, the WERS 2004 Information and Advice Service (WIAS) has also been established. For the seventh edition (October 2007), a file containing updated <b>Travel-to-Work</b> <b>Area</b> (TTWA) variables was deposited, with accompanying documentation, to replace the previous file 'local 98 '. See documentation for further details. Main Topics : The WERS 98 cross-section survey contains data from interviews held with managers and worker representatives, as well as information from a self-completion questionnaire which employees in the selected workplace were invited to complete. The sample covered British workplaces with at least 10 employees. Managers participating in the survey were usually the most senior manager at the workplace with responsibility for employment relations. They were asked mainly factual questions covering {{a wide range of issues}} that deal with the employment relationship. Some examples include: recruitment and training; consultation and communication; worker representation; payment systems; equal opportunities; health and safety; flexibility and performance; change; and attitudes to work. The cross-sectional management questionnaire for this survey also comprises Wave 1 of the Workplace Employee Relations Survey, 2004 : Panel Survey, 1998 - 2004 (WERS 2004). Wave 2 of the 1998 - 2004 panel is held with the rest of the WERS 2004 data under SN 5294. Worker representatives were interviewed where there was a lay representative of a recognised union at the workplace or, if there was no recognised union, with the senior employee representative of any joint consultative committee operating at the workplace. An interview was only conducted with the permission of management. Representatives were asked about the duties they performed when dealing with management and employees. Employees were randomly selected by the interviewer from a list of all employees provided by the management respondent. A maximum of 25 employees were selected, however, in workplaces with fewer than 25 employees, all were asked to complete the questionnaire. Questions asked were predominantly concerned with the employees attitudes and impressions of work covering issues such as satisfaction and commitment.
