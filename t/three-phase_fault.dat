50|$|In solid or {{directly}} earthed neutral, transformer's star point is {{directly connected to}} the ground. In this solution, a low-impedance path is provided for the ground fault current to close and, as result, their magnitudes are comparable with <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> currents. Since the neutral remains at the potential close to the ground, voltages in unaffected phases remain at levels similar to the pre-fault ones; for that reason, this system is regularly used in high-voltage transmission networks, where insulation costs are high.|$|E
50|$|By {{enclosing}} the conductors {{in separate}} housings {{a high degree}} of protection from two-phase and three-phase faults is obtained. Almost any fault would instead be a single-phase earth fault which does not produce a large fault current. The conductors between the generator and the first circuit breaker are even more important to protect against two- and three-phase faults because there is no breaker that can stop the fault current from the generator. While most modern circuit breakers will interrupt the fault current in less than 50 ms, the fault current from the generator will take several seconds to interrupt because the field current in the rotor takes this amount of time to discharge. The consequenses of a two- or <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> between the generator and the first circuit breaker are therefore much more serious and often result in severe damage to the busbars and nearby equipment.|$|E
30|$|Stage 2 : in this stage, the {{reactors}} {{in the arms}} discharge continuously, and the AC-side sources feed <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> current. For the whole DC system, especially the ac-side system and the devices in the MMC arms, the overcurrent in this stage {{is the most serious}} because of the <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> current from the AC-side sources. So we must take measures to minimize the negative effects exerted on the system.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{proposed}} simulation model in Section 3, large numbers of fault simulations are performed at different locations of the system model. The typical simulation results for <b>three-phase</b> <b>faults</b> and phase-to-phase faults at location f 4 are presented in this section.|$|R

30|$|Doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG)-based wind farm has the characteristic of transient fault {{with low voltage}} ride through (LVRT) capability. A new <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> direction identification method for the outgoing transmission line of the wind farm is presented. The ability of the new directional relay to differentiate between a <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> in one direction or the other is obtained by using the increment of phase angle difference between the memory voltage signal and the fault current signal within a certain time, and using the amplitude variation of the fault current. It can be inferred that the fault current is supplied by the wind farm whether the phase angle differs or the current amplitude varies considerably. Different fault locations at the outgoing transmission line have been simulated by PSCAD/EMTDC to evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of the proposed technique. Results show that the new directional relay is of faster response when a <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> occurs at the outgoing transmission line of a DFIG-based wind farm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{locating}} multi-phase faults in ungrounded distribution systems, including phase-to-phase faults, double-phase-to-ground <b>faults,</b> and <b>three-phase</b> <b>faults.</b> Through {{identification of the}} faulty feeder section, the fault location algorithm is only imple-mented on the faulty section of the feeder, thus avoiding the unnecessary computations. A two-ended fault location algorithm is implemented for both two and three phase faults on the mainline of the faulty section. Two different one-ended fault location algorithms are also implemented for handling two-phase <b>faults</b> and <b>three-phase</b> <b>faults</b> on the laterals of the faulty section respectively. The proposed fault location algorithms make no assumption regarding the fault impedance, thus estimation of fault location is invariant to fault impedances. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method...|$|R
30|$|In [11, 12], a {{commutation}} failure immunity index (CFII) is proposed {{to assess the}} immunity of an HVDC converter to CF. However, to obtain the CFII, electromagnetic transient simulations are required for calculating the smallest possible fault inductance that does not result in a CF. Reference [13] provided an analytical expression of a CFII based on the simulation result that the CFII is insensitive to the fault time under a <b>three-phase</b> inductive <b>fault</b> condition. However, in contrast to CFIIs for <b>three-phase</b> <b>faults,</b> CFIIs for single-phase faults {{are closely related to}} the fault time [12].|$|R
30|$|Simulation {{results show}} that, {{when the new}} {{direction}} element criterion is adopted, the fault direction can be correctly identified when <b>three-phase</b> <b>faults</b> occur in the forward and backward directions of the outgoing transmission line, and are not affected by {{factors such as the}} rotating frequency of the fan, the resistance value of the crowbar and the length of the line.|$|R
30|$|Besides the {{foregoing}} fault disturbance cases, two-phase-short-circuit and <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> disturbance scenarios are also simulated with different fault duration setting.

It {{consists of the}} voltage detection and voltage regulation schemes in the 0 dq reference. The proposed control strategy uses the proportional controller in which the proportional gain, kp, is appropriately adjusted by using genetic algorithms. To verify its use, a simplified 4 -bus test system is situated by assuming a <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> at bus 4. As a result, the D-STATCOM can resume the load voltage to the desired level within 1. 8 ms.

30|$|In {{condition}} ④, {{the isolation}} of the faulted AC side can be achieved without the special control and protection, so the basic control and protection strategy under condition ① is sufficient. The fault analyzed and simulated in this paper is the most severe AC <b>fault,</b> <b>three-phase</b> short-circuit <b>fault.</b> Therefore, the other types of faults can be effectively isolated in the MTDC system by applying the special control and protection strategy proposed.|$|R
30|$|Although, {{distance}} relay can easily detect unsymmetrical faults with various faulted loops by assessing the negative sequence of current signal, it is faced by challenge in symmetrical faults during power swing because of inconsiderable amount of negative sequence during <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|E
30|$|From Fig.  6 b, the {{differences}} among CCFVs of one HVDC system for different fault positions and fault times are very large, and Fig.  7 shows that {{the differences}} among the CCFVs of different HVDC systems for the same fault are also very large. This indicates a large discreteness in the voltage drop condition that causes CF and means that the maximum permissible voltage drop criterion does not adequately reflect the characteristics of CF. From Fig.  7 b, {{it is noted that}} for TG-HVDC, a single-phase fault can more easily cause CF than a <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault,</b> in contrast to the common viewpoint that a <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> is more severe and more likely to cause CF.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to modify the {{traditional}} concentric PSB to enable it for detecting <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> during power swing. In this paper, Phasor Estimation Error (PEE) is employed as a quantity with high abrupt at fault initiation that helps the proposed method in determining the location of second pair of concentric PSB. According to proposed method, two indices are used in this method for detecting fault during power swing, which these indices complete each other. The first index (IX 1) is transient monitor that shows occurrence of transient in signal and determines the location of second pair of characteristic and the second index (IX 2) that is the output of second concentric characteristics as final index for detecting <b>three-phase</b> <b>fault</b> during power swing.|$|E
