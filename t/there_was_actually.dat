25|$|Despite the film's central DIY theme, the {{original}} calendar enjoyed sponsorship from British Parliamentarian Glenda Jackson. Also, the film suggests that {{local and national}} WI branches were opposed to the calendar, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> emphatic support for the project from those bodies.|$|E
25|$|The Astor Library {{suffered}} from its name. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> no proprietorship, and {{no question of}} family fiefdom. It was a free public library. But the public, though free to criticize, was reluctant to contribute towards its support. That was left to the Astors.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 {{remake of}} A Nightmare On Elm Street, Jackie Earle Haley portrayed Freddy Krueger. In the film, Krueger is {{depicted}} as a child abuser {{who worked as a}} gardener at a local preschool. Unlike in the original version of events, where he was a known child-killer who evaded conviction on a technicality, in this version of events <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> ambiguity about Kruger's guilt or innocence apart from the testimony of his victims, until the now-grown survivors find the room where Krueger molested them while searching for evidence.|$|E

25|$|Such was {{the extent}} and {{efficacy}} of his preparation of the script that almost no line of dialogue was eliminated in the final edit of the film. Except for some exterior night shots, Huston shot the entire film in sequence, which greatly helped his actors. The shooting went so smoothly that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> extra time for the cast to enjoy themselves; Huston brought Bogart, Astor, Bond, Lorre and others to the Lakeside Golf Club near the Warner lot to relax in the pool, dine, drink and talk until midnight about {{anything other than the}} film they were working on.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Harry Wicks was {{expelled}} from the Communist Party {{on the basis of}} charges made by the Chicago Federation of Labor that he was a spy. This time the charges stuck and Wicks {{was expelled}}. Adding insult to injury, the old accusation which he had dodged in 1923 was revisited and it was declared that Wicks had been a spy ever since joining the party in 1919. Historian Theodore Draper later claimed, {{on the basis of a}} review of Wicks' private papers, that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> no convincing evidence of the veracity of these charges — which may well have been influenced by the spy-mania of the Great Purges then sweeping the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|However, on 1 November 1987, during {{transit to}} Ireland, {{one-third of the}} total Libyan arms {{consignment}} being carried aboard the MV Eksund was intercepted by the French Navy while the ship was in the Bay of Biscay, along with five crew members, among them Gabriel Cleary. The vessel was found to contain 120 tonnes of weapons, including HMGs, 36 RPGs, 1000 detonators, 20 SAMs, Semtex and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition. Ed Moloney claimed that the Eksund shipment also contained military mortars and a 106-millimetre cannon, an assertion never confirmed by the Irish authorities. Despite the Eksund fiasco, the IRA was by then equipped with a {{quantity and quality of}} weaponry and explosives never available to them at any other phase of their history. Furthermore, according to Brendan O'Brien <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> an 'over-supply', especially regarding the 600 AK-47s still {{in the hands of the}} IRA by 1992.|$|E

500|$|Despite these limitations, {{the vehicle}} {{was seen as}} {{only the first step}} in a series of {{increasingly}} ambitious electrical cars. Sinclair intended it to prove the viability of electric personal transport; the hope was that, just as Sinclair had found with home computers like the hugely successful ZX81 and ZX Spectrum, an affordable electric vehicle could unleash pent-up demand for a market that did not previously exist. However, Sinclair performed no market research to ascertain whether <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> a market for his electric vehicle; as the director of the Primary Contact advertising agency commented in January 1985, the project continued all the way to the prototype stage [...] "purely on the convictions of Sir Clive".|$|E
500|$|However, Prost had {{the firm}} belief that Honda and Ron Dennis viewed Senna {{as the future}} of the team. Prost {{recalled}} that by the Italian Grand Prix he had one car with maybe four or five mechanics, while his teammate had two cars and 20 people around him. Before the race Prost, who had announced in July 1989 that he would depart from McLaren, announced he was joining Ferrari. Although Prost was forced to make a public apology to both McLaren and Honda over his Monza comments, he received support from Nigel Mansell (who would be his [...] teammate at Ferrari), and former teammate Rosberg who claimed that once it became known they would not be using the Japanese engines the next season, their Honda engines did not seem to work as well as was once normal. Prost actually won the Italian Grand Prix, after Senna's engine blew with only 9 laps remaining. Until that point Prost's MP4/5 had not been a match for Senna's on Monza's long straights, which had many, especially those in the press, wondering if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> truth to Prost's claim that his Honda engines were not as good as the ones Senna was able to use.|$|E

2500|$|The Belfast Telegraph {{newspaper}} {{summed up}} Billy Wright {{as having been}} [...] "one of the most fear-inspiring loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland since the Shankill Butchers in the 1970s". Peter Taylor offered an alternative insight into the reputation of Billy Wright by suggesting that popular myth had laid many killings and atrocities at Wright's door when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> little evidence to back them up.|$|E

There'll be another one along any minute." [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> a streetcar line in New Orleans named Desire Street and simply signed Desire.

2500|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> little {{reaction}} to the quotes on Merseyside at the time, they did draw comment from Phil Hammond, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, who said: [...] "I can't believe that even after all these years, there is no remorse or regret for the hurt he caused". It was still thought at this point however that, although MacKenzie appeared not to regret the coverage, he no longer regarded it as having any factual basis after his apparent admissions {{in the past that}} the allegations made were lies fed to him by police officers and a Conservative MP.|$|E
2500|$|Later that year, {{during the}} {{invasion}} of Jing Province, after Lü Meng received the surrender of Mi Fang, the Administrator of Nan Commandery (南郡; commandery capital in present-day Jiangling County, Hubei), he did not immediately order his forces to occupy the city and instead held celebrations on the beach. Yu Fan reminded Lü Meng, [...] "As of now, only General Mi has surrendered to us. We cannot trust {{that everyone in the}} city is willing to surrender too. Why are you celebrating here instead of quickly taking control of the city?" [...] Lü Meng followed Yu Fan's advice. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> a planned ambush in the city but it was not successfully carried out because Lü Meng heeded Yu Fan's warning in time.|$|E
