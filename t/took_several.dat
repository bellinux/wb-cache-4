5|$|Another song {{sequence}} ("Suraj Hua Maddham") involving Khan and Kajol {{was shot}} with {{the backdrop of}} the Pyramids of Giza in the city of Cairo in Egypt. Due to the lighting conditions, the crew could shoot only between 7 and 9am in the morning. As a result, the song <b>took</b> <b>several</b> days to film. In addition, Kajol suffered from a minor injury while filming for the song, as she had experienced a bad fall.|$|E

5|$|Because with Calcraft's methods the {{condemned}} <b>took</b> <b>several</b> minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft would sometimes dramatically pull on legs or climb on shoulders {{in an effort}} to break a victim's neck.

5|$|Cowan and Hook {{suggest that}} Lucullus would have {{deployed}} the Romans in a simplex acies, {{that is to}} say a single line, so making the frontage of the army as wide as possible as a counter to the cavalry. He <b>took</b> <b>several</b> of his troops downriver, where the river was the easiest to ford, and at one moment, Tigranes believed that this move meant Lucullus was withdrawing from the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|Statistical {{rating systems}} give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions, mainly because he <b>took</b> <b>several</b> long breaks from {{competitive}} play.

Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years, from 1862 to 1894.|$|E

5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted {{that there was little}} hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it <b>took</b> <b>several</b> decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts. Arguing that there was little evidence for how the faith was born, he suggested that the city of Mecca {{may not have been the}} real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's existence as a real historical figure– claimed that much of the Islamic origin story was later developed in the early years of the Arab Empire.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that <b>took</b> <b>several</b> hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E

5|$|After {{her husband}} died in 1841, a series of {{complications}} obstructed Hańska's marriage to Balzac. Chief of these was the estate and her daughter Anna's inheritance, both of which might be threatened if she married him. Anna married a Polish count, easing some of the pressure. About the same time, Hańska gave Balzac the idea for his 1844 novel Modeste Mignon. In 1850 they finally married, and moved to Paris, but he died five months later. Though she never remarried, she <b>took</b> <b>several</b> lovers, and died in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Although Cryer gained fame {{with his}} early film roles, it <b>took</b> <b>several</b> {{years to find}} success on television; none of his star vehicles, {{including}} The Famous Teddy Z, Partners, and The Trouble with Normal, lasted more than 22 episodes. In 2003, Cryer was cast as Alan Harper on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, for which he won two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009 and 2012. Cryer received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television in 2011.|$|E
5|$|At 9:50 {{and under}} heavy {{pressure}} from the Greek fleet, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, {{and headed for the}} safety of the straits. The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. Barbaros Hayreddin, Turgut Reis, and Mesudiye <b>took</b> <b>several</b> hits during the battle, though only Barbaros Hayreddin was significantly damaged. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles. When they approached the straits, Mesudiye and Âsâr-ı Tevfik took up positions to cover the withdrawal of the damaged pre-dreadnoughts. The ships reached port by 13:00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship Resit Paşa.|$|E
