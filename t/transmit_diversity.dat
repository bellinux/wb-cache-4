40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} wireless multi-carrier communications systems applying different <b>transmit</b> antenna <b>diversity</b> techniques. Whereas the transmitter has available multiple antennas, we assume a single antenna at the receiver. Thus, {{we consider}} multiple-input single-output multi-carrier transmission systems which are {{of special interest}} for downlink mobile radio applications. For these systems, we investigate the matched-filter bounds which represent the performance in an environment free of any interference and, thus, are lower bounds on the achievable performance. Especially, {{we focus on the}} analytical determination of the matched-filter bounds for selection <b>diversity,</b> since this <b>transmit</b> antenna <b>diversity</b> technique requires the least amount of preprocessing at the transmitter. Based on the derived matched-filter bounds, selection diversity is investigated in detail and compared to other <b>transmit</b> antenna <b>diversity</b> techniques which are based on the maximum-ratio and the equal-gain transmission principle, respectively. ...|$|R

50|$|Considering antenna diversity, in many systems {{additional}} antennas may {{be expensive}} or impractical at the remote or {{even at the}} base station. In these cases, <b>transmit</b> <b>diversity</b> {{can be used to}} provide diversity benefit at a receiver with multiple transmit antennas only. With <b>transmit</b> <b>diversity,</b> multiple antennas transmit delayed versions of a signal, creating frequency-selective fading, which is equalized at the receiver to provide diversity gain.|$|E
5000|$|STTD {{is one of}} {{numerous}} open loop <b>transmit</b> <b>diversity</b> schemes which also include Phase Switched <b>Transmit</b> <b>Diversity</b> (PSTD), Time Switched Diversity (TSTD), Orthogonal <b>Transmit</b> <b>Diversity</b> (OTD) and Space Time Spreading (STS) 1. The aim {{of all of these}} schemes is to smooth the Rayleigh fading and drop out effects observed when using only a single antenna at both ends of a radio link in a Multipath propagation environment. Diversity improves link reliability for each user over time, especially near cell edges (in the absence of soft handoff), and also the average performance of an ensemble of users at any particular instant. Not being reliant on slow channel-state feedback from the mobile (i.e. user equipment) means that open loop STTD is almost immune to Doppler shifts associated with high UE speeds and is the preferred method for this scenario. However, an open loop <b>transmit</b> <b>diversity</b> scheme must not degrade performance for a user close to the base station where the channels may be line of sight and nearly ideal. Since STTD is an orthogonal coding system this is also guaranteed.|$|E
50|$|The {{significance}} of Alamouti's proposal in 1998 {{is that it}} was the first demonstration of a method of encoding which enables full diversity with linear processing at the receiver. Earlier proposals for <b>transmit</b> <b>diversity</b> required processing schemes which scaled exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. Furthermore, it was the first open-loop <b>transmit</b> <b>diversity</b> technique which had this capability. Subsequent generalizations of Alamouti's concept have led to a tremendous impact on the wireless communications industry.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} asymptotic capacity {{limits of}} the Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel (BC) with spatially correlated fading to understand when and how much transmit correlation helps the capacity. By imposing a structure on channel covariances (equivalently, transmit correlations at the transmitter side) of users, {{also referred to as}} <b>transmit</b> correlation <b>diversity,</b> the impact of transmit correlation on the power gain of MIMO BCs is characterized in several regimes of system parameters, with a particular interest in the large-scale array (or massive MIMO) regime. Taking the cost for downlink training into account, we provide asymptotic capacity bounds of multiuser MIMO downlink systems to see how <b>transmit</b> correlation <b>diversity</b> affects the system multiplexing gain. We make use of the notion of joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) to derive the capacity bounds. It is advocated in this paper that <b>transmit</b> correlation <b>diversity</b> may be of use to significantly increase multiplexing gain as well as power gain in multiuser MIMO systems. In particular, the new type of diversity in wireless communications is shown to improve the system multiplexing gain up to by a factor of the number of degrees of such diversity. Finally, performance limits of conventional large-scale MIMO systems not exploiting transmit correlation are also characterized. Comment: 29 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|A {{contemporary}} {{perspective on}} the tradeoff between <b>transmit</b> antenna <b>diversity</b> and spatial multiplexing is provided. It is argued that, {{in the context of}} most modern wireless systems and for the operating points of interest, transmission techniques that utilize all available spatial degrees of freedom for multiplexing outperform techniques that explicitly sacrifice spatial multiplexing for diversity. In the context of such systems, therefore, there essentially is no decision to be made between <b>transmit</b> antenna <b>diversity</b> and spatial multiplexing in MIMO communication. Reaching this conclusion, however, requires that the channel and some key system features be adequately modeled and that suitable performance metrics be adopted; failure to do so may bring about starkly different conclusions. As a specific example, this contrast is illustrated using the 3 GPP Long-Term Evolution system design. ...|$|R

50|$|Antenna {{diversity}} is especially effective at mitigating these multipath situations. This is because multiple antennas offer a receiver several {{observations of the}} same signal.
