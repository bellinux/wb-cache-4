They were caught in the crossfire of a battle on 3 May at the Hotel Victoria in Barcelona, which resulted in 2000 casualties. When Spångberg and Nerman return to Sweden soon after, <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> to see their party falling apart in a struggle between Karl Kilbom and Nils Flyg. Spångberg then joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the war was}} not over. Hygelac, the {{new king}} of the Geats, {{attacked}} the Swedes. The Geatish warriors Eofor and Wulf fought together against the hoary king Ongenþeow. Wulf hit Ongentheow's head with his sword so that the old king bled over his hair, but the king hit back and wounded Wulf. Then, Eofor retaliated by cutting through the Swedish king's shield and through his helmet, giving Ongentheow a death-blow. Eofor took the Swedish king's helmet, sword and breastplate and carried them to Hygelac. When <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> Eofor and Wulf were richly awarded, and Eofor was given Hygelac's daughter. Because of this battle, Hygelac {{is referred to as}} Ongentheow's slayer.|$|E

25|$|Kent {{came close}} to humiliation {{in the first round}} of the C Trophy, when they were bowled out for 160, though {{eventually}} <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> dismissing Wiltshire for 151. Kent then made their highest-ever fourth innings total (447 for 9) as they held on for a draw against Hampshire, before taking advantage of an easy draw in the C Trophy, beating Derbyshire by 127 runs to go through to the quarter-finals. There then came a victory over Nottinghamshire and a close draw against Surrey in the Championship, which left them fourth at the end of May. They then beat Gloucestershire in a 3-day match at Maidstone, which also got them an eight-point deduction for a poor pitch. However, in the next match it seemed anything but poor, as Derbyshire racked up 304 for 3 to win by 90 runs.|$|E
500|$|Ag2r's squad for the Giro d'Italia had as {{its leader}} Gadret, the 13th-place {{finisher}} in the 2010 Giro who aimed to improve upon that placing and ride to a top ten finish. Dessel and Nocentini were {{named to the}} squad to aim for stage wins and breakaway representation. The team's showing in the stage 1 team time trial was mediocre at best, as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> 16th of the 23 teams, 49 seconds off the winning pace set by [...] Montaguti finished {{near the front of}} the field in the Giro's first two road races, taking tenth in the mass sprint finish to stage 2, and likewise tenth in stage 3 when the field was a little more split up. Gadret tried to bridge to the leader on the road (Martin Kohler) in stage 5 one of that stage's many dirt road sections, but he experienced mechanical trouble and finished well down on the day, losing almost a minute to the race's top riders. Gadret lay in 26th place after eight stages, which was the eve of the race's first summit finish, at Mount Etna.|$|E
500|$|Between October 1772 and June 1775, Jervis {{travelled}} extensively. He {{began in}} France {{where he studied}} the language and made observations about French life. He accompanied Captain Samuel Barrington to Russia where they spent time in Saint Petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at Kronstadt and took {{a tour of the}} yacht designed by Sir Charles Knowles for Catherine of Russia. The pair continued on to Sweden, Denmark and northern Germany. All the while Jervis made notes on defences, harbour charts and safe anchorages. <b>They</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> via the Netherlands, Jervis once again making extensive studies of the area and taking copious notes describing any useful information. He and Barrington then took a private cruise along the Channel coast calling at various harbours including Brest, making and improving their charts as they went. When Jervis later became the Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet he was aided significantly in his blockade of Brest by these charts. In later years, he commented: [...] "Had the young Captain Jervis not performed such a complete survey of this port then the Earl St Vincent {{would not have been able}} to effect such a thorough blockade of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{talk of a}} {{potential}} exclusion from the race due to these scandals, the team {{were included in the}} list of 23 teams admitted, on March 7, per UCI rules. Carrara was the team's leader for the race, while Božič and Hoogerland were named to the squad to aim for stage wins and breakaway representation. The team's showing in the stage 1 team time trial was average, as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> 10th of the 23 teams, 37 seconds off the winning pace set by [...] Božič finished near the front of the field in the Giro's first road stage, taking fifth in the mass sprint finish to the second stage, in Parma. Hoogerland and Selvaggi made breakaway attempts on stages 7 and 8, but neither could hold a sustainable advantage until the end of each stage. Carrara moved into the top ten overall after stage 9, finishing 14th on the race's first summit finish, at Mount Etna. Selvaggi took the team's only top-ten placing {{in the second half of}} the race by finishing eighth in a mass sprint finish on stage 12, while Carrara eventually finished the race as the team's highest placed rider in the general classification, finishing 17th overall.|$|E
500|$|This tactic {{developed}} {{from the first day}} that Hobbs and Rhodes batted together in the first Test; they added 159 runs for the first wicket. Hobbs scored 89 in the first innings and 35 in the second, and while England lost narrowly, he appeared much more comfortable than the other English batsmen against the googly. Hobbs and Rhodes shared a partnership of 207 in the tour match following the Test, in which Hobbs scored 163. England also lost the second Test, but Hobbs scored 53 and 70, sharing two substantial opening partnerships with Rhodes. The failure of the other batsmen, defeated by the googly bowlers, caused consternation in the English press. As England had few effective pace bowlers on the tour, Hobbs opened the bowling in the first two Tests, as well as the batting. In the third Test, he scored 93 not out to guide England to a three-wicket victory. However, the series was lost when England were defeated in the fourth match; Hobbs scored 0 and 1, the only time in his Test career that he failed to reach double figures in either innings, and his worst match return in first-class cricket. In the final game of the series, he scored his first Test hundred, opening the batting and sharing a partnership of 221 with Rhodes which was a record at the time for the first wicket in Test matches. Hobbs scored 187, an innings praised by Wisden for its [...] "brilliancy". In this match he once more opened the bowling, dismissing Reggie Schwarz, his only Test wicket. England won the match by nine wickets and the series finished 3–2 against them. Hobbs scored 1,124 first-class runs at an average of 66.11 on the tour, while in the Test matches, he scored 539 runs at 67.37. None of the other English batsmen came close to matching his success against the googly, {{and by the end of}} the series, critics were beginning to describe him as the world's leading batsman. Wisden commented: [...] "Beyond everything else from the English point of view the feature of the trip was the superb batting of Hobbs, who easily adapted himself to the matting wickets and scored from the famous googly bowlers with amazing skill and facility. When <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> the other members of the team could not say too much in his praise." ...|$|E

2500|$|Casar was the team's {{de facto}} {{leader for the}} race, with Bonnet, Delage, Jeannesson, Meersman, Pauriol, Roux, Roy and Vichot making up the nine-man outfit. Casar's {{position}} came at the non-inclusion of Fédrigo, who elected to skip the race – as did Hutarovich – due to fatigue and poor form. Roy made the first breakaway of the Tour along with two other riders, and took the honours in the first intermediate sprint of the race, earning 20 points to the revised-for-2011 points classification. The team's showing in the stage 2 team time trial was average, as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> ninth of the 22 teams, 46 seconds off the winning pace set by [...] Delage was in the day's breakaway on the third stage, with an advantage of eight minutes during one point of the stage; he also repeated the feat of Roy by taking maximum intermediate sprint points on the stage, and after being caught with [...] remaining, {{he was awarded the}} most combative rider of the day.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), when Moses grew up, {{he went to}} his brethren and saw their burdens. He saw an Egyptian {{striking}} a Hebrew, he looked this way and that, and when he saw no one, he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. When he went out the next day, he came upon two Hebrew men fighting, and he asked the wrongdoer why he struck his fellow. The man asked Moses who had made him king, asking him whether he intended to kill him as he did the Egyptian, so Moses realized that his deed was known. When Pharaoh heard, he sought to kill Moses, but Moses fled to Midian, where he sat down by a well. The priest of Midian's seven daughters had come to water their father's flock, but shepherds drove them away. Moses stood up and helped the daughters, and watered their flock. When <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> to their father Reuel, he asked how they were able to come home so early, and they explained how an Egyptian had delivered them from the shepherds, and had also drawn water for the flock. Reuel then asked his daughters why they had left the man there, and told them to call him back to join them for a meal. Moses was content to live with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah to marry. Moses and Zipporah had a baby boy, whom Moses called Gershom, saying that he had been a stranger in a strange land. The third open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} God {{instructed}} Moses {{to cause a}} lamp to burn in the Tabernacle not because God needed the light, but so that the Israelites {{might be able to}} give light to God as God gave light to the Israelites.

2500|$|Hobbs scored 1,124 {{first-class}} runs at {{an average}} of 66.11 on the tour, while in the Test matches, he scored 539 runs at 67.37. Wisden commented: [...] "Beyond everything else from the English point of view the feature of the trip was the superb batting of Hobbs, who easily adapted himself to the matting wickets and scored from the famous googly bowlers with amazing skill and facility. When <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> {{the other members of the}} team could not say too much in his praise." [...] Syd Gregory, an Australian Test batsman who was visiting South Africa, described Hobbs as the best batsman in the world in a press interview following the series. His success against the googly arose from either reaching a long way forward or stepping back near his stumps in order to play the ball;this meant that he either smothered the ball so that it did not spin or allowed him time to see which way it would spin and play accordingly. He also adopted cautious tactics, preferring to wait for an easy delivery to hit for runs rather than play aggressively; the orthodox approach at the time was to attempt to hit googly bowling aggressively. Hobbs also demonstrated an ability to judge very effectively where the ball would land after it had been bowled. This judgement, allied to an instinctive knowledge of what the bowler was trying to do and an increasing ability to judge from the bowler's wrist allowed him to predict when a googly had been bowled. As such, he encountered far fewer difficulties than other batsmen in playing googly bowling. According to Ronald Mason, after Hobbs' success, the South African googly bowlers were never as effective.|$|E
