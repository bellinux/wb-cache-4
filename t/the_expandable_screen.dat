There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as an annulus around the sand control <b>screen)</b> and <b>expandable</b> <b>screens.</b> Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral-welded corrosion-resistant wire wrapped around a drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge).

There are various devices for sand control such as sand screens, slotted liners, perforated liners, etc. Many of the wells are completed with a gravel pack located in the annular space between the wellbore wall and the screen.

The objective of this work was to analyze the new well completion with stressed screen (SS). These screens operate so that create necessary mechanical stresses in the reservoir near the wellbore. The using of the stressed screen {{is the way to}} get a super well with maximum production rate limited only by reservoir energy and throughput of pipes. The stressed screen can include gravel packing between the screen and a wellbore wall. Another way to create a stressed screen may be the installation of the screen during reservoir drilling.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{charge of}} <b>the</b> <b>expandable</b> interlayers {{in a series}} of {{fourteen}} diagenetic llite/smectites (I/ S) from lower Paleozoic K-bentonites was determined by the alkylammonium ion exchange method. The magnitude (< 0. 50 equivalents per half formula unit) and characteristic heterogeneous di tribution of interlayer charges in eight samples with expandabilities from 70 % to about 15 % confirm the smectitic character of <b>the</b> <b>expandable</b> interlayers in this range. This result coupled with the lack of a correlation between expandability and interlayer charge is consistent with the hypothesis of a layer-by-layer trans-formation from a precursor smectite to highly illitic I/S clays during K-bentonite diagenesis. The charge of <b>the</b> <b>expandable</b> interlayers in I/S samples with about 10 % or less expandabilities have been inferred to be vermiculitic rather than smectitic. The K-fixed interlayers and expandable interlayers in these samples appear to be similar in charge.

Methods. We performed a retrospective review of 18 patients with > 12 -month follow-up who had been operated on PELIF using expandable spacer from 2001 to 2007.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{underlying}} {{concept of}} expandable technology is cold‐working a pipe downhole to the required size. An expansion cone is typically used to permanently deform the pipe downhole. The cone is pulled or {{pushed through the}} pipe hydraulically or by mechanical force. The cone introduces a stress to the pipe material above the yield stress and thereby plastically deforms the pipe while keeping the stresses below <b>the</b> ultimate yield. <b>Expandable</b> technology gives <b>the</b> possibility of having more casing points in a well {{with little or no}} reduction in inner diameter. It may also increase the productivity of a well by increasing the sizes downhole, thus reducing the frictional pressure drop of the flowing fluids in the production tubing. In addition, expandable technology may give large environmental and economical benefits, such as development of smaller fields and deeper reservoirs, faster drilling speed, and reduced drilling fluids volume, cement volume, and amount of cuttings for disposal. The pipe properties are affected by the expansion process. The cold‐working process, in which the pipe is expanded, increases the yield strength of the material. The increase in yield strength may increase the burst pressure, depending on the expansion ratio and the wall thickness reduction. However, the collapse pressure may be significantly reduced because the D/t ratio is increased in the expansion process. The reduced collapse pressure may limit the range of application of <b>expandable</b> technology. <b>The</b> <b>expandable</b> liners are not, at present, qualified as barriers or to be exposed to well fluids. When used in <b>the</b> reservoir, an <b>expandable</b> liner {{can be used as a}} drilling liner, which means that the liner is covered by another liner that acts as a production liner. <b>The</b> <b>expandable</b> liner does not need to be strong enough to handle production loads, only drilling loads. <b>The</b> <b>expandable</b> liners were in this case strong enough to handle most burst and collapse loads. However, they were not strong enough in collapse to handle the worst case scenario, which in this case was lost circulation with mud drop. If lost circulation zones are encountered <b>the</b> <b>expandable</b> liner may collapse. This represents only one example, for other wells the loads need to be determined for the specific case in which expandable liners are to be used...|$|R

50|$|In 1929, Cicero C. Brown {{organized}} Brown Oil Tools in Houston, and patented {{the first}} liner hanger in 1937.
