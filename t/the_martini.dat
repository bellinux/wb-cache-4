25|$|Some of {{the finest}} {{features}} of the Solstice-class is the half-acre, freshly manicured lawn named The Lawn Club, which is located in deck 15. A special type of grass, Agrostis stolonifera, {{is used for the}} lawn. The areas such as Patio on the Lawn, Sunset Bar, Lawn Club Shop and The Hot Glass Show are found on the lawn. The staterooms on Solstice-class ships are significantly larger than the previous classes, with 80% having a veranda. The staterooms are grouped into seven categories; including the spa-inspired AquaClass and the Concierge class. There are two Penthouse Suites, a 110-m2 stateroom and several Royal Suites, a 54-m2 stateroom. Both have a living room, dining room and separate bedrooms. There are also Jacuzzis and separate showers. Solstice-class feature amenities such as large staterooms, a large theater, and multiple dining options. Signature Celebrity features were also added, such as <b>the</b> <b>Martini</b> Bar. The newest feature of the class is the iLounge, a combination of Internet café and an Apple Store. This feature was recently added to Celebrity Eclipse and Celebrity Silhouette, and on Celebrity Solstice in May 2010.|$|E
500|$|The {{instruction}} was honoured by the AFI as the 90th most-memorable cinema quotation.

Of course this battle was but a small affair, yet I think that few have been more terrible, at any rate in modern times.

They were mown down in hundreds by <b>the</b> <b>Martini</b> fire, but still they came on, and I knew that the game was up. A maddened horde of fugitives, mostly natives, began to flow past us over the nek, making for what was afterwards called Fugitives' Drift, nine miles away, and with them went white soldiers, some mounted, some on foot. Mingled with all these people, following them, {{on either side of}} them, rushed Zulus, stabbing as they ran. Other groups of soldiers formed themselves into rough squares, on which the savage warriors broke like water on a rock. By degrees ammunition ran out; only the bayonet remained. Still the Zulus could not break those squares. So they took another counsel. Withdrawing a few paces {{beyond the reach of the}} bayonets, they overwhelmed the soldiers by throwing assegais, then rushed in and finished them.|$|E
