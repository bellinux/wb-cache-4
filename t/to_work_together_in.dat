The basic technical elements of the game began <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model.

The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E

This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neo-humanistic will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the summum bonum of life and allowing space to be created for people <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development.|$|E
