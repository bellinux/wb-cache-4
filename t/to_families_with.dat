5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E

500|$|On 17–18March the River Trent {{overtopped}} {{its banks}} in Nottingham. Large {{parts of the}} city and surrounding areas were flooded, in which 9,000 properties and nearly a hundred industrial premises were affected– some to first-floor height. The suburbs of Long Eaton, West Bridgford and Beeston suffered particularly badly. Two days later, in the lower tidal reaches of the river, the peak of the flood combined with a high spring tide to flood villages and 2,000 properties in Gainsborough. River levels dropped when the floodbank at Morton breached, resulting in the flooding of some [...] of farmland in the Trent valley. The flooding subsided in the west of the country by 20March but rivers in the east were still rising and the Wharfe, Derwent, Aire and Ouse all burst their banks in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Selby was also badly affected with 70per cent of houses being flooded. More than 100,000 properties were affected by the flooding and the Army worked {{to prevent the spread of}} the floodwater, particularly at pumping plants and power stations. Royal Engineers on national service handed out milk <b>to</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> babies and the Australian Red Cross assisted in Gloucester. The people of Canada sent food parcels to villages in Suffolk and the Premier of Ontario, George A. Drew, offered to help distribute them personally. The flooding lasted for about a week, with some waters taking an additional ten days to subside.|$|E
