By theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that <b>the</b> global <b>awareness</b> cannot decrease <b>the</b> likelihood of an epidemic outbreak while both <b>the</b> local <b>awareness</b> and <b>the</b> contact <b>awareness</b> can.

5|$|Laozi is {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} author of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), though the identity of its author(s) or compiler(s) has been debated throughout history.

As with most other ancient Chinese philosophers, Laozi often explains his ideas by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book can be read as an analogy – the ruler is <b>the</b> <b>awareness,</b> or self, in meditation and the myriad creatures or empire is the experience of the body, senses and desires.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN has {{recommended}} co-operation between countries across the cheetah's range to minimise {{the conflict between}} cheetahs and human beings. A 2016 study showed that ecotourism can have a significantly {{positive impact on the}} conservation of the cheetah. Although the requirement of space for the habitat would have to be compromised in most cases, establishment of private reserves for cheetahs and ensuring the absence of predators and poachers could be a successful conservation measure. Additionally, the financial benefits accrued and <b>the</b> <b>awareness</b> generated can further aid the cause of the cheetah. At the same time, the animals should not be unnecessarily handled or disturbed, as cheetahs are particularly sensitive to human interference.|$|E

Several hours later, a portion of the watch was upgraded to a warning as Andres neared the coastline. By 1500UTC, a hurricane watch was declared for areas between Lazaro Cardenas and Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco and the tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Lazaro Cardenas was discontinued. Roughly six hours later, a hurricane warning was raised for Punto San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes and the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were extended northward to Punto San Telmo. By the following afternoon, the hurricane watch was discontinued and several hours later, areas under a tropical storm warning followed suit. Early on June24, all watches and warnings associated with Andres were discontinued as it rapidly dissipated offshore. Authorities closed ports in Lázaro Cárdenas, Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta because of rough seas.
