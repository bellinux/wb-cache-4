5|$|Cope {{had little}} formal {{scientific}} training, and he eschewed a teaching position for field work. He made regular {{trips to the}} American West, prospecting in the 1870s and 1880s, often {{as a member of}} United States Geological Survey teams. A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led to a period of intense fossil-finding competition now known as the Bone Wars. Cope's financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in the 1880s, forcing him to sell off much of his fossil collection. He experienced a resurgence in his career <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life before dying on April 12, 1897.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus... was {{the most}} eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the {{atmosphere}} in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking.... <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his Systema Naturæ he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he had insisted upon in his earlier works.... warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides.|$|E

5|$|Robinson's eldest son, Jackie Robinson Jr., had {{emotional}} trouble {{during his}} childhood and entered special education {{at an early}} age. He enrolled in the Army {{in search of a}} disciplined environment, served in the Vietnam War, and was wounded in action on November 19, 1965. After his discharge, he struggled with drug problems. Robinson Jr. eventually completed the treatment program at Daytop Village in Seymour, Connecticut, and became a counselor at the institution. On June 17, 1971, he was killed in an automobile accident at age 24. The experience with his son's drug addiction turned Robinson Sr. into an avid anti-drug crusader <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Sitting {{on several}} Royal commissions, the Exchequer Court of Canada, and the BC Supreme Court, Crease {{remained}} an influential figure long after his {{defeat in the}} Thrasher case.

Crease retired soon afterward in January 1896. On 23 January 1896 Crease was knighted. He died in 1905 and was buried at Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{started with}} Landells in 1840. His duties {{included}} delivering proofs of drawings {{to be approved}} by artists such as Edward Dalziel, or authors such as Charles Dickens. A year later, Landells launched Punch magazine, and as early as 1842 had Evans illustrate covers for the new publication. Evans worked and became friends with Myles Birket Foster, John Greenaway and George Dalziel. Foster and Evans became lifelong friends. When Landells received a commission from the Illustrated London News to provide illustrations of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, he sent Evans and Foster to Balmoral to make sketches, which Evans engraved. <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> apprenticeship, the demands of the Illustrated London News caused Evans to work late into the night and return early in the morning.|$|E

5|$|Lavelli {{grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio {{and played}} football, {{baseball}} and basketball at his local high school. After graduating, he enrolled at Ohio State University, where he played {{only a handful of}} games before he was drafted for service in the U.S. Army during World War II. Returning in 1945 after serving in Europe, he joined the Browns in the team's first-ever season in the AAFC. Helped by Lavelli's play, the Browns won each of the AAFC's championships before the league dissolved in 1949 and the team was absorbed by the NFL. Cleveland continued to succeed in the NFL, winning championships in 1950, 1954 and 1955. Lavelli, who helped found the National Football League Players Association <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, retired after the 1956 season.|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, {{he was arrested}} after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police. Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness {{in the face of}} racial antagonism. While at PJC, he was motivated by a preacher (the Rev. Karl Downs) to attend church on a regular basis, and Downs became a confidant for Robinson, a Christian. <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.|$|E
5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
