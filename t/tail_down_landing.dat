5000|$|The NiD 43 was {{powered by}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Hb water cooled upright V-12 engine in the nose, which drove a four blade propeller. The {{undercarriage}} was unusual; although {{it was expected that}} the aircraft would fly from an aircraft carrier, the probability of emergency water landings was recognised. Consequently, the NiD 43 was fitted with both wheels and floats. The latter were short and stepless, each attached to the aircraft by two short pairs of N-form struts. They reached well ahead of the wing leading edge but ended just aft of the trailing edge, too short to support the rear fuselage which instead was made watertight and floated the machine in a <b>tail</b> <b>down</b> traditional <b>landing</b> position. This allowed surface taxiing with the propeller clear of the water. There were fixed wheels recessed into the floats below the wing mid-chord, which on ship formed a conventional undercarriage, <b>tail</b> <b>down</b> again, with the short floats clearing the deck.|$|R
5000|$|Highlights include Travis Parker in Montana hitting jumps through {{trees and}} {{performing}} his signature fully extended backflips, Todd Richards fooling around in Breckenridge's park, Justin Benne doing a 50-50 nollie out performed on a rainbow rail {{in which the}} nollie {{at the very top}} cleared the rest of the rail, Travis riding a set of tabletops and stepdowns at Northstar at Tahoe, and Todd Richards and Travis Parker riding tandem in the halfpipe in colorful full-body snowsuits deemed [...] "ray-ray suits" [...] in reference to artist Renee Renee. The segment finishes at Mammoth Mountain. Simon Chamberlain is shown hitting lines of rail features as well as doing a shifty tail butter to shoulder roll, switch 360 over a rope, and spinning a 720 off the side of a kicker. Team riders tail bonk a tree root in a large train with Eddie Wall leading with a mega-phone in hand. Travis Parker does a straight air over a tabletop only to <b>tail</b> butter <b>down</b> the <b>landing.</b> Eddie Wall is featured absorbing the kicker of the same tabletop doing a switch 180 to the deck and popping off the knuckle doing a BS 540.|$|R

60|$|We were indeed, for as we <b>tailed</b> <b>down</b> that kloof, {{from the}} top of both cliffs above us came a {{continuous}} but luckily ill-directed fire. Lead-coated stones, pot legs and bullets whirred and whistled all round us, yet until the last, just when we were reaching the tree to which we had tied our horses, quite harmlessly. Then suddenly I saw Anscombe begin to limp. Still he managed to run on and mount, though I observed that he did not put his right foot into the stirrup.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to living}} in a rather hostile and very steep terrain, this breed often looks hunched over as they carry their head and <b>tail</b> <b>down</b> most often. They have a light build and long legs making them a rather active breed. The head and face are narrow and clear while the ears are slender. Most often, the Arapawa {{displays}} all black. However, quite often, white points are displayed. On rare occasions, an all-white sheep can be observed. [...] "Cocktail" [...] Arapawas {{are those that are}} white spotted.|$|R
