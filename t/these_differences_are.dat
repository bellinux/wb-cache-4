5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. <b>These</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E
5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. <b>These</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E

5|$|Primatologist Carel P. van Schaik and {{biological}} anthropologist Cheryl D. Knott further investigated tool use in different wild orangutan populations. They compared geographic variations in tool use {{related to the}} processing of Neesia fruit. The orangutans of Suaq Balimbing (P. abelii) {{were found to be}} avid users of insect and seed-extraction tools when compared to other wild orangutans. The scientists suggested <b>these</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> cultural. The orangutans at Suaq Balimbing live in dense groups and are socially tolerant; this creates good conditions for social transmission. Further evidence that highly social orangutans are more likely to exhibit cultural behaviours came from a study of leaf-carrying behaviours of ex-captive orangutans that were being rehabilitated on the island of Kaja in Borneo.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Tarbosaurus was {{completely}} described {{for the first}} time in 2003. Scientists noted key differences between Tarbosaurus and the North American tyrannosaurids. Many of <b>these</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> related to the handling of stress by the skull bones during a bite. When the upper jaw bit down on an object, force was transmitted up through the maxilla, the primary tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw, into surrounding skull bones. In North American tyrannosaurids, this force went from the maxilla into the fused nasal bones on top of the snout, which were firmly connected in the rear to the lacrimal bones by bony struts. These struts locked the two bones together, suggesting that force was then transmitted from the nasals to the lacrimals.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are tamer {{than those}} in the wild. They are more {{comfortable}} around humans and known to seek out their owners while roaming freely. They have decreased reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and {{for a longer period of}} time over their lifespan. Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with each other; while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend protracted amounts of time in a belly-up or boxing position. These behavioral traits are thought to be products of environment as opposed to genetics. However, it is also theorized that there are certain underlying biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are more receptive to domestication than others, and that <b>these</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> then passed down to offspring (compare Domesticated silver fox).|$|E

5|$|Osborn and Mook, in 1921, {{provisionally}} synonymized {{the three}} species, sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus, and suggesting also that A. fragillimus {{is just a}} very large individual of A. altus, a position which most subsequent studies, including McIntosh 1998, Foster (2007), and Woodruff and Foster (2015) have agreed with. Carpenter (2006) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus, however, citing numerous differences {{in the construction of}} the vertebra also noted by Cope, and suggested <b>these</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus. However, he went on to caution that the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species is nearly impossible to determine without the original specimen to study. Although Amphicoelias latus is clearly not Amphicoelias, it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave articular faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} is the square plan with simple {{projections}} and recesses {{but with a}} possibility of both sekhari and bhumija superstructures. The plan {{does not have any}} additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these nagara temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the dravida temples in the north Karnataka region but from the nagara temples north of the Kalyani region as well. <b>These</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> manifest in the articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day Gulbarga district. The plan and the nagara articulation of these temples are the same as found {{to the north of the}} Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.|$|E

50|$|Much {{was made}} of Kokovtsov's {{differences}} with Witte {{which resulted in the}} two refusing to work with one another after 1905—06. The apparent cause of <b>these</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> conflicts over courses of action in the preparation for peace talks with Japan, following the Russo-Japanese War; the changing of the government structure in the wake of widespread political unrest; Witte's opposition to several of Kokovtsov's policies as Minister of Finance during the Russo-Japanese War, and in an important loan negotiation that occurred in 1905—06. <b>These</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> made public in the Council of State when one or the other would make comments in opposition to the other's viewpoint on various issues.|$|R
