25|$|From Florida {{the team}} {{traveled}} to Memphis {{to compete for}} the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) where they were immediately pitted against <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>face</b> team of the territory The Fabulous Ones (Stan Lane and Steve Keirn). On January 24, 1984, the Zambuie Express were awarded the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship when the Fabulous Ones failed to show up for a match, but the titles were declared vacant instead of giving them to Akeem and Muhammad. The CWA held a tournament for the vacant championship, a tournament won by the Zambuie Express as they defeated the Pretty Young Things (Koko B. Ware and Norvell Austin) in the final match. The Pretty Young Things won the championship only a week later, defeating the Zambuie Express on CWA's weekly show at the Mid-South Coliseum. Eight days later the Zambuie Express regained the championship. The duo held on to the belts until March 12, 1984 when they lost to Jerry Lawler and Jos LeDuc. The team toured with New Japan Pro Wrestling in the spring of 1984 and then ended up working for Jim Crockett Promotions based in the Carolinas by the summer of 1984. The team sided with Paul Jones and became part of Paul Jones' Army as they fought against Jimmy Valiant and Valiant's friends. The Express competed on the 1984 version of Starrcade, where they lost to the team of Buzz Tyler and The Masked Assassin #1. The loss to Tyler and the Assassin {{was one of the last}} matches the Zambuie Express worked together, splitting up a short time later.|$|E

2500|$|Research in 2011 by Ropars et al., {{confirms}} {{that one can}} identify {{the direction of the}} sun to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using the sunstone and the naked eye. [...] The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow entoptic pattern on the fovea of the eye. Alternatively a dot can be placed on top of crystal so {{that when you look at}} it from below, two dots appear, because the light is “depolarised” and fractured along different axes. The crystal can then be rotated until the two points have the same luminosity. The angle of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>face</b> now gives the direction of the sun. Attempts to replicate this work in both Scotland and off the coast of Turkey by science journalist Matt Kaplan and mineralogists at The British Geological Survey in 2014 failed.

The same somebody, you conclude, still offering the most creditable opposition, {{is being put}} back into bed. You can follow the contest with much exactitude, because every time the body is flung down upon the spring mattress, the bedstead, just above your head, makes a sort of jump; while every time the body succeeds in struggling out again, you are aware by the thud upon the floor. After a time the struggle wanes, or maybe the bed collapses; and you drift back into sleep. But the next moment, or {{what seems to be}} the next moment, you again open your eyes under the consciousness of a presence.
