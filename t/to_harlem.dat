Filming then moved <b>to</b> <b>Harlem,</b> New York, where a hospice {{was used to}} film a scene involving the character Spider Simpson (Charles Gordone), {{and many of the}} hospice's elderly residents acted as extras for the scene. On April 17, 1986, the production team moved to Staten Island to film exterior and interior scenes involving the character Dr. Fowler (Michael Higgins). Filming then moved to Hoboken, New Jersey, which doubled for a scene set in a New Orleans train station. From April 28 to April 29, the production team returned <b>to</b> <b>Harlem,</b> where Parker filmed Rourke and De Niro's scene in a Harlem mission. The two actors next filmed a scene at Lanza's, an Italian restaurant located on the Lower East Side.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} was a British success, {{and resulted in}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Continental Army <b>to</b> <b>Harlem</b> Heights, ceding control of New York City on {{the lower half of the}} island. However, General Washington established strong positions on Harlem Heights which he proved determined to defend in a fierce skirmish between the two armies the following day. General Howe, unwilling to risk a costly frontal attack, did not attempt to advance further up the island for another two months.|$|E
5|$|Lesbianism, or the {{suggestion}} of it, began early in filmmaking. The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed—or for what reasons—as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films. Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones. Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in A Florida Enchantment featuring Edith Storey. In Morocco (1930) Marlene Dietrich kisses another woman on the lips, and Katharine Hepburn plays a man in Christopher Strong in 1933 and again in Sylvia Scarlett (1936). Hollywood films followed the same trend set by audiences who flocked <b>to</b> <b>Harlem</b> to see edgy shows that suggested bisexuality.|$|E
5|$|On {{the episode}} of Nitro after Fall Brawl, Riggs and Bagwell won the World Tag Team Championship after {{defeating}} then-champions Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) in an upset win in an impromptu match. The American Males {{had been scheduled}} to face The Blue Bloods, but Harlem Heat attacked both members of the Blue Bloods prior to the match and volunteered to take their place. As champions, the pair defeated Harlem Heat and the team of Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. However, Bagwell and Riggs lost the titles back <b>to</b> <b>Harlem</b> Heat one week later on Saturday Night. The American Males remained top challengers for the title belts for the rest of 1995 but were unable to regain the championship from Harlem Heat.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} team then moved <b>to</b> <b>Harlem</b> to film a chase scene set during a procession {{before moving to}} Coney Island, where {{the cast and crew}} underwent severely cold weather conditions. The location was used to film a scene in which Angel questions a man Izzy (George Buck) about the whereabouts of Johnny Favorite, while Izzy's wife Bo (Judith Drake) stands waist deep in the ocean. The original actress who was cast as Bo was injured when she was knocked off her feet by a wave while delivering her first line. The actress refused to reshoot the scene, which led to her being replaced by her stand-in, Drake, whom Parker found to be a better actress for the role.|$|E
5|$|On December9, 1964, Clarence13X {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} torso while at a popular {{gathering}} place {{in the basement of}} a Harlem tenement. He was brought <b>to</b> <b>Harlem</b> Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure. The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence13X's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.|$|E

5000|$|New Heritage Theatre Groups {{connection}} to South African theatre began in 1984 when Rivers and his production team Andre Robinson, Phyllis Yvonne Stickney and his South African producing team Duma Ndlovu and Mbongeni Ngema transferred South African play Woza Albert!, {{a play that}} opened at Johannesburg's Market Theater and toured in Europe and America as was the most successful play {{to come out of}} South Africa <b>to</b> <b>Harlem's</b> New Heritage Theatre. The successful impact of Striver's Row inspired Rivers to look beyond the African American experience and reach across the world <b>to</b> introduce <b>Harlem</b> <b>to</b> the works of Black South African playwrights and actors which was an opportunity to bring lessons from the South African Apartheid <b>to</b> the <b>Harlem</b> community. NHTG produced a series of plays in the 1980s — including “Woza Albert(1985)!,” “Asinamli!”(1986) and Sarafina!(1987) that educated Harlemites about the apartheid struggle. [...] "Asinimali", a play about celebration of resistance, opened in 1986 at Roger Furman's New Heritage Repertory Theatre (now known as New Heritage Theatre Group) just two weeks after an attack by an armed mob, killing the shows local promoter as a reaction to the plays political stance.|$|R
