5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Grenade,</b> Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. <b>The</b> <b>grenade</b> was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of <b>the</b> <b>grenade,</b> the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grenade</b> {{had several}} faults with its design. In tests, {{it failed to}} adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and, if the user was not careful after freeing <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> from its casing, it could easily stick to his uniform. The Ordnance Board of the War Department did not approve <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> {{for use by the}} British Army, but {{personal}} intervention by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, led to <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> going into production. Between 1940 and 1943, approximately 2.5 million were produced. It was primarily issued to the Home Guard, but was also used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa, accounting for six German tanks; used by Allied Forces on the Anzio Beachhead, including the First Special Service Force; as well as by Australian Army units during the New Guinea campaign. The French Resistance were also issued a quantity of the grenades.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grenade</b> did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>grenades</b> {{use one of}} the world's spiciest chili pepper {{species in}} weaponized form. The weapon emits a {{powerful}} skin and eye irritant as well as pungent smell that causes enemies to leave their cover or become physically overcome by <b>the</b> <b>grenade's</b> load.|$|R
50|$|When {{the formula}} is {{considered}} ideal, {{the next step}} will be to develop a delivery system using airships. A four-passenger airship is built, with sufficient storage to carry an unspecified amount of <b>the</b> fire-fighting <b>grenades.</b> To aid in dropping grenades, Tom builds a bombsight, which, when mechanically adjusted for altitude, air speed, wind, {{and the weight of}} <b>the</b> <b>grenades,</b> will permit accurate placement of <b>the</b> <b>grenades</b> over <b>the</b> target.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Schiessbecher rifle <b>grenade</b> {{launcher}} {{could be}} used against infantry, fortifications and light armored vehicles up {{to a range of}} 280 m. For these differing tasks several specialized grenades with accompanying special propelling cartridges were developed for <b>the</b> Schiessbecher rifle <b>grenade</b> launchers. <b>The</b> rifle <b>grenade</b> propelling cartridges fired a wooden projectile through the barrel to <b>the</b> rifle <b>grenade</b> that upon impact automatically primed <b>the</b> rifle <b>grenade.</b>|$|R
5|$|A small grayed-out grenade icon {{appears in}} the center of the screen when the player is near a grenade, with an arrow {{pointing}} in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>grenade.</b> Enemies can sometimes seem to be dead when they are not, where the enemy can still wield his side arm and fire at the player.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grenade</b> {{was first}} issued in 1940 to Home Guard units, who {{appeared}} to have taken a liking to it despite its flaws. Although the Ordnance Board had not approved <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> {{to be used by}} Regular Army units, a quantity were provided for training purposes. However, a number of sticky bombs did find their way to British and Commonwealth units participating in the campaign in North Africa, and were used as anti-tank weapons. During the Afrika Korps advance towards the town of Thala in February 1943, they accounted for six German tanks. They were also issued to units of the Australian Army, who used them during the Battle of Wau and the Battle of Milne Bay. They were used by various allied units on the Anzio Beachhead, namely the First Special Service Force, who obtained them from the British. A large number were also supplied to the French Resistance.|$|E
5|$|As of February 17, 1972, when Shakur was {{identified}} as one of four BLA members on a short trip to Chattanooga, Tennessee, she was wanted for questioning (along with Robert Vickers, Twyman Meyers, Samuel Cooper, and Paul Stewart) in relation to police killings, a Queens bank robbery, and <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> attack. Shakur was announced as one of six suspects in the ambushing of four policemen—two in Jamaica, Queens, and two in Brooklyn—on January 28, 1973.|$|E
50|$|The player {{starts off}} with a {{standard}} machine gun with infinite ammo and 10 normal grenades. When certain enemies are killed, they drop collectable guns or <b>grenades.</b> <b>The</b> guns consist of the Balcan (A more powerful machine gun), the Flamethrower (A gun for taking out ground units only) and the Missile Launcher. <b>The</b> <b>grenades</b> consist of <b>the</b> normal <b>grenades,</b> <b>the</b> Spark Bomb and the Napalm Bomb.|$|R
50|$|Fragmentation is {{enhanced}} by a special pre-notched fragmentation coil that lies along the inside of <b>the</b> <b>grenade's</b> body. This coil had a circular cross-section in <b>the</b> M26 <b>grenade</b> and an improved square cross-section in the M26A1 and later designs.|$|R

5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on <b>the</b> <b>grenade,</b> taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
5|$|Lopez {{engaged the}} enemy {{immediately}} after landing with the assault waves. He exposed himself to enemy fire {{in an attempt}} to throw a hand grenade into a pillbox whose fire was pinning down that sector of the beach. He was wounded by enemy gun fire and dropped <b>the</b> <b>grenade.</b> Unable to grasp the hand grenade firmly enough to hurl it, he chose to sacrifice himself rather than endanger the lives of his men. He cradled <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> under him and absorbed the full impact of the explosion, thus saving the lives of his comrades. Lopez was nominated for the Medal of Honor. Lopez however, was not the only Hispanic member of the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division to be awarded the Medal of Honor. PFC Eugene Arnold Obregon (1930–1950), who also participated in the Inchon landing, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions 11 days after Lopez gave his life. Obregon was killed in action while using his body to shield a wounded fellow Marine.|$|E
5|$|Staff Sergeant Leroy A. Petry {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} acts of gallantry and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house that potentially contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant Petry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy fighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand grenade, providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first grenade explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second grenade then landed only a few feet away from them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up <b>the</b> <b>grenade,</b> and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> it detonated, amputating his right hand at the wrist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live grenade grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain the presence of mind to place a tourniquet on his right wrist before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>grenades</b> weigh 0.96 lbs. each. They come {{packed in}} storage tubes in crates of 30 grenades.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell of}} <b>the</b> No 69 <b>grenade</b> was {{composed}} entirely {{of the hard}} plastic, Bakelite, which shattered without producing fragments like a metal bodied grenade. Metal fragmenting sleeves were available to increase <b>the</b> <b>grenade's</b> lethality.|$|R

5|$|The {{adhesive}} {{surface was}} protected by a light metal case which was released by pulling a safety pin: the case fell away as two hemispheres connected by a sprung hinge. The inside of the case was fitted {{with a number of}} rubber spikes that kept it clear of the glued surface of <b>the</b> <b>grenade.</b> Early models also had a strip of adhesive tape round the neck of the casing.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{includes}} vehicle sections, where Drake must protect the jeep he and Elena are in using a mounted turret, and where Drake and Elena ride a jet ski along water-filled routes while avoiding enemy fire and explosive barrels. While players direct Drake in driving the jet ski, {{they may also}} switch to Elena by aiming the gun {{in order to use}} her weapon — either <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher or the Beretta, depending on the chapter — in defense, or to clear the barrels from their path.|$|E
5|$|The insurgents {{responded by}} {{throwing}} a grenade at the Marines. The two Marines with Sgt. Peralta {{tried to get}} out of the room but could not. Sgt. Peralta was still conscious on the floor and despite his wounds was able to reach for <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> and pull it under his body absorbing the majority of the lethal blast and shrapnel which killed him instantly, but saved the lives of his fellow marines.|$|E
50|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>grenades</b> had a green band {{just under}} the middle to {{indicate}} it was a High Explosive grenade.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>grenades</b> have <b>the</b> {{appearance}} of a cast-iron ball, or a skinny dart, having fins of cardboard to stabilize the flight. They assured landing on the nose, which was backed by a percussion cap that set off the main powder charge in <b>the</b> body. <b>The</b> <b>grenades</b> were largely inefficient {{because they had to}} land on their nose to detonate. In one incident Confederates caught them in blankets and hurled them back at the attackers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>grenades</b> {{were stored}} inside two-part {{cylindrical}} fiberboard shipping tubes (Container M289) and were packed 25 or 30 to a crate.|$|R
5|$|Born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Petry had {{an active}} youth, {{and joined the}} Army after high school. Completing the Ranger Indoctrination Program, he was {{deployed}} several times to both Iraq and Afghanistan {{as a member of}} the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. On May 26, 2008 during his seventh deployment, Petry was a member of a team on a mission to capture a Taliban target in Paktia Province. Despite being wounded in both legs by gunfire, Petry continued to fight and give orders. When a grenade landed between him and two other soldiers, Petry grabbed it and attempted to throw it away from them. He saved the soldiers' lives but <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> exploded, severing his right hand.|$|E
5|$|Chance leads Natasha to {{his uncle}} Douvee's (Wilford Brimley) house {{deep in the}} bayou, and enlists his help in {{defeating}} the men. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee lead the hunting party to a warehouse of old damaged Mardi Gras floats and statues, called Mardi Gras graveyard, and even kill off Fouchon's men one by one. Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end only Fouchon is left, but he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow. Chance charges him, attacking with a flurry of blows, and then drops a grenade in his pants. Fouchon attempts to dismantle <b>the</b> <b>grenade,</b> but fails and gets incenerated in the explosion. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee now make {{their way out of}} the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. <b>The</b> <b>grenade</b> needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> M69 <b>grenade</b> is {{used for}} grenade {{training}} to safely simulate <b>the</b> M67 <b>grenade.</b> <b>The</b> fuze screws into the body, and is replaceable after use. The simulator produces a report and small puff of white smoke when properly employed.|$|R

5|$|Ross Andrew McGinnis (June 14, 1987December 4, 2006) was a United States Army {{soldier who}} was killed in the Iraq War and was posthumously awarded the United States' highest {{decoration}} for bravery, the Medal of Honor. While serving as the gunner in a HMMWV, his convoy was attacked and a hand grenade was thrown into his vehicle. McGinnis was subsequently killed in action when he deliberately threw himself on <b>the</b> <b>grenade,</b> saving the lives of at least four other soldiers in the vehicle. He was the fourth soldier to receive the Medal of Honor during the Iraq War, which was presented to his family following his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, a good example being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of <b>the</b> <b>grenade</b> which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from <b>the</b> <b>grenade,</b> but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E
