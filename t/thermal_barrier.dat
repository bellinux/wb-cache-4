25|$|A {{lubricant}} is {{used when}} forging to reduce friction and wear. It {{is also used}} as a <b>thermal</b> <b>barrier</b> to restrict heat transfer from the workpiece to the die. Finally, the lubricant acts as a parting compound to prevent the part from sticking in the dies.|$|E
25|$|The boards {{containing}} a flame retardant when {{tested in a}} tunnel using test method UL 723 or ASTM E84 will have a flame spread index of less than 25 and a smoke-developed index of less than 450.

40|$|A noncontacting, {{two-dimensional}} (2 -D) laser {{inspection system}} has been designed and implemented to dimensionally profile <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> being developed for space vehicle applications. In a vehicle as-installed state, <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> are commonly compressed between load sensitive thermal protection system (TPS) panels to prevent hot gas ingestion through the panel interface during flight. Loads required to compress the <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> are functions of their construction, {{as well as their}} dimensional characteristics relative to the gaps in which they are installed. Excessive loads during a mission could damage surrounding TPS panels and have catastrophic consequences. As such, accurate dimensional profiling of <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> prior to use is important. Due to the compliant nature of the <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers,</b> traditional contact measurement techniques (e. g., calipers and micrometers) are subjective and introduce significant error and variability into collected dimensional data. Implementation of a laser inspection system significantly enhanced the method by which <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> are dimensionally profiled, and improved the accuracy and repeatability of collected data. A statistical design of experiments study comparing laser inspection and manual caliper measurement techniques verified these findings...|$|R

25|$|Other glazing {{material}} variations affect acoustics. The {{most widely}} used glazing configurations for sound dampening include laminated glass with varied thickness of the interlayer and thickness of the glass. Including a structural, thermally improved aluminum <b>thermal</b> <b>barrier</b> air spacer in the insulating glass can improve acoustical performance by reducing the transmission of exterior noise sources in the fenestration system.|$|E
25|$|The {{deposition}} rate {{in this process}} can be as low as 1nm per minute to as high as few micrometers per minute. The material utilization efficiency is high relative to other methods, and the process offers structural and morphological control of films. Due to the very high {{deposition rate}}, this process has potential industrial application for wear-resistant and <b>thermal</b> <b>barrier</b> coatings in aerospace industries, hard coatings for cutting and tool industries, and electronic and optical films for semiconductor industries and thin-film solar applications.|$|E
25|$|However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless {{the metal}} is {{thermally}} improved), undermining {{the ability of}} the insulated glass unit (IGU) to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming {{at the bottom of the}} sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural <b>thermal</b> <b>barrier</b> reduces condensation on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall U-value.|$|E
40|$|Thermally-sprayed metal {{coatings}} {{were investigated}} with thermal waves and their specific heats and thermal conductivities were determined. The deviations {{of the experimental}} results from the theory of homogeneous solids at low frequencies served to {{determine the influence of}} different types of defects. The roles of the pores and the <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> were studied by comparing the results to models of inhomogeneous media and the <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> were found to affect significantly the coating properties...|$|R

40|$|High {{temperature}} seals {{are required}} for advanced hypersonic airframe applications. In this study, both spring tube <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> and innovative wafer seal systems were evaluated under relevant hypersonic test conditions (temperatures, pressures, etc.) via high temperature compression testing and room temperature flow assessments. <b>Thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> composed of a Rene 41 spring tube filled with Saffil insulation and overbraided with a Nextel 312 sheath showed acceptable performance at 1500 F in both short term and longer term compression testing. Nextel 440 <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> with Rene 41 spring tubes and Saffil insulation demonstrated good compression performance up to 1750 F. A silicon nitride wafer seal/compression spring system displayed excellent load performance at temperatures as high as 2200 F and exhibited room temperature leakage values that were only 1 / 3 those for the spring tube rope seals. For all seal candidates evaluated, no significant degradation in leakage resistance was noted after high temperature compression testing. In addition to these tests, a superalloy seal suitable for dynamic seal applications was optimized through finite element techniques...|$|R
25|$|EBPVD {{systems are}} {{equipped}} with ion sources. These ion sources are used for substrate etching and cleaning, sputtering the target and controlling the microstructure of the substrate. The ion beams bombard the surface and alter the microstructure of the film. When the deposition reaction takes place on the hot substrate surface, the films can develop an internal tensile stress due to the mismatch in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} between the substrate and the film. High-energy ions can be used to bombard these ceramic <b>thermal</b> <b>barrier</b> coatings and change the tensile stress into compressive stress. Ion bombardment also increases the density of the film, changes the grain size and modifies amorphous films to polycrystalline films. Low-energy ions are used for the surfaces of semiconductor films.|$|E
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of <b>thermal</b> <b>barrier</b> coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E

40|$|A {{recent article}} in Ecography by Zuloaga and Kerr (2016) {{addressed}} a prediction of Janzen 2 ̆ 7 s (1967) classic contention that mountain passes are higher in the tropics: species assemblages separated by steep thermal gradients are less similar than assemblages separated by small thermal gradients. Their results have some surprising and important additional implications. In the New World, mountain passes are in fact higher in both the tropics and near 55 °N. This fact allows a strong test of Simpson 2 ̆ 7 s (1964) hypothesis that <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> promote allopatric speciation, which leads to higher species richness.

40|$|Porous {{media with}} {{high water content}} can be {{successfully}} used as <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> to operate under high exposure temperatures and/or high heat fluxes. Modeling and simulation of such systems presents difficulties and challenges, which are pointed and worked out in this work. Liquid water and water vapor transfers are considered, including the capillary effects for the liquid phase, {{as well as the}} air transfer inside the porous medium. Heat transfer model includes conduction, radiation, enthalpy convection, sensible heating and phase change. A realistic model is considered at the exposed boundary in what concerns mass transfer: the outflow mass transfer is dictated by the water effusion and not by the convection transfer mechanism between the exposed surface and the environment. A set of numerical aspects is detailed, concerning both the numerical modeling and the solution of the discretization equations, which are crucial to obtain successful simulations. Some illustrative results are presented, showing the potential of the wetted porous media when used as <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers,</b> as well as the capabilities of the presented physical and numerical models to deal with such systems.

40|$|The {{increase}} of the petroleum cost in the last decades revitalized the interest for lighter and more economic vehicles. Simultaneously, the demand for safe and unpolluted transports grows. The application of <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> coatings (TBC) on combustion chamber and on flat surface of pistons reduces the thermal losses of the engines, resulting in higher temperatures in the combus-tion chamber. This fact contributes to {{the improvement of the}} thermal efficiency (performance) and for the reduction of incomplete combustion. Supported on these initial ideas, <b>thermal</b> <b>barriers</b> coatings constituted by CaO partially stabilized zirconia were produced and their microstructure examined. This coating still presents some drawbacks associated with thermal stresses and permeability to oxidizing gases, which will, eventually, lead to failure of the TBC by spallation. The failure may, in general, be associated to one of three factors: oxide growth at the ceramic-metal interface, formed during thermal cycling; stress build-up due to thermal cycling; and metal-oxide interface segregation, mainly of S. However, it is also relevant to understand the behavior of TBC’s under isothermal oxidation. Therefore, this paper investigates the effect of oxidation on the adherence of thermal sprayed coatings. The adherence was measured by linear scratching tests, widely used fo...|$|R
