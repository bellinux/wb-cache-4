5|$|In April 1916 a German battlecruiser {{squadron}} with accompanying cruisers and destroyers bombarded {{the coastal}} ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Although the ports had some military importance, the main {{aim of the}} raid was to entice out defending ships which could then be picked off either by the battlecruiser squadron or by the full High Seas Fleet, which was stationed at sea ready <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> if an opportunity presented itself. The result was inconclusive: nearby Royal Navy units were too small <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> so largely kept clear of the German battlecruisers, and the German ships withdrew before the first British fast response battlecruiser squadron or the Grand Fleet could arrive.|$|E

5|$|Though the UN's primary mandate was peacekeeping, the {{division}} between the US and USSR often paralysed the organization, generally allowing it <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> only in conflicts distant from the Cold War. (A notable exception was a Security Council resolution in 1950 authorizing a US-led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea, passed {{in the absence of}} the USSR.) In 1947, the General Assembly approved a resolution to partition Palestine, approving the creation of the state of Israel. Two years later, Ralph Bunche, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict. In 1956, the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis; however, the UN was unable <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> against the USSR's simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country's revolution.|$|E

Either Walworth or Richard ordered Tyler to be arrested, Tyler attempted to attack the Mayor, and Walworth responded by stabbing Tyler. Ralph Standish, a royal squire, then repeatedly stabbed Tyler with his sword, mortally injuring him.|$|E

5|$|Aqil's victory entrenched {{his rule}} over Galilee and {{afterward}} he established stronger {{relations with the}} Europeans. After Aqil's victory at Hattin, the Ottoman authorities distanced themselves from the incident in their correspondence with Aqil, but he accepted their explanations {{with a grain of}} salt. In September 1858, Aqil was residing in Nazareth and decided not <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> and put a stop to tribal clashes in the Jezreel Valley.|$|E
5|$|But in {{addition}} to being militarily exhausted, the Commonwealth was now pressured by several European diplomacies to suspend further military activities, to allow Gustavus Adolphus <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in the Holy Roman Empire. The Truce of Altmark left Livonia north of the Daugava and all Prussian and Livonian seaports except for Danzig, Puck, Königsberg, and Libau in hands of the Swedes, who were also allowed to charge duty on trade through Danzig.|$|E
5|$|By February 1326, it {{was clear}} that Isabella was {{involved}} in a relationship with the exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power. The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> on his behalf, but this had no effect.|$|E

50|$|Omicron Columbae {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation Columba. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 4.81, which is bright enough to be faintly visible to the naked eye. The distance to this star, as determined by an annual parallax shift of 30.82 mas, is 105.8 light years. The visual magnitude is reduced by an interstellar absorption factor of 0.06 due <b>to</b> <b>intervening</b> dust.|$|R
50|$|The {{services}} {{these little}} mayors undertook ranged from explaining government, legal or business usages <b>to</b> constituents <b>to</b> <b>intervening</b> with institutions like banks to providing holiday food or winter coal for the poor.

5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end {{the impression that the}} Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders that {{something had to be done}} about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.|$|E

50|$|Omicron1 Orionis (ο1 Ori) is {{a binary}} {{star in the}} northeastern corner of the {{constellation}} Orion. It is {{visible to the naked}} eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.7.

50|$|Omicron2 Orionis (ο2 Ori) is {{a solitary}} {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Orion. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 4.06, which is bright enough {{to be seen with}} the naked eye.

At that distance, the visual magnitude of the star is diminished by an interstellar absorption factor of 0.09 due <b>to</b> <b>intervening</b> dust.|$|R
5|$|However, {{events in}} the world {{appeared}} to play into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92) and the Austro-Turkish War (1787–91)); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War (1788–90)).|$|E
5|$|In 191 BC, Antiochus the Great, the Emperor of the Seleucid Empire of Asia, invaded Greece. The Romans decided <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> {{and they}} {{defeated}} the Seleucids at the Battle of Thermopylae. The defeat by Rome forced the Seleucids to retreat back to Asia Minor. The Romans followed {{them across the}} Aegean Sea and together with their allies, Pergamum, they decisively defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Magnesia.|$|E
