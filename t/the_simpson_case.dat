25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. <b>The</b> <b>Simpson</b> <b>case</b> continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E
2500|$|Authors Donald Freed and Raymond Briggs {{claimed in}} Killing Time (1996), their book about <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> <b>case,</b> that an unnamed source {{told them that}} while Nigg had lived in Colorado, {{he was known to}} law {{enforcement}} there to be [...] "involved in the narcotics culture" [...] in Aspen (where another branch of Mezzaluna is located) and Denver. According to journalist Joseph Bosco, who had a reserved seat at the entire trial, Nigg [...] "lived beyond his apparent means", driving a Mercedes and living in a luxury condominium while ostensibly deriving most of his income from waiting tables and occasional low-level acting jobs. Freed and Briggs, among others, have also observed that the circumstances of the killing seem to suggest the assailants' true intent was to kill Nigg rather than rob him. Moreover, Nigg and Goldman were not the only Mezzaluna waiters who had fallen victim to foul play around that time: two others were missing, and a third had his car destroyed by fire in Corona del Mar during 1994.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an article}} by Jeffrey Toobin in the July 25 issue of The New Yorker, the defense {{revealed}} that they planned to play [...] "the race card".

The article detailed Fuhrman's prior use of racist language and claims of violence made during his 1981-1982 psychiatric interviews. Although Fuhrman's psychiatric reports were later ruled inadmissible in <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> <b>case</b> because they were determined to be too old to have direct relevance, the New Yorker article was published before jury selection was finalized or jury sequestration had taken place. Potential jurors were asked how much exposure to <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> <b>case</b> they received from The New Yorker (among other media outlets) as part of the jury selection process.

5000|$|After the trial, {{there was}} {{widespread}} pressure on Los Angeles County district attorney Gil Garcetti to bring perjury charges against Fuhrman. Garcetti initially refused, saying that Fuhrman's use of racist language was [...] "not {{material to the}} case", a major element of proving perjury.

In the book, Fuhrman apologized for the racist remarks on the audiotapes, terming them [...] "immature, irresponsible ramblings" [...] made because of a desire to make money; he contends that the tapes were merely part of a screenplay.

[...] With the jury absent on September 6, the defense asked Fuhrman whether he had ever falsified police reports, or if he had planted or manufactured evidence in <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> <b>case.</b> Although he had earlier responded, [...] "No", when asked this question, this time, on his lawyer's advice, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.|$|E
50|$|Fuhrman {{retired from}} the LAPD in 1995.

Fuhrman maintains that he did not plant or manufacture evidence in <b>the</b> <b>Simpson</b> <b>case,</b> and Simpson's defense team did not present any evidence to contradict this claim. Fuhrman believes that Simpson is guilty and places blame for his acquittal on the failure of lead detectives to enter evidence into the chain of custody and failure of the prosecution to adequately argue their case.|$|E
