We focus on the European Monetary Union (EMU) and compare the results obtained by analysing the EMU at a disaggregated level.

5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} with a tight focus on a small group (with {{everyone}} in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.|$|E

2500|$|One {{can then}} compute the {{probability}} density associated to the approximate wave function. The {{probability that the}} quantum particle will {{be found in the}} classically forbidden region is small. In the classically allowed region, meanwhile, the [...] probability the quantum particle will be found in a given interval is approximately the fraction of time the classical particle spends in that interval over one period of motion. Since the classical particle's velocity goes to zero at <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>points,</b> it spends more time near <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> than in other classically allowed regions.

According to a study by Zhang and Yang, China has reached <b>the</b> Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> by 2010, and cheap labor in the country has rapidly declined and real agricultural wages have substantially increased. However, other journals such as the China Economic Review claim that <b>the</b> Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> was not yet passed in China and that this was comparable to the Japanese historical experience in regard to how <b>the</b> Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> affected <b>the</b> economy. Despite its large population, in the early 2010s China has faced labor shortages and real wages have nearly doubled since 2003, such rapidly rising wages in regard to unskilled work is a key indicator that a country has reached <b>the</b> Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point.</b> A 2013 working paper by the International Monetary Fund predicts <b>the</b> Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> in China to “emerge between 2020 and 2025.” Piazza argues that a fast-growing economy that reaches <b>the</b> Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> can experience financial turmoil and a persistent downshift in growth prospects.|$|R

After winning a similar engagement over Baron later in the game, Samsung Galaxy was then able to quickly destroy five of SKT's defensive towers and win the game. This third game was the second-longest in competitive League of Legends history, at 71 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Although Philip {{considered}} Attalus' {{escape a}} bitter defeat, {{it proved to}} be <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> of the war. Attalus was forced to return to Pergamon, when he learned at Opus that, perhaps at the urging of Philip, Prusias I, king of Bithynia and related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Sulpicius returned to Aegina. Free from the pressure of the combined Roman and Pergamene fleets, Philip was able to resume the offensive against the Aetolians. He captured Thronium, followed by the towns of Tithronium and Drymaea north of the Cephisus, controlling all of Epicnemidian Locris, and took back control of Oreus.|$|E
