It achieves an equivalent high sampling rate using Coherent Time Interleaved Sampling (CTIS) technique to accurately characterize high Power amplifiers driven by repetitive pulsed RF large signal. The acquired samples are {{the combination of}} non-sequential sub-sampling technique and the measurement system based {{on the use of}} <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hold</b> amplifiers to avoid Intermediate Frequency (IF) aliasing and IF filtering. This principle is applied to the large signal pulsed characterization of S-band 50 W GaN amplifier.

40|$|Fiscal {{decentralization}} {{in developing}} countries {{has been at the}} center stage of public sector reforms in the last two decades.

The success of decentralization depends on the existence of a framework that keeps local or “subnational ” governments on <b>track</b> <b>and</b> <b>holds</b> local government officials accountable for results—two missing components in most recent decentralization efforts.
