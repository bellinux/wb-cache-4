5|$|About 20 minutes later, Bariko {{launched}} a helicopter <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cable winch {{which was to}} collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged {{and had to be}} towed out ten days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final phase was {{operational}} training for the astronauts. This focused on giving them hands-on experience using the instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight. They received training in the effects of microgravity and rapid acceleration. The astronauts spent time in simulators, aboard cargo planes that simulated weightlessness, underwater to practice extravehicular activities (EVAs), and on visits to manufacturing plants <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> progress of the hardware.|$|E

5|$|Bruix's {{orders were}} {{to combine the}} French and Spanish fleets and rescue Napoleon's army, {{stranded}} in Egypt following the Battle of the Nile, but the ships in Cádiz were prevented from joining their French allies by an opposing wind, and although the British offered their line-of-battle, it was declined and the Brest fleet instead stood out for the Straits of Gibraltar. Elphinstone followed as far as Cape Spartel before first returning <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fleet in Cádiz, then sailing to join Jervis at Gibraltar, arriving at 09:00 on 10May. Elphinstone made several further attempts to track down and bring the French to action, without success. Bruix was able to amass a powerful fleet of 59 ships but failed to achieve his ultimate goal and returned to Brest on 8August.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, in the {{capacity}} as an engineering advisor, Verville joined General Billy Mitchell and his aide, Lieutenant Clayton Bissell, on their sailing trip to Europe in December 1921. The three men toured France, Italy, Germany, Holland, and England in order <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> European progress of aviation. From their research they produced a 206-page report, which was published as an U.S. Army Air Service Information Circular. General Mitchell asked Verville to incorporate some of the European developments they had observed and to produce a plane for the U.S. Army Air Service's participation in the upcoming 1922 National Air Races.|$|E

Gwendolyn first appears {{at the end of}} issue #8, having been {{assigned}} by the Secretary General of Wreath High Command <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Will and helps him rescue Slave Girl from Sextillion in order to spur him to complete his mission. Marko and Alana's wedding rings, which also function as translator devices, were originally those of Gwendolyn's grandparents, who had the rings enchanted with a translator spell because they spoke two different dialects of Wreath's native language. She wears her grandparents' translation pendant around her neck, which was forged with the rings as part of the same set. She resists The Will's advances, though she reveals she loves him while attempting to get medical attention for him after he suffers a near-fatal injury.|$|E

He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting {{to him that he}} had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
5|$|Since the New York State Militia {{had been}} sent to assist Union troops at Gettysburg, the local New York Metropolitan Police Department was the only force on hand to try to {{suppress}} the riots. Police Superintendent John Kennedy arrived at the site on Monday <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> situation. Although not in uniform, people in the mob recognized him and attacked him. Kennedy was left nearly unconscious, his face bruised and cut, his eye injured, his lips swollen, and his hand cut with a knife. He had been beaten to a mass of bruises and blood all over his body.|$|E
5|$|The team {{decided to}} stay with {{two-dimensional}} graphics instead of three-dimensional graphics, believing it would help differentiate themselves from other Square Enix titles as well as better represent their vision for the game. When first approached {{with the task of}} creating the art for the game, background art director Takayuki Ohdachi thought the modern-day setting would be too boring, and opted to use highly skewed and angular images of Shibuya to avoid this; the rest of the creative team found this approach to fit the game quite well. For combat, the background of the top screen was selected for visual interest, while the bottom touchscreen background was designed to emphasize the gameplay. Ohdachi was also responsible for the artwork for the psych pins, and used a mix of pop art and tribal designs for the various graphics. Character designs were handled by Tetsuya Nomura and Gen Kobayashi. Character designs were made to match with the real-world Tokyo setting, after which their outfits were designed based on the character's personality. Kobayashi was also in charge of designing the game's non-player characters and noted how most designs made it to the final product. Hasegawa was responsible for creating the designs for the Noise creatures, and wanted to have them recognizable as creatures before they decay into skeletons. In keeping with the theme of human emotion in the game, Hasegawa selected creatures that conveyed such feelings, such as wolves and crows. Representation of the Noise in the game required drawing the 2D sprites from several angles to match the action on screen as well as using rotoscoping on pre-rendered sprites, and took several iterations between Square Enix and Jupiter {{to make sure that the}} sprites' art matched the style of game, with Kando making the two-hour trip between Tokyo and Kyoto weekly <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> progress.|$|E

25|$|The next match saw El Hijo del Perro Aguayo {{challenge}} El Mesías for the AAA Mega Championship. The champion {{was accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by Cibernético, while the challenger was accompanied by his stablemates Héctor Garza and Taya Valkyrie. Towards {{the end of the}} bloody brawl, Aguayo went for the illegal Martinete, which would lead to an automatic disqualification, but was stopped by Garza, leading to an argument between the two stablemates. Garza then attempted to hit El Mesías with a steel chair, but accidentally hit Aguayo instead. As Aguayo began bleeding heavily, the match was stopped for a moment as a doctor entered the ring <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cut on his head; Aguayo, however, kept avoiding the doctor, not wanting the match to be ended. El Mesías then speared his challenger through a table for the win and to retain the AAA Mega Championship. Afterwards, Cibernético immediately climbed to the ring and jumped on top of the bloody Aguayo, mocking him, while El Mesías received his title belt. Cibernético then went out of the ring and pushed Hall of Famer Perro Aguayo, who was seated in the front row, before being pulled away by an irate El Mesías as Los Perros del Mal members Halloween, Psicosis and Teddy Hart came ringside <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition of the challenger. Garza attempted to do the same, but was pulled away from Aguayo by Halloween, Psicosis and Hart, who blamed him for the loss.
