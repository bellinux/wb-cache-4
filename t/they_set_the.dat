5|$|Meanwhile, the Bynars discreetly {{create a}} catastrophic {{failure in the}} ship's warp core. Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, {{assuming}} them to already be on the Starbase, order an emergency evacuation. <b>They</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> ship to leave the Starbase and warp to a safe location before it would explode. However, once they are clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow them. Back on the Enterprise, Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at warp to the Bynar system, with the ship's controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars have taken over the ship for nefarious purposes, <b>they</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> ship to self-destruct in 5 minutes and then take the bridge by inter-ship transporter beam and find the Bynars there unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. <b>They</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
5|$|During their record-setting {{streak of}} sixteen {{consecutive}} losing seasons, the Phillies posted their franchise record for losses {{in a season}} in 1941 with 111, falling shy of the modern (post-dead-ball era) Major League record of 120 losses in a season. During the 2007 season, the franchise also became the first professional sports team in American history to reach 10,000 losses. The Phillies have thrice surpassed the century mark for wins in a season: in 1976 with 101 wins, when they made their first playoff appearance in twenty-six seasons; again the next season when they matched that mark; and in 2011, when <b>they</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> franchise single-season record for wins with 102 victories and clinched a playoff position at the earliest point in team history. Philadelphia finished the 2010 season {{with a record of}} 97–65, marking {{the first time that the}} team completed a season with Major League Baseball’s best record; they duplicated this accomplishment in 2011 as the majors' only 100-win team. Since 2011, the Phillies have declined again and in 2015 they suffered the worst record in MLB and the franchise’s worst since an equally-poor record in 1969, with their worst before than from 1961.|$|E

John Turman, a Hulk comic book fan, was brought to write the script in 1995, getting approval from Lee. Turman wrote ten drafts and was heavily influenced by the Tales to Astonish issues, which pitted the Hulk against General Ross and the military, the Leader, Rick Jones, the atomic explosion origin from the comics, and Brian Banner as the explanation for Bruce's inner anger. Universal had mixed feelings over Turman's script, but nonetheless future screenwriters would use many elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} all the major statistics and records for the 2007 Cricket World Cup held in the West Indies from 13 March to 28 April 2007. Though India were eliminated early, <b>they</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> ODI record for the highest victory margin in their 257 run win over Bermuda. In their match against Netherlands, Herschelle Gibbs (South Africa) created ODI and International cricket record when he hit sixes off all six deliveries in Daan van Bunge's over. In the Super 8 stage games, Lasith Malinga (Sri Lanka) created ODI record when he took four wickets in four consecutive deliveries in a losing effort against South Africa. By the end of the tournament, new World Cup records for the fastest fifty (20 balls – Brendon McCullum of New Zealand) and fastest hundred (66 balls – Matthew Hayden of Australia) were established. Glenn McGrath established a new Cricket World Cup record for the most number of wickets (26) and also finished his ODI career with the most number of wickets in World Cup history (71). The number of sixes in the overall tournament (373) was 40% higher than the previous record holder, the 2003 Cricket World Cup (266). The tournament also saw 32 century partnerships (previous record of 28 during the 1996 Cricket World Cup) and 10 batsmen over 400 runs (previous record of 4 during the 2003 Cricket World Cup).|$|E
