25|$|The {{area that}} has {{seen some of the}} worst terror attacks in modern history has been Iraq as part of the Iraq War. In 2005, there were more than 400 {{incidents}} of suicide bombing attacks, killing more than 2,000 people. In 2006, almost half of all reported terrorist attacks in the world (6,600), {{and more than half of}} all terrorist fatalities (13,000), occurred in Iraq, according to the National Counterterrorism Center of the United States. Along with nationalist groups and criminal, non-political attacks, the Iraqi insurgency includes Islamist insurgent groups, such as Al-Qaeda in Iraq, who favor suicide attacks far more than non-Islamist groups. At least some of the <b>terrorism</b> <b>has</b> a transnational character in that some foreign Islamic jihadists have joined the insurgency.|$|E

Many of his articles on Islam have been collected in an e-book, Debating Islam. The New Quislings: How the International Left Used the Oslo Massacre to Silence Debate about Islam (2012) is an e-book by Bawer about the aftermath of the mass murders committed by Anders Behring Breivik on July 22, 2011. In recent years, Bawer has written several articles for Frontpage Mag.

2500|$|Critics [...] {{believe that}} {{interrogation}} methods employed by U.S. forces {{in places such}} as Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib were immoral and unethical, making them no better than the insurgents they are trying to find. The War on <b>Terrorism</b> <b>has</b> been effectively called an act of terrorism in itself by some who point to incidents such as the Bagram torture and prisoner abuse scandal, the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal, the alleged use of chemical weapons against terrorists in Fallujah, and {{the use of military force}} to disperse anti-American demonstrations in Iraq.|$|E

He said, [...] "Terrorism is act of violence done or threatened {{in order to try to}} influence a public body or citizenry, so it's more of a political act, and again, based on what I know, I don't see this as a political act. Doesn't make it any less horrific, but <b>terrorism</b> <b>has</b> a definition under federal law." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{analysed}} {{the role}} of terrorism in the novel. Patrick Reilly calls the novel [...] "a terrorist text {{as well as a}} text about terrorism" [...] due to Conrad's manipulation of chronology to allow the reader to comprehend the outcome of the bombing before the characters, thereby corrupting the traditional conception of time. The morality which is implicit in these acts of <b>terrorism</b> <b>has</b> also been explored: is Verloc evil because his negligence leads to the death of his brother-in-law? Although Winnie evidently thinks so, the issue is not clear, as Verloc attempted to carry out the act with no fatalities, and as simply as possible to retain his job, and care for his family.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 21st century <b>terrorism</b> <b>has</b> become {{increasingly}} {{a concern for}} Papua New Guinea policy-makers {{and one of the}} major objectives of the army for 2008 is to prepare itself to deter any attack on its sovereignty but more particularly to terrorist attacks. Equally, although the army has no history of peace support contributions, its involvement in RAMSI has proven a catalyst to determine how it could train for and be used in UN operations. Despite these efforts the army is still {{not in a position to}} provide forces with the appropriate [...] "level of training and discipline" [...] without significant risk, according to Janes. To be sure, however, [...] "the army command views such deployment as their contribution to the 'economic well-being of PNG' and a way of maintaining any semblance of a proficient armed force." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 22 August 1998, the Irish National Liberation Army {{called a}} ceasefire in its {{operations}} against the British government. The National Consortium for the Study of <b>Terrorism</b> <b>has</b> accused the republican paramilitary organisation of providing {{supplies for the}} bombing. The INLA continued to observe the ceasefire although it remains opposed to the Good Friday Agreement. In 2010, it began decommissioning its arms. The RIRA also suspended operations {{for a short time}} after the Omagh bombing before returning to violence. The RIRA came under pressure from the PIRA after the bombing; PIRA members visited the homes of 60 people connected with the RIRA and ordered them to disband and stop interfering with PIRA arms dumps. The BBC News reported that, [...] "Like the other bombings {{in the early part of}} 1998 in places like Lisburn and Banbridge, Omagh was a conscious attempt by republicans who disagreed with the political strategy of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, to destabilise Northern Ireland in that vulnerable moment of hope. It failed — but there is a terrible irony to the way in which the campaign was halted only by the wave of revulsion triggered by the carnage at Omagh." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aside from {{injuries}} and death associated with stray bullets, mines and epidemic disease, MSF volunteers are sometimes attacked or kidnapped for political reasons. In some countries afflicted by civil war, humanitarian-aid organizations {{are viewed as}} helping the enemy. If an aid mission {{is perceived to be}} exclusively set up for victims {{on one side of the}} conflict, it may come under attack for that reason. However, the War on <b>Terrorism</b> <b>has</b> generated attitudes among some groups in US-occupied countries that non-governmental aid organizations such as MSF are allied with or even work for the Coalition forces. Since the United States has labelled its operations [...] "humanitarian actions," [...] independent aid organizations have been forced to defend their positions, or even evacuate their teams. Insecurity in cities in Afghanistan and Iraq rose significantly following United States operations, and MSF has declared that providing aid in these countries was too dangerous. The organization was forced to evacuate its teams from Afghanistan on 28 July 2004, after five volunteers (Afghans Fasil Ahmad and Besmillah, Belgian Hélène de Beir, Norwegian Egil Tynæs, and Dutchman Willem Kwint) were killed on 2 June in an ambush by unidentified militia near Khair Khāna in Badghis Province. In June 2007, Elsa Serfass, a volunteer with MSF-France, was killed in the Central African Republic and in January 2008, two expatriate staff (Damien Lehalle and Victor Okumu) and a national staff member (Mohammed Bidhaan Ali) were killed in an organized attack in Somalia resulting in the closing of the project.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010 {{during the}} United States {{diplomatic}} cables leak, WikiLeaks leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009, where the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Rahul Gandhi, then the General Secretary of the AICC. One {{of the guests}} who was invited for the lunch was the United States Ambassador to India, Timothy J. Roemer. In a [...] "candid conversation" [...] with Roemer, {{he said that he}} believes Hindu extremists pose a greater threat to his country than Muslim militants. Rahul Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the Bharatiya Janata Party. Also responding to the ambassador's query about the activities in the region by the Islamist militant organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Rahul Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous Muslim population. In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Rahul Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad slammed Rahul Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, [...] "In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in Pakistan, and also some segments of Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as also our strategic security." [...] Adding that <b>terrorism</b> <b>has</b> no religion, he said that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India. Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the RSS and has compared them to terrorist organisations like SIMI.|$|E
