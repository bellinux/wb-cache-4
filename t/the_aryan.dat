5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the NSDAP and the Nazi regime. Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on their belief {{in the existence of}} a superior master race. The Nazis postulated the existence of a racial conflict between <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and repression of <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> race.|$|E

5|$|He was {{a founder}} of the Church of the Nazarene in Los Angeles, as well as a Methodist pastor. He {{published}} many books, mainly on his views about California and its history, but only Race Life of <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> Peoples was commercially published.|$|E
25|$|By the 1880s {{a number}} of {{linguists}} and anthropologists argued that <b>the</b> <b>Aryans</b> themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe. Theodor Poesche proposed that <b>the</b> <b>Aryans</b> originated in <b>the</b> vast Rokitno, or Pinsk Marshes, then in the Russian Empire, now covering much of {{the southern part of}} Belarus and the north-west of the Ukraine, but it was Karl Penka who popularised the idea that <b>the</b> <b>Aryans</b> had emerged in Scandinavia and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics of blond hair and blue eyes.|$|R

5|$|In the Telugu Sita Puranamu, Ramaswami Chaudari portrays Trijata as the {{daughter}} of the Dravidian Vibhishana and <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> Gandharva Sarama. Trijata, a half-Aryan, is labelled a traitor, who betrays her uncle Ravana and helps Sita. Vibhishana's betrayal towards his brother and defection to Rama is also blamed on his Aryan wife.|$|E
5|$|The {{ideology}} of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics, and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism {{with the goal}} of obtaining more Lebensraum (living space) for the Germanic people. Nazi Germany attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> master race.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the mainstream views, the Hindu revivalist movements denied an external origin to <b>Aryans.</b> Dayananda Saraswati, <b>the</b> founder of the Arya Samaj (Society of Aryans), held that Vedas were {{the source of all}} knowledge that were revealed to <b>the</b> <b>Aryans.</b> <b>The</b> first man (an Aryan) was created in Tibet and, after living there for some time, <b>the</b> <b>Aryans</b> came down and inhabited India, which was devoid of any people earlier.|$|R

5|$|Legalized {{discrimination}} against Jews in Germany began {{immediately after the}} Nazi seizure of power in January 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism {{with the goal of}} obtaining more Lebensraum (living space) for the Germanic people. Nazi Germany attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or exterminate the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> master race.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding {{in a sense of}} duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over the conduct of the war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. German {{dictator}} Adolf Hitler {{ordered that}} the Polish leadership and intelligentsia be destroyed. Approximately 65,000 civilians, who {{were viewed as}} being inferior to <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> master race, {{were killed by the}} end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, the Nazis killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani, and the mentally ill. SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, then head of the Gestapo, ordered on 21 September that Polish Jews should be rounded up and concentrated into cities with good rail links. Initially the intention was to deport the Jews to points further east, or possibly to Madagascar. Two years later, in an attempt to obtain new territory, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there.|$|E

5|$|Racism, {{especially}} antisemitism, was {{a central}} feature of the regime. The Germanic peoples (the Nordic race) were considered by the Nazis to be the purest branch of <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> race and were therefore viewed as the master race. Millions of Jews and other peoples deemed undesirable by the state were murdered in the Holocaust. Opposition to Hitler's rule was ruthlessly suppressed. Members of the liberal, socialist and communist opposition were killed, imprisoned or exiled. Christian churches were also oppressed, with many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} reprinted eight times and {{sold more than}} 16,000 copies by 1941. Thousands more were given away. It was sold in Chicago book stores and by mail order from Dilling's house. It was {{distributed}} by the KKK, the Knights of the White Camellia, the German-American Bund, and <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> Bookstores. Subscribers to Gerald Winrod's new journal, The Revealer, received a copy; fundamentalist preacher W. B. Riley, president of the Northwest Bible Training School, claimed he had given away hundreds of copies; and it was advertised and sold by the Moody Bible Institute. It was endorsed by officials in the DAR and the American Legion. Copies were bought by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, the New York Police Department, the Chicago Police Department, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A Los Angeles arms manufacturer bought and distributed 150 copies, and a tear gas manufacturer bought 1,500 copies, which it distributed to the Standard Oil Company, the National Guard, and hundreds of police departments.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his tenure, he sought to distance himself from previous Directors-General and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors. Assigned with a four-year contract, Wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from Britain, Glyn Daniel and Stuart Piggott, to aid him in reforming the Archaeological Survey, although they declined the offer. He then toured the subcontinent, seeking to meet all of the Survey's staff members. He had drawn up a prospectus containing research questions that he wanted the Survey to focus on; these included understanding the period between the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization and the Achaemenid Empire, discerning the socio-cultural background to the Vedas, dating <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> invasion, and establishing a dating system for southern India prior to the sixth century CE. During his time in office he also achieved a 25 per cent budget increase for the Archaeological Survey, and convinced the government to agree to the construction of a National Museum of Archaeology, to be built in New Delhi.|$|E

5|$|Mengele used Auschwitz as an {{opportunity}} to continue his anthropological studies and research on heredity, using inmates for human experimentation. The experiments had no regard for the health, safety, or physical and emotional suffering of the victims. He was particularly interested in identical twins, people with heterochromia iridum (eyes of two different colours), dwarfs, and people with physical abnormalities. A grant was provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, applied for by von Verschuer, who received regular reports and shipments of specimens from Mengele. The grant was used to build a pathology laboratory attached to Crematorium II at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli, a Hungarian Jewish pathologist who arrived in Auschwitz on 29 May 1944, performed dissections and prepared specimens for shipment in this laboratory. Mengele's twin research was in part intended to prove the supremacy of heredity over environment and thus bolster the Nazi premise of the superiority of <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> race. Nyiszli and others report that the twins studies may also have been motivated by a desire to improve the reproduction rate of the German race by improving the chances of racially desirable people having twins.|$|E
5|$|Spokane and its {{metro area}} in general, {{particularly}} northern Idaho has been stigmatized {{in the popular}} consciousness {{by a number of}} hate groups that have been set up in and around Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in the past. Low ethnic diversity made the region a destination for some seeking to escape more cosmopolitan cities for a locale with a relatively homogenous, white population. This trend increased with the arrival of retired engineer Richard Butler from California who traveled to Hayden, Idaho in 1974 to eventually establish a white supremacist church called the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, better known by its political arm, <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> Nations. Aryan Nations recruits and associates were responsible for several hate crimes and terror plots during the mid 1980s and 1990s. The group went defunct in 2000 when the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a civil suit which resulted in a $6.3 million settlement, which led to the eventual bankruptcy and closure of their Hayden compound. Another significant act of hate was the attempted bombing of Spokane's Martin Luther King Day Parade by Kevin Harpham of Addy, Washington in 2011. The Southern Poverty Law Center currently lists three hate groups in the Spokane and Coeur d'Alene metro areas, in the categories of anti-Muslim, Holocaust denial, and general hate.|$|E
5|$|The NSDAP was a far-right {{political}} party which came {{into its own}} during the social and financial upheavals that occurred {{with the onset of}} the Great Depression in 1929. While in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, which laid out his plan for transforming German society into one based on race. The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more Lebensraum for the Germanic people. The regime attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> master race and part of a Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy. The Nazi regime believed that only Germany could defeat the forces of Bolshevism and save humanity from world domination by International Jewry. Others deemed life unworthy of life by the Nazis included the mentally and physically disabled, Romani people, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and social misfits.|$|E

5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under <b>the</b> <b>Aryan</b> population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E
