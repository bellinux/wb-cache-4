Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt <b>to</b> <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E

The Icelanders who copied the Poetic Edda did not {{explicitly}} try to integrate elves into Christian thought. Likewise, the early modern Scottish people confessed to encountering elves seem not to have thought of themselves as having dealings with the Devil. Nineteenth-century Icelandic folklore about elves mostly presents them as a human agricultural community parallel to the visible human community, {{that may or may}} not be Christian.

Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans.

5|$|Waters {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> Momentary Lapse of Reason tour {{by contacting}} promoters in the US {{and threatening to}} sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained {{the right to use}} the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.|$|E
