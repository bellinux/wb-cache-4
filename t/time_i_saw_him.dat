He said he had used up his bad luck." [...] In February 1943, the Associated Press ran a feature story about Gedeon's war service under the headline: [...] "Gedeon Will Return to Baseball If War Doesn’t Last Too Long." [...] Gedeon was quoted in the article as saying [...] "he hopes to pick up after the war where he left off." [...] He added that [...] "it's a matter of time." [...] "If the war ends before I’m past the playing age I’ll return to the game. [...] If I’m too old, I’ll do something else." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of a {{modestly}} successful LP, Last <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>Him,</b> Ross had a third #1 hit with [...] "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)", from her second feature film, Mahogany. A year later, in 1976, Ross released her fourth solo #1 hit, [...] "Love Hangover", a sensual, dramatic mid-tempo song that bursts into an uptempo disco tune. Later that year, Ross launch her [...] "An Evening with Diana Ross. The tour's success led to a two-week stint at Broadway's Palace Theatre and a 90-minute, Emmy-nominated television special of the same name, featuring special make-up effects by Stan Winston, for a scene in which Ross portrayed legendary cabaret artist Josephine Baker and blues singers Bessie Smith and Ethel Waters, and a Special Tony Award.|$|E
2500|$|The war {{energised}} Churchill, who was 65 {{years old}} when he became Prime Minister. An American journalist wrote in 1941: [...] "The responsibilities which are his now must be greater than those carried by any other human being on earth. One would think such a weight would have a crushing effect upon him. Not at all. The last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> while the Battle of Britain was still raging, he looked twenty years younger than before the war began... His uplifted spirit is transmitted to the people". Churchill's speeches were a great inspiration to the embattled British. His first as prime minister was the famous, [...] "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat" [...] speech. One historian has called its effect on Parliament as [...] "electrifying". The House of Commons that had ignored him during the 1930s [...] "was now listening, and cheering". Churchill followed that closely with two other equally famous ones, given just before the Battle of Britain. One included the words: ...|$|E

5000|$|The magician Henry R. Evans {{sat with}} Keeler in April, 1895 {{suspected}} {{that he had}} written the 'spirit' messages on the slates himself. According to Evans [...] "I {{was sure he was}} writing under the table; I heard the faint rubbing of a soft bit of pencil upon the surface of a slate... several <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> put his fingers into his vest pockets, and he appeared to bring up small particles of something, which I believe were bits of the white and coloured crayons used in writing the messages." ...|$|R
2500|$|Roach {{made his}} Test debut on 9July 2009. He {{was part of}} an understrength team fielded by the West Indies against Bangladesh; in the 15-man squad, there were nine {{uncapped}} players and in the Test seven West Indies players made their debut. The side was captained by Floyd Reifer who had played the last of his four Tests ten years earlier. The first XI had made themselves unavailable due to a pay dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board. His first Test wicket was that of all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Although Bangladesh won by 95runs, Roach helped put pressure on the Bangladesh batsmen through a combination of yorkers and swinging deliveries, although he bowled slightly wide to the left-handers. Reifer praised Roach's efforts, saying [...] "The first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as an under-19 bowler, I always {{thought he was going to}} play for West Indies. He does a lot, especially with the old ball, getting it to move in and out and he performed very well this morning, bowling decent lengths and lines". Although Bangladesh won the second Test to take the series 2–0, Roach again bowled with pace and aggression, unsettling the Bangladesh batsmen. Varying his length and exploiting the Bangladesh batsmen's weakness against short bowling– even hitting Raqibul Hasan on the elbow with one delivery– Roach proceeded to take career-best figures of 6/48 in the first innings. With 13wickets to his name, Roach finished as West Indies' leading wicket-taker from the series. Although Bangladesh won the three-match ODI series that followed 3–0, Roach was leading wicket-taker for the series, with 10wickets at an average of 16.20; in the first of the ODIs he took his maiden five-wicket haul in one day matches (5/44), beating his previous best figures of 2/29. In the second ODI, Roach was fined 10% of his match fee for bowling two beamers. The core of the same squad was retained for September's 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. Roach played in two of West Indies' three matches, as they exited the tournament in the first round, and took three wickets at 33.33.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Pike {{was with}} them, working them {{and working with}} them. He took every chance they took, yet somehow he escaped being washed off his feet, though several <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> entirely buried from view. There was more than luck in the matter; for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> twice, {{at the head of}} a line of the men, himself next to the pin. And twice, in this position, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the North Atlantic curl over the rail and fall upon them. And each time he alone remained, holding the turn of the rope on the pin, while the rest of them were rolled and sprawled helplessly away.|$|R

2500|$|Rawlins corroborated Rowley's {{account of}} Grant's {{whereabouts}} and performance, maintaining that the rumors were typically [...] "unmitigated slander" [...] {{and that he}} had never seen Grant at any time take a drink, and that [...] "Grant and his staff" [...] were on the battlefield by 7 A.M. Colonel John E. Smith, also of the 45th Illinois, corroborated Rowley's claim as well, maintaining that the army was [...] "astonished" [...] to hear such claims, and that they were made by [...] "those who are jealous of him". Colonel Jacob Ammen, who had also seen Grant at Savannah and at Pittsburg Landing, in like manner claimed [...] "I am satisfied General Grant was not under the influence of liquor, either of the <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> Rowley was soon promoted to Major General of Volunteers and later served on a detail as Provost Marshal General of Departments of Tennessee and Cumberland, in 1863.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Caramba!' he said, 'whom have we here? Senor Thomas Wingfield I salute you. Look, my comrades, you {{see this}} young man whom the sea has brought to us.

6000|$|... "He did say something," [...] {{admitted}} the other, [...] "the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> And, by-the-bye, I did {{find him in}} the garden.

6000|$|... "'Yes,' replied Mr. Fox. 'He made {{my mouth}} water {{the very last}} <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> Seems to me I can smell him now. If he had made this hole {{just a little bit}} bigger I would go down and pull him out, but I am too tired to do any digging now.' ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{the good}} fortune one morning to see Meeko, the patriarch, make a new path for himself that none of the others ever {{followed}} so long as I was in the dormitory. He had a home den over a hallway, and a hiding place for acorns in a hollow linden. Between the two was a driveway; but though the branches arched over it from either side, the jump was too great for him to take. A hundred <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> run out on the farthest oak twig and look across longingly at the maple that swayed on the other side. It was perhaps three feet away, with no branches beneath to seize and break his fall in case he missed his spring, altogether too much for a red squirrel to attempt. He would rush out as if determined to try it, time after time, but always his courage failed him; he had to go down the oak trunk and cross the driveway on the ground, where numberless straying dogs were always ready to chase him.|$|R
6000|$|... “Just as Leighton {{was being}} taken to prison, the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> {{he told me to}} find some way to come here and get the money.

He thought I would find the laces still hidden in the wall, and perhaps the money.” ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the manner}} of his death was terrible and frightful to me, and, above all, the strange notices I had of it. I had never pretended to the second-sight, or {{anything}} of that kind, but certainly, if any one ever had such a thing, I had it at this <b>time,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as plainly in all those terrible shapes as above; first, as a skeleton, not dead only, but rotten and wasted; secondly, as killed, and his face bloody; and, thirdly, his clothes bloody, and all within the space of one minute, or indeed of a very few moments.|$|R
