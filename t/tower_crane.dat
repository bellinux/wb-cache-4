5|$|On August 16, 2008, {{construction}} crews {{made the}} last major concrete pour to top off the Trump tower's concrete core, which was commemorated with an unofficial ceremony. To celebrate the milestone, a yellow <b>tower</b> <b>crane</b> raised a bucket full of concrete and an American flag to the rooftop of the skyscraper. Another ceremony occurred on August 19, when construction supervisors, structural engineers and company representatives from McHugh Construction made a minor concrete pour {{at the top of}} the Trump tower. Though Donald Trump was absent from both of these ceremonies, he, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump attended the topping off party on September 24, 2008. Original plans called for the windows to be completed and the spire erected in October 2008. However, the spire installation was delayed through high winds in December 2008, and was finally completed on January 3, 2009. Kamin's critical opinion is that the spire is not aesthetically complementary.|$|E
25|$|Marina City was {{the first}} urban post-war {{high-rise}} residential complex in the United States and is widely credited with beginning the residential renaissance of American inner cities. Its model of mixed residential and office uses and high-rise towers with a base of parking has become a primary model for urban development in the United States and throughout the world, and has been widely copied throughout many cities internationally. Marina City construction employed the first <b>tower</b> <b>crane</b> used in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} of Harran, a mysterious viral {{outbreak}} has turned most of the population into hyper-aggressive zombie-like creatures, forcing Harran's Defence Ministry to quarantine the entire city. The Global Relief Effort (GRE) assists survivors still trapped in the city by regularly airdropping supplies. The GRE hires Kyle Crane (Roger Craig Smith) to infiltrate Harran in order to retrieve a sensitive file stolen from them by Kadir Suleiman (Jim Pirri), which he is using as leverage to blackmail them, {{with the threat of}} publicizing it if anything were to happen to him. Crane is airdropped into Harran, where he is ambushed by a gang of hostile bandits. As the infected attack, Crane is bitten and infected, but rescued by Jade Aldemir (Nazneen Contractor) and Amir Ghoreyshi (Roy Vongtama). Amir sacrifices himself to buy Jade and Crane time, and Jade takes him to a survivor sanctuary called the <b>Tower.</b> <b>Crane</b> wakes up and is introduced to Rahim Aldemir (Suraj Partha), Jade's brother. Rahim then teaches Crane parkour and sends him to Spike (Kevin Daniels), who gives him his first task as a Runner of the <b>tower.</b> <b>Crane</b> learns that the Tower, which seeks to help other survivors, is being harassed by a gang of bandits led by a warlord named Rais who steals and hoards the supplies from the GRE airdrops, including Antizin; a drug that suppresses symptoms of infection and slows down the process of turning. After Harris Brecken (Matthew Wolf), leader of the tower is nearly killed by a rival runner in a mission to retrieve an Antizin drop, need for the drug becomes immense. Crane volunteers and manages to reach an airdrop containing Antizin, but despite the dire need of the medicine by the survivors, Crane is instructed by the GRE to destroy the airdrop, instructing him to reach out to Rais in order to buy the drug and possibly confirm his identity. Crane reluctantly complies and lies to the Tower that the supplies have been looted.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Tower</b> <b>cranes,</b> on today’s typical {{building}} construction sites, are {{the centerpiece of}} production, hoisting and transporting {{of a variety of}} loads. Occasionally <b>tower</b> <b>cranes</b> operate with overlapping work zones and often under time, cost and labor constraints. Identifying optimal number and location of <b>tower</b> <b>cranes</b> is an important issue that can reduce conflicts between groups of <b>tower</b> <b>cranes.</b> Geographic information systems (GIS) facilitate the analysis of large amounts of spatial data used in the process of location optimization for <b>tower</b> <b>cranes.</b> In addition, integrating analysis results from GIS with 3 D visual models enables managers to visualize the po-tential conflicts with <b>tower</b> <b>cranes</b> in great detail. Building Information Modeling (BIM) helps managers to visu-alize buildings before implementation takes place through a digitally constructed virtual model. Hence, in this paper, the integrated GIS-BIM model starts with the identification of feasible locations for defined <b>tower</b> <b>cranes.</b> The method presented is based on previous works using “geometric closeness ” and coverage of all demand and supply points as key criteria for locating a group of <b>tower</b> <b>cranes.</b> Once the geometry of the construction site is generated by the BIM tool, the model determines the proper combination of <b>tower</b> <b>cranes</b> in order to optimize location. The output of the GIS model includes one or more feasible areas that cover all demand and supply points, which is then linked to the BIM tool and generates 3 D models to visualize the optimum location of <b>tower</b> <b>cranes.</b> As a result, potential conflicts are detected in different 3 D views in order to identify optimal location o...|$|R

500|$|Harland and Wolff, the RMS Titanic builders, {{opened their}} private {{archives}} to the crew, sharing blueprints that were thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for {{artifacts from the}} era. The newness of the ship meant every prop {{had to be made}} from scratch. Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunken by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, {{but the rest of the}} ship was just steel plating. Within was a fifty-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. Towering above was a [...] <b>tower</b> <b>crane</b> on [...] of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.|$|E
500|$|A {{deck crane}} {{was used for}} the {{construction}} of the main span of the bridge. A specially designed crane of 45tonne capacity was used to erect the pylons of the bridge. The structural steel used in the bridge weighs about 13,200 tonnes. The pylons, which are [...] in height, are designed as free standing portals. They are provided with two cross portal members, one at the bottom and another at the top, below the pylon head. The deck is connected to the end piers by bolts embedded in the chambers of the piers. Pylons made of [...] steel boxes of riveted construction were raised on the two side spans of the bridge; one set is on the Calcutta side and the other is on the Howrah side. The six pylons on the Calcutta side of the bridge were installed using 75 MT and 50 MT cranes, while on the Howrah end, a single 50 MT crane was used. Anchorage of the pylon with the base of piers was effected through Dywidag rods, duly anchored in the piers. Cables were erected from the four pylon heads with the help of 32 MT hoist frames. The hoist frames were mounted on top of each pylon. Sheave blocks, winches and snatch blocks were used to facilitate the lifting, and cables inside the pylons were stressed with jacks. Pressure grouting was performed to fill the voids between the wire and the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes. A twotonne <b>tower</b> <b>crane,</b> fixed inside the pylons, lifted the cables into position.|$|E
