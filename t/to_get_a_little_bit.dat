I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E

500|$|Very {{little of}} the design from Freelance Police was carried over into Save the World; LucasArts still held onto the assets created for use in Freelance Police, and Telltale was wary of using similar design patterns. While Ferguson and Purcell had both been {{involved}} with the canceled LucasArts project, Grossman had not. The team decided to just start from fresh, and pursue a different treatment of the game's subject. Purcell himself wanted to ensure that the game conveyed the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the original comics—something he felt was lacking from the LucasArts renditions of the franchise. Grossman stated that [...] "we wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more of that dirt on the streets, and the paper cups and people being mean and nasty". This [...] "gritty" [...] feeling also influenced artistic design. For instance, on Purcell's suggestion, the sky was changed from blue to yellow in the street outside Sam and Max's office, instantly making the environment feel [...] "filthy and disgusting".|$|E

In {{an interview with}} MTV News Ciara said that creating her fifth album was the most personal experience of her career thus far. She elaborated that she had asked close friend and collaborator Missy Elliott to review her early progress on Ciara, [...] "I always share my projects with her early. I'll go to her house and play her the records really early in the process, and it's always so cool, but I just have to pinch myself in moments when I see her a lot. I'll be like, 'OK, this is really my friend,' but it's dope because I really respect her. She's done something in music {{that no one has}} done {{and when you look at}} her old references and just her references period, you wonder what the mind of that person is, and she's my friend, so I get <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more out of that mind, and it's really cool." ...|$|E

Then as the movie goes along and Timothy begins to get on top of it, you'll notice the shot sizes begin to diminish on John and begin <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> bigger on Timothy - until finally they are equal partners shooting back and forth." ...|$|E

It is a power made of pure energy. I tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> closer to this symbolic world and share it through this series of abstract paintings named by some orishas, its deities. When I paint, I try to open doors and paths to the imagination. I don’t {{see it as a}} mirror, but as a passage, toward the others and our interiority." ...|$|E

[...] "Each session our balance got a little bit better and we were able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more speed out of it. That's kind of what you want to do, play it enough in the first few rounds to get to the final round where you go all out. Good job by our FedEx Ground Toyota team.

The favourite was still {{among a group of}} sixteen horses who still held serious chances with four fences to jump but he made a mistake at the 27th and was always struggling to get back on terms with those {{at the head of the}} group. After the race, jockey Tony McCoy said: [...] "He ran OK. He's probably still a bit high in the handicap. From Becher's on the second circuit he was just starting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> tired and he made a lot of little mistakes late on." ...|$|E

[...] "We had a similar fuel issue {{at the start of}} the Pocono race last year where we broke a fuel cable," [...] Hamlin said after the race. [...] "I thought maybe that’s what we did. When I went to take off his stop, it immediately shut off. While it was [...] "a downer, I was pretty confident we weren’t going to have it again. Because Mike crew chief never really gave me an alarm we were going to be stretching it on fuel." [...] In the subsequent press conference, Hamlin's crew chief said,"Towards the end of last season, where I said the best is yet to come, I strongly felt that way because towards the end of last season we closed out the season strong.
