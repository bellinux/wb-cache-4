25|$|In October 1905, Satie {{enrolled}} in Vincent d'Indy's Schola Cantorum de Paris to study classical counterpoint while still continuing his cabaret work. Most {{of his friends}} were as dumbfounded as the professors at the Schola when they heard about his new plan {{to return to the}} classrooms, especially as d'Indy was an admiring pupil of Saint-Saëns, not particularly favoured by Satie. Satie would follow these courses at the Schola, as a respected pupil, for more than five years, receiving a first (intermediate) diploma in 1908. Some of his classroom counterpoint-exercises, such as the , were published after his death. Another summary, of the period prior to the Schola, also appeared in 1911: the Trois morceaux en forme de poire, which was a kind of compilation of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he had written up to 1903.|$|E

25|$|Bach wrote virtuoso {{music for}} {{specific}} instruments, {{as well as}} music independent of instrumentation. For instance, the Sonatas and partitas for solo violin are considered the pinnacle {{of what has been}} written for this instrument, only within reach of accomplished players: the music fits the instrument, pushing it to the full scale of its possibilities, requiring virtuosity of the player, but without bravura. Notwithstanding that the music and the instrument seem inseparable, Bach made transcriptions for other instruments of some pieces of this collection. Similarly, for the cello suites, the virtuoso music seems tailored for the instrument, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is on offer for it, yet Bach made an arrangement for lute of one of these suites. Likewise for much of his most virtuoso keyboard music. Bach exploited the capabilities of an instrument to the fullest while keeping the core of such music independent of the instrument on which it is performed.|$|E

[...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E

In a 2007 article on Simpsons guest stars, Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote that McClure was [...] "responsible {{for some of the}} funniest moments in Simpsons history". Hartman ranked first on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars. Chris Turner argues in Planet Simpson that McClure and Lionel Hutz [...] "together...represent the most significant contribution to the show outside of its permanent cast", adding that [...] "the show's Golden Age is hard to imagine without them". He continues, [...] "The smarmy Hollywood type...has been done to death, but Hartman's version breathed new life into it with each appearance. McClure has become the apotheosis of the stereotype, a gut-achingly funny reinterpretation whose trademark introduction...has become a shorthand way to describe any grossly artificial media figure." ...|$|E

Rush drummer Neil Peart has said: [...] "I think Selling England by the Pound is an {{enduring}} masterpiece of drumming. Beautiful drumming, lovely sound, and the arrangements, I {{think they really}} nailed <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> that band as an entity could have done with that album." [...] Fish, solo artist and former lead singer of Marillion, has called it [...] "the definitive Genesis album", praised its [...] "emotive" [...] quality, said the wordplay was [...] "one {{of the things that}} became quite an influence on me - the games within the lyrics" [...] and concluded it [...] "took a whole jump forward and was the album that really got me into Genesis". Singer and songwriter Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices considers Selling England by the Pound one of his ten favourite records of all time.

[...] The Wall Street Journals film critic thinks [...] "Matthew McConaughey continues to amaze." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker talked about McConaughey's physical transformation in his words, [...] "It's McConaughey's spiritual transformation that is most remarkable. His gaze is at once desperate and challenging." [...] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers said, [...] " [...] explosive, unerring portrayal defines what makes an actor great, blazing commitment to a character and the range to make every nuance felt."

500|$|The {{scale of}} the project was enormous: By the time Gygax and Kuntz had stopped working on their {{original}} home campaign, the castle dungeons had encompassed 50 levels of cunningly complex passages with thousands of rooms and traps. This, plus plans for the city of Yggsburgh and encounter areas outside the castle and city, would clearly be too much to fit into the proposed 6 volumes. Gygax decided he would compress the castle dungeons into 13 levels, the size of his original Castle Greyhawk in 1973 by amalgamating <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> could be gleaned from binders and boxes of old notes. However, neither Gygax nor Kuntz had kept careful or comprehensive plans. Because they had often made up details of play sessions on the spot, they usually just scribbled a quick map as they played, with cursory notes about monsters, treasures, and traps. These sketchy maps had contained just enough detail that the two could ensure their independent work would dovetail. All of these old notes now had to be deciphered, 25-year-old memories dredged up as to what had happened in each room, and a decision made whether to keep or discard each new piece. Recreating the city too would be a challenge. [...] Although Gygax still had his old maps of the original city, all of his previously published work on the city was owned by WotC, so he would have to create most of the city from scratch while still maintaining the [...] "look and feel" [...] of his original.|$|E

2500|$|The BCS itself {{acknowledges}} the vast discrepancies between conferences the automatically qualify (AQ conferences) by drawing {{a comparison between}} BCS and non-BCS bowls.
