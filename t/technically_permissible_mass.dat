40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{requirements to}} parameters of an automobile being designed with axle arrangement 6 x 4 and <b>technically</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>mass</b> of 25 tons with its {{all year round}} operation in agricultural industry with the purpose to ensure in-time load transportation and technological cycle in crop production of the agricultural complex in accordance with time schedule of the executed mechanized works. The future automobile should also have a power takeoff device. The paper presents operation chart flowsheets for cultivation of main crops on mineral and peat soils with indication of automobile motion modes and type of transported loads. Specific properties of peat-bog soils are given in the paper. The paper considers off-road capability of mobile machines when they are moving on soils with low bearing capacity. The paper indicates field applications of automobiles with limited and high off-road capability. Description of wheel interaction with bearing surface area, values of soil resistivity after multiple automobile passages have been given in the paper. The paper specifies values of rolling resistance coefficient and adhesion coefficient of the automobile undercarriage systems in spring and autumn for wheeled and crawler units. Schemes of the automobile front axle drives (electric, hydraulic, mechanical) and their characteristics have been analyzed in the paper. An elastic flexible drive with separation of flow power has been proposed for reduction of dynamic loads in a power transmission drive. The paper describes a drive system of auto-analogue steering wheels with hydraulic hydrostatic drive which is located within a front wheel hub that ensure additional thrust. Recommendations for MAZ-automobile modernization with axle arrangement 6 x 4 have been given with the purpose to improve its off- road capability. Metallic anti-skid chain, segment and small link, track and crawler chains, wideners have obtained a wide application for improvement of automobile off-road capacity in various soil preparations. The paper notes the conditions required for provision of the automobile off-road capacity. </p...|$|E

5000|$|Following Caesar's murder, Octavian assumed {{permanent}} {{title of}} imperator and became permanent {{head of the}} Senate from 27 BCE (see principate) under the title and name Augustus. Only the year before, he had blocked the senatorial award of a triumph to Marcus Licinius Crassus the Younger, despite the latter's acclamation in the field as Imperator and his fulfillment of all traditional, Republican qualifying criteria except full consulship. Technically, generals in the Imperial era were legates of the ruling Emperor (Imperator). [...] Augustus claimed the victory as his own but permitted Crassus a second, which is listed on the Fasti for 27 BCE. Crassus was also denied the rare (and <b>technically</b> <b>permissible,</b> in his case) honour of dedicating the spolia opima of this campaign to Jupiter Feretrius.|$|R

A Black Hole exhibits extremely strong Gravitational attraction that no particle or {{electromagnetic radiation}} can escape from it. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called Event Horizon. In this work it is proposed that there exists a Neutron star smaller than Event Horizon, which is termed as Black Neutron Star.

50|$|Experts often {{state that}} sloped armored plate (for {{increasing}} {{the protection of}} the tank), was first used on the T-34. That is not the case. The fact is that the designers could not exceed the <b>permissible</b> <b>mass</b> of the T-19, therefore they used a maximum thickness of 16 mm of armor. The shape of the hull would be critical in terms of protection. Successful construction of the T-19 depended on sloped armor, such as that proposed to M. I. Tarshinovym (who was already occupied in KB KHPZ with the production of the T-12/T-24), by Ginzburg, which made it more likely for bullets and projectiles to ricochet rather than penetrate.|$|R
2500|$|One month later, an {{agreement}} {{was made for}} the tactical and technical requirements for the new BMD {{as well as a}} complete technical design stage. When developing the new BMD, the experience gained in the course of work on the BMD-1 and [...] "Object 934" [...] light tank was used. By 1985, the acceptance testing of three new BMD prototypes was completed. The test results revealed that all the samples exceeded the <b>permissible</b> <b>mass</b> by 190–290kg and that the running vehicle gave numerous failures. The design bureau VgTZ fixed most of the shortcomings and were eliminated. By May 1986, the refined BMD prototypes completed preliminary tests with three more prototypes developed by the Volgograd tractor factory. These were sent to the state test for another evaluation. New samples exceeded the <b>permissible</b> <b>mass</b> by 400kg, as they were made subject to measures of improving the reliability of the running transmission gears. The BMD state tests took place between 27 October 1986 and 27 October 1987. According to test results, two to three vehicles were completed and sent to the control tests in different climatic zones conducted from 10 July to 19 November 1988. The conclusion for the [...] "Bakhcha" [...] was assessed as positive with the vehicle fulfilling the tactical and technical requirements set by the airborne troops. On 10 February 1990, the USSR adopted the [...] "Object 950" [...] IFV into service under the designation BMD-3. The serial production of the BMD-3 was then initiated and continued until 1997. Excluding six prototypes produced before 1990, 137 BMD-3s were produced from the year of its adoption to the end of its serial production.|$|R

Because it was <b>technically</b> not <b>permissible</b> to draft non-citizens, many ethnic Germans ended up being (oxymoronically) forcibly volunteered for the Waffen-SS.

40|$|The {{amount of}} mass {{contained}} in low-mass objects is investigated anew. Instead {{of using a}} mass-luminosity relation to convert a luminosity function to a mass function, I predict the mass-luminosity relation from assumed mass functions and the luminosity functions of Jahreiss & Wielen (1997) and Gould et al (1997). Comparison of the resulting mass-luminosity relations with data from binary stars constrains the <b>permissible</b> <b>mass</b> functions. If the mass function {{is assumed to be}} a power law, the best fitting slope lies either side of the critical slope, - 2, below which the mass in low-mass objects is divergent, depending on the luminosity function adopted. If these power-law mass functions are truncated at 0. 001 Msun, the contribution to the local density of stars lies between 0. 016 and 0. 039 Msun pc^- 3, in conformity with the density measured dynamically from Hipparcos stars. If the mass function is generalized from a power law to a low-order polynomial in log(M), the mass in stars with M< 0. 1 Msun is either negligible or strongly divergent, depending on the order of the polynomial adopted.

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} of the global curvature of space-time, using distant supernovae as distance indicators, favor a positive cosmological constant, associated with an accelerating universal expansion. However, these results by themselves still allow an open universe with low mass density and zero cosmological constant. We show here that this degeneracy is removed by independent constraints from galaxy peculiar velocities in our cosmological neighborhood, which provide a lower bound on the <b>permissible</b> mean <b>mass</b> density. The joint constraints from the two independent sources thus favor an unbound and nearly flat universe with comparable contributions from cosmological constant and mass density, and they rule out a low-density open universe of vanishing cosmological constant. The indicated conspiracy between {{the values of the}} cosmological constant and the mass density seems to require fine tuning that is in conflict with our common wisdom concerning the early universe...|$|R

The number of fatalities in accidents involving vans has been constant during the last 10 years, not following the diminishing tendency shown by the general accidents.

This report analyses the security of the light commercial vehicles across the study of the influence from load distribution and the effectiveness of ESC (Electronic Stability Control). Through the medium of simulations made with Pc-Crash software, it has been analysed if the implementation of ESC in vans can at some extent compensate the influence of inaccurate load distributions. Furthermore, due to van’s relatively high centre of gravity and its load, vans may have less avoidance properties than a passenger car. Also (in addition) the differences of braking and dynamic properties between passenger cars and light commercial vehicles have been studied. Neither through literature review nor through own tests, the widespread opinion that van...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{simulations}} {{of the origin}} of the Moon have, until recently, centred on impact, about 100 M. yr after the origin of the solar system, of a Mars-like body (10 – 20 % Earth mass) on a near fully-accreted protoEarth. Although this model provides an explanation of the distribution of mass and moment of inertia of the Earth–Moon system it has recently been found that modification of the initial conditions greatly expands the range of <b>permissible</b> impactor <b>masses.</b> Here we take an alternative approach and consider how the oxidation state and mass of the impactor affect the chemical compositions of the product Earth and Moon. We apply the constraints that silicate Moon is richer in FeO than silicate Earth (9 – 13 % as opposed to 8. 05 %), that their Hf/W ratios are both ∼ 25 and that they are virtually identical in isotopes of O, Ti, Si, Ni, Cr and W. We then grow protoEarth using a standard accretionary model which yields the correct mantle abundances of Ni, Co, W, Mo, Nb, V and Cr, and add to this body different masses of impactor. The impactor is assumed to be either highly oxidised (∼ 18 % FeO), highly reduced (∼ 0. 3 % FeO) or undifferentiated and chondritic. In order to satisfy the isotopic constraints silicate Moon is assumed to be derived principally from silicate protoEarth. We find that an oxidised or chondritic impactor of ∼ 0. 15 ME can satisfy the isotopic constraints (most importantly ε 182 W), FeO contents and Nb/Ta of Earth and Moon, but leads to implausibly low Hf/W of ∼ 12 – 16 in silicate Earth and ∼ 4 – 6 in silicate Moon. This is because the Moon requires more impactor mantle, with low Hf/W, than Earth to reach its higher FeO content. In contrast, impact of a similar mass (10 – 20 % ME) of highly reduced, Mercury-like impactor on an oxidised protoEarth (∼ 10. 7 % FeO in mantle) satisfies the isotopic constraints, FeO contents, Nb/Ta and Hf/W of silicate Earth and Moon given a small amount of post-impact re-equilibration of terrestrial mantle with impactor core. The presence of a small S-rich lunar core is consistent with this reduced impactor scenario. We conclude that the geochemical properties of Earth and Moon strongly favour a reduced impactor of 10 – 20 % ME. </p...|$|R
