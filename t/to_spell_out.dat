5|$|In November 1989, IBM {{scientists}} {{demonstrated a}} technology capable of manipulating individual atoms. The program, called IBM in atoms, used a {{scanning tunneling microscope}} to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of nickel <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> the three letter company initialism. It {{was the first time}} atoms had been precisely positioned on a flat surface.|$|E

The Discovery Channel scheduled a special tribute episode of Storm Chasers titled Mile Wide Tornado: Oklahoma Disaster on June5, both honoring the three chasers and covering the events of the EF5-rated tornado that struck Moore and portions of southern Oklahoma City eleven days earlier on May20. The November 2013 issue of National Geographic, for its featured cover story, paid tribute to Tim Samaras, a National Geographic Explorer funded in part by the Society, and featured a detailed scientific analysis of the tornado itself.|$|E
5|$|Taft's ruling had {{no bearing}} on the cases of Governor Taylor and Lieutenant Governor Marshall except <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> a means {{for them to take}} their cases to the federal courts, if necessary. On the same day that Taft's ruling was issued, Taylor filed suit in Jefferson County circuit court against Beckham and Adjutant General John Breckinridge Castleman to prevent them from exercising any {{authority}} due the offices they claimed. Unaware of Taylor's suit, Beckham filed suit against Taylor for possession of the capitol and executive building in Franklin County circuit court â€“ a court believed to be favorable to the Democratic cause. Marshall also filed suit against Beckham and state senator L. H. Carter to prevent them from exercising any authority in the state senate, where the lieutenant governor was the presiding officer.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} bring {{together}} the cognitive neuroscientific discovery of mirror system and the philosophical account of pretense within a unique theoretical framework of mental simulation, Goldman distinguishes two types of mindreading, respectively, based on low-level and high-level simulation.

25|$|The Court {{said that}} the {{statutory}} language incorporates all the refinements associated with the language, is a shorthand description of the worker's legal rights. The Court explained that if the petitioner's logic was used, {{there would be no}} stopping point because all contracts would have <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> every intricacy of every term in the contract. Contracts would thus become massive, and yet there would be no real benefit from the increase in mass. The Court decided that it was perfectly reasonable for the union to use terms of art in a contract.|$|E

The Talmud insists that a mamzer should be considered as an ordinary relative for the purpose of inheritance, including levirate marriage. Maimonides and Joseph ben Ephraim Karo see fit to repeat this, and confirm that a mamzer can serve as a judge. Similarly a tosafa insists that it is permissible for a mamzer to become a king.|$|E

Finally, on December 27, President Corazon Aquino, who fought to delay the pullout to cushion the country's battered economy, issued a formal notice for the U.S. to leave {{what has been the}} U.S.'s largest overseas defense facility after Clark Air Base was closed, by the end of 1992.|$|E
25|$|The many {{windows on}} the capitol building's tower are used for several ongoing {{tradition}}s.

25|$|In January 2013, Mary Parent {{joined the}} project as a {{producer}} for Disruption Entertainment. and producers Dan Lin, Roy Lee and Doug Davison were dismissed from the project. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the producers left over creative and financial differences with Legendary Pictures, and Legendary was buying out their producer contracts, a move which led to court. On January 9, Legendary Pictures filed a 'Complaint for Declaratory Relief' lawsuit against Lin, Lee and Davison in California State Court <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> any fees owed to the individuals, who had {{signed an agreement with}} Legendary and were working with Legendary on the film's development. According to the complaint, Legendary had decided in the fall of 2012 to not employ the three as producers on the film and the three were not eligible for any producer fees. The three filed a counter-claim, that the agreement cited by Legendary was not in force and that the original working agreement was breached by Legendary. The three argued that the suit should be decided in open court, not in arbitration, and that Legendary should be responsible for damages for breach of contract. At court, the judge dismissed the arbitration and ordered mediation followed by jury trial if necessary. Legendary appealed the decision and lost the appeal in March 2014, leaving the case in California Superior Court for trial. In June 2015, {{on the eve of the}} trial, the parties came to a settlement, terms of which were not disclosed.|$|E

50|$|Suzhou numerals {{were used}} as {{shorthand}} in number-intensive areas of commerce such as accounting and bookkeeping. At the same time, standard Chinese numerals were used in formal writing, akin <b>to</b> <b>spelling</b> <b>out</b> the numbers in English. Suzhou numerals were once popular in Chinese marketplaces, {{such as those in}} Hong Kong along with local transportation before the 1990s, but they have gradually been supplanted by Arabic numerals. This is similar to what had happened in Europe with Roman numerals used in ancient and medieval Europe for mathematics and commerce. Nowadays, the Suzhou numeral system is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.|$|R

500|$|On November 6, 1928, an {{electronic}} news ticker {{known as the}} Motograph News Bulletin (colloquially known as the [...] "zipper") was introduced near {{the base of the}} building. The zipper originally consisted of 14,800 light bulbs, with the display controlled by a chain conveyor system inside the building; individual letter elements (a form of movable type) were loaded into frames <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> news headlines. As the frames moved along the conveyor, the letters themselves triggered electrical contacts which lit the external bulbs (the zipper has since been upgraded to use modern LED technology). The first headline displayed on the zipper announced Herbert Hoover's victory in that day's presidential election. The zipper was used to display other major news headlines of the era, and its content later expanded to include sports and weather updates as well. On the evening of August 14, 1945, the zipper was famously used to announce Japan's surrender from World War II to a packed crowd in Times Square.|$|E
