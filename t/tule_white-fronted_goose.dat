50|$|In {{addition}} to the fish habitat, the Chewaucan Marsh supports a diverse population of nesting ducks and sandhill cranes. It also has nesting colonies of white-faced ibis, great egrets, and snowy egrets. The area provides excellent migration staging habitat for double-crested cormorants, snow <b>geese,</b> <b>tule</b> <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese,</b> and black-crowned night-herons.|$|R
40|$|Since large, dark <b>tule</b> <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> (Anser albifrons gam belli Hartlaub) {{were first}} {{described}} in Texas {{over a century}} ago by Hartlaub (1852), and again 65 years later in California by Swarth and Bryant (1917), tule geese {{have been the subject}} of at least 14 studies in California and 8 attempts to locate summering birds in the Artic. Central questions of these efforts have been: Is the tule goose a distinct subspecies? What is their range and population size? How can the birds be identified? and What threatens their existence? The purpose of this paper is to present the current status of tule geese, including taxonomy, distribution, population size, and management challenges, and to provide management recommendations. Intensive work on tule geese in Calfornia by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service since 1978 and in Alaska by the Department of Fish and Game since 1979 has provided the basis for this paper...|$|R
50|$|The {{appearance}} of European or Russian <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese,</b> {{of the race}} albifrons and Greenland <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese,</b> of the race flavirostris, differ {{in a number of}} ways. The Greenland <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose,</b> in all plumages, looks darker and more 'oily-looking' than the European <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose,</b> both at rest and in flight.|$|R
50|$|Adult lesser <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese,</b> as well {{as being}} smaller than <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese,</b> have an obvious yellow eye-ring, and the white facial blaze goes up to the crown.|$|R
50|$|The upper wing-coverts {{are dark}} brown, {{as in the}} <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> (Anser albifrons) and the lesser <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> (A. erythropus), but differing from these in having narrow white fringes to the feathers.|$|R
50|$|Greater <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> are 64 - 81 cm in length, have a 130 - 165 cm {{wingspan}} {{and weigh}} 1.93 - 3.31 kg. They have bright orange legs and mouse-coloured upper wing-coverts. They {{are smaller than}} greylag geese. As well as being larger than the lesser <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose,</b> the greater <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> lacks the yellow eye-ring of that species, and the white facial blaze does not extend upwards so far as in lesser.|$|R

To provide information on the distribution and abundance of the two species in Greenland during the prelude to the autumn migration back to winter quarters, we here report on the first ever post-moult aerial surveys of West Greenland between 64 ° and 73 °N (from regular transects and transit reconnaissance flights in August 2007), which located 1888 Greenland <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> and 6071 Canada geese. Strip transect surveys found 733 Greenland <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> and 1318 Canada geese in the 993 km 2 surveyed, which, given a <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> global population of 23 200 in winter 2007 / 08, suggests more than 41 500 Canada geese in West Greenland post-moult in 2007.

5000|$|The lesser <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> (Anser erythropus) is a goose {{closely related}} to the larger <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> (A. albifrons). It breeds in northernmost Asia, but it is a scarce breeder in Europe. There is a re-introduction scheme in Fennoscandia. The {{scientific}} name comes from anser, the Latin for [...] "goose", and erythropus, [...] "red-footed", derived from the old Greek eruthros [...] "red" [...] and pous [...] "foot".|$|R
5000|$|The greater <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> (Anser albifrons) is {{a species}} of goose related to the smaller lesser <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> (A. erythropus). It is named for the patch of white {{feathers}} bordering the base of its bill, in fact albifrons comes from the Latin albus [...] "white" [...] and frons" [...] forehead [...] ". [...] In Europe it has been known as simply [...] "white-fronted goose"; in North America it {{is known as the}} greater <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> (or [...] "greater whitefront"), and this name is also increasingly adopted internationally. Even more distinctive are the salt-and-pepper markings on the breast of adult birds, which is why the goose is colloquially called the [...] "specklebelly" [...] in North America.|$|R
50|$|Where snow geese and Ross's geese breed together, as at La Pérouse, they {{hybridize}} at times, and hybrids are fertile. Rare hybrids {{with the}} greater <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose,</b> Canada goose, and cackling goose have been observed.|$|R

50|$|Weather {{conditions}} {{are a key}} factor in the annual breeding success of <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese.</b> In the Arctic, the window of opportunity for nesting, incubating eggs, and raising a brood to flight state is open briefly, for about three months. Arriving in late May or early June, <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> begin departing for fall staging areas in early September. This means that a delayed snowmelt or late spring storm can significantly reduce the birds' reproductive success.|$|R

50|$|Midcontinental <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> in North America {{have many}} {{breeding}} areas and each group in each breeding area differs in its migration time and wintering location. There are six breeding areas, including interior Alaska, the North Slope of Alaska, western Northwest Territories, western Nunavut, central Nunavut, and eastern Nunavut. These spatial differences lead to different departure times for <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> leaving their breeding areas. Birds from interior Alaska start migrating earlier during autumn and fly farther south to winter.|$|R
