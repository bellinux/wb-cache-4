40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework to assess the benefits and costs of intervening in a banking crisis. Intervention involves liquidity support and resolution actions. Principal benefits of intervention include avoiding panic and eliminating the economic costs of distorted incentives. Principal costs include fiscal costs and the economic costs of delay. The government’s main decision concerns {{the length of the}} resolution horizon—whether to adopt a deliberate or an aggressive resolution strategy. Dominant factors affecting net benefits are the relative size of the banking system and the loss liquidation rate on assets financed by bank loans.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} banks use {{accounting}} discretion to overstate {{the value of}} distressed assets. Banks'' balance sheets overvalue real estate-related assets compared to {{the market value of}} these assets, especially during the U. S. mortgage crisis. Share prices of banks with large exposure to mortgage-backed securities also react favorably to recent changes in accounting rules that relax fair-value accounting, and these banks provision less for bad loans. Furthermore, distressed banks use discretion in the classification of mortgage-backed securities to inflate their books. Our results indicate that banks'' balance sheets offer a distorted view of the financial health of the banks.

40|$|We {{study how}} investors {{account for the}} riskiness of banks'' risk-weighted assets (RWA) by {{examining}} the determinants of stock returns and market measures of risk. We find that banks with higher RWA had lower stock returns over the US and European crises. This relationship is weaker in Europe where banks can use Basel II internal risk models. For large banks, investors paid less attention to RWA and rewarded instead lower wholesale funding and better asset quality. RWA do not, in general, predict market measures of risk although {{there is evidence of}} a positive relationship before the US crisis which becomes negative afterwards.

40|$|The typical {{portrait}} of monetary policy has {{the banks and}} the money supply being manipulated through changes in bank reserves. However, with {{only a small portion}} of bank deposits now subject to reserve requirements, an alternative explanation of how monetary policy influences banks is needed. Over the last decade, capital requirements have effectively replaced reserve requirements as the main constraint on the behavior of banks. This paper explores the implications of Basel capital requirements for monetary policy. In particular, we identify a "bank balance-sheet channel" of monetary policy, which operates through the impact on the money stock and the economy.

We differentiate among {{various types of}} capital ratios: the Basel risk-adjusted ratio; the leverage ratio; the Tier I and Tier II ratios; and the tangible equity ratio. We find several results: (i) before the crisis, differences in capital {{did not have much}} impact on stock returns; (ii) during the crisis, a stronger capital position was associated with better stock market performance, most markedly for larger banks; (iii) the relationship between stock returns and capital is stronger when capital is measured by the leverage ratio rather than the risk-adjusted capital ratio; (iv) higher quality forms of capital, such as Tier 1 capital and tangible common equity, were more relevant.

40|$|The forward-looking {{framework}} expounded in {{this paper}} links a qualitative evaluation of system-wide vulnerability (covering macro, sectoral, institutional, and systemic liquidity issues) with a quantitative assessment of the financial condition of significant financial institutions. Based on vulnerability criteria and judgmental stress tests, twelve indicators of soundness (measuring risk exposure, solvency, liquidity, profitability, and supervisory assessment) are developed. This holistic methodology can be used not only as an early warning/crisis-avoidance system to identify potential systemic problems—and problem institutions—requiring immediate attention, but also to pinpoint needed reforms in the legal, regulatory, and institutional infrastructure that can lessen {{the likelihood of a}} future crisis.

This paper highlights the range of operational and strategic issues to be addressed and the institutional arrangements needed to foster an effective banking system restructuring and maximize the returns on government investment. The approaches to recapitalization have varied, with countries choosing different mixes of direct capital injections and asset purchase and rehabilitation. The choice of an appropriate mix is critical, to minimize the expected present value of government outlays net of recoveries.

40|$|Chinese banks {{generate}} large {{profits and}} have relatively low nonperforming loans. However, good financial performance does not, in itself, guarantee that banks efficiently intermediate the economy''s financial resources. This paper first examines how efficient Chinese banks are in financial intermediation, using the stochastic production frontier approach. Quality of loans are controlled for {{by focusing on}} net loans and correcting for nonperforming loans; Hong Kong SAR banks {{are included in the}} sample to have a more universally representative production frontier. The results suggest that Chinese banks indeed became more efficient during 2001 - 07. Nevertheless, a majority of banks remain quite inefficient, including several large state owned banks and many city banks. Large banks tend to hoard deposits and operate beyond the point of diminishing returns to scale, while smaller banks operate at increasing returns to scale. This suggests that reallocating deposits from large to smaller banks would increase overall efficiency. The paper finds no significant correlation between bank efficiency and profitability. Possible factors leading to large profits in the banking system, despite wide-spread inefficiencies, are low deposit interest rates, large interest margins, and high market concentration. Moving to indirect monetary policy and deepening capital markets to channel some of the savings to productive investment would help improve the efficiency of financial intermediation. This may spur loan growth, however, which will need to be handled with monetary policy and regulatory/supervisory tools.
