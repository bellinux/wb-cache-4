5|$|Many sponges shed Sponge spicules, {{forming a}} dense carpet several meters deep <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> away {{echinoderms}} which would otherwise prey on the sponges. They also produce toxins that prevent other sessile organisms such as bryozoans or sea squirts from growing {{on or near}} them, making sponges very effective competitors for living space.

5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler {{team has}} said that Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c are {{probably}} composed mostly of water with a thin hydrogen and helium atmosphere. In comparison to the outer planets of the system, which probably have large hydrogen and helium atmospheres, Kepler-11c's proximity to its star has blown off most of its atmosphere. Kepler-11 and its six-planet system form what NASA considers {{to be the most}} compact and flattest planetary system yet discovered. Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c orbit Kepler-11 with a phenomenon called orbital resonance, a gravitational tugging <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> their orbit stable at a 5.4 ratio.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is a {{naturally}} occurring element {{that can be}} found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements. The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.|$|E

5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|At {{the heart}} of the Combine's command {{structure}} in Half-Life 2 is the Citadel, an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky from ground level, and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth. The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.|$|E

5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E
5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E

5|$|The player's ship is {{protected}} by a shield which decreases when attacked by enemies. If the shield is fully depleted, the player dies and must start the game again from a previous section of the fight without any collected power-ups. Nevertheless, the player can reclaim the missing power-ups from {{the ruins of the}} destroyed ship. Shield, energy, and ammunition suppliers are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The player can also collect equipment items which grant special powers. For example, the Quad Laser modifies the laser weapons to fire four shots at once instead of the standard two, while the Cloaking Device renders the player invisible to enemies for 30 seconds. During the game, the player may also deploy the Guide-Bot, an assistant <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> track of the next objective and shows the player the way to a specific target.|$|E

His posture is well formed and suggests that the 6th century artist knew this asana. He sits on a lotus with a stalk shown as if coming out of the earth, his legs are crossed symmetrically. Two Nagas flank the lotus and express their reverence with a namaste posture. The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, yet there is a halo around him <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> them at bay, as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.|$|E
5|$|Garista, the {{strategist}} for the Niren Corps, attempts to dissuade Niren {{but to no}} avail. The investigation in the fortress {{turns out to be}} more dangerous as the aer begins to turn the fortress into a living weapon to attack the knights. The knights make their way {{into the center of the}} fortress, where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel, and causing the fortress to begin to crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him crumbles. Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable to pull himself to safety. Leaving his blastia with Yuri, Niren has the knights leave without him.|$|E

5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> the duct open. Removable plastic stents {{are used in}} {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E
5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E
