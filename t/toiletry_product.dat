40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the functional and symbolic attributes of product and brand selection that are of importance to 18 - 24 consumers across food and <b>toiletries</b> <b>products.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The investigation used both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The initial quantitative study (268 respondents) aimed to identify in order of importance (using ANOVA) the variables that drive purchase behaviour across the four product categories of soap, coffee, breakfast cereal and toothpaste. Findings – The study identified the key importance of sensory (e. g. taste, scent) attributes {{in the selection of}} the specific products studied. These sensory attributes may define the brand positioning of the products. Practical implications – This paper has implications for new product development. Originality/value – Identifies the functional and symbolic attributes of product and brand selection that are of importance to 18 - 24 consumers across food and <b>toiletries</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

50|$|Also, making many {{different}} products {{of a particular}} type—many with relatively small sales volume—added considerably to costs, hurting profitability. For example, in the early 1970s, the Shulton line had been enlarged to about two dozen brand names of men's <b>toiletry</b> <b>products,</b> without any appreciable product differentiation among the lines. Profits improved greatly when the minor products were discontinued and the company concentrated on the Old Spice brand. Similar improvements occurred when the acrylic fibers product group was cut from about 30 types and sizes of fibers to a single product which could be produced in great volume. Another example was that Cyanamid produced hundreds of different dyes, many in {{only one or two}} small batches a year; and profits improved when the number of dyes was cut in half.|$|R

5000|$|Larkin and Hubbard {{decided to}} market {{directly}} to consumers, and by 1885 had eliminated all middlemen, including their own salesmen. With the money saved on sales commissions, Larkin {{was able to}} offer better Premiums. In 1891, Larkin placed its first large wholesale order, $40,000 (...) worth of piano lamps. The next year it expanded into Morris Chairs worth $80,000 (...) and oak dining chairs worth $125,000 (...) [...] One {{of the most popular}} giveaways was the Chatauqua Desk. For a $10 order of soap, the customer would receive the soap and the desk, a $10 Premium. The idea grabbed the attention of the public, and through further refinement, Larkin began offering a variety of both products and Premiums. The [...] "Combination Box", advertised in the 1890s, offered enough soap and <b>toiletry</b> <b>products</b> to last an average family one year.|$|R

40|$|Synthetic musks in {{environmental}} samples: indicator compounds with relevant properties for environmental monitoring Synthetic musks (nitro and polycyclic musks) are {{a group of}} chemicals offering {{a wide range of}} important properties for environmental monitoring programs.

As such, they are directly applied in cosmetic products or in washed textiles to the human body in considerable concentrations and accumulate owing to dermal resorption. In addition, synthetic musks also enter the environment via waste water treatment. Several polycyclic musks are chiral. By using chiral gas chromatographic methods, it is possible to determine the enantiomeric ratio and assess their bioavailability. Although an comprehensive quality assurance program must be followed during the analysis of synthetic musks {{in environmental}} samples, the determination of these compounds is not very demanding and can be carried out by a standard analytical laboratory specialising in trace analysis of organic pollutants.
