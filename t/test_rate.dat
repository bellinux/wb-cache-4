However, difficulty in detecting infection in early stages impairs those benefits. We determined the minimum <b>testing</b> <b>rate</b> that maximizes benefits derived from early diagnosis. We developed a mathematical model of HIV infection, diagnosis and treatment that allows studying both diagnosed and undiagnosed populations, as well as determining the impact of modifying time to diagnosis and <b>testing</b> <b>rates.</b> The model's external consistency was assessed by estimating time to AIDS and death in absence of treatment {{as well as by}} estimating age-dependent mortality rates during treatment, and comparing them with data previously reported from CASCADE and DHCS cohorts. In our model, life expectancy of patients diagnosed before 8 years post infection is the same as HIV-negative population. After this time point, age at death is significantly dependent on diagnosis delay but {{initiation of}} treatment increases life expectancy to similar levels as HIV-negative population. Early mortality during HAART is dependent on treatment CD 4 threshold until 6 years post infection and becomes dependent on diagnosis delay after 6 years post infection.

Tubes of various geometries and manufactured from either continuous filament random mat (CoFRM) or glass braid and polyester resin were subjected to various types of damage before testing. Damage types consisted of drilled holes, to simulate the use of drilling components for the need of assembly, impacts, to simulate damage that may occur through tool drops or items being kicked up during use and PET inserts to simulate delamination. Large glass CoFRM/polyester tubes with an outer diameter of 89. 1 mm and varying wall thicknesses were crushed quasi-statically at a speed of 5 mmlmin. Small CoFRM and braided glass/polyester tubes with an outer diameter of 38. 1 mm and a 2 mm wall thickness were tested quasi statically and dynamically at a speed of 5 m 1 s. Tubes were tested undamaged and containing various sizes of holes, simulated delamination and impacts. Specific energy absorptions (SEA) and failure modes were compared. Threshold values of damage size have been found for each tube and test type, above which unstable failures and subsequent unpredictable reductions in energy absorptions occur. The small CoFRM tubes showed a decrease in SEA as the <b>test</b> <b>rate</b> increased and this was attributed to the rate dependency of the resin, causing greater fragmentation allowing fibres to bend more easily and without fracturing. The braided small tubes showed an increase in SEA as the <b>test</b> <b>rate</b> increased due {{to a change in}} the mode of failure attributed to a higher compressive strength at the increased rate. Relatively small hole sizes and impacts, of 5 mm and 1. 5 J- 3 J, were seen to reduce the energy absorption of the materials tested at quasi-static test speeds.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{determination of}} inert strength {{is important in}} reliable life prediction of structural ceramic components. At ambient temperature, the inert strength of a brittle material is typically regarded as free {{of the effects of}} slow crack growth due to stress corrosion. Therefore, the inert strength can be determined either by eliminating active species, especially moisture, with an appropriate inert medium, or by using a very high <b>test</b> <b>rate.</b> However, at elevated temperatures, the concept or definition of the inert strength of brittle ceramic materials is not clear, since temperature itself is a degrading environment, resulting in strength degradation through slow crack growth and/or creep. Since the mechanism to control strength is rate-dependent viscous flow, the only conceivable way to determine the inert strength at elevated temperatures is to utilize a very fast <b>test</b> <b>rate</b> that either minimizes the time for or eliminates slow crack growth. Few experimental studies have measured the elevated-temperature, inert (or "ultra"-fast fracture) strength of advanced ceramics. At the NASA Lewis Research Center, an experimental study was initiated to better understand the "ultra"-fast fracture strength behavior of advanced ceramics at elevated temperatures. Fourteen advanced ceramics - one alumina, eleven silicon nitrides, and two silicon carbides - have been tested using constant stress-rate (dynamic fatigue) testing in flexure with a series of stress rates including the "ultra"-fast stress rate of 33 000 MPa/sec with digitally controlled test frames. The results for these 14 advanced ceramics indicate that, notwithstanding possible changes in flaw populations as well as flaw configurations because of elevated temperatures, the strength at 33 000 MPa/sec approached the room-temperature strength or reached a higher value than that determined at the conventional <b>test</b> <b>rate</b> of 30 MPa/sec. On the basis of the experimental data, it can be stated that the elevated-temperature, inert strength of an advanced ceramic material can be defined as the strength where no slow crack growth takes place at the temperature...|$|E

No patients clinically had Prinzmetal's variant angina. Overall, 4 % had a positive ergonovine test result, defined by spasm causing ≥ 75 % focal stenosis. Complications related to ergonovine use occurred in 11 patients (0. 03 %). In a training sample of 1, 136 patients (studied between 1980 and 1984), two independent predictors of spasm were found by using multivariate analysis: the amount of visible coronary artery disease {{on the coronary angiogram}} (p < 0. 0001) and a smoking history (p = 0. 001). A model to predict spasm based on these variables was validated in a test group of 2, 311 patients who received ergonovine from 1985 to 1989. This model allowed the identification of a subset of 480 patients in the validation sample who had a 10 % positive <b>test</b> <b>rate</b> compared with a 2 % positive <b>test</b> <b>rate</b> in the remaining patients.

Various carbon-fibre reinforced-polymer (CFRP) matrix composite substrates have been bonded using two different types of automotive structural epoxy-adhesives. They have been tested via loading the bonded joints in mode I (tensile), mode II (in-plane shear) and mixed-mode I/II from slow rates (i. e. of about 10 - 5 m/s) up to relatively high rates of test of about 15 m/s. The high-rate tests were photographed using a high-speed digital video camera to record the deformation of the joint and the fracture behaviour. An analysis strategy has been developed for the various modes of loading (i) to account for the observed fracture behaviour, (ii) to circumvent the problems posed by oscillations in the load traces due to the presence of dynamic effects in the faster tests, and (iii) to account for the kinetic energy associated with the moving specimen arms in the faster tests.

Out of 26, 367 adult OPD attendees in phase 1, 4. 7 % were tested and out of 29, 864 attendees in phase 3, 17. 0 % were tested (p[*] <[*] 0. 001). The proportion of HIV cases diagnosed was 0. 25 % (67 / 26, 367) in phase 1 and 0. 46 % (136 / 29864) in phase 3 (p[*] <[*] 0. 001). In multivariable analysis, both <b>testing</b> <b>rate</b> and case finding were significantly higher in phase 3 for OPD attendees. In phase 1 most of the HIV testing was done in VCT departments rather than at the OPD (78. 6 % vs 21. 4 % respectively); in phase 3 this was reversed (40. 0 % vs 60. 0 %; p[*] <[*] 0. 001). In a combined analysis of VCT and OPD attendees, <b>testing</b> <b>rate</b> increased from 18. 7 % in phase 1 to 25. 4 % in phase 3, but case finding did not increase. In multivariable analysis, <b>testing</b> <b>rate</b> was significantly higher in phase 3 (OR 1. 67; 95 % CI 1. 60 - 1. 73), but case finding remained stable (OR 1. 09; 95 % CI 0. 93 - 1. 27). PITC led to a shift of HIV testing from VCT department to the OPD, a higher <b>testing</b> <b>rate,</b> but no additional HIV case findin...|$|R

Sulfentrazone confirmed the initial screening <b>test</b> <b>rate</b> range of 0. 05 to 0. 1 lb AI/A for demonstrating marginal lettuce safety. Flumetsulam and thifensulfuron showed greater selectivity only in head lettuce while severely injuring romaine and red leaf lettuce. Rimsulfuron caused considerable stand reduction of all three lettuce cultivars. Sulfentrazone, fluroxypyr, and thifensulfuron exhibited good tolerance on broccoli as no stunting or stand reduction was observed at maturity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Short latency {{somatosensory}} {{evoked potential}} (SSEP) (N 20) is a good predictor of poor outcome in postanoxic coma. It {{has been suggested that}} the long latency response (N 70) may increase the sensitivity of SSEPs for predicting poor outcome. METHODS: As part of a prospective cohort study in 407 adult patients unconscious 24 hours after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), N 20 was recorded 24, 48, and 72 hours after CPR, and N 70 was recorded at least once in 319 patients. Poor outcome was defined as death or persistent vegetative state 1 month after CPR. RESULTS: Absent N 20 had a 0 % false positive <b>test</b> <b>rate</b> at all time intervals, with prevalence of poor test result varying from 37 to 48 %. Addition of abnormal N 70 (absent or delayed > 130 msec) with present N 20 as poor test result added 21 to 28 % to this prevalence, but at the cost of a false positive <b>test</b> <b>rate</b> of 4 to 15 %. Good outcome could not be predicted reliably with either of the tests, as only 28 % of patients with normal N 20 and N 70 had a good outcome. CONCLUSION: Determination of presence or absence of the N 70 in patients with postanoxic coma gives additional information about the likelihood of poor outcome, but it is not precise enough to base treatment decisions solely on its absenc...|$|E
40|$|Background: In HIV infection, {{initiation}} of treatment {{is associated with}} improved clinical outcom and reduced rate of sexual transmission. However, difficulty in detecting infection in early stages impairs those benefits. We determined the minimum <b>testing</b> <b>rate</b> that maximizes benefits derived from early diagnosis. Methods: We developed a mathematical model of HIV infection, diagnosis and treatment that allows studying both diagnosed and undiagnosed populations, as well as determining the impact of modifying time to diagnosis and <b>testing</b> <b>rates.</b> The model’s external consistency was assessed by estimating time to AIDS and death in absence of treatment {{as well as by}} estimating age-dependent mortality rates during treatment, and comparing them with data previously reported from CASCADE and DHCS cohorts. Results: In our model, life expectancy of patients diagnosed before 8 years post infection is the same as HIV-negative population. After this time point, age at death is significantly dependent on diagnosis delay but {{initiation of}} treatment increases life expectancy to similar levels as HIV-negative population. Early mortality during HAART is dependent on treatment CD 4 threshold until 6 years post infection and becomes dependent on diagnosis delay after 6 years post infection. By modifying <b>testing</b> <b>rates,</b> we estimate that an annual <b>testing</b> <b>rate</b> of 20 % leads to diagnosis of 90 % of infected individuals within the first 8. 2 years of infection and that current <b>testing</b> <b>rate</b> in middle-high income settings stands close t...|$|R

40|$|PLANET) is a {{peer-to-peer}} in-person 1 -hr {{lead poisoning}} prevention educa-tional program for health professionals. This evaluation {{was designed to}} determine {{the impact of the}} PLANET program. Evaluation methods included analyzing data from PLANET sign-in sheets, evaluation forms, pre/post-knowledge tests, claims data, and focus groups (FGs) and interviews (IVs) with PLANET attendees and nonattendees. Claims data were used to com-pare blood lead <b>testing</b> <b>rates</b> for physicians attending and those not attending a PLANET program. Over 2, 000 health professionals attended the 192 PLANET presentations delivered between June 2001 and December 2006; most were registered nurses or physicians. Written evaluations were overwhelmingly positive. Posttests indicated increased provider knowledge about childhood lead poisoning prevention, and assessment of blood lead <b>testing</b> <b>rates</b> showed higher <b>testing</b> <b>rates</b> for PLANET attendees.
