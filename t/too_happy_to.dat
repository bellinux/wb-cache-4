5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, Courtney {{was part of}} a {{movement}} within the UDA that became frustrated with the directions being taken by the UDA leadership. He argued that too little was being done by the movement in terms of killing republicans as the leaders were <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> sit back and become rich from extortion and racketeering. Courtney was soon involved in conspiracies to overthrow the UDA leadership. These however came to nothing as the fallout from the Stevens Inquiries saw the existing leadership swept aside. For his part, Courtney would go on {{to become part of the}} new leadership that emerged in the 1990s around Johnny Adair.|$|E
25|$|Dwarkanath Ganguly {{was born}} on the Bengali New Year's Day, 1st Baisakh (mid-April), 1845 at Magurkhanda village in Bikrampur, now in Bangladesh. At the time of Ganguly's birth, his father, Krishnapran Ganguli lived in Faridpur in {{connection}} with some family work. His mother hailed from a rich family. Once {{she wanted to go}} on a pilgrimage to Puri. In those days, one had to use boats and elephants for transport. Her parent's family would have been <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> support her financially for that but she was too upright a person to accept such support. Instead, she covered the long distance for the pilgrimage on foot. This incident portrays the strong will power of Ganguly's mother. The same would be apparent in his life later.|$|E

Angie and Den continue to row constantly and in a bid for revenge, Angie vows to take Den 'to the cleaners' for her divorce settlement. In retaliation, Den installs his mistress, Jan, as the new landlady of The Queen Vic, which only infuriates Angie even more. However, Den and Jan's cohabitation eventually leads {{to the end of}} their relationship, when Den decides that Jan is too posh for him, and so by the summer of that year orders her to leave.|$|E

In a deleted scene from It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, Kermit reveals that J.P. has died and left the theatre to the Muppets in his will. This would have taken place some time after 1996, as J.P. can be seen (and {{referred}} to as such {{by the head of}} the KMUP network) in episode 107 of Muppets Tonight, the 1990s reworking of The Muppet Show. The Muppet Theater is shown to be in New York City as Rachel Bitterman plots to tear down the Muppet Theater and build a club. She is thwarted when Pepe the King Prawn manages to get the Muppet Theater to be made into a national landmark.|$|E
25|$|Minuit and {{his family}} joined the Dutch West India Company, {{probably}} in the mid 1620s, and was sent to New Netherland in 1625 to search for tradable goods other than the animal pelts which were then the major product coming from New Netherland. He returned in the same year, and in 1626 was appointed the new director of New Netherland, taking over from Willem Verhulst. He sailed to North America and arrived in the colony on May 4, 1626. Minuit is credited with purchasing the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans in exchange for traded goods valued at 60 guilders. According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley, Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys, chief of the Canarsees, who were only <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was actually mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks.|$|E

25|$|These Dzungars, {{who were}} Buddhist, had {{supported}} the Fifth Dalai Lama and his regent. They were secretly petitioned by the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to invade with their {{help in order}} to rid them of their foreign ruler Lhazang Khan and to replace the unpopular Sixth Dalai Lama pretender with the young Kelzang Gyats]. This plot suited the devious Dzungar leaders' ambitions and they were only <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> oblige. Early in 1717, after conspiring to undermine Lhazang Khan through treachery they entered Tibet from the northwest with a large army, sending a smaller force to Kumbum to collect Kelzang Gyatso and escort him to Lhasa. By {{the end of the}} year, with Tibetan connivance they had captured Lhasa, killed Lhazang and all his family and deposed Yeshe Gyatso. Their force sent to fetch Kelzang Gyatso however was intercepted and destroyed by Qing armies alerted by Lhazang. In Lhasa, the unruly Dzungar not only failed to produce the boy but also went on the rampage, looting and destroying the holy places, abusing the populace, killing hundreds of Nyingma monks, causing chaos and bloodshed and turning their Tibetan allies against them. The Tibetans were soon appealing to the Kangxi Emperor to rid them of the Dzungars.|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson's {{best teams}} {{came during the}} first eleven years of his tenure. In that time, he {{recorded}} winning streaks of 31 and 47games and went 114–10–3, a winning percentage of 90.9%. Wilkinson left Oklahoma after the 1963 season {{with a record of}} 145–29–4, 14 conference titles and 123 straight games without being shut out. During Wilkinson's tenure, another first would be recorded. Prentice Gautt would become the first black football player at the University of Oklahoma. Gautt had been a superior student at his Oklahoma City high school. He {{was a member of the}} National Honor Society and president of his senior class. During his junior and senior years of high school, he helped his team amass a 31-game win streak. He was also the first black player to participate in the Oklahoma state all-star game. Because of Gautt's academic success in high school, he was supported financially by a group of local black doctors and pharmacists. A couple months into his freshman year, Gautt was placed on athletic scholarship and the money was returned to the investors. Unfortunately, some members of Gautt's team were not <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> play with him. One player even left Oklahoma because he refused to play with an African American. However, most of the team had his support. After a freshman game in Tulsa, Gautt was refused service in the restaurant where the team was scheduled to eat. His teammates abruptly left and found an eating establishment that would also serve him. As a player, Gautt broke out in 1958. In 1959, he was named the Orange Bowl MVP. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1985.|$|E
500|$|Campling {{and other}} critics have commented {{that one of the}} main {{features}} of the show is the ability of the locals to laugh at themselves and their eccentricities. Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability to laugh at itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to a place and insulting it takes guts and careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – whatever he was about to say about Dartford – it was better than his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, I hope, we laugh at ourselves.

500|$|Media {{and public}} opinion was more hostile. The Sydney Morning Herald ran the {{headline}} [...] "Baggy Green Shame" [...] while The Australian wrote of the [...] "$11,000 price of disgrace". Many newspaper columns and {{letters to the editor}} attacked the players. The editorial of The Australian stated that [...] "Waugh and Warne said yesterday they had been naïve and stupid. Put the emphasis on the second adjective—and add greedy." [...] Readers called for the players to be banned from playing for Australia as well as the sacking of the ACB officials who had kept the matter secret; some said that the players should never be appointed to leadership roles in the cricket community. In the Weekend Australian of 12 December, Warwick Hadfield and Brian Woodley editorialised that [...] "Warne is in need of some good advice, but not from business managers and PR folk <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> tell him how wonderful he is in order to flog a few more videos, books, pairs of duds, sports shoes or anti-smoking ads". Warne's major sponsors reviewed their partnerships with him, and three newspapers, the Daily Mirror of the United Kingdom, The Age of Melbourne and the Sydney Morning Herald severed their ties with him.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout much of {{the rest}} of the play, Salieri masquerades as Mozart's ally to his face while doing his utmost to destroy his {{reputation}} and any success his compositions may have. On more than one occasion it is only the direct intervention of the Emperor himself that allows Mozart to continue (interventions which Salieri opposes, and then is all <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> take credit for when Mozart assumes it was he who intervened). Salieri also humiliates Mozart's wife when she comes to Salieri for aid, and smears Mozart's character with the Emperor and the court. A major theme in Amadeus is Mozart's repeated attempts to win over the aristocratic [...] "public" [...] with increasingly brilliant compositions, which are always frustrated either by Salieri or by the aristocracy's own inability to appreciate Mozart's genius.|$|E

Around 3,000fans attended the concert in London, which was streamed over the internet. More than nine million people watched the concert according to Nicky Price, a representative for Microsoft's MSN, the webcast's producer. It became the most-viewed webcast of all time, beating Paul McCartney's performance of [...] "50s rock and roll classics" [...] at Liverpool's The Cavern Club in December 1999, which was viewed by an audience of about three million.|$|E
2500|$|Letterman had {{initially}} wanted O'Brien {{to be in}} the promo as well, but he turned it down: [...] "No fucking way I'm doing that. It's not a joke to me—it's real." [...] O'Brien was sure his agreement prohibited television appearances for several months, but gathered NBC would be only <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> allow him a one-time reprieve for the ad, as it was to improve Leno's image. O'Brien, by this point, was planning a live tour with his staff that would take him on the road, and had also created a Twitter account, which flourished (NBC closely monitored the account for anti-Leno sentiments). After about one hour online, O'Brien's number of Twitter followers had rocketed past the 30,000 followers of the official Jay Leno account, and he held over 300,000 followers in under 24 hours; he surpassed the one million mark in May 2010. Many speculated that O'Brien would sign a deal with Fox for a late-night program; Comedy Central and HBO had also expressed interest in O'Brien. Fox's deal moved slowly and they eventually withdrew their offer due to station resistance, the daunting financial investment and opposition from Roger Ailes.|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{the script and}} starting work on casting and production, Madonna realised that the budget of film {{was going to be}} high. Simpson's character had around 80costume changes with dresses by designers like Balenciaga, Christian Dior, Madeleine Vionnet and Elsa Schiaparelli. Most of the actual dresses were kept in museum archives, hence unobtainable to Madonna. Instead, many of the couture houses offered to create the dresses for her. While casting for the film, she asked for a Michael O'Connor wedding dress, in display at the National Museum of Costume in Scotland, for a scene where Riseborough would wear it. National Museum of Costume general manager Margaret Roberts said they were happy to send the dress to Madonna. [...] "Our Marriage in the Movies exhibition is packed with fabulous gowns that tell a story not only {{about the history of the}} period they represent, but also of Hollywood glamour and style," [...] she said. [...] This is a dress that was made for the movies, so when we received the request from Madonna's production company, we were only <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> oblige."
