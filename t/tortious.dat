5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for <b>tortious</b> behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E
25|$|Marriott counter-sued JBG Cos. on January 14, 2010, accusing JBG Cos. of <b>tortious</b> {{interference}} in its contractual relations. In support of its claim, Marriott {{told the court}} that JBG Cos. officials had threatened Marriott with a convention center lawsuit {{if it did not}} renegotiate its Wardman Park deal. The lawsuit significantly delayed financing of the project. No bonds were issued by mid-January 2010, and there were signs that ING Clarion might back out of the project if additional delays occurred. In an attempt to break the deadlock, Council member Jack Evans (a former real estate attorney) tried to mediate the dispute. On January 21, WCSA filed suit against JBG Cos. for <b>tortious</b> interference as well. The city followed suit with yet another <b>tortious</b> interference claim on February 18.|$|E
25|$|A {{successful}} defense absolves {{the defendant}} from full or partial liability for damages. Apart from proof {{that there was}} no breach of duty, there are three principal defenses to <b>tortious</b> liability.|$|E
25|$|A tort, {{in common}} law jurisdictions, {{is a civil}} wrong that causes someone else to suffer loss or harm {{resulting}} in legal liability {{for the person who}} commits the <b>tortious</b> act.|$|E
25|$|A {{verdict of}} Trondheim District Court in 2006 {{resulted}} in Norway's government being {{ordered to pay}} compensation for <b>tortious</b> injury that Knut Braa acquired as a UNIFIL soldier — Norwegian kroner 1 215 374.|$|E
25|$|On June 4, 2007, Al Jourgensen filed a <b>Tortious</b> Interference {{lawsuit against}} ex-bassist Paul Barker and Spurburn Music in Los Angeles Superior Court. (case #SC094122) The case was {{dismissed}} on October 24, 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{multiplier}} {{principle is}} encapsulated in a statutory form for <b>tortious</b> cases involving personal injuries caused by motor vehicles, under the Motor Vehicle Act. However, in so calculating, {{the court will}} take into account inflation in calculating damages.|$|E
25|$|In another formulation, it {{has been}} stated that one {{claiming}} conversion must show a <b>tortious</b> conversion of the chattel, a right to property in it, and a right to immediate possession which is absolute, unconditional, and not dependent upon the performance of some act.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the court did}} not {{consider}} Quanta to have foreclosed the enforcement of the shrinkwrap restrictions under state contract law. The contract law aspects of the case became moot, however, because Lexmark voluntarily dismissed its claims based on Static Control's <b>tortious</b> interference with contract.|$|E
25|$|In January 2016, a $1.5M {{lawsuit was}} filed against Uber in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Sergei Lemberg {{on behalf of}} a Philadelphia taxicab {{medallion}} owners. The suit claimed that Uber engaged in <b>tortious</b> interference with a prospective business advantage and engaged in false advertising under the Lanham Act. The case was dismissed in August 2016.|$|E
25|$|Finding a {{successful}} defence absolves the defendant from full or partial liability for damages, {{which makes them}} valuable commodities in the court. There are three main defences to <b>tortious</b> liability; to argue the claimant voluntarily undertook the risk of his harm, that he contributed to the harm, or that he engaged in illegal activity.|$|E
25|$|In mid-September, the SEC {{accepted}} Texas A as its thirteenth member, conditional upon a reaffirmation {{that the}} Big 12 would not pursue legal action. The SEC later {{reported that they}} had been assured that the Big 12 would waive its rights to legal action. However, Baylor rejected that they had waived their school's rights to pursue legal action for <b>tortious</b> interference. Several other Big 12 schools adopted Baylor's position.|$|E
25|$|Third, {{some critics}} allege {{that the legal}} {{strategies}} of comprehensive campaigns leave workers, unions and elected labor leaders open to legal retaliation. Increasingly, they point out, workers and unions are being sued for libel, slander, <b>tortious</b> business interference {{and a variety of}} other state and federal claims which carry heavy fines. Even labor scholars who have spoken publicly about employer misbehavior have been sued. A more conservative organizing approach would be less litigious and less costly.|$|E
25|$|The main remedy against <b>tortious</b> loss is {{compensation}} in 'damages' or money. In {{a limited}} range of cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser. This is a defence against the tort of battery. Further, {{in the case of}} a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction. This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm.|$|E
25|$|Richard J. Cardamone {{wrote for}} a panel that {{followed}} Mitsbushis analysis: first holding the arbitration clause valid, then inquiring into whether the claims came under its scope. Since, as the Mitsubishi majority had found, the alleged bad acts {{arose from the}} activities covered by the contract, all save the RICO and <b>tortious</b> interference claims were arbitrable. It told the district court to stay even the RICO claims, however, pending the outcome of McMahon at the Supreme Court (which ruled them arbitrable).|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, Checker Cab Philadelphia and 44 other taxi {{companies}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania {{filed a lawsuit}} alleging that Uber was operating illegally in the city. On March 3, 2015, U.S. District Judge Nitza I. Quinones Alejandro denied a motion for a preliminary injunction against Uber. In January 2016, a $1.5M lawsuit was filed against Uber in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Sergei Lemberg on behalf of Philadelphia taxicab medallion owners. The suit claimed that Uber engaged in <b>tortious</b> interference with a prospective business advantage and engaged in false advertising under the Lanham Act. The case was dismissed in August 2016.|$|E
25|$|The Second Circuit was {{the first}} lower court to apply Mitsubishi in 1986 when it heard Genesco, Inc. v. T. Kakiuchi & Co., Ltd., a case with many similarities. Genesco, a {{clothing}} manufacturer, had brought antitrust claims against both its American supplier of fabric and its eponymous Japanese parent company, alleging they and one of Genesco's employees conspired to destroy it by consistently selling it overpriced and/or low-quality material in violation of RICO and the Robinson–Patman Act, along with <b>tortious</b> interference and fraud claims. The two defendants sought arbitration before the JCAA per their contracts. After the district court stayed the fraud and RICO claims against the American subsidiary, both it and the parent company appealed.|$|E
25|$|Following Roman law, the English {{system has}} long been based on a closed system of {{nominate}} torts, such as trespass, battery and conversion. This {{is in contrast to}} continental legal systems, which have since adopted more open systems of <b>tortious</b> liability. There are various categories of tort, which lead back to the system of separate causes of action. The tort of negligence is however increasing in importance over other types of tort, providing a wide scope of protection, especially since Donoghue v Stevenson. For liability under negligence a duty of care must be established owed to a group of persons to which the victim belongs, a nebulous concept into which many other categories are being pulled.|$|E
25|$|The main remedy against <b>tortious</b> loss is {{compensation}} {{in damages}} or money. In a {{limited range of}} cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser. This is a defense against the tort of battery. Further, {{in the case of}} a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction, such as in the English case Miller v Jackson (1977). This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm. Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors, but some Australian jurisdictions can make an order for specific performance to ensure that the defendant carries out their legal obligations, especially in relation to nuisance matters.|$|E
25|$|The {{merits of}} plaintiffs' claims pose {{important}} questions {{relating to the}} propriety of actions undertaken by our highest government officials. Defendants' motions, however, raise issues that the Court is obliged to address before it can consider the merits of plaintiffs' claims. As it turns out, the Court will not reach, and therefore expresses no views on, {{the merits of the}} constitutional and other tort claims asserted by plaintiffs based on defendants' alleged disclosures because the motions to dismiss will be granted...The alleged means by which defendants chose to rebut Mr. Wilson's comments and attack his credibility may have been highly unsavory. But there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism, such as that levied by Mr. Wilson against the Bush Administration's handling of prewar foreign intelligence, by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants' duties as high-level Executive Branch officials. Thus, the alleged <b>tortious</b> conduct, namely the disclosure of Mrs. Wilson's status as a covert operative, was incidental to the kind of conduct that defendants were employed to perform.|$|E
25|$|Early English {{common law}} had, in many instances, imposed {{liability}} {{on those who}} had caused harm regardless of wrongful intent or negligence. Trespass was considered a remedy for all <b>tortious</b> wrongs, and sometimes used as a synonym for torts generally. Over the centuries, however, judges focused more on the intent and negligence behind the actions than {{the nature of the}} actions themselves, leading to the development of negligence and nuisance and the further development of trespass. At the time of Rylands, the previous case relied upon was Vaughan v Menlove, decided in the Court of Common Pleas in 1837. The case had almost identical facts to Rylands, but strict liability was never even considered. The case is instead thought of {{as one of the best}} attempts of early 19th Century English judges to build up the law of negligence. The outcome of Rylands meant that judges would again impose strict liability on defendants who accumulated dangerous things on their land without any need to prove negligence or wrongful intent. The decision won support for bringing the law relating to private reservoirs up to standard with the law relating to public reservoirs, which contained similar statutory provisions thanks to a pair of private Acts of Parliament passed in 1853 and 1864.|$|E
500|$|On September 13, 2012, BPI {{announced}} that it filed a $1.2 billion lawsuit, Beef Products, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., against ABC News; three reporters (Diane Sawyer, Jim Avila and David Kerley) and others, claiming ABC News made nearly [...] "200 false, misleading and defamatory statements, repeated continuously during a month-long disinformation campaign", engaged in [...] "product and food disparagement, and <b>tortious</b> interference with business relationships". BPI called the ABC News series a [...] "concerted disinformation campaign" [...] against LFTB.|$|E
500|$|In response, DraftKings and FanDuel filed {{lawsuits}} {{against the state}} of New York on November 13, arguing that their games were one of skill, they had been denied due process due to the Attorney General's abruptness, {{that he does not}} have the power to make such a ruling, and that Schneiderman engaged in <b>tortious</b> interference by sending cease and desist notices to their payment processors. On November 16, the two services tried to request a temporary restraining order to prevent Schneiderman from enforcing the cease-and-desist, but a state judge declared their request to be premature. Following the hearing, a spokesperson for the Attorney General declared that he could file a formal lawsuit against the two sites [...] "as soon as tomorrow". The same day, state senator Michael Ranzenhofer introduced a bill that would explicitly classify daily fantasy sports as a game of skill.|$|E
500|$|It {{requires}} that the defendant owed a duty of care to the victim (it is for the judge to decide on which facts such a duty would be created). These rules are typically those of tort. For example, in R v Pittwood, the defendant was put under a duty to act on account of being contractually obliged to close the gates at a railway crossing. Similar duties include those of a doctor of his patients, an electrician over a householder he has done work for, parents over their children, and, developed more recently, a police officer over persons he arrests. Included, however, are those of a criminal enterprise, which would not attract <b>tortious</b> liability in the civil law. Where the defendant is liable through an omission and not an act, then a legal duty to act – rather than a duty of care – is needed. Andrew Ashworth has criticised {{the nature of the}} duty of care requirement as [...] "decision-making at its retrospective worst".|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Judge Kocoras {{reduced the}} $11.7 million damages award to $27,002—$1 for <b>tortious</b> {{interference}} with prospective economic advantage, $1 for claims of defamation, and $27,000 for [...] "existing contracts".|$|E
2500|$|Aggravated damages may {{be awarded}} to {{compensate}} victims for their wounded feelings in <b>tortious</b> cases in certain cases. These damages {{are determined by}} examining if the defendant's conduct aggravated the plaintiff's damage by injuring [...] "feelings of dignity, safety and pride".|$|E
2500|$|On February 10, 2013 {{a report}} {{authored}} by former United States Attorney General and former Governor of Pennsylvania Dick Thornburgh, whom the Paterno family retained to conduct its own investigation, {{concluded that the}} Freeh report was [...] "seriously flawed, both {{with respect to the}} process of [...] investigation and its findings related to Mr. Paterno". Graham Spanier is suing Freeh for defamation and <b>tortious</b> interference and Penn State University for breach of contract.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{time during}} the fifteenth century, the common law courts seemed to draw a real {{distinction}} between the counts detinue sur trover and detinue sur bailment. A bailment occurs {{when there is an}} agreement for someone to transport or keep a chattel. [...] The normal rule was that [...] "ordinary" [...] care was necessary to protect the chattel while it was in the custody of the bailee. The former was a wrongful detention and a <b>tortious</b> wrong. [...] The latter a wrong based on the agreement between the parties.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1981, U.S. District Court judge Gabrielle McDonald {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} injunction against the Klan, {{requiring them to}} cease intimidating, threatening, or harassing the Vietnamese. McDonald eventually found the TER and Beam liable for <b>tortious</b> interference, violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and of various civil rights statutes and thus permanently enjoined them against violence, threatening behavior, and other harassment of the Vietnamese shrimpers. The SPLC also uncovered an obscure Texas law [...] "that forbade private armies in that state." [...] McDonald found that Beam's organization violated it and hence ordered the TER to close its military training camp.|$|E
2500|$|Business torts (i.e., {{economic}} torts) typically involve commercial transactions, {{and include}} <b>tortious</b> interference with trade or contract, fraud, injurious falsehood, and negligent misrepresentation. Negligent misrepresentation torts are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation {{in that there}} is no privity of contract; these torts are likely to involve pure economic loss which has been less-commonly recoverable in tort. One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the [...] "foreseeability" [...] doctrine. The economic loss rule is highly confusing and inconsistently applied. In 2010, {{the supreme court of the}} U.S. state of Washington replaced the economic loss doctrine with an [...] "independent duty doctrine".|$|E
2500|$|While {{negligence}} actions set {{a general}} groundwork, many further fields of tort have {{developed their own}} identity or, where judicial decision-making was seen as insufficient by Parliament, through statutory reform. Major statutory torts concern food safety, health and safety and environmental law. For example, liability under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, or liability imposed on utility (gas and electricity) companies {{to ensure the safety}} of their products, all of which are strict liability. While a statute has said nothing specific, a <b>tortious</b> duty may have arisen. This will be a question of statutory interpretation (e.g. Stovin v Wise [...] AC 923).|$|E
2500|$|Economic {{antitrust}} torts {{have been}} somewhat submerged by modern competition law. However, in the United States, private parties are permitted in certain circumstances to sue for anticompetitive practices, including under federal or state statutes or {{on the basis of}} common law <b>tortious</b> interference, which may be based upon the Restatement (Second) of Torts §766. [...] Federal laws include the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 followed by the Clayton Antitrust Act which restrict cartels and through Federal Trade Commission regulate mergers and acquisitions. [...] In the European Union, articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union apply but allowing private actions to enforce antitrust laws is under discussion.|$|E
2500|$|When a {{fiduciary}} duty is imposed, equity requires a different, stricter, standard of behavior than the comparable <b>tortious</b> {{duty of care}} at common law. The fiduciary has a duty {{not to be in}} a situation where personal interests and {{fiduciary duty}} conflict, not to be in a situation where his fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and a duty not to profit from his fiduciary position without knowledge and consent. A fiduciary ideally would not have a conflict of interest. It has been said that fiduciaries must conduct themselves [...] "at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd" [...] and that [...] "he distinguishing or overriding duty of a fiduciary is the obligation of undivided loyalty".|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{consensus}} {{about the status of}} the right to strike at common law. On the one hand, the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed that [...] "to cease work except for higher wages, and a strike in consequence, was lawful at common law", that [...] "right of workmen to strike is an essential element in the principle of collective bargaining", [...] "that workmen have a right to strike", and that this is [...] "a fundamental human right". This view would accord with international law, and see the right to stop work in a good faith trade dispute as an implied term in every employment contract. On the other hand, differently composed courts have asserted that the common law position sits at odds with international law: that a strike is a breach of contract, and this creates <b>tortious</b> liability for unions organising collective action, unless it falls within an immunity from statute. On this view, even though an employer is not liable for economic loss to workers who are collectively dismissed, a union could be liable to the employer for taking collective action. Economic torts have been said to include conspiracy to injure, inducement of breach of contract, and <b>tortious</b> interference with a contract. However, TULRCA 1992 section 219 contains the classic formula, that collective action by a trade union becomes immune from any liability in tort if done [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute". This said, various further hurdles must be jumped for a union to be certain of immunity from employers suing for damages, or an injunction to stop a strike.|$|E
2500|$|An {{action for}} {{conversion}} does not rest on knowledge or {{intent of the}} defendant. The act constituting [...] "conversion" [...] must be an intentional act, but does not require wrongful intent, and is not excused by care, good faith, or lack of knowledge. Fraudulent intent is not an element of conversion. The defendant is answerable for the conversion, {{no matter how good}} his intentions were, or how careful he has been, or how apparently well-founded was his belief that his <b>tortious</b> act was right. The existence of probable cause does not preclude liability. A person may be liable for conversion even though he was reasonably mistaken in thinking the facts to be such as would give him a legal right to the goods.|$|E
2500|$|Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield, 27 Cal.3d 167, 178 (Cal. 1980) [...] and Petermann v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters 174 Cal.App.2d 184, 188 (1959): an employer's general {{right to}} {{terminate}} an [...] "at-will" [...] employee is 'subject to limits imposed by public policy, since otherwise {{the threat of}} discharge {{could be used to}} coerce employees into committing crimes, concealing wrongdoing, or taking other action harmful to the public weal.' However, an exception to the general at-will employment presumption is made and a <b>tortious</b> wrongful discharge claim will lie where an employer's termination of an employee violates a fundamental public policy, or in other words, where [...] "he or she is discharged for performing an act that public policy would encourage, or for refusing to do something that public policy would condemn.|$|E
