5|$|The cantata text {{does not}} tell a story but {{reflects}} {{different aspects of the}} Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> that was present at the Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.|$|E

The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death {{and did not}} cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of aikido.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began after Uchikoshi joined Chunsoft to write a visual novel for them that could reach a wider audience; Uchikoshi {{suggested}} adding puzzle elements that are integrated with the game's story. The inspiration for the story was {{the question of where}} inspiration comes from; while researching it, Uchikoshi came across Rupert Sheldrake's morphic resonance hypothesis, which became the main theme {{of the game}}. The music was composed by Shinji Hosoe, while the characters were designed by Kinu Nishimura. The localization was handled by Aksys Games; they worked by the philosophy of keeping true <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the original Japanese version, opting for natural-sounding English rather than following the original's exact wording.|$|E
5|$|Fates is {{primarily}} {{set in the}} territories of the kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr. Their royalty share a similar line of descent from ancient dragons, but each kingdom worships different dragon deities, and so exist {{in a state of}} war. Little do they know that there is also another dragon deity; the dragon Anankos, ruler of the kingdom of Valla. This realm is located under the Bottomless Canyon which separates Hoshido and Nohr. Anankos has usurped the throne of Valla and is intentionally provoking war between the two kingdoms. In the Hidden Truths DLC, it is revealed that Anankos was formerly a kind dragon who gave wisdom to humanity, but his growing power and inability to ascend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> realm with the world's other dragons began corrupting him. After he killed Valla's king in an uncontrolled fit of bestial rage, he finally went mad: his remaining sanity and kindness took temporary shelter in a human form and fathered the Avatar before dying, while his dragon self began an insane crusade to destroy humanity.|$|E

The Spirit of Fire inadvertently activates a Forerunner docking station and enters the planet's interior. Flood board the ship, and very soon Forerunner Sentinels appear to cleanse the Flood threat and also to destroy all UNSC forces in the process. The crew discovers the planet is actually hollow, with a habitable interior and a miniature sun. The Covenant's plan is to activate a dormant fleet of highly advanced Forerunner starships inside the planet, {{and use them to}} obliterate humanity.|$|E

5|$|On 24 January 2000, after SMU chaired a {{technical}} workshop to obtain feedback on three alternative proposals, a well-known architect named Tay Kheng Soon {{held a press}} conference at The Substation to unveil his unofficial SMU masterplan. URA was invited to the presentation but did not show up. His proposal entailed re-routing the tunnel to save the National Library building. A week later, Tay wrote to the Prime Minister's Office regarding his proposal which was referred to the MND. Many members of the public wrote in publicly either in support of Tay's plans or argue for heritage conservation in general. A few articles and letters highlighted that the adamant official response to public dissent ran counter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the Government's S21 Vision, which expressed a desire to foster civic participation and active citizenry.|$|E
5|$|The Sioux people {{consist of}} three main groups, the Lakota in the west, the Western Dakota in the center, and the Eastern Dakota in the east. In the east, the Santee was {{originally}} from the Minnesota area. The Chippewa or Ojibwe people were {{also from the}} same general area. The two tribes had been at war from at least 1736 and by 1750 the Chippewa had forced the Santee to the west into the prairie. The war between the tribes continued until at least the 1850s. Only after 1862, when the Santee rose up against the whites and were subsequently removed to the Dakota Territory, did the fighting cease. In 1872, the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands of the Santee signed a treaty that resulted in their moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> Lake Reservation.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{was done}} by the philosophy of keeping true <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the original Japanese, making dialogue sound like what a native speaker of English would say instead of strictly adhering the original's exact wording. The localization editor, Ben Bateman, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, line by line or scene by scene rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same ideas in English. Most parts of the game that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese version, but a different one; Bateman did however try to make similar types of jokes, with similar contents and ideas. The game's use of Japanese language puns led to problems, as many of them relied on Japanese dialects to function; for these, Bateman replaced them with new puns in English. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E

5|$|The second season, , begins {{six months}} later, with dark spirits terrorizing the seas. Korra {{turns to her}} spirit-attuned uncle Unalaq, chief of the Northern Water Tribe, for tutelage, and opens the polar portals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> World at his direction. Unalaq then seizes power in the Southern Water Tribe by force, {{starting}} a civil war {{in which he is}} opposed by his brother, Korra's father, Tonraq. Seeking allies against Unalaq, Korra experiences the life of the first Avatar, Wan, who fused his soul with the spirit Raava to imprison her opponent Vaatu. Aided by his twin children Eska and Desna, Unalaq frees Vaatu during the Harmonic Convergence, a decamillennial alignment of planets, and unites with him to become a dark Avatar. As Korra fights this figure, her link to the previous Avatars is broken; but with the help of Tenzin's daughter Jinora, she defeats Vaatu and Unalaq, and leaves the spirit portals open, allowing a new coexistence of spirits and humans.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{was known}} for his gentlemanly nature and his {{adherence}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the game. Aside from refusing to retaliate against bodyline, Woodfull refused to exploit loopholes to dismiss batsmen. On one occasion, Jack Fingleton was run out after wandering out of the crease to inspect the crease, without intending to run. A teammate broke the wicket and the umpire upheld the appeal, but Woodfull called Fingleton back. He led his team in an understated way, preferring to give broad objectives to his players and trusting them to choose their own methods to fulfil the task at hand. However, he was known to organise his team tightly on tour to ensure that things proceeded smoothly.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{releases}} the new Halo, but faces immediate resistance upon {{it from the}} Banished. Back on the Ark, Alice-130 and Douglas-042 destroy enemy barricades and prevent reinforcements, including Atriox, from reaching the Halo; they then use the portal network to reach the Halo themselves. There, Professor Anders is escorted to the ring’s control room, where the firing system of the structure is deactivated and a signal beacon is set. Meanwhile, the Spirit of Fires forces are locked in a struggle with {{the remnants of the}} Banished. Anders finds the gravity controls for the Halo and uses them to raise the land that the remaining Banished are standing on into space where it disintegrates. The ground forces return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of Fire, but Anders and the Halo enter slipspace as they cannot halt the jump's countdown. Before the Halo jumps, Anders promises to get help from the UNSC as soon as possible. On the Ark, Atriox and a legion of Banished still live, preparing for the next fight against the UNSC. Meanwhile, the Halo carrying Anders drops out of slipspace prematurely, only to encounter a Foreunner construct known as a Guardian.|$|E
