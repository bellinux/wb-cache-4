60|$|<b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> legs blurred <b>the</b> {{landscape}} as she fled, and in high elation I sought Bess {{to tell of}} the potency of my voice.

5000|$|Starting {{with the}} old adage [...] "Once {{there was a little}} girl..." [...] you come across a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> and her parents, all wearing crowns. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> is wide awake {{claiming}} she is not tired. Her parents take this almost as a regular occurrence and require that she at least put on her pajamas, wash her face, brush her teeth. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> keeps repeating that she is not tired but climbs into bed and under the sheets since that is where she is the most comfortable. She then proceeds to ask her parents if everything thing goes to sleep. The parents then proceed to go through a list of animals and their habits of sleeping. They discuss the family dog, the cat, bats, snails, bears, and whales. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> proclaims that she knows an animal that sleeps a lot. We then finally come across the tiger in the jungle, where <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> tells her parents that he sleeps to stay strong. The parents agree that sleep is good to stay strong then say good night even thought <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> claims she is still not sleepy. Her parents know what will happen and agree that she can stay awake all night long. After the long discussion, <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> goes through all the processes that the animals go through and ends up fast asleep.|$|R

Mr Rabbit then suggested that <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> should get her mother [...] "red underwear" [...] but <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> refused to give her mother such a gift. Mr Rabbit then took the girl to an apple tree in which she agreed {{that would be a}} lovely present for her mom. Mr Rabbit and <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> then proceeded to find another [...] "present" [...] for her mom. Mr Rabbit suggest that <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> get her mother something yellow. They both agreed that a banana would be the perfect fruit for her mom. Mr Rabbit and <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> filled a <b>little</b> brown basket with blue, yellow, green and red fruits.

She went on to another hut, with another old woman and <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> This time, <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> gave her a flask that poured whatever was wished for and never emptied.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> is then seen {{pushing a}} {{wheelchair}} in which Perry {{sits in a}} hospital gown, trembling with the poisoned strawberry in one hand. In the hallway, they are blocked by two minotaur guards who block their way. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> furiously goes {{up to them and}} stomps her foot, sending the minotaurs flying. Perry gets up from the wheelchair, grabbing <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> hand as they run down the hallway to the exit. The doors open to reveal a garden. A man dressed as Prince Charming appears riding a unicorn, and walks to Perry with fingers crossed behind his back. Perry punches him in the face, sending him through the fence. Perry and the girl find a heart-shaped exit, and the two girls high-five. They hug each other before <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> places something in Perry's closed fist. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> rides away into a suburban neighborhood on a bike with a license plate reading [...] "Katheryn". Perry returns to her dressing room and opens her fist, revealing a butterfly. The camera pans to a stage where Perry stands on a rising platform, and sings the beginning bars of [...] "Teenage Dream".|$|R
6000|$|Next day I was {{inclined}} to agree with her. [...] "There's {{a woman and a}} <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> heading straight for the poppies," [...] said May, a maid about the bungalow. I went out on the porch and waited their advent. They plunged through the pine trees and into the fields, and as the roots of the first poppies were pulled I called to them. They were about a hundred feet away. The woman and <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> turned to <b>the</b> sound of my voice and looked at me. [...] "Please do not pick the poppies," [...] I pleaded. They pondered this for a minute; then the woman said something in an undertone to <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> and both backs jack-knifed as the slaughter recommenced. I shouted, but they had become suddenly deaf. I screamed, and so fiercely that <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> wavered dubiously. And while the woman went on picking I could hear her in low tones heartening <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b>|$|R
