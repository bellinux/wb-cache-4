50|$|<b>The</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> usually {{two hours}} or less, {{as it is}} just a first <b>date</b> and <b>is</b> really meant to {{introduce}} the two people more than it is meant to create a marriage.Furthermore, due to the unfamiliarity of the two people <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> shorter than most because they are in the beginning stages of a relationship. <b>The</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> also very adventurous in the way that neither party knows what to expect {{and whether or not they}} will hit it off.

5|$|Hunter {{was born}} in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute. <b>The</b> <b>date</b> <b>was</b> 7 August 1877. He was the {{youngest}} child of five, born to William and Jeanie (née Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude for drawing when very young {{and when he was}} about thirteen, his mother arranged for him to have painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have been victims of an influenza pandemic. William, the father, and Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a home had been sold. Evidently, the tragic deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed for California via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.|$|E

5|$|In a {{nationwide}} Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll of 900 registered voters conducted in July 2001, 44 percent of American respondents thought that Condit {{was involved in}} Levy's disappearance and 27 percent felt that he should resign. Fifty-one {{percent of the respondents}} believed that he was acting as if he were guilty; 13 percent felt that he should run again for office. A poll sample taken from Condit's congressional district held a more favorable view of Condit. On March 5, 2002, Condit lost the Democratic primary election for his Congressional seat to his former aide, then-Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, with the Levy controversy being cited as a contributing factor. He was subpoenaed to appear on April 1, 2002, before a District of Columbia grand jury investigating the disappearance. <b>The</b> <b>date</b> <b>was</b> kept a carefully guarded secret to avoid further leaks. Condit left Congress {{at the end of his}} term on January 3, 2003.|$|E
5|$|Its {{status in}} the history of Danish {{photography}} is rivalled by a portrait of Bertel Thorvaldsen sitting at an easel outside his studio in the garden of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen. This daguerrotype was taken by the French photographer Aymard Charles Théodore Neubourg, who visited Copenhagen in the summer of 1840. An examination of the circumstances under which it was taken reveals that <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>was</b> Sunday, 26 July 1840. It has also been noticed that Thorvaldsen is making the horn sign with what apparently is his left hand although, {{as a result of the}} daguerrotype mirror effect, it is actually his right hand. This has been ascribed to the anxiety he must have experienced while facing the new mechanical device which could reveal even the slightest detail.|$|E

There was also a historical reason: under the Communist regime, May 2 was a day when national flags, hoisted for Labor Day on May 1 were being quickly removed before Polish Constitution Day (May 3), which was banned by the authorities.|$|E

5|$|The Day of Reconciliation is {{a public}} holiday in South Africa held {{annually}} on 16 December. The holiday came into effect in 1994 {{after the end of}} apartheid, with the intention of fostering reconciliation and national unity for the country. <b>The</b> <b>date</b> <b>was</b> chosen because it was significant to both Afrikaner and African cultures.

5|$|The {{spring of}} 1973 passed with no {{offensive}} being launched. On 21 August of that year, in complete secrecy, six senior Syrian commanders, using false names and passports, arrived from Latakia at Alexandria harbor in a Soviet passenger liner carrying holiday makers. Among the Syrian commanders were, principally, the Minister of Defense General Mustafa Tlass and the Chief of Staff General Yusuf Shakkour. For {{the next two}} days, they convened with their Egyptian counterparts at Egyptian Naval Headquarters in Ras El Tin Palace. By August 23, two documents were ratified by Shazly and Shakkour concluding that the Egyptian and Syrian armed forces were ready for war.
