5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at five in the morning to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> turns. In the week before the World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E
5|$|As during Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign, when a Commission of Sciences and Arts had {{accompanied}} the military campaign, a Morea scientific expedition (Expédition scientifique de Morée.) accompanied the troops. Seventeen learned men representing different specialties (natural history and antiquities – archaeology, architecture and sculpture) made the voyage. Their work was of major importance in increasing {{knowledge about the}} country. As an example, the topographic maps they produced were excellent. More significantly, the measurements, drawings, profiles, plans and proposals for the theoretical restoration of Peloponnesian monuments, of Attica and of the Cyclades were, following James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's Antiquities of Athens, a new attempt to systematically and exhaustively catalogue ancient Greek ruins. The Morea expedition and its publications offered a near-complete description of the regions visited. They formed a scientific, aesthetic and human inventory that remained {{one of the best}} means, short of visiting them in person, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> regions.|$|E

500|$|... "Not to everyone's taste, granted, [...] is {{nevertheless}} an original and disturbing take on modern love stories" [...] was {{the view of}} Stuart Willis writing for the Sex-Gore-Mutants website. Believing that the film was a [...] "pleasant surprise", he praised the improvised nature of the work, believing that it created believable scenes and allowed the viewer <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> characters [...] "almost without realising." [...] He considered the acting to be very good, and particularly praised Hoyle's ability to portray a paedophile grooming {{a young man in}} a way that was both [...] "pathetic and truly sinister all at once". Rather than falling into [...] "tasteless exploitation", Willis thought that the film was saved by a lack of sensationalism. Praising the exterior scenes as [...] "beautifully atmospheric" [...] and the music as [...] "fitting the laconic mood and sense of ill-foreboding well", he considered the film to be a good example of low-key filmmaking, akin to that produced in Britain during the early 1980s.|$|E
500|$|The British Society for Parasitology {{was founded}} in the 1950s, largely due to Bishop's efforts. She was {{initially}} given only five pounds and a secretary to start the Society; to raise funds Bishop passed around a pudding basin at the Society's meetings. The society was originally a subgroup of the Institute of Biology at Cambridge, but it became an independent group in 1960 and was headed by Bishop. She {{was the president of}} the group, called the Institute of Biology Parasitology Group, from 1960 to 1962, the third overall leader of the group. Later that decade, the Department of Biology asked her to be the department head, but she declined because of the public nature of the role. For 20 years, the scientific journal Parasitology had Bishop on staff as an editor. Her lifelong association with Girton College prompted the placement of a plaque commemorating her life, whose inscription, quoted from Virgil, reads [...] "Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas", Latin for [...] "Happy is the one who has been able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> causes of things". In 1992, the British Society for Parasitology created a grant in Bishop's name, the Ann Bishop Travelling Award, to aid young parasitologists in travelling for field work where their parasites of interest are endemic.|$|E

500|$|Episode 2 [...] Part Two: A sycophantic clergyman named Mr. William Collins visits his cousins, the Bennets. He is the entailed heir {{of their}} home and estate, Longbourn, and intends to marry one of Mr. Bennet's daughters. This is meant, on his part, {{as an act of}} benign {{goodwill}} towards the Bennets, because Mrs. Bennet and her unwed daughters will be rendered homeless once Mr. Bennet dies and Mr. Collins inherits the estate. He therefore invites himself for a two-week visit, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Bennets better and select a wife from among the daughters of the family. However, the Bennet girls judge Mr. Collins to be a rather ridiculous man, an [...] "oddity" [...] with many peculiarities of speech and deportment. They are nevertheless civil to him, and take him to balls and social events in Meryton. One day, while on a walk around Meryton village, they meet members of a newly arrived militia, including a Mr George Wickham. At a social event, Wickham befriends Elizabeth and tells her that Darcy, who is the son of Wickham's late father's employer, has denied Wickham a living (a curacy) which had been assured to him by Mr. Darcy's father. At another social event, Darcy surprises Elizabeth with a dance offer at a ball at Netherfield, which she grudgingly but politely accepts. Mr Collins proposes to Elizabeth the next day, but she resoundingly rejects him. While Mrs Bennet disagrees about Elizabeth's decision, her close friend Charlotte Lucas invites Mr Collins to stay at Lucas Lodge.|$|E

Individual needs of patients are met by bending the rules of standard interventions and assessment. Psychiatric/mental health nurses spoke of the potential to 'bend the rules', which required an interpretation of the unit rules and the ability to evaluate the risks associated with bending them.|$|E

This followed on from a mini-series named Meet the Popstars which was intended to allow the public <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> group and their music away from the talent show format. In August 2001, Hear'Say toured the United Kingdom. They initially announced five dates which quickly sold out, causing the band to schedule thirty more dates.

My intention was to start fast but I wanted to keep going a bit longer than I did. I maybe got over excited and a went too fast, but I maintained the time difference {{and so it was}} all ok." [...] This race was the seasons' main goal for Van Dijk. She had been tested on her time trial position during the season and found a better position which she was able to maintain for almost half an hour. Van Dijk told she practiced the course twice in August at 5:00am to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> turns.

Based on this, and the opinions of the Houses' existing members, the prefrosh are placed into a House which will be their home physically and socially for the next few years.

[...] Also, the selection process is constrained: [...] there are {{only a limited number of}} openings in each House, and it is impossible to simultaneously meet the preferences of all of the Freshmen and Houses.|$|E

[...] Advent Children received mixed views from critics. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network felt that, due to the film's pace and context, viewers were not given enough time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> characters. These sentiments were echoed by John Eriani of Mania Entertainment, who particularly faulted the lack of character names or explanations of the villains' motives. Chris Carle of IGN was critical {{of the lack of}} motivation for those who were not familiar with the series, but praised both the English and Japanese voice acting. Michael Beckett of RPGamer, while generally less than impressed by the overall story, said that it [...] " [...] some interesting insights into a few of the less-developed characters of the game, though Cloud receives most of the attention and development as the story unfolds".|$|E

It was planned to again visit 6 countries in the March/April period but due to a plane tragedy in Poland giving rise to a week of mourning the Polish promoter decided to postpone the concerts planned for Poland on 16–18 April. The dates were rescheduled for September 2010. On 1 May 2010 the first concert in the U.S.A. took place as part of a prog festival at the Majestic Theater in Gettysburg Pennsylvania. For the later German/Italian festivals and the Polish gigs in September they hired a stand-in guitarist by the name of Micheal Krumins to cover for Jon-Arne following the arrival of his first child and his decision to give priority to his family. Meanwhile, in July 2010 the band announced that they should still go on without Robert Johanson and recording of the new album is almost over and it will be out by the end of the year. they also revealed the name of the album a month after that during a gig.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers {{also criticized}} the dialogue, which Ebert said {{was limited to}} [...] "simplistic declamations" [...] and Claudia Puig of USA Today {{described}} as [...] "stilted and overblown, a problem also {{in some of the}} live-action incarnations." [...] Many critics also said that the battle scenes were repetitive and lacked tension; McCarthy described the action sequences as [...] "a little exposition, an invasion; some more exposition, a lightsaber fight; a bit more blah-blah, a spaceship dogfight, and on and on." [...] Linda Stasi, of the New York Post, also described the lack of character development in the film, writing that whereas the original Star Wars films dedicated time to allowing viewers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> characters, [...] "Director Dave Filoni is so concentrated on the action that we're never given the chance to care who lives and who is blown into spare parts." [...] Jason Anderson, of the Globe and Mail, wrote that although The Clone Wars is intended for younger audiences, [...] "parents may be perturbed by the film's relentless violence." [...] Ebert also found protagonist Ahsoka Tano [...] "annoying," [...] and Michael Rechtshaffen, of The Hollywood Reporter, said the attempts of humor amid the bickering between Tano and Anakin Skywalker are [...] "strained". Puig said she enjoyed the character, and that [...] "her repartee with Anakin enlivens things." ...|$|E
