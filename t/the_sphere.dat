5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} from the plane to <b>the</b> <b>sphere</b> and other quadratic surfaces. For <b>the</b> <b>sphere,</b> the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on <b>the</b> <b>sphere.</b> This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E
