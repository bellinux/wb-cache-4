5|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} junior {{officer who had}} distinguished himself to Captain Pigot during the previous months, but his disrating {{was one of the}} primary triggers to the mutiny. About a week before the mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main top, and the captain noticed that a gasket, one of <b>the</b> <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> held the sail securely, had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. Casey was brought before the captain, and apologised for the oversight and took responsibility for it. The captain demanded that Casey apologise on his knees, a completely unacceptable and debasing demand for a gentleman. Casey refused to be humiliated in such a way. Pigot offered him one more opportunity and when Casey once more refused, the captain ordered that Casey receive 12 lashes (more commonly a sailor's punishment than that of a junior officer), and he was disrated, which would effectively end his career as a naval officer. Casey was a popular officer amongst the crew and they felt that he was punished unfairly. The topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E

25|$|Throughout 1860, Buford and {{his fellow}} {{soldiers}} had lived with talk of secession {{and the possibility of}} civil war until the Pony Express brought word that Fort Sumter had been fired on in April 1861, confirming secession as fact. As was the case with many West Pointers, Buford had to choose between North and South. Based on his background, Buford had ample reason to join the Confederacy. He was a native Kentuckian, the son of a slave-owning father, and the husband of a woman whose relatives would fight for the South, as would a number of his own. On the other hand, Buford had been educated in the North and come to maturity within the Army. His two most influential professional role models, Colonels William S. Harney and Philip St. George Cooke, were Southerners who elected to remain with the Union and the U.S. Army. He loved his profession and his time on the frontier had snapped <b>the</b> <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> drew other Southerners home.|$|E
500|$|Until the mid-1950s, French {{colonies in}} west and central Africa were grouped within two federations: French Equatorial Africa (AEF) and French West Africa (AOF). Côte d'Ivoire {{was part of}} the AOF, {{financing}} roughly two thirds of its budget. Wishing to free the country from the guardianship of the AOF, Houphouët-Boigny advocated an Africa made up of nations that would generate wealth rather than share poverty and misery. He participated actively in the drafting and adoption of the framework of the Defferre Loi Cadre, a French legal reform which, in addition to granting autonomy to African colonies, would break <b>the</b> <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> bound the different territories together, giving them more autonomy by means of local assemblies. The Deffere Loi Cadre was far from unanimously accepted by Houphouët-Boigny's compatriots in Africa: Léopold Sédar Senghor, leader of Senegal, was the first to speak out against this attempted [...] "Balkanization" [...] of Africa, arguing that the colonial territories [...] "do not correspond to any reality: be it geographical, economic, ethnic, or linguistic". Senghor argued that maintaining the AOF would give the territories stronger political credibility and would allow them to develop harmoniously as well as emerge as a genuine people. This view was shared by most members of the African Democratic Rally, who backed Ahmed Sékou Touré and Modibo Keïta, placing Houphouët-Boigny in the minority at the 1957 congress in Bamako.|$|E

Ismailis have marked the Jubilees of their Imāms with public celebrations, which are symbolic affirmations of <b>the</b> <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> link the Ismāʿīlī Imām and his followers.

Atlantic producer Tom Dowd tried to get one more album out of Canned Heat, despite their drug use and heavy drinking; they ultimately recorded an album's worth of material at Criteria Studios in Miami during 1974 (featuring some collaboration with former member Mandel), but Atlantic ended its relationship with Canned Heat {{before it could be}} released. The masters for the bulk of the material, which had been kept at Skip Taylor's house, were destroyed in a fire, and what material was rescued by de la Parra was finally restored and issued decades later, in 1997, titled <b>The</b> <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> Bind.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{drowning}} pool, Killjoy, Copperfield and The Creeper assess Torque's moral actions. Torque {{fights and}} defeats Copperfield. However, Blackmore leaves, compelling Torque to follow him. [...] They return to where Torque grew up; Garvey Children's Home. Inside, Torque remembers meeting Blackmore {{for the first}} time. However, in his memory, Blackmore is an adult, Torque is a child, {{and none of the}} staff can see or hear Blackmore. Blackmore then confronts Torque, telling him that <b>the</b> <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> bind them can never be cut. Torque realizes the truth - Blackmore is not real, he is Torque's alter ego. When Torque blacks out, Blackmore's personality takes over, but now, Blackmore wants to be in control all the time; [...] "we've only got the one body, and I'm tired of sharing." [...] He transforms into a monster, and he and Torque fight, with Torque defeating him. Blackmore disappears, and Torque is approached by Carmen, who tells him [...] "I never want us to be apart again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{things are}} {{different}} throughout the game if the player is playing as a neutral character. For example, the letter from Blackmore is to Cory, not Torque, telling him Torque doesn't really love him. During the scene when Torque sees Killjoy on his TV, Killjoy reminds Torque that Blackmore had manipulated Cory. When the helicopter attacks, it is piloted by Jordan, and in the drowning pool, Torque fights Copperfield. Later, Blackmore reveals that he gave Cory spiked drugs prior to Cory's murder of Malcolm and subsequent suicide. In the final battle, neither Blackmore nor Torque is able to win, and when they approach one another they are repelled away from touching. Blackmore points out [...] "Looks like we're going {{to play this game}} a while longer.

2500|$|The Windows {{version of}} Street Fighter IV {{includes}} all the features {{found in the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and some extras, that Capcom representatives say could make it [...] "the definitive version" [...] of the game. The game features online play via Games for Windows - LIVE, with built-in voice chat and PC-exclusive achievements, but no cross-platform playability would be available with Xbox 360 players. Also, the game features higher resolutions, and three new freely selectable visual styles, named [...] "Ink", [...] "Watercolor" [...] and [...] "Posterize". There are also two bundles of the game: regular (game only, $39.99) and a bundle that includes the Mad Catz FightPad (with the Ryu design) that is currently sold separately for the Xbox 360 version. Those who pre-ordered the game at Best Buy received a DVD with an Eagle One animated comic (this {{is not the same}} as <b>The</b> <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> Bind that comes in the collector's editions of the console versions).
