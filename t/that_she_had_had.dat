Wounded, Rueda fled the room, locking Kinne inside, and called the police.|$|E

[...] The Prince of Wales hoped that what was termed [...] "the Delicate Investigation" [...] would turn up evidence of adultery that would permit {{him to get a}} divorce, and forbade Charlotte to see her mother.

[...] The ten-year-old was deeply hurt when mother and daughter caught sight of each other in the park, and Caroline, obedient to the Prince's command to have no contact with Charlotte, pretended not to see her. [...] To George's bitter disappointment, the investigating committee found no evidence Caroline had had a second child, though it noted that the Princess's behaviour was very much open to misconstruction. [...] The King, who was fond of Caroline, had refused to see her during the investigation, but began to receive her again afterwards.
