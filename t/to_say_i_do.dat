6000|$|... "No, I {{must stay}} {{and face the}} music, as my father used <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish to seem to run away, and, besides, I {{may be able to}} offer a {{suggestion}} now and then." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr Thompson looked equally thoughtful. 'The {{circumstances}} are certainly very suspicious,' he said, echoing the Head's own words. 'I wish I could {{think he was}} innocent, but I am bound <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not. I regard the evidence as conclusive.' ...|$|E
60|$|Then she was silent, and, needless <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not pursue}} the conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Deed and I know nothin'." [...] Now the boy {{began to}} cry. [...] "You {{have no right}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. Why should <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the likes of that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have tried}} to marry Miss Neuchatel once," [...] said Lady Montfort, with a {{mantling}} cheek, [...] "and <b>I</b> am glad <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not succeed. My match-making is over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Advantage {{has been taken}} of her {{relationship}} to the old man, to include that innocent creature in political suspicions which it is simply absurd to suppose that she has deserved. She is ordered to leave the Prince's domains immediately.--Are you going to her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My good fellow, not so sharp, pray," [...] said Ned, helping {{himself to}} another roll, the first having {{vanished}} like a morning cloud; [...] "I don't want money--ah: that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want money, but I don't want yours. No; I {{came here to}} ask you to help me to get a body." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You, you are, you're a {{great deal}} too good for me, and I'm so {{grateful}} to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't know why I can't love you as you want me to. I've tried, but I can't change the feeling, {{and it would be}} a lie <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> when I don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> {{but it was}} only for a few minutes," [...] replied the book-keeper. [...] "I called around to Mack & Heath's for that Rock Island circular." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, with [...] "Not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not speak}} of flowers", the Island came in eighth place, {{addressing}} some of the darkest of the 500 years of Brazil: a military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985.|$|R
6000|$|... "True; yes, it was {{a foolish}} faithless word. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not take it, {{and it would have}} been no good to my soul <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Lies cannot prosper, cannot prosper, Mr. Thurnall!" [...] and she stopped short again.|$|R
60|$|It is, I think, now universally {{admitted}} by all Devonshire and Cornwall that Luke Rowan {{has succeeded}} in brewing good beer; with what results to himself I am not prepared <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not, however, think it probable that he will succeed in his professed object of shutting up the apple orchards of the county.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{agree with}} you, Bickley--about Bastin, I mean. I am {{by no means}} certain {{that he is not}} the wisest of the three of us. He has a faith and he sticks to it, as {{millions}} have done before him, and that is better than making spiritual experiments, as I am sorry <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> or rejecting things because one cannot understand them, as you do, which is only a form of intellectual vanity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I {{know every}} word {{you are going}} <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not say they were alike, in fact. One fell into a {{condition}} where everything acted against the natural tendency, and the other where everything acted for it; and so one turned out a pretty wilful, stout, overbearing old democrat, {{and the other a}} wilful, stout old despot. If both had owned plantations in Louisiana, they would have been as like as two old bullets cast in the same mould." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not," [...] Ned replied. [...] "Some of {{them were}} masked. The others were, so far as I could see among such a crowd of faces in a not very bright light, all strangers to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{one of his}} rare written {{comments}} on this process Ramana Maharshi wrote, [...] "Enquiring within Who is the seer? I saw the seer disappear leaving That alone which stands forever. No thought arose <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> saw. How then could the thought arise <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{dare not}}! You dare not burden my o'erburdened soul With two dead men! I think one is enough. For when I stand before God, face to face, I {{would not have}} you, with a scarlet thread Around your white throat, coming up behind <b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|O I {{am trying}} my hand at a novel just now; it may {{interest}} you to know, I am bound <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think it}} will be a success. [...] However, it's an amusement for the moment, and work, work is your only ally against the 'bearded people' that squat upon their hams in the dark places of life and embrace people horribly as they go by. God save us from the bearded people! to think that the sun is still shining in some happy places! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And my son's. Strange <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not miss}} {{her so much}} as I miss him. She offers to return at any moment; but I {{do not wish to}} deprive her of the {{advantages}} of a little foreign travel with her friend. Always, Mr. Somerset, give your spare time to foreign countries, especially those which contrast with your own in topography, language, and art. That's my advice to all young people of your age. Don't waste your money on expensive amusements at home. Practise the strictest economy at home, to have a margin for going abroad.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad news, I regret <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} that Genoa {{will be able to}} send out any galleys for at least a fortnight. There have been civil dissensions, and {{fighting}} between rival factions, and in consequence her ships are all dismantled and laid up. Crews will have to be collected for them, repairs executed, and officers chosen; a fortnight will be the earliest time in which they can be here. Pisa has no war galleys, and unless the Pope sends some out directly he gets the news, the corsairs will have it their own way. Have you discovered them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went from}} bad to worse," [...] she said, {{with an air of}} discouragement very foreign to her. [...] "I did {{everything}} foolish except actually bursting into tears. <b>I</b> am thankful <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>do</b> that. But <b>I</b> was unable to speak for quite a long time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{replied the}} woman; 'if he--she pointed to Monks--'has been coward enough to confess, as I see he has, {{and you have}} sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> sell them, and they're where you'll never get them. What then?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was asked, in 2003, {{whether he}} has duct tape, plastic sheeting, and a three-day supply of bottled water at home. He replied, [...] "I would like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> don't believe we <b>do.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> have a {{miniature}} dachshund named Reggie who looks out for us." ...|$|R
60|$|Strange <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not at {{this late}} day {{remember}} a detail of how I was ditched at Rawlins. I remember watching the train as it was immediately swallowed up in the snow-storm, and of heading for a saloon to warm up. Here was light and warmth. Everything was in full blast and wide open. Faro, roulette, craps, and poker tables were running, and some mad cow-punchers were making the night merry. I had just succeeded in fraternizing with them and was downing my first drink at their expense, when a heavy hand descended on my shoulder. I looked around and sighed. It was the sheriff.|$|E
60|$|By {{this means}} I had, as I have said above, all the {{advantages}} of education that I could have had if I had been as much a gentlewoman as they were with whom I lived; and in some things I {{had the advantage of}} my ladies, though they were my superiors; but they were all the gifts of nature, and which all their fortunes could not furnish. First, I was apparently handsomer than any of them; secondly, I was better shaped; and, thirdly, I sang better, by which I mean I had a better voice; in all which you will, I hope, allow me <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not speak my own conceit of myself, but the opinion of all that knew the family.|$|E
60|$|Now says St. Paul, 'Covet earnestly {{the best}} gifts: and yet show I you a more {{excellent}} way;' {{and that is}} charity; love. As much as <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not complain of any of you for {{trying to be the}} best that you can, for trying to be as wise as you can be, as eloquent as you can be, as learned as you can be: I do not complain of you for trying to rise; but I do complain of you for trying to rise upon each other's shoulders. I do complain of you for each trying to set up himself, and trying to make use of his neighbours instead of helping them; and, when God gives you gifts to do good to others with, trying to do good only to yourselves with them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> am glad <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But <b>I</b> don't {{think it}} was your {{operations}} and the rest that cured him, Bickley, although you take all the credit. I believe it was the Life-water that the Lady Yva made him drink and the stuff that Oro sent which we gave him when you weren't looking." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{was obliged}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think <b>I</b> {{had ever heard}} it.|$|R
50|$|Well I {{developed}} this stand-up persona, and that's {{where it all}} started from. I realised I was getting laughs being a version of me, and that's what {{ended up in the}} sitcom. You do ultimately start from yourself but I'm pleased <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> have <b>to</b> exaggerate for comedic effect. It wasn't entirely autobiographical. I'm not quite that mad.|$|R
6000|$|This {{will do well}} enough--I have copied it and {{enclosed}} it to Hunt. You {{will call}} it a little politic--seeing I keep clear of all parties. I say something for and against both parties--and suit it {{to the tune of}} the Examiner--I meant <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not unsuit it--and I believe I think what I say, nay I am sure I do--I and my conscience are in luck to-day--which is an excellent thing. The other night I went to the Play with Rice, Reynolds, and Martin--we saw a new dull and half-damn'd opera call'd the 'Heart of Midlothian,' that was on Saturday--I stopt at Taylor's on Sunday with Woodhouse--and passed a quiet sort of pleasant day. I have been very much pleased with the Panorama of the Ship at the North Pole--with the icebergs, the Mountains, the Bears, the Wolves--the seals, the Penguins--and a large whale floating back above water--it is impossible to describe the place-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'With {{a million}} thanks,' said she, 'and my address upon my card {{in case of}} {{anything}} to be communicated personally, I will not send my love to the dear little thing for {{it might not be}} acceptable, and indeed there is no dear little thing left in the transformation so why do it but both myself and Mr F.'s Aunt ever wish her well and lay no claim to any favour on our side you may be sure of that but quite the other way for what she undertook to do she did and that is more than a great many of us do, not to say anything of her doing it as Well as it could be done and I myself am one of them for I have said ever since I began to recover the blow of Mr F's death that I would learn the Organ of which I am extremely fond but of which I am ashamed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not yet know a note, good evening!' ...|$|E
60|$|I had noticed, {{in other}} foreign languages, that verbs are bred in families, {{and that the}} members of each family have certain {{features}} or resemblances that are common to that family and distinguish it from the other families--the other kin, the cousins and what not. I had noticed that this family-mark is not usually the nose or the hair, so to speak, but the tail--the Termination--and that these tails are quite definitely differentiated; insomuch that an expert can tell a Pluperfect from a Subjunctive by its tail as easily and as certainly as a cowboy can tell a cow from a horse by the like process, the result of observation and culture. I should explain that I am speaking of legitimate verbs, those verbs which in the slang of the grammar are called Regular. There are other--I am not meaning to conceal this; others called Irregulars, born out of wedlock, of unknown and uninteresting parentage, and naturally destitute of family resemblances, as regards to all features, tails included. But of these pathetic outcasts I have nothing <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not approve of them, I do not encourage them; I am prudishly delicate and sensitive, and I do not allow them to be used in my presence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Were <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> this willingly," [...] {{said the}} King, [...] "no one would believe me, {{therefore}} do you, my fair cousin, {{judge of the}} extent of my wish to oblige you, when <b>I</b> <b>say</b> most reluctantly, that the parties consenting, and a dispensation from the Pope being obtained, my own objections shall be no bar to this match which you purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever I {{may have}} meant <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> that. Nor in truth <b>did</b> <b>I</b> mean it. Pray don't {{go on about}} it now. These are to be our last days, you know, and we shouldn't waste them by talking {{of things that are}} unpleasant. After all poor Johnny Eames is nothing to me; nothing, nothing. How can any one be {{anything}} to me when I think of you?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{am sorry}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not get {{favorable}} news from Orvil. He {{does not seem}} to improve.|$|R
