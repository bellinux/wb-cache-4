25|$|Brouwer's {{approach}} yielded its fruits, and in 1910 he {{also found}} a proof that was valid for any finite dimension, {{as well as other}} key theorems such as the invariance of dimension.

This branch of mathematics, originally envisioned by Poincaré and developed by Brouwer, changed its name. In the 1930s, analysis situs became algebraic topology.|$|E

25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

Repast Simphony projections are named sets of relationships defined over <b>the</b> constituents <b>of</b> a <b>context.</b> For example, a Repast Simphony network projection stores a network or graph relationship between <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> its <b>context.</b> <b>The</b> members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> can then ask {{to whom they}} are linked and who is linked to them. Similarly, the Repast Simphony grid projection stores a set of Cartesian coordinates for each member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>context.</b> <b>The</b> members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> can ask where they are located. Each context can support any mixture of projections. Also, projections can be declaratively visualized at runtime.|$|R

25|$|It {{may have}} been in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ecclesiastical crisis in the Isles that Guðrøðr {{undertook}} his journey to Norway in 1152. Guðrøðr's overseas objective, therefore, {{may have been}} to secure the patronage of a Scandinavian metropolitan willing to protect the Diocese of the Isles. Certainly, Guðrøðr's stay in Norway coincided with the Scandinavian visit of the papal legate Nicholas Breakspeare, Cardinal-Bishop of Albano (died 1159), {{a man who had been}} tasked to create Norwegian and Swedish ecclesiastical provinces in order to further extend the papacy's authority into the northern European periphery. Eventually the newly created Norwegian provincethe Archdiocese of Niðaróssencompassed eleven dioceses within and outwith mainland Norway. One such overseas diocese was that of the Isles, officially incorporated within the province in November 1154. Although Óláfr did not live long enough to witness the latter formality, it is evident that the remarkable overseas statecraft undertaken by Óláfr and Guðrøðr secured their kingdom's ecclesiastical and secular independence from nearby Dublin. The establishment of the Norwegian archdiocese bound outlying Norse territories closer to Norwegian royal power. In effect, the political reality of the Diocese of the Islesits territorial borders and nominal subjection to far-off Norwayappears to have mirrored that of the Kingdom of the Isles.|$|E

500|$|The russet sparrow's vocalisations are {{described}} by most sources as [...] "the sweetest and most musical" [...] of any sparrow. Its basic call is a cheep or chilp, {{similar to that}} of other sparrows. This call is monosyllabic, unlike the house sparrow's chirrup call, and is softer than that of the other sparrows. This call is given as a flight call, or by displaying males. Recorded variations include a chweep given by males at the nest and a trilled cheeep. Sometimes the male strings calls together and sings them in a strident tone, to create a sort of short song, transcribed as cheep chirrup cheeweep or chreet-chreet-chreet. The song is interspersed with sibilant chu-swik notes {{similar to those of the}} white wagtail.

In the first series finale, Rose takes on deadly energies to save the Doctor and planet Earth. Script editor Helen Raynor felt the episode gave Rose a chance to [...] "again be the Doctor’s equal" [...] and [...] "to finally match him with a gesture that is so noble, and strong, and heroic, and clever".

The Doctor repays her loyalty by sacrificing his ninth incarnation in turn to save her; Davies states unequivocally that [...] "he gives his life for her". Elements of Rose's characterisation in the first series were originally different. Paul Abbott was scheduled to write an episode which would have revealed that Rose's entire life had been manipulated by the Doctor in order to mould her into an ideal companion. Davies wrote the episode [...] "Boom Town" [...] to replace it when Abbott realised he was too busy to work on the script.|$|E
