5|$|The {{giant otter}} {{is a highly}} social animal and lives in {{extended}} family groups. Group sizes are anywhere from two to 20 members, but likely average between three and eight. (Larger figures may reflect two or three family groups temporarily feeding together.) <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> strongly cohesive: the otters sleep, play, travel, and feed together.|$|E
5|$|Culturally the Betsimisaraka can {{be divided}} into {{northern}} and southern sub-groups. Many elements of culture are common across both groups, including respect for ancestors, spirit possession, the ritual sacrifice of zebu, and a patriarchal social structure. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> distinguished by linguistic sub-dialects and various fady (taboos), as well as certain funeral practices and other customs. The Betsimisaraka practice famadihana (reburial) and sambatra (circumcision) and believe in sorcery and a wide range of supernatural forces. Many taboos and folktales revolve around lemurs and crocodiles, both of which are common throughout Betsimisaraka territory.|$|E
5|$|Greek life at Georgia Tech {{includes}} over 50 active {{chapters of}} social fraternities and sororities. All of <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> chapters of national organizations, {{including members of}} the North-American Interfraternity Conference, National Panhellenic Conference, and National Pan-Hellenic Council. The first fraternity to establish a chapter at Georgia Tech was Alpha Tau Omega in 1888, before the school held its first classes. The first sorority to establish a chapter was Alpha Xi Delta in 1954. Students with Greek affiliation make up around 26 percent of the undergraduate student body.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> M101 <b>Group</b> <b>is</b> a loose <b>group</b> {{of galaxies}} located in Ursa Major. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> named after <b>the</b> {{brightest}} galaxy in <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> <b>the</b> Pinwheel Galaxy (M101). Most {{of the other}} members of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>are</b> companions of <b>the</b> Pinwheel Galaxy. [...] <b>The</b> <b>group</b> itself <b>is</b> one of many located within the Virgo Supercluster (i.e. the Local Supercluster).|$|R
50|$|In Germany <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> {{assigned}} to <b>the</b> United States Air Forces in Europe's XII Tactical Air Command for duty with the occupation force. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> {{assigned to}} AAF Station Straubing, <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> transferred, without personnel and equipment, to Mitchel Field, New York in June 1947.|$|R
5|$|More generally, the i-th {{homotopy}} group, πi(X) {{begins with}} the pointed i-sphere (S'i,s), and otherwise follows the same procedure. The null homotopic class acts as {{the identity of the}} group addition, and for X equal to S'n (for positive n) — the homotopy groups of spheres — <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> abelian and finitely generated. If for some i all maps are null homotopic, then the group πi consists of one element, and is called the trivial group.|$|E
5|$|The common raven {{evolved in}} the Old World and crossed the Bering land bridge into North America. Recent genetic studies, which {{examined}} the DNA of common ravens from across the world, have determined that the birds fall into at least two clades: a California clade, found only in the southwestern United States, and a Holarctic clade, found across {{the rest of the}} Northern Hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> {{divided based}} on their {{alternative}} strategies of parasitizing its host colony (Myrmica ants). The predatory (in which the caterpillar preys on the host ants) and 'cuckoo' (in which the caterpillars feed off of the ants' regurgitation) strategies are derived characteristics from the alcon group, with the predatory strategy having evolved from the teleius group and the cuckoo strategy having evolved from the arion-Phengaris group. Another way these groups are categorized is by {{whether or not they}} release a certain chemical (dorsal nectary organ secretions) {{to attract the attention of}} the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, which is part of the teleius group.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Mexican banking <b>group</b> Grupo Financiero InverMexico {{was founded}} in 1991. In 1997, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> renamed Grupo Financiero Santander Mexicano, after <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> {{acquired}} by Banco Santander. In 1998, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> merged with Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico. In 2000, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> merged with sister group Grupo Financiero Serfin. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> renamed to Grupo Financiero Santander Serfin in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Karussell is a German {{rock band}} from Leipzig. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> formed in 1976. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> one of <b>the</b> {{well-known}} East German bands.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of conglomerate, sandstone and shale. It is typically red, with bands, streaks, and spots of greenish-white {{no more than}} a few inches thick. The total thickness of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> unknown, but may be as much as 21000 ft deep. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> a member of the Keweenawan Supergroup.|$|R
5|$|The {{standard}} {{language has}} seven monophthong vowel phonemes. They are aligned into three vowel harmony groups by a parameter called ATR (advanced tongue root); <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> ATR, +ATR, and neutral. This alignment {{seems to have}} superseded an alignment according to oral backness. However, some scholars still describe Mongolian as being characterized by a distinction between front vowels and back vowels, and the front vowel spellings 'ö' and 'ü' are still often used in the West to indicate two vowels which were historically front. The Mongolian vowel system also has rounding harmony.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010–2011 {{academic}} year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 300registered student organizations. Among <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, {{personal interest}} organizations, sports clubs, and student government agencies. These clubs and organizations {{run the gamut}} from sailing to Ultimate Frisbee, from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild, from political organizations to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $9million that is then given to student government for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances other student life programs, including career fairs, the University Press, OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> alerted for {{movement}} overseas {{in the summer}} of 1945, but with the Japanese surrender, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> inactivated on 17 October 1945.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1980 and registered as a charity in 1988. In 2006 <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> awarded <b>the</b> Queen's Award for Voluntary Service.|$|R

5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups are individuals that shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, {{ranging in size from}} two individuals to nine. Females within <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E
25|$|After the prelude, {{there is}} usually an {{announcement}} {{of the number of}} number-groups in the message, the page to be used from the one-time pad, or other pertinent information. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> then recited. Groups are usually either four or five digits or radio-alphabet letters. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> typically repeated, either by reading each group twice or by repeating the entire message as a whole.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> BA-20 <b>Group</b> <b>is</b> {{situated}} {{a few kilometers}} to {{the northeast}} of the site core and includes four platforms dating to the Late Preclassic. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> already abandoned by the time Río Azul reached its maximum extent; no Early Classic remains {{have been found in}} the vicinity of BA-20. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>was</b> reinhabited during <b>the</b> Late Classic, with the general repopulation of Río Azul and <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have housed some 2500 people between the AD 692 and 830. The total area covered by <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be 7 to 8 km2, of which mapping and test excavations covered just 0.8 km2. In the mapped area, archaeologists recorded 275 structures and 30 chultunob.
