It has also been suggested that since it is not consciously perceived, it may make people feel vaguely <b>that</b> <b>odd</b> or supernatural events are taking place. Engineer Vic Tandy provided such an explanation in his investigations in the 1980s. Tandy, while working in his laboratory, started to feel uneasy and as if a supernatural presence was with him. Later, he could attribute these feelings to a broken metal fan that was causing noises of a frequency that triggered them. The noise could not be perceived by the human ear, but Tandy's body reacted to the 19Hz sounds.|$|E
500|$|At Game Informer, Matt Bertz {{gave the}} game a 7.25/10 score {{and wrote a}} mixed review. Bertz complimented the changes made to {{certain parts of the}} gameplay, saying that [...] "shooting, passing and {{checking}} are all solid," [...] although he felt <b>that</b> <b>odd</b> puck pickups and player pivots slowed down the game speed. He felt that EASHL was the game's standout mode that featured improvements with new customization options for players and teams, but also felt that these options were limited. Bertz criticized the lack of an in-depth career mode, comparing the NHL 17 Be a Pro mode to the story-driven NBA 2K MyCareer mode, which he enjoyed more. He finished his review stating that the developers continue to make only [...] "minor improvements across the board, yet the NHL series has yet to tap its true potential this generation." ...|$|E

The first two charted on the US Billboard 200, reaching number 171 and 122, respectively. Several songs have been recorded {{with the purpose of}} a single or album release, and have not been featured on the show. For example, the song [...] "My Tidy Whities" [...] written by Tom Kenny and Andy Paley was released only for the album The Best Day Ever (2006). Kenny's inspiration for the song was [...] "underwear humor". Kenny said, [...] "Underwear humor is always a surefire laugh-getter with kids ... Just seeing a character <b>that</b> <b>odd</b> wearing really prosaic, normal, Kmart, three-to-a-pack underwear is a funny drawing ... We thought it was funny to make a really lush, beautiful love song to his underwear". The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie – Music from the Movie and More..., a soundtrack album featuring the score of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, was released along with the feature-length film in November 2004. Various artists including the Flaming Lips, Wilco, Ween, Motörhead, the Shins, and Avril Lavigne contributed to the soundtrack that reached number 76 on the US Billboard 200.|$|E

500|$|Writing in London's Evening Standard on 5 January 2011, media {{commentator}} Roy Greenslade {{expressed concern}} {{over a number}} of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning Yeates' landlord, Jefferies, following his arrest, describing the coverage as [...] "character assassination on a large scale". He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published, including a headline in The Sun describing Jefferies– a former schoolmaster at Clifton College– as weird, posh, lewd and creepy; a story from the Daily Express quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as [...] "... a sort of Nutty Professor" [...] who made them feel [...] "creeped out" [...] by his [...] "strange" [...] behaviour; and an article from the Daily Telegraph, which reported Jefferies [...] "has been described by pupils at Clifton College ... as a fan of dark and violent avant-garde films". Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 April– The Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Daily Star, the Daily Express, the Daily Mail and the Daily Record– seeking damages for libel. It was held that the media were quick to jump to conclusions regarding Jefferies' arrest. Being a retired English teacher who lived alone, whose physical appearance and [...] "eccentrically unkempt white hair," [...] made him stand out, led people to believe that he looked the type. As Stephen Moss would write in The Guardian: [...] "The unspoken assumption was that no one could look <b>that</b> <b>odd</b> and be innocent." ...|$|E
500|$|The OF Tape Vol. 2 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone stated that the album contained a [...] "fizzy energy that elevates it above its limitations", musing <b>that</b> <b>Odd</b> Future were a lot like [...] "early Wu-Tang, a thrilling regional act, and a bunch of whip-smart black hipsters whose worldview is grounded in their corner of sun-baked [...] southern California." [...] PopMatters's Jeff Dunn felt that every member improved from their past mixtapes, stating that Ocean, Tyler, and Sweatshirt were all impressive, consistently [...] "spitting dizzying, more original lines than they ever have on mixtapes past." [...] Dunn wrote that [...] "after the mixed returns of Goblin, Tyler himself now seems to realize that less is more on his part", who [...] "wisely tones down the shock-for-shock’s-sake rhymes quite a bit, making his appearances all the more rewarding when they do occur." [...] Steve Labate of Paste mused that [...] "while Odd Future’s critics try hard to frame them as such, it’s difficult to accept Tyler and the OF crew as mere shock artists, flippantly tossing off incendiary slurs for attention—the music is too tongue-in-cheek clever, too brainy and self-aware, too anything-goes eccentric." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{theme song}} for Homicide: Life on the Street was {{composed}} by Lynn F. Kowal, who submitted {{one of several}} tapes sent to the producers for consideration. Homicide producers initially had trouble finding the right song, and Levinson ultimately chose Kowal's themes because, {{while most of the}} candidates too closely resembled typical television theme songs, Levinson felt Kowal's song [...] "had <b>that</b> <b>odd</b> quality to it, drums or whatever, and it was very unusual". Music is presented in various ways throughout the first season of Homicide. Some songs are played on radios that play in the homicide squad room, like [...] "Lay Down My Life" [...] by Carole King, [...] "Texas Slide" [...] by Jean-Jacques Milteau, [...] "N.Y.C (Can You Believe This City?)" [...] by Charles & Eddie, [...] "Little Boy Blues" [...] and [...] "Break Up" [...] by , and [...] "Tropic Call" [...] by Mitchell Coodley and Andrew Snitzer, all of which are featured in [...] "Night of the Dead Living". Other songs are more integrated into the show itself, like [...] "Hazy Shade of Blue", a Tor Hyams song that plays while the police raid several neighborhood homes in search of clues during [...] "Ghost of a Chance", and the hymn [...] "The Sweet By and By", which is sung at a church during Adena Watson's funeral in that same episode. Several other songs are featured in episodes throughout the first season, including [...] "Elephant Walk" [...] by The Kings, [...] "The Beat Goes On" [...] by Sonny Bono, [...] "Going' Around in Circles" [...] by Jules Taub, [...] "Telephone Blues" [...] by Sam Ling and George Smith, and [...] "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" [...] by Freddie Perren and Christine Yarian.|$|E

Or maybe for a few seasons past." [...] Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that [...] "the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated". Michael Kuchwara of the Associated Press found the show to be [...] "visually striking [...] musically adventurous", but noted that [...] "the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development".

2500|$|Joseph Shipman {{showed in}} 2007 that the {{assumption}} <b>that</b> <b>odd</b> degree polynomials have roots {{is stronger than}} necessary; any field in which polynomials of prime degree have roots is algebraically closed (so [...] "odd" [...] can be replaced by [...] "odd prime" [...] and furthermore this holds for fields of all characteristics). For axiomatization of algebraically closed fields, {{this is the best}} possible, as there are counterexamples if a single prime is excluded. However, these counterexamples rely on −1 having a square root. If we take a field where −1 has no square root, and every polynomial of degree n∈I has a root, where I is any fixed infinite set of odd numbers, then every polynomial f(x) of odd degree has a root (since [...] has a root, where k is chosen so that [...] ). Mohsen Aliabadi [...] generalized Shipman's result for any field in 2013, proving that the sufficient condition for an arbitrary field (of any characteristic) to be algebraically closed is having a root for any polynomial of prime degree.|$|E

Rather, computers should are be viewed as active assistants to every-day human activities that help us; i. e. watch what we watch and point out what we might have missed. So instead of teaching hello world the canonical example first presented to students should be hello [...] <b>that′s</b> <b>odd</b> Hello [...] . <b>that’s</b> <b>odd</b> was inspired by Lucy Stein’s interaction per-spective [11, 12]. She claims that hello world reflects a von Neumann view of serial computing where “computation {{is the process of}} executing those steps – the algorithm – to deduce the answer to a particular question”. Stein argues convincingly that this von Neumann view is an incomplete model of modern computing where “computation as a living, breathing thing that exists and coexists in a dynamic continuous parallel world”. For example, even building a simple spreadsheet with standard business software is an exploratory task where users explore alternate scenarios and different lay-outs to discover the best way to analyze and present business knowledge. Her preferred canonical introductory example is while true {echo() } i. e. an ongoing process which samples its environment and re-sponds to it.

2500|$|Although {{reportedly}} [...] "dismissed by most {{critics as}} 'strange' and 'unintelligible'" [...] {{at the time}} of its release, the film received positive reviews from 71% of 34 surveyed critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Bill Cosford of The Miami Herald praised it as [...] "an unusual film": [...] "Its comedy springs from <b>that</b> <b>odd</b> combination of self-effacement and self-absorption that characterized some of the Saturday Night Live characters and continues to provide Bill Murray with work. And though Buckaroo Banzai is basically a comic strip, it's also relentlessly hip, hipper even than it is goofy." [...] Cosford added, [...] "There are inside jokes and 'quotations' from movies, television and pop music, and there's lots of weird activity on the edges of the film, so much that I suspect Banzai might even be rewarding the second time around. First or second, the film defies easy explanation. But it's anarchic comedy for the 1980s, closest in spirit to the Marx Brothers as they might have been if they grown up on themselves, and had had the benefit of post-Star Wars special effects. It's also adventure in the Buck Rogers mold, the aliens employing a wide array of weaponry, including Arachnids From Space, the good guys fighting back from a mobile command post aboard the Cavaliers' doubledecker tour bus. The pace of both jokes and action is that of Airplane!, and to say much more is only to spoil the fun." ...|$|E
