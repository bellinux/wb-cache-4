40|$|Meter Company's N- 2 ARPS-A 6, Style D power {{supplies}}. When manufactured, {{the power}} supplies utilized Thomas and Betts TC 105 A aluminum wire tie holders in random numbers and placements. As the power supplies age, the tie wrap holder adhesive degrades and the <b>tie</b> <b>wraps</b> embrittle {{resulting in the}} separation of the <b>tie</b> <b>wraps</b> and loss of holder adhesion to the power supply enclosure. This causes the wraps and holders to fall {{to the bottom of the}} enclosure which could result in shorts when the aluminum comes in contact with electronic components. In one particular power supply, all tie wrap holders in use failed and separated from the enclosure. The power supplies are used in Foxboro SPEC- 200 cabinetry that are used throughout the industry. At the time of this notification, Integrated Resources has one power supply from Three Mile Island and two power supplies from Ft. Calhoun undergoing refurbishment.

50|$|The Prusik is <b>tied</b> by <b>wrapping</b> the prusik loop (see Double fisherman's knot) {{around the}} rope {{a number of}} times, usually 3-5 times {{depending}} on the materials, and then back through itself, forming a barrel around the rope with a tail hanging out the middle. When the tail is weighted, the turns tighten and make {{a bend in the}} rope. When weight is removed, the loop can be moved along the rope by placing a hand directly on the barrel and pushing. Breaking the Prusik free from the rope after it has been weighted can be difficult, however, and is easiest done by pushing the bow, the loop of cord which runs from the top wrap over the knot to the bottom wrap, along the tail a little.

50|$|The track {{consists}} of steel rail resting on concrete supports via rubberised cork absorption pads with galvanised steel <b>tie</b> beams which <b>wrap</b> around the concrete members {{rather than being}} cast into the concrete as with other ladder tracks. The track is modular and precast, rather than being cast in situ. Modular turnouts are also produced.

The ballastless and modular nature of the track makes it advantageous for both wet and desert conditions where ballast degradation is problematic, as well as in mines where transportation of the track components is simplified. Since the rail is continuously supported rail stresses are less; a 34 tonne axle load version has been designed and lighter rails can be used compared to sleepered track, additionally maintenance costs of ballast are reduced.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I present novel {{strategies}} for controlling objects with high {{degrees of freedom}} {{for the purpose of}} robotic control and computer animation, including articulated objects such as human bodies or robots and deformable objects such as ropes and cloth. Such control is required for common daily movements such as folding arms, <b>tying</b> ropes, <b>wrapping</b> objects and putting on clothes. Although there is demand in computer graphics and animation for generating such scenes, little work has targeted these problems. The difficulty of solving such problems are due to the following two factors: (1) The complexity of the planning algorithms: The computational costs of the methods that are currently available increase exponentially with respect to the degrees of freedom of the objects and therefore they cannot be applied for full human body structures, ropes and clothes. (2) Lack of abstract descriptors for complex tasks. Models for quantitatively describing the progress of tasks such as wrapping and knotting are absent for animation generation. In this work, we employ the concept of a task-centric manifold to quantitatively describe complex tasks, and incorporate a bi-mapping scheme to bridge this manifold and the configuration space of the controlled objects, called an object-centric manifold. The control problem is solved by first projecting the controlled object onto the task-centric manifold, then getting the next ideal state of the scenario by local planning, and finally projecting the state back to the object-centric manifold to get the desirable state of the controlled object. Using this scheme, complex movements that previously required global path planning can be synthesised by local path planning. Under this framework, we show the applications in various fields. An interpolation algorithm for arbitrary postures of human character is first proposed. Second, a control scheme is suggested in generating Furoshiki wraps with different styles. Finally, new models and planning methods are given for quantitatively control for wrapping/ unwrapping and dressing/undressing problems...|$|R
5000|$|A tie pin (or tiepin, {{also known}} as a stick pin/stickpin) is a neckwear-controlling device, {{originally}} worn by wealthy English gentlemen to secure the folds of their cravats. They were first popularized {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century. Cravats were made of silk, satin, lace and lightly starched cambric, lawn and muslin, and stickpins were necessary accoutrements to keep these expensive fabrics in place and safe. Stickpins commonly used pearls and other precious gemstones set in gold or other precious metals and were designed specifically for their owners. By the 1860s, wearing cravats had been embraced by the English upper middle classes with a consequently lower quality of materials and designs used in both the neckwear and in the stickpins used to keep it in place. By the 1870s Americans had embraced stickpins and designs were mass-produced and included animal heads, horse shoes, knife and fork motifs, crossed pipes, wishbones, bugs, flowers, shields and a host of other figural motifs. By the 1890s stickpins had crossed gender lines as women began wearing them with sporting outfits worn for bicycling, boating, riding, tennis and golf. The Ascot, Four in Hand, Sailor scarf, cravat bow <b>tie</b> and <b>wrapped</b> scarf all became popular for both men and women, and all could be set off with an [...] stickpin. Between 1894 and 1930 many patents were issued covering such issues as prong setting, ornament attachment, stickpin blanks, safety clutches, guards and decorations. One patent was for a brooch which could convert the center medallion to a stickpin. Another concealed a small lead pencil point attached to the shaft of the pin. Still another included a small water reservoir behind the ornamental head of the stick pin in which a flower blossom could be placed. Patent 1,301,568 dated April 22, 1919 was for a luminous stickpin with a star motif disk-like head which held a small drop of radioactive material.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this investigation, {{an attempt}} was made to study the {{flexural}} and plastic hinge behaviour of reinforced concrete beams confined with GFRP wraps and polyolefin fiber addition in critical regions(plastic hinge zone) along with stirrup confinement. The variables are the number of layers and chopped/woven type of wrapping, which controls the behaviour of the GFRP, and the percentage of polyolefin addition. The programme consisted of casting and testing 20 rectangular reinforced concrete beams of the size of 150 mm × 230 mm × 2000 mm, under a symmetrical two point loading. During the casting of the beams, the middle one third 600 mm of the beams were cast with polyolefin fibers concrete, of volume fractions 0. 3 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 7 %, 0. 9 % and 1. 2 %. After the curing of the beams, glass fiber mats along with polyester resin were wrapped over the beams in the plastic hinge zone (critical zone) for 600 mm length; i. e., 300 mm from the centre on each side. Polyolefin fiber addition to the lateral tie and GFRP confined beams has the advantage over the confinement by the lateral <b>ties</b> and FRP <b>wrap</b> in improving the performance under large deformations...|$|R
50|$|The myth {{comes from}} the oral {{tradition}} of Chiloé Island, an island of the southern coast of Chile. In its physical manifestation it is a grotesquely disfigured being that has been sutured, <b>tied,</b> bound and <b>wrapped</b> from birth. In this way, its orifices are sown shut, its tongue is removed or split, its extremities and sexual organ bound and immobilised. It is then kept as a guardian to a cave. It {{is the product of}} magic and witchcraft. It is the incarnation of the very realistic fears we feel as children, when monsters, magic and imaginings all seem real - they are the deeply rooted fears that, despite rationalisation, remain present (albeit dormant) in the recesses of the subconscious. In the novel, the intellectual/spatial manifestation of the Imbunche is the self-imposed alienation from the outside world, i.e. an adoption of the ideal of the physical Imbunche in terms of space, with the purpose of taking away the power that others have over the individual and choosing a life of non-existence. This auto-segregation is achieved by fortifying one’s living space, i.e. sealing off all the entrances (like the Imbunche’s, metaphorically speaking). This seclusion from the outside world is a form of self-preservation from an oppressive and anti-individualistic society. Later on in the novel, a reversal from the state of Imbunche begins, with the recuperation of one’s own name - the word that represents the concept of an individual. Ironically, the re-discovery of the self here depends on being acknowledged by the outside world, to be named by others.|$|R
