This paper proposes a typical structure named the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter. The structural characteristics and working principle of the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter was introduced in detail, the prototype of the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter was designed and processed, and the calibration tests and pressure experiments of the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter prototype was made at last. We can draw that the three gear flow-meter {{can be used in}} hydraulic system pressure range is less than 25 Mpa, the flow rate was 0. 15 ~ 0. 2 m 3 /h can meet the high requirements of the stability of measurement, and the measurement accuracy in the whole flow range is 0. 2 class. This article provides a reliable experimental data for the design of the micro gear flow-meter...|$|R

50|$|The <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> in {{the picture}} has 42 teeth. The gear ratio between the idler and <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> is thus 42/21, or 2:1, and hence the final gear ratio is 1.62x2≈3.23. For every 3.23 {{revolutions}} of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns one revolution, or for every one revolution of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns 0.31 (1/3.23) revolution, a total reduction of about 1:3.23 (Gear Reduction Ratio (GRR) = 1/Gear Ratio (GR)).|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the efficacy of alar batten graft in correcting internal and external nasal valve collapse (i. <b>n.</b> <b>v.</b> and e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.)</b> and evaluate the functional and aesthetic results. From July 2006 to September 2008, 80 patients (54 females and 26 males) underwent alar batten cartilage grafting. The patients were divided into three groups: (1) 55 patients with iatrogenic nasal valve collapse (80 % i. <b>n.</b> <b>v.,</b> 20 % e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.),</b> (2) 15 patients with posttraumatic nasal valve collapse (45 % i. <b>n.</b> <b>v.,</b> 55 % e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.),</b> and (3) 10 patients with congenital nasal valve collapse (100 % e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.).</b> Patients were evaluated at 6, 12, 24, and some at 36 months after surgery. The final follow-up was at least 24 months. The results of this study revealed a significant increase in the size of the aperture at the internal or external nasal valve after the application of alar batten grafts. All the patients noted improvement in their nasal airway breathing and in their cosmetic appearance. No major complication was observed. The alar batten graft is a simple, versatile technique for long-term reshaping, repositioning, and reconstruction of the nasal valve collapse...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{correspondence}} P associates {{to every}} subset A ⊆ N a partition P (A) of A and to every game (<b>N,</b> <b>v),</b> the P -restricted game (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> ¯) defined by v ¯ (A) = ∑ F ∈ P (A) v (F) for all A ⊆ N. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on P to have inheritance of convexity from (<b>N,</b> <b>v)</b> to (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> ¯). The main condition is a cyclic intersecting sequence free condition. As a consequence, we {{only need to}} verify inheritance of convexity for unanimity games and for the small class of extremal convex games (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> S) (for any 0 ̸ ≠ S ⊆ N) defined for any A ⊆ <b>N</b> by <b>v</b> S (A) = | A ∩ S | − 1 if A ∩ S ≠ 0 ̸, and v S (A) = 0 otherwise. In particular, when (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> ¯) corresponds to Myerson’s network-restricted game, inheritance of convexity can be verified by this way. For the P min correspondence (P min (A) is built by deleting edges of minimum weight in the subgraph G A of a weighted communication graph G), we show that inheritance of convexity for unanimity games already implies inheritance of convexit...|$|R

5000|$|The {{shifting}} sequence {{was very}} different and much rougher than the Hydra-Matics that preceded it, or the Super Turbines and Turbo Hydramatics that followed it. The shift from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd range was long and drawn-out, ending with a harsh shift. The reason for this was that three things were happening. Not only was the transmission shifting to a very much higher range ( [...] 2.93 to 1.56, {{but it was also}} simultaneously emptying the fluid coupling and making a mechanical lock-up. The wide gap in the reduction ratio between first and second gears combined with the direct mechanical connection to the engine to create a shift that could be firm enough to lug the engine. Because of the mechanical lock-up, there was sometimes a shudder felt as the transmission shifted into <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> (fourth range) by refilling the fluid coupling. Direct drive (1:1 ratio) is achieved by splitting engine power between the fluid coupling (used for first gear) and the front clutch (used for second gear), which are both applied to provide <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> effectively locking the planetary gearsets and forcing them to spin at engine speed. The design is unique in that it provides <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> by applying first and second gears at the same time.|$|R
