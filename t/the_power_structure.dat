5|$|After {{the decades}} of {{political}} disappointments, the February Revolution offered the Finnish Social Democrats momentum for power; they held the absolute majority in the Parliament. The conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists' might since 1899, with the climax in 1917 without the offsetting control of Russian administration; the Social Democrats had to be halted before {{they were able to}} markedly alter <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{assimilation}} was not {{as strongly}} implemented in the German dominions of Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden, and the Baltic dominions (Estonia and Livonia). In Germany, Charles found himself being opposed by the Estates there. He was also bound by {{the law of the}} German emperor and the peace treaty. In the Baltic, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>structure</b> was completely different, with a German-descended nobility that used serfs, something that Charles abhorred and wanted to abolish but was unable to.

5|$|The main {{goals of}} the terror was to destroy <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>structure</b> of the enemy, clear and secure the areas governed and {{occupied}} by the armies. Another goal was to create shock and fear among the civil population and the enemy soldiers. In the Finnish case, the common troopers' paramilitary nature and lack of combat skills, led to use political violence as a military weapon. The terror achieved some of the objectives, but also gave additional motivation to fight against an enemy perceived to be inhuman and cruel. The Red and White propaganda utilized the acts of the opponent effectively, which increased the local killings and the spiral of revenge.|$|E
5|$|Despite their defeat by Selim I and the Ottomans in 1517, the Mamluks {{remained}} {{influential in}} Egyptian society, becoming beys ("chieftains"), nominally {{under the control}} of the Ottoman governors, instead of amirs at the head of an empire. The first governor of Egypt under Selim I was Khai'r Bey, a Mamluk amir who had defected to the Ottomans during the Battle of Marj Dabiq. Though the Mamluks launched multiple revolts to reinstate their Sultanate, including two in 1523, the Ottomans refrained from completely destroying the Mamluk hold over <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>structure</b> of Egypt. The Mamluks did suffer losses—both economic and military—in the immediate aftermath of the Ottoman victory, and this was reflected in the lack of financial assistance provided to al-Azhar in the first hundred years of Ottoman rule. By the 18th century the Mamluk elite had regained much of its influence and began to sponsor numerous renovations throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar specifically.|$|E

25|$|As for {{the reasons}} of Castillo in staying neutral, there are several {{interpretation}}s. One interpretation focuses on the Argentine tradition of neutrality. Others see Castillo as a nationalist, not being influenced by <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>structure</b> in Buenos Aires (since he was from Catamarca), so, {{with the support of}} the army, he could simply defy the pressure to join the Allies. A similar perspective considers instead that Castillo simply had no power to go against the wishes of the army, and if he declared war he would be deposed in a military coup. A third interpretation considers that only the United States wanted Argentina to declare war, whereas the United Kingdom was benefited by Argentine neutrality because the country was able to supply the British with livestock. This interpretation, however, fails to acknowledge the constant requests to declare war from Anglophile factions. Most likely, it was a combination of the desires of the British diplomacy and the Argentine army, which prevailed over the pro-war factions.|$|E
25|$|The New Industrial State {{not only}} {{provided}} Galbraith with another best-selling book, it also extended once again, {{the currency of}} institutionalist economic thought. The book also filled a very pressing need in the late 1960s. The conventional theory of monopoly power in economic life maintains that the monopolist will attempt to restrict supply {{in order to maintain}} price above its competitive level. The social cost of this monopoly power is a decrease in both allocative efficiency and the equity of income distribution. This conventional economic analysis of the role of monopoly power did not adequately address popular concern about the large corporation in the late 1960s. The growing concern focused {{on the role of the}} corporation in politics, the damage done to the natural environment by an unmitigated commitment to economic growth, and the perversion of advertising and other pecuniary aspects of culture. The New Industrial State gave a plausible explanation of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>structure</b> involved in generating these problems and found a very receptive audience among the rising American counterculture and political activists.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies price {{coordination}} {{problem in}} a three-echelon supply chain composed of a single supplier, a single manufacturer and a single retailer.

Murasaki taught Chinese to Shōshi who was interested in Chinese art and Juyi's ballads. Upon becoming Empress, Shōshi installed screens decorated with Chinese script, causing outrage because written Chinese was considered the language of men, far removed from the women's quarters. The study of Chinese was thought to be unladylike and went against the notion that only men should have access to the literature. Women were supposed to read and write only in Japanese, which separated them through language from government and <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>structure.</b> Murasaki, with her unconventional classical Chinese education, {{was one of the few}} women available to teach Shōshi classical Chinese. Bowring writes it was [...] "almost subversive" [...] that Murasaki knew Chinese and taught the language to Shōshi.

500|$|The Berlin Conference of 1884 {{assigned}} the territory to Germany {{as part of}} German East Africa, marking {{the beginning of the}} colonial era. The explorer Gustav Adolf von Götzen was the first European to significantly explore the country in 1894; he crossed from the south-east to Lake Kivu and met the king. The Germans did not significantly alter the social structure of the country, but exerted influence by supporting the king and the existing hierarchy and delegating power to local chiefs. [...] Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi in 1916, during World War I, beginning a period of more direct colonial rule. Belgium ruled both Rwanda and Burundi as a League of Nations 'mandate' called Ruanda-Urundi; the Belgians also simplified and centralised <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>structure,</b> and introduced large-scale projects in education, health, public works, and agricultural supervision, including new crops and improved agricultural techniques to try to reduce the incidence of famine. Both the Germans and the Belgians promoted Tutsi supremacy, considering the Hutu and Tutsi different races. In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the classes.|$|E
500|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>structure</b> within the Germanic societies in Poland and elsewhere {{can be traced}} to some degree by examining the [...] "princely" [...] graves - burials of chiefs, and even hereditary princes, as the consolidation of power progressed. Those appear {{from the beginning of the}} Common Era and are located away from ordinary cemeteries, singly or in small groups. The bodies were inhumed in wooden coffins and covered with kurgans, or interred in wooden or stone chambers. Luxurious Roman-made gifts and fancy barbarian emulations (such as silver and gold clasps with springs, created with an unsurpassed attention to detail, dated 3rd century AD from Wrocław Zakrzów), but not weapons, were placed in the graves. The 1st and 2nd century burials of this type, occurring all the way from Jutland to Lesser Poland, are referred to as princely graves Lubieszewo type, after Lubieszewo, Gryfice County in western Pomerania, where six such burials were found. On the 3rd and 4th century sites two types of princely graves are distinguished. The Zakrzów type, named after the location of three very rich stone chamber burials found in Wrocław Zakrzów occur in southern Poland, while in the northern and central parts of the country the Rostołty (Białystok County) type kurgans are rather common. At some sites, believed to be dynastic necropolises, the princes were buried in generation long time increments. During the late Roman period the princely burials are fewer in number, but they get increasingly more elaborate.|$|E
