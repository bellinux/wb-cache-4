5000|$|In 1986 Oliver Saari {{was awarded}} a patent for a <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> roller screw, {{commonly}} referred to by its trademark, Spiracon. [...] This type matches the orbit of the rollers to {{the rotation of the}} nut assembly. The actuator contains more load transfer elements than the other types, a <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> and <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings,</b> but manufacture of component parts is relatively simple (e.g. gearing teeth may be eliminated).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the other}} roller screw types above, loads are {{transferred}} from the nut through the rollers to the screw (or in the reverse order). In this type of actuator, <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> and a freely rotating internally grooved <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> transfer loads between the rollers and the nut.|$|R
50|$|The screw has a multi-start thread. The rollers and {{encapsulating}} {{rotating ring}} are identically grooved, not threaded, {{so there is}} no axial movement between the two. The nut assembly includes a cylindrical housing capped by non-rotating spacer rings. The spacer rings have equidistant holes that act as rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. Roller-type <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> between the spacer <b>rings</b> and <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> permit free rotation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> while transferring the axial load between the two.|$|R
50|$|This type of mill {{consists}} of two types of rings separated {{by a series of}} large balls, like a <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing.</b> The lower <b>ring</b> rotates, while the upper ring presses down on the balls via a set of spring and adjuster assemblies, or pressurised rams. The material to be pulverized is introduced into the center or side of the pulverizer (depending on the design). As the lower ring rotates, the balls to orbit between the upper and lower rings, and balls roll over the bed of coal on the lower ring. The pulverized material is carried out of the mill by the flow of air moving through it. The size of the pulverized particles released from the grinding section of the mill is determined by a classifier separator. If the coal is fine enough to be picked up by the air, it is carried through the classifier. Coarser particles return to be further pulverized.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> have included: (a) the porous aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> containing a porous pad and (b) the inherently compensated compliant surface aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> containing a thin elastomer layer. Both these developments {{have been reported}} to improve the bearing load capacity compared to conventional aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> with rigid surfaces. This development is carried one stage further in a porous and compliant aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> incorporating both a porous pad and an opposing compliant surface. The thin elastomer layer forming the compliant surface is bonded to a rigid backing and is of a soft rubber like material. Such a bearing is studied experimentally and theoretically under steady state operating conditions. A mathematical model is presented to predict the bearing performance. In this model is a simplified solution to the elasticity equations for deflections of the compliant surface. Account is also taken of deflections in the porous pad due to the pressure difference across its thickness. The lubrication equations for flow in the porous pad and bearing clearance are solved by numerical finite difference methods. An iteration procedure is used to couple deflections of the compliant surface and porous pad with solutions to the lubrication equations. Comparisons between experimental results and theoretically predicted bearing performance are in good agreement. However these results show that the porous and compliant aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> performance is lower than that of a porous aerostatic <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> with a rigid surface in place of the compliant surface. This discovery is accounted to the recess formed in the bearing clearance by deflections of the compliant surface and its effect on flow through the porous pad...|$|R
