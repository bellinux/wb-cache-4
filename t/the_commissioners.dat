5|$|The Board of Commissioners {{consists}} of three commissioners who are elected county-wide in staggered terms. Each serves a four-year term. One of <b>the</b> <b>commissioners,</b> typically the most senior, serves {{as president of the}} board. <b>The</b> <b>commissioners</b> manage the budget set forth by the council, the collection of revenue, enact and repeal ordinances, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government. <b>The</b> <b>commissioners</b> hold public meetings twice each month to discuss issues affecting the public and receive community input. In 2013 <b>the</b> <b>commissioners</b> were George Ethridge, District 1 (R); Kenny Saulman, District 2 (R); James Klinstiver, District 3 (R).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Commissioners</b> {{were given}} by the state {{additional}} powers to build and maintain approaches {{to the park and}} other parks as well, this allowed <b>the</b> <b>commissioners</b> to build a series of boulevards around the city. Western Avenue from the northwestern corner of Washington Park to the location of the toll gate of the Western Turnpike was under the purview of <b>the</b> <b>commissioners.</b> Work on the road began in late 1876 and was finished the next year. The total construction cost of the park, including purchasing the real estate and improving Western Avenue, was $1,073,020.91. In 1878 Northern Boulevard (today Manning Boulevard) was constructed by <b>the</b> <b>commissioners,</b> it extended from the western end of their jurisdiction on Western Avenue north and east to the intersection of Clinton and Central avenues. In 1896 the state legislature also gave <b>the</b> <b>commissioners</b> authority over Lake Avenue from the park corner at Madison Avenue south to New Scotland Avenue (then- Albany, Schoharie, and Rensselaerville Plank Road). In addition to boulevards <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> of Washington Park also gained control of other existing parks, and built new ones throughout the city, including Academy Park, Bleeker Park, Hudson Avenue Park, Clinton Square, Rensselaer Park, St. Joseph's Park, Townsend Park, Beaver Park (later Lincoln Park), and the former grounds of the Dudley Observatory. In 1900 the board of commissioners was transformed into the Bureau of Parks in the Department of Public Works and later the bureau became a separate department.|$|E
5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had different ideas. Nichols was seen as too closely identified with the wartime Manhattan Project; he had opinions at variance with <b>the</b> <b>commissioners</b> on whether the Director of Military Applications was a staff or a line position; {{and he had a}} strong disagreement with <b>the</b> <b>commissioners</b> over the vexing issue of which agency should hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided to find another candidate.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for Older People for Northern Ireland {{is set up}} as a non-departmental public body, {{established}} by <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner</b> for Older People Act (Northern Ireland) 2011. <b>The</b> <b>Commissioner</b> {{has a number of}} legal functions and powers directly linked to <b>the</b> legislation. <b>The</b> <b>Commissioner's</b> office is sponsored by the Executive Office of Northern Ireland. <b>The</b> <b>Commissioner</b> is independent and the principal aim of her office is to safeguard and promote the interests of older people. <b>The</b> current <b>Commissioner</b> for Older People for Northern Ireland is Claire Keatinge.|$|R
5|$|The lower {{sections}} of the canal were given to <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> for Sewers, {{for use as a}} drainage ditch. The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966, while the branches to the dairy at Bason Bridge and the Highbridge Wharf lasted until 1972.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, {{the owner}} Major Richard Winstanley {{was unable to}} pay for the upkeep of the castle and, {{concerned}} about its deteriorating condition, proposed placing the property into the guardianship of <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> of Works. Following a survey by the architect Sir Frank Baines, which showed the ruins to need immediate repairs, <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> took over the castle the following year. It was restored by Sir Charles Peers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments, between 1912 and 1913. He stripped away any remains of the farm, cleared the vegetation from the walls and repaired the brickwork, re-cutting the moat and reconstructing a replica of the medieval bridge.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century the Glastonbury Canal {{drainage}} problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town's economy became depressed. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854. The lower sections of the canal were given to <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> for Sewers, for use as a drainage ditch. The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966.|$|E
50|$|Executive branch {{positions}} {{may vary}} by state but are primarily mirrors of that state's elected offices. For example, in Maine, the positions include governor, and governor's cabinet, including: the Attorney General, the State Treasurer, <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner</b> of Economic Development, <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner</b> of Education, <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner</b> of Human Services, and <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner</b> of Natural Resources.|$|R

5|$|Debts {{continued}} to increase, as <b>the</b> <b>commissioners</b> borrowed {{more money to}} fund the improvements. The new weir and lock at Pickerings failed in 1761 and both had to be rebuilt. Work had started on Witton Brook in 1756, but the plans were revised in 1764 to increase the navigable depth to , and this work was completed in 1765.|$|E
5|$|During World War I the South Arklow Lightvessel Guillemot, {{operated}} by <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> of Irish Lights, had given warning of a U-boat. In consequence on 28 March 1917 UC-65 surfaced, ordered the crew into their lifeboat, and sank the Guillemot. Against this background {{the sinking of}} Irish Oak became a hotly debated issue.|$|E
5|$|Englewood Place and Thurlow Terrace were {{constructed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> of Washington Park and maintained by them for some time, {{with half the}} maintenance cost assessed on the private property facing the street.

50|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner,</b> <b>the</b> Assistant <b>Commissioners</b> were {{sworn in}} as Justices of the Peace, {{although}} they could not try criminal cases. This continued until 1973. Like <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner,</b> <b>the</b> Assistant <b>Commissioners</b> were mainly appointed from outside the police {{until well into the}} 20th century, although career police officers could and sometimes did rise to the rank.|$|R
5|$|Following their appointment, the President {{appoints}} {{a number}} of Vice-Presidents (the High Representative is mandated {{to be one of}} them) from among <b>the</b> <b>commissioners.</b> For the most part, the position grants little extra power to Vice-Presidents, except the first Vice-President who stands in for the President when he is away.|$|E
5|$|Fort Belvedere {{was largely}} unoccupied during the 20 years {{following}} Edward's abdication. The fort {{was used by}} the Office of <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> of Crown Lands, who had been evacuated from their central London offices during World War II. After the war, the house remained empty.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the First Civil War, the Long Parliament recognized that they would need assistance from the Scots. In return for a military alliance, the Scottish Parliament required the English to sign the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643, which stipulated that the English would bring their church into greater conformity with the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament sent commissioners to London to represent Scotland's interests to the English Parliament. Eleven of these, four theologians and seven members of Parliament, were also invited to the Assembly. <b>The</b> <b>commissioners</b> were given the opportunity to become full voting members of the Assembly but declined, preferring to maintain their independence as commissioners of their own nation and church. Samuel Rutherford, George Gillespie, and Alexander Henderson were the most outspoken of <b>the</b> <b>commissioners.</b>|$|E

25|$|Jones filed {{a lawsuit}} in Pulaski County Circuit Court against <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner</b> and Flowers, alleging that <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner's</b> failure to provide notice of the tax sale and of Jones' right to redeem {{resulted}} in the taking of his property without due process. <b>The</b> <b>Commissioner</b> and Flowers moved for summary judgment {{on the ground that}} the two unclaimed letters sent by <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner</b> were a constitutionally adequate attempt at notice, and Jones filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner</b> and Flowers, concluding that the Arkansas tax sale statute, which set forth the notice procedure followed by <b>the</b> <b>Commissioner,</b> complied with constitutional due process requirements.|$|R
5|$|In 1723, <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float Sluice, a timber {{lock on the}} lower river. He built a dovetailed sheet pile wall below the foundations, and <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> offered him the job of maintaining the levels in 1725, for which he would be paid Â£65 per year. He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years. Silting of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s. Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet. Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s, {{so that all the}} runoff passed through Scots Float. Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as he was too busy with other engineering projects.|$|E
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was granted}} in 1539, on a 21-year lease, to Dr. Francis Cave, one of <b>the</b> <b>commissioners</b> who had {{negotiated}} {{the surrender of}} the abbey. During this period the abbey was rapidly demolished with the stone sold to meet the high demand within the town of Leicester.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commercial}} {{traffic on the}} waterways continued despite the railway competition, with 44,034 tons generating Â£733 of tolls in 1888, which enabled <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> to show a profit of Â£216. Traffic had fallen slightly to 42,640 tons in 1898, but by 1905 was down to 12,770 tons, and <b>the</b> <b>Commissioners</b> showed a loss of Â£702 that year. An Alderman giving evidence to the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways in 1905 pointed out {{that one of the}} railway companies had been paying to collect traffic in hay and straw, although this practice ceased when it became public knowledge. The condition of the Nene and the Wisbech Canal declined, which discouraged navigation, but some trade in agricultural produce, coal, bricks and road building materials continued. Coal was delivered by barge from Outwell Depot to around 40 pumping stations.|$|E

Under the terms of the Act, two small canals, called Galton's Canal and Brown's Canal, were built near the North Drain to serve peat extraction workings.
