An audio-book version was also made available, narrated by Jonathan Frakes. MacFarlane wrote the book on weekends during shooting for the film, partially due to boredom.|$|E
5|$|Although Benchley {{was known}} for {{misleading}} and fictional autobiographical statements about himself (at one point asserting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> A Tale of Two Cities before being buried at Westminster Abbey), he actually was the great-grandchild of the founder of Benchley, Texas, Henry Wetherby Benchley, who was jailed for his help with the Underground Railroad. Robert Benchley was born on September 15, 1889, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Maria Jane (Moran) and Charles Henry Benchley.|$|E

5|$|Between 1772 and 1779, Espejo {{provoked}} the colonial authorities, who regarded him as responsible for several satirical and mocking posters. These posters {{were attached to}} the doors of churches and other buildings, and their anonymous author tended to attack the colonial authorities, the clergy or any other subject he deemed convenient. Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{began writing}} {{early in his}} career. His {{published}} articles on machine tool technology led to {{a job as an}} editor of Machine magazine in New York City. This job, which he held between 1905 and 1910, required him to cover developments in the machine tool industry. He traveled widely to visit the companies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> about, which provided him many valuable contacts with leaders in the industry. As editor, he wrote articles on gear tooth systems, gear cutting machinery, hobs, the manufacture of cans, and of motor cars, including Machinery’s reference series on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Having bonded with Percy and valuing their relationship, Carl accepts Percy's {{enthusiastic}} {{offer to}} help out on weekends and holidays when the two are back in Los Angeles. Ramsey visits the truck to explain <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> the bad review as he felt Carl's skills did not suit a restaurant which had been serving the same menu for years. He leaves with an offer to bankroll a new restaurant. In a flash-forward set six months later, the new restaurant is successful and closed for a private event: Carl and Inez's remarriage ceremony.|$|E

50|$|Triamllam is notable, in <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> {{as though}} the Norman {{invasion}} never occurred, and as if many of the families listed still occupied their original territories. This, however, may reflect his interest as an antiquarian preserving ancient lore.|$|R

5|$|Hogg {{was called}} to {{the bar at the}} Michaelmas term in 1817, and often practised law in Northumberland and Durham. He {{frequently}} visited his family, with whom he was then on good terms. His reserved personality proved to be a hindrance to his career, and he remained dependent on financial assistance from his father. He continued studying Greek, and an article <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> on Apuleius was published in the third issue of The Liberal in 1822. A paper that he submitted for the fourth issue was rejected, causing him to resent the editors.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, he {{appeared}} in the films Heart and Souls with Alfre Woodard and Kyra Sedgwick and Short Cuts with Matthew Modine and Julianne Moore, along with a documentary <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> about the 1992 presidential campaigns titled The Last Party (1993). He starred in the 1994 films, Only You with Marisa Tomei, and Natural Born Killers with Woody Harrelson. He then subsequently appeared in Restoration (1995), Richard III (1995), Two Girls and a Guy (1998), as Special Agent John Royce in U.S. Marshals (1998), and in Black and White (1999).|$|E

5|$|In {{the summers}} of 1843 and 1844 Słowacki {{traveled}} to Pornic, a resort on the Atlantic coast in Brittany. It was there, in 1844, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> Genezis z Ducha (Genesis from the Spirit). This work introduced his own philosophical {{system that would}} have a visible influence on his works in his last decade. Around 1839 Słowacki put his capital into the Parisian stock market. He was a shrewd investor who earned enough from the investments to dedicate his life to his literary career; he was also able to pay the costs of having his books published.|$|E
5|$|Jeethu had {{initially}} approached Mammootty {{to play the}} lead, but {{he was unable to}} commit and asked Jeethu to proceed with the film with another actor. According to the director, Mammootty was instrumental in casting actress Meena for the film. The director, in an interview with The New Indian Express, stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> the screenplay with Mohanlal in mind and that the character was tailor-made for Mohanlal. He later added that no changes were made in the script when Mohanlal agreed.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi {{recorded}} {{no apparent}} {{interest in the}} performance of Andromeda after the 1620 Carnival; the long letter <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> to Striggio on 13 March 1620 makes no reference to the event and is chiefly concerned with financial matters. The letter implies that the Gonzaga court was trying to persuade Monteverdi to return to Mantua; in courtly language Monteverdi evades the issue, while comparing the relative generosity of his Venetian employers with the parsimony of the Gonzaga court.|$|E

5|$|Nostradamus was {{not only}} a diviner, but a {{professional}} healer. It is known <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> at least two books on medical science. One was an extremely free translation (or rather a paraphrase) of The Protreptic of Galen (Paraphrase de C. GALIEN, sus l'Exhortation de Menodote aux estudes des bonnes Artz, mesmement Medicine), and in his so-called Traité des fardemens (basically a medical cookbook containing, once again, materials borrowed mainly from others), he included a description of the methods he used to treat the plague, including bloodletting, none of which apparently worked. The same book also describes the preparation of cosmetics.|$|E
5|$|One catechesis of Symeon's, On Faith, {{along with}} a {{composite}} work titled One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts, {{are included in the}} Philokalia, a collection of texts by early Christian mystics. Another text in the Philokalia, titled The Three Methods of Prayer is also attributed to Symeon—it describes a method of practicing the Jesus Prayer that includes direction on correct posture and breathing while reciting the prayer. It is extremely unlikely <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> that text—some scholars attribute it to Nikiphoros the Monk, while others believe it was written by disciples of Symeon.|$|E
5|$|Shelley wrote eleven poems for Jane {{during that}} time. She {{served as the}} primary {{inspiration}} for the last poems <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> before his death. This did not bother Edward; he was proud that his wife inspired such poetry. Some biographers of Shelley have maintained that Shelley's feelings for Jane were strictly platonic, although different scholars have observed themes of frustrated sexual desires in Shelley's poetry during this period. Other critics have noted that Shelley's poems during this period struggle to define his feelings.|$|E

5|$|Sima Qian {{claimed that}} Sun Tzu later proved on the {{battlefield}} that his theories were effective (for example, at the Battle of Boju), {{that he had a}} successful military career, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> The Art of War based on his tested expertise. However, the Zuo zhuan, a historical text written centuries earlier than the Shiji, provides a much more detailed account of the Battle of Boju, but does not mention Sun Tzu at all.|$|E
5|$|The 1st-centuryAD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas {{second only}} to Callimachus among the elegiac poets. Philitas' {{influence}} has been found or suspected {{in a wide range}} of ancient writing; Longus' 2nd centuryAD novel Daphnis and Chloe contains a character likely named after him. Almost all <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> seems to have disappeared within two centuries, though, so it is unlikely that any writer later than the 2nd centuryBC read any but a few of his lines.|$|E
5|$|Before {{releasing}} {{their first}} album with Sire, Uncle Tupelo needed a drummer. Farrar and Tweedy interviewed twenty-four candidates and were both impressed with Ken Coomer and Bill Belzer. Belzer was chosen and Uncle Tupelo embarked on the European {{segment of the}} promotional tour for March 16–20, 1992 as the opening act for Sugar. Belzer was dismissed from the band after six months, and Coomer was hired as his permanent replacement. Coomer {{was not the only}} new member added after the tour—Uncle Tupelo sought to expand beyond a trio for the Anodyne recording sessions. They recruited multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston and bassist John Stirratt—Stirratt's presence enabled Tweedy to become a full-time guitarist on the songs <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote.</b>|$|E
