5|$|The cannon is in a {{compartment}} beneath <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> {{mounted on}} a load-bearing beam attached to <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> floor and the forward fuselage support structure. The nose is fitted with distinctive twin pitot probes and hinges up for service access.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} bulkheads, with <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> {{at the front}} of the first bulkhead. The nose was fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. <b>The</b> <b>cockpit</b> was fully glazed, with the exception of the lower right section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> floor into a protective housing on the external side of <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{airtight}} {{avionics compartment}} is behind <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> {{and in front}} of the forward fuel tank.|$|E
5000|$|Yackey Monoplane: Yackey's first, and last, {{original}} design. The Yackey Monoplane {{featured a}} single high wing over the plane body. The pilot {{was seated in}} <b>the</b> front <b>cockpit,</b> and up to two passengers were seated side-by-side in <b>the</b> rear <b>cockpit.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cockpits</b> were furnished in full leather with a baggage compartment between <b>the</b> two <b>cockpits.</b> <b>The</b> plane came standard with a 225 hp Wright J5 engine, but could be upgraded to a 425 hp Pratt & Whitney. One of the prototypes participated in the 1927 National Air Race from New York to Spokane, finishing 5th.|$|R
5000|$|Improved {{visibility}} as <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> are {{forward of}} the swept wings.|$|R
25|$|Type D A {{conversion}} into a single-seat bomber, {{with the}} pilot's position moved to <b>the</b> rear <b>cockpit,</b> <b>the</b> space previously used for <b>the</b> front <b>cockpit</b> {{being used to}} stow nine 65lb bombs.|$|R
5|$|The canopy hinges open to {{the right}} and the pilot enters using the flip-down ladder. Once inside, the pilot sits low in <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> {{protected}} by the bathtub assembly, which makes for a cramped cockpit. Visibility from <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> is limited, being a trade-off for improved pilot protection. Rearwards visibility is poor, though a periscope is fitted on top of the canopy to compensate.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of allowing pilots under instruction to gain experience in <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> of aircraft carrying passengers should be reviewed.|$|E
5|$|A {{folding ladder}} {{built into the}} left {{fuselage}} provides access to <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> {{as well as to}} the top of the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Gamma 5B: Two-seat {{version with}} <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> moved forward, {{used by the}} Spanish Republican air force for coastal patrol.|$|R
5|$|A two-seat {{conversion}} trainer, {{designated the}} I-5UTI (Uchebno-Trenirovochnyy Istrebitel—Fighter Trainer), {{was built by}} one of the factories. Only about twenty are believed to have been built. <b>The</b> <b>cockpit</b> was moved back and a second one inserted in front of it.|$|E
5|$|After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to {{join the}} rest of the crew in <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.|$|E
5|$|As Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is {{revealed}} that the Abu Nidal organization, a Libyan-sponsored terrorist group, plans to hijack the plane in Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had {{just enough time to}} escape, as the hijackers did not realize that <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E
50|$|These {{aircraft}} retained <b>the</b> open <b>cockpit</b> {{introduced in}} <b>the</b> A-8 production batch, {{and carried the}} same weapons load. In an attempt to improve pilot/observer co-operation, <b>the</b> rear <b>cockpit</b> was moved forward sufficiently for its glazed covering to form {{a continuation of the}} fuselage decking behind <b>the</b> pilot's <b>cockpit.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The wood framed Phoenix I {{was a small}} parasol winged monoplane. [...] The {{foldable}} wing had {{a constant}} chord and square ends in standard Boulton & Paul fashion. It was mounted {{on a pair of}} substantial streamlined struts from the lower fuselage longerons to the front wing spar. These main struts each carried a pair of short, slimmer members from near the wing to the front and rear spars. Further complicated strutting joined the upper fuselage to the wing centre section: a pair diverged gently from ahead of <b>the</b> forward <b>cockpit</b> to <b>the</b> front spar, another strut joined that spar on the starboard side to the port upper longeron between <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> and yet another joined the rear spar to the fuselage in the opposite direction behind <b>the</b> rear <b>cockpit.</b> <b>The</b> aircraft was normally flown from <b>the</b> rear <b>cockpit</b> at <b>the</b> trailing edge of the wing, with a cut-out to improve visibility. <b>The</b> forward <b>cockpit</b> was under <b>the</b> wing.|$|R
50|$|Both models {{also had}} flat sided, truss framed {{fuselage}}s, with rounded upper decking ahead of <b>the</b> <b>cockpits.</b> Behind <b>the</b> G-26 <b>cockpit</b> <b>the</b> raised upper fuselage continued to the tail. As on the G-22, the fin and the fabric covered, unbalanced rudder of the G-26 together had an elliptic profile. Its tailplane was set well back, with its leading edge {{only a little}} ahead of the rudder hinge line; the elevators were hinged behind the rudder.|$|R
5|$|Asiana Airlines was {{the first}} Star Alliance member to paint its {{aircraft}} in the current Star Alliance livery. Aircraft painted in an airline's regular livery have the Star Alliance logo between <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and {{the first set of}} cabin doors.|$|E
5|$|Both {{weapons were}} to be {{sufficiently}} compact to be carried hands-free on the user's person at all times, whether in the cab of a vehicle or <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> of an aircraft, and were to perform effectively in all environments and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the incident and the circumstances of Lubitz's involvement, aviation authorities in some countries implemented new regulations that require the presence of two authorized personnel in <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> at all times. Three days after the incident, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a temporary recommendation for airlines to ensure {{that at least two}} crew members—including at least one pilot—were in <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> during the entire duration of the flight. Several airlines announced that they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily.|$|E
25|$|Accommodation was {{provided}} for pilot and passenger/navigator in two closed <b>cockpits.</b> <b>The</b> pilot sat in <b>the</b> rear <b>cockpit</b> aft of <b>the</b> wing trailing-edges under a small forward-sliding canopy and flip-open side panels. <b>The</b> passenger/navigators <b>cockpit</b> had a flush glazed roof and was situated over the centre-section.|$|R
25|$|Designed by Rudolf Kaiser, the Ka-2 was an all wooden glider with {{plywood and}} {{aircraft}} fabric covering. The Ka-2s wings, with marked forward sweep and dihedral are mounted above the fuselage, flanking <b>the</b> rear <b>cockpit.</b> <b>The</b> front <b>cockpit</b> {{is covered by}} a one piece plexiglas canopy which opens {{to the right and}} <b>the</b> rear <b>cockpit</b> is covered by a canopy incorporating the inner leading edges of the wing, opening rear-wards, held in place by the front canopy when closed.|$|R
50|$|The crew {{of three}} {{occupied}} two <b>cockpits.</b> <b>The</b> pilot in <b>the</b> open front <b>cockpit</b> and <b>the</b> other two crewmen, (navigator and radio operator/gunner), in <b>the</b> enclosed rear <b>cockpit.</b>|$|R
5|$|It was {{not until}} 35 minutes after the crash that rescuers {{identified}} the debris that was the remains of <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> with the four pilots alive inside. All four recovered from their injuries and eventually returned.|$|E
5|$|Selex ES {{next-generation}} cockpit {{includes a}} new mission computer, an enhanced head-up display and contemporary multi-function displays, plus the capability {{for the pilot}} to instead use a single, large-area display. Selex is positioning <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> as a possible upgrade of JF-17 Block III.|$|E
5|$|The AJ-2 {{incorporated}} all of {{the changes}} made to the late model AJ-2P and 55 aircraft were ordered on 14 February 1951. The AJ-2 deleted the separate compartment for the third crewman, but retained the third seat in <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> from the AJ-2P.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} has {{a classic}} structure {{consisting of a}} welded tube fuselage and wooden wings, all fabric covered. It is a tandem open-cockpit two-seat biplane and is stressed for normal aerobatics. <b>The</b> <b>cockpits</b> are frequently constructed as a single tandem cabin with an enclosing bubble canopy. Some aerobatic competition aircraft are built as single seaters with <b>the</b> front <b>cockpit</b> closed off.|$|R
5000|$|Aeronautics, {{in which}} nomograms {{were used for}} decades in <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> of {{aircraft}} of all descriptions. As a navigation and flight control aid, nomograms were fast, compact and easy-to-use calculators.|$|R
50|$|After 32 {{years of}} service and more than 6,000 hours in <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> of more than 100 {{different}} aircraft, {{he retired from the}} U.S. Air Force as a Colonel in 1982.|$|R
5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. <b>The</b> <b>cockpit</b> was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. <b>The</b> <b>cockpit</b> has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The Flight Data Recorder was recovered intact from the wreckage, but <b>the</b> <b>Cockpit</b> Voice Recorder had been damaged in the post-crash fire and was unusable.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cockpit's</b> interior, instruments, and gunsight were {{imported}} from foreign suppliers. This effort to aggregate a fighter {{from various sources}} {{was a result of}} the last-minute demands for a frontline fighter.|$|R
50|$|An English {{designer}} of warplanes, concerned that Australian pilots {{would be too}} tall to fit in <b>the</b> <b>cockpits,</b> asked his daughter for the heights of Bruce's characters Jim Linton and Wally Meadows.|$|R
