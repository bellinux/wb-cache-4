5|$|Kauri gum was Auckland's main export in {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{sustaining}} much of the early growth of the city. Between 1850 and 1950, 450,000tons of gum were exported. <b>The</b> <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> the gum market was 1899, with 11,116tons exported that year, with a value of £600,000 ($989,700). The average annual export was over 5,000tons, with the average price gained £63 ($103.91) per ton.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in}} the week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|Haas' early third {{millennium}} dates {{suggest that the}} development of coastal and inland sites occurred in parallel. But, from 2500 to 2000 BC, during the period of greatest expansion, the population and development decisively shifted toward the inland sites. All development apparently occurred at large interior sites such as Caral, though they remained dependent on fish and shellfish from the coast. <b>The</b> <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> dates is in keeping with Shady's dates at Caral, which show habitation from 2627 BC to 2020 BC. That coastal and inland sites developed in tandem remains disputed, however (see next section).|$|E

5|$|Packhorse routes criss-crossed <b>the</b> <b>Peak</b> <b>in</b> the Medieval era, {{and some}} paved causeways are {{believed}} to date from this period, such as the Long Causeway along Stanage Edge. However, no highways were marked on Christopher Saxton's map of Derbyshire, published in 1579. Bridge-building improved the transport network. A surviving early example is the three-arched gritstone bridge over the River Derwent at Baslow, which dates from 1608 and has an adjacent toll-shelter.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Aarhus {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{industrial}} ports in northern Europe with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world. It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while feedstuffs, stone, cement and coal are among the chief imports. Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from the Port of Hamburg and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> 2008.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> the {{brightness}} just {{inside of the}} Amalthea's orbit and, therefore, the vertical asymmetry the Amalthea gossamer ring {{may be due to}} the dust particles trapped at the leading (L4) and trailing (L5) Lagrange points of this moon. The particles may also follow horseshoe orbits between the Lagrangian points. The dust may be present at the leading and trailing Lagrange points of Thebe as well. This discovery implies that there are two particle populations in the gossamer rings: one slowly drifts in the direction of Jupiter as described above, while another remains near a source moon trapped in 1:1 resonance with it.|$|E

5|$|The peak {{is home to}} {{many species}} of birds, {{including}} blue-gray gnatcatchers, lazuli buntings, oak titmice, acorn woodpeckers, and California quail on the lower slopes, and mountain quail, mountain chickadees, and red-breasted nuthatches on the upper slopes. Wild turkeys and raptors such as Cooper's hawks, golden eagles, bald eagles, and prairie falcons are also common. A few species migrate to <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> the winter, including ruby-crowned kinglets, yellow-rumped warblers, and golden-crowned sparrows. Mammals that inhabit the mountain include black-tailed deer, cougars, bobcats, skunks, raccoons, coyotes, bears, weasels, and squirrels. A large herd of Roosevelt elk frequent the peak's western foothills. The herd swelled to over 100 individuals in the mid-2000s, causing traffic problems and severe damage to local pear orchards, but shrank to about 40 members by 2009 after an Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife relocation effort. Other common animals on the peak include western rattlesnakes and western blacklegged ticks.|$|E
5|$|The {{primitive}} jetty {{was damaged}} {{in a storm}} of 1659, so that in 1708 leading local wool merchant Sir William Wyndham built a new harbour costing £1,000, with a stronger pier. The main export at this time was kelp, made by burning seaweed for use in glass making. In the 19th century trade increased with the export of iron ore from the Brendon Hills mainly to Newport for onward transportation to the Ebbw Vale Steelworks, paper, flour and gypsum. In 1843 the esplanade was built by George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont, and in 1855 a new harbour was commissioned to cope with increased iron ore trade. The existing harbour was damaged and several vessels wrecked by the Royal Charter Storm on 26 October 1859. A new east pier and wharf was completed in 1861−62 by James Abernethy. This allowed shipping movement to reach a peak, with over 1,100 ship movements per annum. Harbour trade was aided by {{the coming of the}} railway, with two independent railways terminating at Watchet from the mid 1860s. The West Somerset Mineral Railway ran down from the iron mines on the Brendon Hills, and the West Somerset Railway came up from the Bristol and Exeter Railway at Norton Fitzwarren. At <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> the trade during the late 19th century 40,000 tons of ore were exported annually.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom {{established}} the world’s first civil nuclear programme, opening {{a nuclear power}} station, Calder Hall at Windscale, England, in 1956.

25|$|While the {{negative}} effects of that phenomenon may have been exaggerated, Parliament passed legislation in 1736 to discourage consumption by prohibiting the sale of gin in quantities of less than two gallons and raising the tax on it dramatically. However, <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> consumption was reached seven years later, when the nation of six and one-half million people drank over 18 million gallons of gin. And most was consumed by the small minority of the population then living in London and other cities; people in the countryside largely consumed beer, ale and cider.|$|E
25|$|To {{defend against}} V-1s {{falling in the}} city and dock area, the British and US guns had to be {{positioned}} at least 10 miles outside the city (codenamed the Nylen Belt), integrated into a system of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights. No 1 Identification Troop and No 2 Local Warning (Radar) Troop were formed by 80 AA Bde for this purpose, manned by the Royal Signals and 114th LAA Rgt respectively.
