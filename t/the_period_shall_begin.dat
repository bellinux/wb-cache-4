40|$|The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) {{spacecraft}} {{was successfully}} inserted into an elliptical orbit around Mars on 9 / 12 / 97, 01 : 53 : 49 UTC. This orbit was near polar (inclination = 93. 26 deg) with an orbital period of 44. 993 hours and apoapsis and periapsis altitudes of 54, 025. 9 km and 262. 9 km respectively. After a short aerobraking (AB) initiation interval (9 / 12 / 97 to 10 / 2 / 97), the main phase of AB or orbit period reduction was established. However shortly thereafter, {{a significant problem}} with the minus-Y axis solar array developed which necessitated a temporary suspension of AB. Ultimately, this forced the Project to abandon the original plan to complete AB on 1 / 18 / 98 and establish the mapping orbit on 3 / 15 / 98. The revised plan called for a reduced level of AB, thus subjecting the solar array and yoke assembly to less aerodynamic stress.

According to the tax treaty between India and Mauritius, capital gains arising {{from the sale of}} shares are taxable in the country of residence of the shareholder and not in the country of residence of the company whose shares have been sold. Therefore, a company resident in Mauritius selling shares of an Indian company will not pay tax in India. Since there is no capital gains tax in Mauritius, the gain will escape tax altogether.The Protocol for amendment of the India-Mauritius Convention signed on 10 May 2016, provides for source-based taxation of capital gains arising from alienation of shares acquired from 1 April 2017 in a company resident in India. Simultaneously, investments made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered and will not be subject to capital gains taxation in India. Where such capital gains arise during <b>the</b> transition <b>period</b> from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019, the tax rate will be limited to 50% of the domestic tax rate of India. However, the benefit of 50% reduction in tax rate during <b>the</b> transition <b>period</b> <b>shall</b> be subject to the Limitation of Benefits Article.

60|$|Another {{interesting}} {{quality of}} Holmes {{is what we}} may call his rationalism, his habit of taking nothing for granted, of judging every matter by observation rather than by tradition or sentiment or imagination; and herein he is in marked contrast with Longfellow and other romantic writers of <b>the</b> <b>period.</b> We <b>shall</b> enjoy him better if we remember his bent of mind. As a boy {{he was fond of}} tools and machinery; as a man he was interested in photography, safety razors, inventions of every kind; as a physician he rebelled against drugs (then believed to have almost magical powers, and imposed on suffering stomachs in horrible doses) and observed his patients closely to discover what mentally ailed them; and as boy or man or physician he cared very little for books but a great deal for his own observation of life. Hence there is always a surprise in reading Holmes, which comes partly from his flashes of wit but more largely from his independent way of looking at things and recording his first-hand impressions.
