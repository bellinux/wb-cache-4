Oilblotter, trade name of the Anderson Cob Mills' new anti-pollution product, is an absorbent of vegetable origin for removing oil from water and other surfaces quickly and efficiently. According to David I. B. Vander Hooven, Executive Vice-President of the mills, Oilblotter has been undergoing research and develop­ment since early 1969 and has been successfully demon­strated for federal, state and marine industry officials in both fresh and salt water and under both hot and cold temperature conditions in Canada, Texas and Florida. Mr. Vander Hooven flew to Kentucky to personally oversee the demonstration of the product which is used after a slick is contained by means of a floating boom. O ilblotter, which is non-toxic and subject to normal organic decomposition, absorbs oil immediately upon contact and is then skimmed off for burning or other means of disposal. Affiliated with The Andersons of Maumee, the Ander­son Cob Mills, Inc., are primary producers of a versatile, tough-textured natural cellulose grit derived from corn cobs, which is used in a number of manu­facturing processes including de-burring, burnishing and finishing metal parts, blast cleaning, and as carriers of agricultural chemicals. Grit-O-Cobs and Lite-R-Cobs, registered trade names, are also used by foundries, fur cleaners and cosmetic manufacturers.

Annual Sugar Beet Field Tour Held Recently In Oh io Areas The Farmers' and Manufacturers' Beet Sugar Associ· ation of Saginaw, Michigan, held its annual sugar beet field tour i. n the Fremont and Findlay, Ohio areas recently, reports Glenn E. Maddy, county extension agent. They visited the sugar beet fields of Melvin Schulte, Woodville; Carl and Theodore Kaiser of Graytown; Wilson Damschroder, Lindsey; Rollin Turnow, Curtice; Harold Draeger, Lindsey; Emil Webert, Elmore, and toured the new additions to the Fremont factory of the Northern Ohio Sugar Company. The main items observed were the planting of beets to a stand-that is, the farmer planted beets at the rate of four seeds per foot with no blocking done. The weed control material was Pyramin+ TCA. Then in many of the cases, they had labor removing the weeds with long· handled hoes. This is a very common practice in Michigan, the planting of beets to stand without using labor. The Kaiser Brothers used a John Deere electronic thinner to remove their excess beets. The beets were planted at two inches apart, and then were reduced to approximately one foot apart. This thinning mach­ine can do two acres per hour. The machine covers six rows at a time.

5000|$|The furnace {{is built}} on a tilting {{platform}} so that the liquid steel can be poured into another vessel for transport. The operation of tilting the furnace to pour molten steel is called [...] "tapping". Originally, all steelmaking furnaces had a tapping spout closed with refractory that washed out when the furnace was tilted, but often modern furnaces have an eccentric bottom tap-hole (EBT) to reduce inclusion of nitrogen and slag in the liquid steel. These furnaces have a <b>taphole</b> that passes vertically through the hearth and shell, and is set off-centre in the narrow [...] "nose" [...] of the egg-shaped hearth. It is filled with refractory sand, such as olivine, when it is closed off. Modern plants may have two shells with a single set of electrodes that can be transferred between the two; one shell preheats scrap while the other shell is utilised for meltdown. Other DC-based furnaces have a similar arrangement, but have electrodes for each shell and one set of electronics.|$|E

For plain-carbon steel furnaces, as soon as slag is detected during tapping the furnace is rapidly tilted back towards the deslagging side, minimising slag carryover into the ladle. For some special steel grades, including stainless steel, the slag is poured into the ladle as well, to be treated at the ladle furnace to recover valuable alloying elements. During tapping some alloy additions are introduced into the metal stream, and more lime is added {{on top of the}} ladle to begin building a new slag layer.

All models {{were based on a}} general understanding of the typical tap cycle of an industrial blast furnace. Some of the models were evaluated on short-term process data from the reference furnace. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was built and applied to simulate the complicated hearth flows and thus to predict the regions of the hearth exerted to erosion under various operating conditions. Key boundary variables of the CFD model were provided by a simplified drainage model based on the first principles. By examining the evolutions of liquid outflow rates measured from the furnace studied, the drainage model was improved to include the effects of <b>taphole</b> diameter and length. The estimated slag delays showed good agreement with the observed ones. The liquid flows in the <b>taphole</b> were further studied using two different models and the results of both models indicated that {{it is more likely that}} separated flow of iron and slag occurs in the <b>taphole</b> when the liquid outflow rates are comparable during tapping.

40|$|Iron and slag are the {{products}} from blast furnace and normally drained {{out as a}} mixture via <b>taphole.</b> Two tapholes are opening alternatively in the large-scale blast furnace hearth. After the <b>taphole</b> switches, molten iron is only tapped out at the first few minutes. This phenomenon is observed widely in the large-scale blast furnace and {{it is called the}} Slag delay. Due to the high temperature and high pressure inside the furnace, it is hard to execute real-time observations. A CFD model is developed to study the fluids of iron, slag, and gas inside the blast furnace hearth. This numerical simulation was performed by finite volume method that considers the key forces involved, including the gravity, buoyancy, and the drag between liquid-solid and liquid-liquid. The pressure difference between the liquid surface inside furnace and outside the atmosphere induces the pitting of the liquid surface during the liquids tapping. Consequently, when the bottom of pit reaches the <b>taphole,</b> the gas is drained out through the pit. The computational simulation results by liquid level model are consistent with the observations in the physical water model experiment.

40|$|The tapping of slag {{and metal}} {{is a key}} {{operational}} aspect in high-carbon ferromanganese (HCFeMn) and silicomanganese (SiMn) production. Tapping behaviour can be influenced by <b>taphole</b> design and the physicochemical properties of the tapped slag and metal. Unfavourable behaviour includes difficulties during <b>taphole</b> opening, and sluggish or intermittent slag flow. The slags of interest here consist mostly of components in the CaO-MnO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgO system, but differ greatly in MnO content and basicity due to the different operating practices. To evaluate the flow behaviour of these slags from submerged arc furnaces (SAFs) the latest physicochemical property models were applied to model viscosity, thermal conductivity, density, and heat capacity as functions of temperature and typical HCFeMn and SiMn slag compositions. These property values were applied in a simplified model of flow through the coke bed and <b>taphole</b> with an inlet pressure specified. Based on a model from the literature (Iida et al. 2008), a model was formulated with spherical-radial flow through the coke bed, being independent {{of the length of}} the fluid path through the coke bed. The effect of variation in the slag-metal ratio was investigated, with the focus on tap streams consisting of only slag. The estimated flow rates were comparable to those reported elsewhere (Kadkhodabeigi 2011) and found to be dependent mostly on slag viscosity, which was generally lower for the typical SiMn slags due to their composition and higher operating temperature. Furthermore, in most of the cases considered it was estimated that the flow through the <b>taphole</b> would develop into laminar flow, with the pressure drop predominantly over the coke bed. Flow rates were found to be highly dependent on the <b>taphole</b> diameter and coke bed void fraction, and to lesser extent on the <b>taphole</b> length and coke bed particle diameter.

40|$|<b>Taphole</b> clays are {{a plastic}} ceramic-polymer {{composite}} used in iron making blast furnaces {{to control the}} casting of hot metal and slag from the blast furnace. They also protect the sidewall refractories in the blast furnace from erosion and corrosion. <b>Taphole</b> clays generally consist of liquid binder, refractory matrix, and refractory aggregate. A novolak resin solution {{has been used in}} this study because it is a common binder used in industry. The matrix material is usually a mixture of fine particles of silicon carbide, coke, alumina, and other special additives. The aggregate materialconsists of coarse particles of alumina or alumino-silicates. Studies on <b>taphole</b> clays to date have generally focused on the effect of compositional variations on their performance. Extrusion behaviour is known to highly influence the performance of <b>taphole</b> clays but has not been previously studied in depth. In this thesis the rheology of the <b>taphole</b> clay mixtures and their components are studied. The binder was aged at various temperatures with and without the addition of the curing agent hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). The effect of temperature and curing time was assessed based on the binder 2 ̆ 7 s viscosity. Extrusion pressure variation in the mixture of binder and matrix material due to ageing, temperature and binder composition was also studied. The Benbow-Bridgwater model for paste extrusion was used to evaluate the extrusion pressures. The aggregate material was not added in this study and will be the focus of future work. Major findings of this study were that the binder was found to react with HMTA at temperatures above 40 °C producing an increase in viscosity. This reaction occurred at temperatures much lower than had previously been reported. Without the addition of HMTA there was found to be no significant change in the viscosity of the binder. When the binder and HMTA mixture was heated to temperatures of 70 °C and above, the reaction was rapid, taking less than 12 hours to observe a significant viscosity increase. Again, these cure temperatures were lower than reported in previous studies. It is proposed that the increased mobility of the polymer chains due to the addition of the solvent is the reason these reactions were occurring at relatively low temperatures. The extrusion behaviour of different <b>taphole</b> clay compositions was performed by comparing parameters from the Benbow-Bridgwater equation. This study has extended the application of the Benbow-Bridgwater equation, which was previously applied to the extrusion behaviour of ceramic pastes. Studying the matrix binder material variation found that ageing at 50 °C, mixing technique and temperature all had a significant effect on the extrusion pressure. The effect of temperature of extrusion was also examined and found to be a significant factor in extrusion behaviour. A novel variation to the Benbow-Bridgwater equation is proposed to account for these temperature changes. It is envisaged that this work will be used to modify blast furnace <b>taphole</b> clay storage and utilization procedures to obtain more consistent <b>taphole</b> clay behaviour. This work also provides an understanding of the factors that can contribute to the variability observed in the extrusion pressures of <b>taphole</b> clays.

This study aims, in particular, at the metallurgical {{applications of the}} problem where the molten metal and slag are tapped from the coke-bed in the furnace hearth. CFD techniques have been employed in order to perform a systematic study of this problem and clarify the underlying physical mechanisms controlling the tapping behaviour. The influence of density and viscosity ratios {{as well as the}} packed-bed characteristics on the onset of entrainment of the lighter liquid into the <b>taphole</b> is studied. Buoyancy effects were found out to be the underlying parameter in determining the onset of the simultaneous tapping. In the absence of packed bed, the viscosity ratio was found out to have no influence on the tapping behaviour. With the presence of the packed-bed, however, the tapping behaviour is drastically changed. The onset of entrainment of the lighter liquid as well as the gas-liquid interface into the <b>taphole</b> is advanced, leading to the considerable amounts of the lighter liquid to be remained in the reservoir.

40|$|Refractory sand {{used for}} filling the <b>taphole</b> nozzle in slide-gate system of steel ladle needs {{to form a}} {{suitable}} sintered crust to prevent molten metal from {{direct contact with the}} gate system which, when opened, permits flow of metal from the ladle through the <b>taphole</b> well. Conventional filler sand consists of powdered mixtures of at least two compositions with suitable particle size and mass ratio. We herein propose a novel core-shell-structured composite particle as the refractory sand. Silicon carbide (SiC) particles with an average diameter of 50 mu M were oxidized in air at 1100 - 1600 degrees C to form SiC@SiO 2 core-shell structure. As the oxidation temperature increases, silica weight-ratio increases from 0. 8 to 7. 9 wt. %, equivalent to a calculated shell thickness of 20 - 157 nm, respectively. The crust thickness can be tailored by adjusting the shell thickness. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the core shell structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S. r. l.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to study the heat flows in the blast furnace hearth lining by {{experimental}} measurements and numerical modeling. Thermocouple data from an operating furnace have been used throughout the work, to verify results and to develop methodologies to use the results in further studies. The hearth lining {{were divided into two}} zones based on the thermocouple readings: a region with regular temperature variations due to the tapping of the furnace, and another region with slow temperature variations. In an experimental study, the temperatures of the outer surfaces of the wall and bottom were measured and compared with lining temperature measured by thermocouples. Expressions to describe the outer surface temperature profiles were derived and used as input in a two-dimensional steady state heat transfer model. The {{aim of the}} study was to predict the lining temperature profiles in the region subjected to slow temperature variations. The methodology to calculate a steady state lining temperature profile was used as input to a three-dimensional model. The aim of the three-dimensional model was primarily to study the region with dynamic lining temperature variations caused by regular tappings. The study revealed that the replacement of original lining with tap clay has an effect when simulating the quasi-stationary temperature variations in the lining. The study initiated a more detailed study of the <b>taphole</b> region and the size and shape of the tap clay layer profile. It was concluded, that in order to make a more accurate heat transfer model of the blast furnace hearth, the presence of a skull build-up below the <b>taphole,</b> erosion above the <b>taphole</b> and the bath level variations must to be taken into consideration.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} {{community of}} maple sap {{was characterized by}} analysis of samples obtained at the <b>taphole</b> of maple trees for the 2001 and 2002 seasons. Among the 190 bacterial isolates, 32 groups were formed according to the similarity of the banding patterns obtained by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). A subset of representative isolates for each ARDRA group was identified by 16 S rRNA gene fragment sequencing. Results showed {{a wide variety of}} organisms, with 22 different genera encountered. Pseudomonas and Ralstonia, of the γ- and β-Proteobacteria, respectively, were the most frequently encountered genera. Gram-positive bacteria were also observed, and Staphylococcus, Plantibacter, and Bacillus were the most highly represented genera. The sampling period corresponding to 50 % of the cumulative sap flow percentage presented the greatest bacterial diversity according to its Shannon diversity index value (1. 1). γ-Proteobacteria were found to be dominant almost {{from the beginning of the}} season to the end. These results are providing interesting insights on maple sap microflora that will be useful for further investigation related to microbial contamination and quality of maple products and also for guiding new strategies on <b>taphole</b> contamination control...|$|E

40|$|The {{erosion of}} hearth {{refractories}} {{is the main}} limitation for a long campaign blast furnace life. An in-depth understanding of the flow and heat transfer is essential {{in order to identify}} the key mechanisms for the hearth erosion. In this study, a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics model is described which predicts the flow and temperature distributions of liquid iron in blast furnace hearth, and the temperature distribution in the refractories. The model addresses conjugate heat transfer, natural convection and turbulent flow through porous media, with its main features including three-dimensional, high grid resolution and a wide range of geometrical and kinematic scales (from <b>taphole</b> diameter to hearth outside diameter). The melt flow was simulated using improved transport equations, including a modified k-&# 949; turbulence model and a thermal dispersion term. The predicted results show a well-organized flow pattern: two large scale recirculation zones are separated vertically at the <b>taphole</b> level. This flow pattern controls the temperature distribution in the liquid phase, so that the temperature remains nearly uniform in the upper zone, but changes mainly across the lower zone. The effects of several important factors are examined, such as the fluid buoyancy vs constant fluid density, and the shape and position of coke free zone (different shapes of coke free zones were assumed in connection with the reported dissection study). The inclusion of fluid buoyancy was found to be most important for the flow pattern observed. Comparison with the plant data from BlueScope Steel's Port Kembla blast furnaces shows that the pad temperature is most sensitive to the thickness of protection layer in the hearth lining...|$|E
40|$|During {{the casting}} of {{ferromanganese}} alloys from electric arc furnaces into sand beds at temperatures {{of up to}} 1800 °C {{a considerable amount of}} very brown fumes are generated when the alloy fume is oxidized in the atmosphere. The fume is difficult to capture because of the large flux of gas that is generated. Possible reasons for this flux include the high evaporation rate of Mn at elevated temperatures, the large surface area of the casting beds and the large thermal plumes over the furnace tapholes and casting beds. It has been found that the use of fine water sprays {{along the edge of the}} roof that covers the casting bed resulted in a significant reduction in visible emissions. This paper describes research into the kinetics of the fume to improve the design of the capture hoods, as well as the mechanism of suppression by the water sprays by using CFD analysis. It is shown that the oxidation reaction produces less than 20 % of the energy content of the plume over the arc furnace <b>taphole,</b> and also that radiation heat transfer may play an important role in increasing the energy content of the <b>taphole</b> plume. The capture of fume particles by fine spray droplets is shown to have limited efficiency, while the heat sink that is caused by evaporation does not materially contribute to the circulation of fume through the spray. It is postulated that the increased moisture content of the air over the casting beds may be instrumental in reducing the oxygen partial pressure or in the formation of an oxide layer, both of which would reduce metal evaporation and, therefore fume formation. The exact mechanism requires further investigation. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the foundry, it's {{difficult}} to measure the level of molten iron in pouring package and the flow of molten iron each pouring during casting control process, which {{will result in the}} control problem of over-pouring and under-pouring. So,a new measurement method about molten iron level and dynamic detection of vertical flow rate has been developed in this paper. The method is based on infrared radiation and time intervals under the state of vertical flow rate of molten iron. By analysing the flow rate of molten iron in the casting ladle <b>taphole</b> theoretically, building field experimental device and analysing experimental results, it shows that the proposed iron level measurement and dynamic detection of vertical flow rate based on infrared radiation and time intervals are feasible. And then it lays a foundation for controlling the flow of molten iron...|$|E
40|$|This paper numerically {{predicts the}} {{decrease}} in temperature of the eroded hearth of the blast furnace with floating deadman (coke zone) case for Port Kembla no. 5 blast furnace (PKBF 5) by solving the Navier-Stokes equation, the thermal-energy-balance equation with conjugated heat transfer, and the mass transfer equation with the effect of chemical reaction during tapping process at steady state. The chemical reaction is generated by titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) reacting with saturated carbon in hot metal. The following calculations are done by using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package, FLUENT (version 6. 2), with a segregated model. As shown in the results, {{on the basis of}} the flow pattern of liquid iron, the inlet selection of adding TiO(2) may be far away from the <b>taphole.</b> The calculated temperature variation in the damaged hearth by reaction is significant, but that on the other side of the hearth without adding TiO(2) isn't influenced. Additionally, the numerical temperature data of different locations may be examined by the blast furnace operators to judge the effect of lowering temperature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Electric furnace {{smelting}} {{is one of}} {{the principal}} unit operations for ferroalloy production, and increased process intensity, improved availability, minimal maintenance and a longer campaign life are common objectives for electric furnace operation in order to obtain favourable economics of production. Furnace designers have continued to develop innovative solutions that have allowed these objectives to be realised, e. g., furnace cooling systems, and numerical modelling {{plays a key role in}} the design process. Enhanced understanding of the energy transfer process in the furnace and the ability to develop, evaluate and optimise components of the crucible design to match process requirements are the key motivators for modelling. This paper provides an overview of recent applications of numerical modelling to the design of electric furnaces. The aim is to illustrate what can be done, and identify areas where further work is needed in this field. Examples include furnace bath modelling, crucible cooling system design, <b>taphole</b> design, baking of Soderberg electrodes, off-gas systems, and fume control and building ventilation. It is argued that the trend is for numerical models to become more encompassing while at the same time more accessible, and therefore further improvements in furnace design will be realised with continued and well validated modelling efforts. 1...|$|E

40|$|The wear of a {{blast furnace}} hearth and the hearth inner profile are highly {{dependent}} on the liquid iron flow pattern, refractory temperatures, and temperature distributions at the hot face (the interface between the liquid iron and refractory or the skull). A 3 -D CFD hearth model has been developed for predict the hearth erosion and its inner profile. The detailed computation {{results show that the}} hot face temperature is location dependant. Based on these discoveries, a new methodology along with new algorithms is established to calculate the hearth erosion and its inner profile. The methodology is to estimate the hearth primary inner profile based on 1 -D heat transfer, and to compute the hot face temperature using the 3 -D CFD hearth model according to the 1 -D pre-estimated and re-estimated profiles. After the hot face temperatures are converged, the hot face positions are refined by a new algorithm, which is based on the difference between the calculated and measured results. The finalized CFD prediction temperatures are in good agreement with the experimental results except at or near the corner and <b>taphole</b> regions.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a process to}} recover steel plant waste oxides {{to be used in}} the production of hot metal. The process flowsheet used at the pilot plant. Coal/coke breeze and iron ore pellets/waste oxides are charged into the smelting reactor. The waste oxides are either agglomerated into briquettes (1 inch) using a binder or micro-agglomerated into pellets (1 / 4 inch) without the use of a binder. The iron oxides dissolve in the slag and are reduced by carbon to produce molten iron. The gangue oxides present in the raw materials report to the slag. Coal charged to the smelter is both the fuel as well as the reductant. Carbon present in the waste oxides is also used as the fuel/reductant resulting in a decrease in the coal requirement. Oxygen is top blown through a central, water-cooled, dual circuit lance. Nitrogen is injected through tuyeres at the bottom of the reactor for stirring purposes. The hot metal and slag produced in the smelting reactor are tapped at regular intervals through a single <b>taphole</b> using a mudgun and drill system. The energy requirements of the process are provided by (i) the combustion of carbon to carbon monoxide, referred to as primary combustion and (ii) the combustion of CO and H{sub 2 } to CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }O, known as postcombustion...|$|E
