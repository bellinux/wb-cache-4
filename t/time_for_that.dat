25|$|Because of the {{controversy}} over Westropp's Mesolithic and Mortillet's Gap beginning in 1872 archaeological attention focused mainly on the revolution at the Palaeolithic—Neolithic boundary as {{an explanation of the}} gap. For a few decades the Neolithic Period, as it was called, was described as a kind of revolution. In the 1890s, a standard term, the Neolithic Revolution, began to appear in encyclopedias such as Pears. In 1925 the Cambridge Ancient History reported:There are quite a large number of archaeologists who justifiably consider the period of the Late Stone Age to be a neolithic revolution and an economic revolution at the same <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> <b>that</b> is the period when primitive agriculture developed and cattle breeding began.|$|E

While working with the MRA he had {{come into contact with}} several Buddhists who would assist his {{understanding}} of dealing with them in Burma, helping to lower barriers which existed between them and Christians. Under his leadership the hosts of churches which had been destroyed or damaged were rebuilt or repaired. In June 1948 he underwent an operation for throat cancer which affected his speaking. While recovering Karenni separatists marched on Rangoon, reaching a point only nine miles away from the city in January 1949. It was partly thanks to the efforts of West, whom the Karenni respected and admired, that after a siege of one hundred and twelve days the Karen withdrew. West resigned the bishopric of Rangoon in 1949 but later withdrew his resignation, and returned to Britain in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> year's annual meeting of the Rangoon Diocesan Association.|$|E

This led to her first international medal – a bronze close behind Romania's Margareta Keszeg. Her time of 8:51.90 minutes placed her as the third fastest in the world indoors that year, after Keszeg and the world indoor champion Marie-Pierre Duros. Outdoors she was third at the 1991 European Cup, again beaten by Keszeg and also Germany's Uta Pippig.|$|E

500|$|The {{reasons for}} Wagner's strong {{negative}} {{reaction to the}} ATC's request {{have been the subject}} of much speculation.
