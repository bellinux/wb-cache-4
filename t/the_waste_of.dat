5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Castro embraced environmentalism, campaigning against {{global warming and}} <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> natural resources, and accusing the U.S. of being the world's primary polluter. In 1994 a {{ministry}} dedicated to the environment was established, and new laws established in 1997 that promoted awareness of environmental issues throughout Cuba and stressed the sustainable use of natural resources. By 2006, Cuba was the world's only nation which met the United Nations Development Programme's definition of sustainable development, with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8. Castro also became a proponent of the anti-globalization movement, criticizing U.S. global hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals. Castro maintained his devout anti-apartheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, he was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison. Mandela praised Cuba's involvement in battling South Africa in Angola and thanked Castro personally. He later attended Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994. In 2001 he attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured on the global spread of racial stereotypes through U.S. film.|$|E

25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that cooperative diversity can increase the diversity gain {{at the cost of}} losing the wireless resource such as frequency, time and power resources for the relaying phase.

On the other hand, he believed in the citizen's right to fair treatment. So while he bought up rival companies and created a monopoly, he kept his prices low and campaigned vigorously for regulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{decay of}} {{a mixture of}} two or more {{materials}} which each decay exponentially, but with different half-lives, is not exponential. Mathematically, the sum of two exponential functions is not a single exponential function. A common example of such a situation is <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> nuclear power stations, which is a mix of substances with vastly different half-lives. Consider a mixture of a rapidly decaying element A, with a half-life of 1 second, and a slowly decaying element B, with a half-life of 1 year. In a couple of minutes, almost all atoms of element A will have decayed after repeated halving of the initial number of atoms, but very few of the atoms of element B will have done so as {{only a tiny fraction of}} its half-life has elapsed. Thus, the mixture taken as a whole will not decay by halves.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the {{government}} of Egypt sold annual contracts reaching US$50 million to international companies to collect Cairo's solid waste. The three companies that were awarded with contracts for cleaning Cairo are FCC and Urbaser, Enser (both Spanish companies), and AMA (an Italian) company. The Egyptian Company for Garbage Collection (ECGC), a domestic company was also awarded with contracts. There was a precedent for this approach to trash collection two years earlier, in 2001, when {{the government}} agreed to sign a contract with Onyx, a French company, to manage <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria, the second largest city in Egypt.

25|$|One of Clark's least {{successful}} acts {{as director}} was buying four early-sixteenth century paintings {{now known as}} Scenes from Tebaldeo's Eclogues. He saw them in 1937 {{in the possession of}} a dealer in Vienna, and against the united advice of his professional staff he persuaded the trustees to buy them. He believed them to be by Giorgione, whose work was inadequately represented in the gallery at the time. The trustees authorised the expenditure of £14,000 of public funds and the paintings went on display in the gallery with considerable fanfare. His staff did not accept the attribution to Giorgione, and within a year scholarly research established the paintings as the work of Andrea Previtali, one of Giorgione's minor contemporaries. The British press protested at <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> taxpayers' money, Clark's reputation suffered a considerable blow, and his relations with his professional team, already uneasy, were further strained.|$|E
25|$|A queen {{is capable}} of mating {{starting}} 48 hours after emerging from the pupal stage. To find a male, queens fly to trees and bushes where males form aggregations. Males frequently groom their legs, antennae, and gasters throughout courtship, mating, and after contact with a queen. The queens have also been seen to groom the face and antennae, but only briefly. At the end of copulation, a queen is able to produce an olfactory or contact pheromone to signal release to the male. The queen also begins to nibble the dorsal surface of the male’s gaster to further signal the end of copulation. Since both queens and males can mate multiple times, the queen’s signals are advantageous if her spermatheca is full, thereby preventing <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> resources and time. Male having strong genitalic locks for mating is also advantageous, due to male-male competition, but can cause problems during disengagement. In the laboratory, both females and males have died during disengagement, sometimes leaving reproductive ends attached to the opposite sex.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferior}} planet mechanism {{includes the}} sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus. For {{each of the}} three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the sun and all the planets—excepting only the moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, {{out in front of the}} front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.|$|E
