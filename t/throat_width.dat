The arrangements were tested at flow rates that ranged from 10 L/min to 1000 L/min, where the collection efficiency of the minor flow was determined. An unknown acoustical phenomenon was present during aerosol tests at elevated flow rates causing low minor flow collection efficiencies. In order to test the impactors at elevated flow rates, the acoustical generation phenomenon was systematically studied and suppressed. The cutpoint for the first arrangement was 1. 3 ??m AD, and the cutpoint for the second arrangement was 1. 0 ??m AD. The average Stk 50 for both arrangements was 0. 71.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of laboratory data for a 0. 914 -m (3 -ft) length Cutthroat flume with four different throat widths is presented.

Special attention {{was given to}} non-hydrostatic pressures at the upstream and downstream piezometer taps, and the variations are presented {{in a series of}} three-dimensional plots. Variation in relative pressure at different tap heights was observed and was concluded to represent a shift from a concave to a convex flow profile between the 0. 305 - and 0. 203 -m throat widths. This significant alteration in the flow profile correlates with a sharp change in the nf calibration parameter, describing a non-linear relationship with flume <b>throat</b> <b>width.</b> Alternative equation forms were explored in an attempt to increase the predictive accuracy of the calculated flow rates for free- and submerged-flow regimes. The alternative equations showed a decrease in the percent error, in the submerged-flow regime, by more than 50 %. Transition submergence was observed to vary not only due to flume size, but also to flow rate. An empirically fitted equation was developed to calculate the transition submergence as a function of <b>throat</b> <b>width</b> and flow rate.

40|$|The most {{classic example}} of a {{hydraulic}} structure where gas transfer occurs is a weir. Transfer of gases between the atmosphere and river water can occur in a free overfall jet from a weir. A free overfall jet from a weir plunging into down-stream water causes entrainment of air bubbles if the free overfall jet velocity exceeds the critical value where aeration occurs. This paper investigates the free overfall jets from Venturi and rectangular notch weirs and their effect on air entrainment rate. A Venturi weir was placed at the upstream channel end {{in order to increase}} the flow velocity of the free overfall jet and, in turn, to increase air entrainment. It was demonstrated that the air entrainment rate of the Venturi weir is significantly better than the rectangular notch weir, and this advantage becomes more pronounced as the <b>throat</b> <b>width</b> of the Venturi weir is decreased. These results demonstrated that Venturi weirs can be used as highly effective aerators in streams, rivers, constructed channels, fish hatcheries, water treatment plants, etc. Moreover, a regression equation was obtained for the Venturi weirs, relating air entrainment rate to unit discharge, weir crest width, drop height and <b>throat</b> <b>width</b> of Venturi weir.

Flow and heat transfer studies were made at total divergence angles ranging from 0 to 45 degrees, at diffuser wall length to throat ratios ranging from 6 to 18, and at Reynolds numbers based on throat velocity and <b>throat</b> <b>width</b> ranging from approximately 40, 000 to 300, 000. Flow studies were made using wool-yarn tufts and a smoke generator. Flow regimes developed were: no "appreciable" separation, large transitory stall, and fully-developed two-dimensional stall. Velocity measurements were made for fully-developed two-dimensional stall. Steady-state heat transfer measurements were obtained with 23 electrically heated spot heaters mounted in the isothermal wall. Only one of the diffuser walls was heated to an isothermal condition. The other walls and the diffuser entrance sections were adiabatic. Results indicated that the total divergence angle, the ratio of wall length to <b>throat</b> <b>width,</b> and inlet turbulence level had the greatest effect on establishment of flow regimes. Flow patterns were found to be in general agreement with those observed by Waitman, Reneau, and Kline. Heat transfer results for round entrances agreed substantially with those of VanSant. Heat transfer rates for all entrances tested were greatest when the angle of divergence was 0 degrees. When the angle was increased, the heat transfer rates decreased. For the configurations tested, heat transfer rates were greater for reentrant than square entrances.

40|$|AbstractA turbine design method {{based on}} {{pressure}} controlled vortex design (PCVD) {{is presented to}} design a small-size turbine stage. Contrary to the conventional controlled vortex design (CVD) method, the main objective of PCVD is to control the axial velocity and radial pressure in the stator–rotor gap. Through controlling axial velocity, the PCVD establishes a direct tie to meridional stream surface. Thus stream surface variation is induced, resulting in a large secondary flow vortex covering the full blade passage in the respective stator and rotor. This secondary flow vortex could be dedicated to control the secondary flow mitigation and migration. Through radial pressure, the PCVD is also associated with the macroscopic driving force of fluid motion. So the better benefit of CVD can be achieved. The core concept behind PCVD is to mainly control the spanwise pressure gradient by altering profile loading at various spanwise locations. Therefore not only the local profile lift is affected, but also the resulting <b>throat</b> <b>widths,</b> stage reaction degree, and massflow rate are altered or redistributed respectively. With the PCVD method, the global stage efficiency is increased successfully while the mass flow rate keeps constant. Additionally there is no endwall shape optimization, stacking optimization, or pitch/chord variations, concentrating solely on varying blade profile deflections and stagger...|$|R

In the nitrogen testing, peak nozzle performance was achieved around area ratio of 5. In the helium series, nozzle performance peaked for the smallest nozzle tested area ratio 1. 5. For both gases, there was a secondary performance peak above area ratio 15. At low chamber pressures (< 1. 6 atm), nitrogen provided higher nozzle performance than helium.

Such hierarchical nanoporous carbons with mesopores and micropores have shown high specific electric double layer capacitances and high rate capability in an organic electrolyte. We express the anisotropic diffusion coefficient and adsorption coefficient of such materials {{in terms of the}} tunnels' properties (pore radius and inter-pore <b>throat</b> <b>width)</b> and their connectivity (spacing between the adjacent tunnels and nanotube-bridge density). Our analysis is applicable for solutes that undergo a non-equilibrium Langmuir adsorption reaction on the surfaces of fluid-filled pores, but other homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions can be handled in a similar fashion. The presented results can be used to guide the design of nanoporous materials with optimal permeability and sorption capacity...|$|E
25|$|Most popular {{constant}} directivity horns (also {{known as}} CD horns) suffer from non-spherical wavefronts, limitations in arrayability, distortion at high sound pressure levels {{as well as}} reflections and distortions related to the transition from diffraction slot to secondary horn. They tend toward a narrowing of dispersion pattern at the higher frequencies whose wavelengths approach the <b>width</b> of the <b>throat</b> or the <b>width</b> of the diffraction slot.|$|R
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} software {{was used to}} simulate the hydraulic behavior of 51 Cutthroat flume (CTF) sizes under various flow conditions, including 24 standard sizes with <b>throat</b> <b>widths</b> (W) from 0. 051 to 1. 219 m (2 inches to 4 ft), flume scale lengths (L) ranging from 0. 457 to 2. 743 m (1. 5 - 9 ft), constriction ratios (W/L) of 1 / 9, 2 / 9, 3 / 9, and 4 / 9, and 27 non-standard flumes of intermediate sizes. The validity and accuracy of the simulation results were demonstrated using laboratory data from other studies for 16 of the standard flume sizes and three non-standard sizes. By using the depth-discharge data for 24 standard CTFs obtained from the modeling, a series of 2 ̆ 2 best-fit 2 ̆ 2 calibrations of existing separate free- and submerged-flow rating equations were performed {{for each of the}} 24 standard-sized CTFs. A new unified rating equation for free- and submerged-flow conditions for the standard CTF sizes was proposed by comparing a set of empirical equations. The performance of the unified rating equation was also analyzed {{in order to determine the}} technical desirability of the equations as substitutes for the existing separate free- and submerged-flow rating equations. For the free-flow rating, the discharge parameters in the traditional equation are generalized to be applicable to any of the CTF sizes with flume lengths ranging from 0. 457 to 2. 743 m (1. 5 - 9 ft), and the constriction ratio ranging from 1 / 9 to 4 / 9. This allows the application of CTFs with greater accuracy than the previously available equation. With the new generic-fit equations for the free-flow rating parameters, the discharge error is 4...|$|R
40|$|A multiple-throat venturi {{system has}} been invented for {{measuring}} laminar flow of air or other gas at low speed (1 to 30 cm/s) in a duct while preserving the laminar nature of the flow and keeping the velocity profile across the duct as nearly flat as possible. While means for measuring flows at higher speeds are well established, heretofore, {{there have been no}} reliable means for making consistent, accurate measurements in this speed range. In the original application for which this system was invented, the duct leads into the test section of a low-speed wind tunnel wherein uniform, low-speed, laminar flow is required for scientific experiments. The system could also be used to monitor a slow flow of gas in an industrial process like chemical vapor deposition. In the original application, the multiple- throat venturi system is mounted at the inlet end of the duct having a rectangular cross section of 19 by 14 cm, just upstream of an assembly of inlet screens and flow straighteners that help to suppress undesired flow fluctuations (see Figure 1). The basic venturi measurement principle is well established: One measures the difference in pressure between (1) a point just outside the inlet, where the pressure is highest and the kinetic energy lowest; and (2) the narrowest part (the throat) of the venturi passage, where the kinetic energy is highest and the pressure is lowest. Then by use of Bernoulli s equation for the relationship between pressure and kinetic energy, the volumetric flow speed in the duct can be calculated from the pressure difference and the inlet and <b>throat</b> <b>widths.</b> The design of this system represents a compromise among length, pressure recovery, uniformity of flow, and complexity of assembly. Traditionally, venturis are used to measure faster flows in narrower cross sections, with longer upstream and downstream passages to maintain accuracy. The dimensions of the passages of the present venturi system are sized to provide a readily measurable pressure drop. Multiple throats are used to minimize the length needed to recover internal energy and enable the velocity profile to recover to near flatness...|$|R
