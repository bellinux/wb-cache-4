5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> do not give up hope even {{at the edge of the}} grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E

Ford delivered a speech at Calvin College in Grand Rapids {{the week before the}} election in which he said: [...] "Paul Goebel I have known since he was just a lad. His dad knew me when I was back at South High—an inspired if not very competent football player. But I have known the Goebel family a long time, and they are strong and they are tall, and they are <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are dedicated to public service. Paul, Jr.'s, father was; Paul, Jr., himself is. And I have seen nothing but the finest in that family, and young Paul, he epitomizes all the great characteristics of that family." ...|$|E

Shop windows were cleared of all signs and obstructions to preserve intended view from the corridor through to the street. Fluorescent lighting was prohibited and only gold leaf lettering on the glass was permitted for signage. Shops, all individually owned, were selected to fit the architectural character of the building. A florist, for example, was chosen that evoked a turn-of-the-century atmosphere, {{as well as a}} barbershop with vintage fixtures and decor. A tobacconist with oak furnishings, a pen shop with glass cases, a shoe-shine stand, and other service establishments represented, in Donnell's words, [...] "the kind of small-scale entrepreneurs who occupied those spaces {{at the turn of the}} century, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> bring vitality and life to a building because they have a stake in it." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 15, Madonna threw a pre-release {{party at}} New York City's Industria Superstudio, and signed all the invitations under her Sex alter ego [...] "Dita". During the party, Madonna showed up dressed as Little Bo Peep and even carried {{with her a}} stuffed toy lamb. Madonna's {{publicist}} Liz Rosenberg showed concern at first due to [...] "what the parents of America's impressionable teens will soon be thinking" [...] but later said that it [...] "all depends on your idea of lovemaking, which in Madonna's case, should give {{new meaning to the}} word erotic". Both Waldenbooks and Barnes & Noble prepared corporate statements that the managers could share with customers who are offended by Sex. (Both statements defended the right of bookstores to provide [...] "diversity and choice" [...] to customers and say censorship is not the role of bookstores.) Many book stores, too, stated that the book would not be sold to anyone under 18 {{and that it would be}} for display only behind the cash register. Bookstore owner David Epstein stated that [...] "The feeling of most people who have ordered the book is that Madonna is something special, that this is cutting-edge art, , they're not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are buying it because it's smut and dirty pictures. People are interested in it as art." ...|$|E

These excellent people, it seems, have conscientious objections {{to going to}} chapel or church, {{but at the same}} time the devotional habit of countless generations of pious forerunners is strong in them. Consequently they have invented things like these lectures to go to, with a professor instead of a priest, and a lantern slide of a stomach by way of altar-piece; and alcohol they make their Devil, and their god is Hygiene--a curious and instructive case of mental inertia. I understand, too, there are several other temples of this Cult in London--South Place Chapel and Essex Hall, for instance, where they worship the Spirit of the Innermost. But the thing that struck me so oddly was the number of bald heads glimmering faintly in the reflected light from the lantern circle. And that set me thinking upon a difficulty I have never been able to surmount.|$|E

The party very soon broke up, the Flushings going in one direction, Hirst in another, and Rachel remaining in the hall, pulling the illustrated papers about, turning from one to another, her movements expressing the unformed restless desire in her mind. She {{did not know whether}} to go or to stay, though Mrs. Flushing had commanded her to appear at tea. The hall was empty, save for Miss Willett who was playing scales with her fingers upon a sheet of sacred music, and the Carters, an opulent couple who disliked the girl, because her shoe laces were untied, and she did not look sufficiently cheery, which by some indirect process of thought led them to think that she would not like them. Rachel certainly would not have liked them, if she had seen them, for the excellent reason that Mr. Carter waxed his moustache, and Mrs. Carter wore bracelets, and they were evidently <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> would not like her; but she was too much absorbed by her own restlessness to think or to look.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have just}} been reading an amusing book by Lady Grove called [...] "The Social Fetich," [...] which is a {{positive}} riot of this new specialism and mystification. It is due to Lady Grove {{to say that she}} has some of the freer and more honourable qualities of the old Whig aristocracy, as well as their wonderful worldliness and their strange faith in the passing fashion of our politics. For instance, she speaks of Jingo Imperialism with a healthy English contempt; and she perceives stray and striking truths, and records them justly--as, for instance, the greater democracy of the Southern and Catholic countries of Europe. But in her dealings with social formulæ here in England she is, it must frankly be said, a common mystagogue. She does not, like a decent demagogue, wish to make people understand; she wishes to make them painfully conscious of not understanding. Her favourite method is to terrify people from doing things that are quite harmless by telling them that if they do they are <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> would do other things, equally harmless. If you ask after somebody's mother (or whatever it is), you are {{the kind of person who}} would have a pillow-case, or would not have a pillow-case. I forget which it is; and so, I dare say, does she. If you assume the ordinary dignity of a decent citizen and say that you don't see the harm of having a mother or a pillow-case, she would say that of course you wouldn't. This is what I call being a mystagogue. It is more vulgar than being a demagogue; because it is much easier.|$|E
