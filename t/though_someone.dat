25|$|One {{method of}} hunting sloth bears {{involved}} {{the use of}} beaters, in which case, a hunter waiting on a post could either shoot the approaching bear through the shoulder or on the white chest mark if it was moving directly to him. Sloth bears are very resistant to body shots, and can charge hunters if wounded, <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> of steady nerves could score a direct hit from within a few paces of a charging bear. Sloth bears were easy to track during the wet season, as their clear footprints could be followed straight to their lairs. The majority of sloth bears killed in forests were due to chance encounters with them during hunts for other game. In hilly or mountainous regions, two methods were used to hunt them there. One was to lie in wait above the bear's lair at dawn {{and wait for the}} bear to return from its nocturnal foraging. Another was to rouse them at daytime by firing flares into the cave to draw them out. Sloth bears were also occasionally speared on horseback. In Sri Lanka, the baculum of a sloth bear was once used as a charm against barrenness.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

[...] " [...] Roger Christian has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras," [...] wrote Ebert, [...] "but he has not learned why." [...] Derivative special effects and illogical plotting were also widely criticized. The Providence Journal highlighted the film's unusual color scheme: [...] "Battlefield Earth's primary colors are blue and gray, adding to the misery.

500|$|Saldívar {{accompanied}} Selena {{on a trip}} to Tennessee {{while the}} singer finished recording a song for her crossover album. Selena told Saldívar some bank statements were missing and asked her to return them as soon as they returned to Texas. Saldívar re-purchased the gun on March 27 and asked Selena to meet her alone at a motel room; this was her second attempt to kill Selena. News of Selena's arrival spread and she was soon mobbed by fans. Quintanilla, Jr. believed her fans saved her that day; there were [...] "too many witnesses". According to him, the third attempt to kill Selena was during Saldívar's trip to Monterrey in the last week of March. Dr. Martinez received telephone calls from Saldívar crying hysterically and saying she had been raped on March 29. The next day, Saldívar again called Dr. Martinez, who said the calls sounded as <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> was trying to snatch the telephone away from Saldívar. He sent an employee to her motel room to investigate; the employee found she had left a few minutes earlier.|$|E

He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was {{the sort of person who}} might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{criticism}} has been leveled by Brody (2004), {{who claimed that}} unlike tests of cognitive ability, the MSCEIT [...] "tests knowledge of emotions but not necessarily the ability to perform tasks {{that are related to}} the knowledge that is assessed". The main argument is that even <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> knows how he should behave in an emotionally laden situation, it doesn't necessarily follow that the person could actually carry out the reported behavior.|$|E

2500|$|David Flying Hawk was {{the eldest}} son of Felix Flying Hawk. David was a {{performer}} with Wild West Shows and traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk. In 1924, David Flying Hawk performed in Rhode Island and had a notable encounter with a horse named “King Tut.” [...] “King Tut was a big bay, very rank horse, that we bought at Tribune, Kansas. [...] The real King Tut’s tomb had been discovered along about this time and papers were still carrying {{quite a bit of}} news about it, therefore the name King Tut. [...] The horse had been bucked away from a snubbing horse a few times and we thought he would develop; into a real good, tough bucking horse. [...] A lot of the credit for getting ole Tut started on the road to becoming a great horse must go to a Sioux Indian boy by the name of Dave Flying Hawk, who was on the Knights of Columbus rodeo with us in 1924. [...] This Indian and two others, of the carload that was with us, were bronc riders. [...] Dave was also part of the Indian dance troupe. The program for our opening performance in Providence, Rhode Island was somewhat in turmoil. [...] The Indian dancers had just finished when the arena director, Sammy Garrett, started calling for Flying Hawk to come to the bucking chutes, that his horse was in. [...] King Tut, being pretty wild. Had gone into the chutes first. [...] There being no time for Flying Hawk to change clothes, he came to the chutes in full dance costume—fringed buckskin clothes, feathers, bells—the whole works. [...] While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn’t been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut’s back. [...] When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk. [...] The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit. [...] It looked as <b>though</b> <b>someone</b> had shot a wild turkey—the crowd went wild. [...] They thought that it was a special act that Flying Hawk was putting on. [...] That was the funniest thong I’ve ever seen happened at a rodeo. [...] We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year. [...] I heard {{a few years ago that}} they bucked him until he was nearly twenty-six years old, but I’m sure that he was never as scared in his life as we was with Flying Hawk on board.” ...|$|E
