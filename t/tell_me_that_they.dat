500|$|From 1904 onwards, Bondfield was {{increasingly}} occupied {{with the issue}} of women's suffrage. In that year she travelled with Dora Montefiore of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to the International Congress of Women in Berlin, but she was not in sympathy with the main WSPU policy, which was to secure the vote for women on the same highly restricted basis that it was then given to men. This involved a property qualification, and thus largely excluded the working class. Bondfield saw no benefit in this policy to the women that she represented, and aligned herself with the Adult Suffrage Society (ASS), which campaigned for universal adult suffrage, men and women alike, regardless of property. In 1906 she became chairman of the society and supported the Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities bill, introduced to parliament by Sir Charles Dilke. This proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs. The bill was [...] "talked out" [...] in the House of Commons, but Bondfield's support antagonised many militants in the WSPU, who considered the bill a distraction from their more limited aims. In 1907, {{in the course of a}} public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women's Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification. She wished good luck to those fighting for a [...] "same terms as men" [...] suffrage bill, but [...] "don't let them come and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are working for my class". The strains of her duties and constant campaigning began to undermine her health, and in 1908 she resigned her union post after ten years' service, during which NAUSAWC membership had risen to over 20,000. Her departure, she said, was [...] "alike a grief and a deliverance".|$|E
2500|$|In response, 60 Minutes Wednesday {{released}} a statement suggesting that Will and James had [...] "misrepresented" [...] {{their role in the}} authentication of the documents and had played only a small part in the process. CBS News concurrently amended its previous claim that Matley had authenticated the documents, saying instead that he had only authenticated the signatures. On CNN, Matley stated he had only verified that the signatures were [...] "from the same source," [...] not that they were authentically Killian's: [...] "When I saw the documents, I could not verify the documents were authentic or inauthentic. I could only verify that the signatures came from the same source," [...] Matley said. [...] "I could not authenticate the documents themselves. But at the same time, there was nothing to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not authentic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Forty years later, Holloway's son was {{responsible}} for interviewing the eminent lawyers, businessmen, and government officials who applied {{for membership in the}} exclusive Metropolitan Club of the City of Washington between 1988 and 1992. [...] "I was truly amazed at the number of these prospective members who asked if I were any relation to the admiral who founded the Holloway Plan," [...] recalled the younger Holloway, by then a famous admiral in his own right. [...] "When I answered yes, they would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't be sitting there today if it weren't for the Holloway Plan....It had put them through collegeschools like Princeton, Duke University, Caltech, and Stanford. After the Korean War and Vietnam, the opportunities were so great on the outside that many of them left the service and became quite successful in their civilian careers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are wonderfully well made," [...] said Johnson, {{talking to}} me, and still {{fingering}} the button. [...] "They are manufactured, he says, at Osuna, and he <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> make them better there than anywhere else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{good can}} I do her, suppose--suppose the enemy arrive?" [...] Jos answered. [...] "They'll spare the women; but my man <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{have taken an}} oath to give no quarter to the men--the dastardly cowards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear young man," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "my dear Mr.--Mr. Burton--why, this is wonderful! Where did you {{get these}} sheets, do you say? Are you {{honestly}} <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were written within the last thousand years?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{have got}} a dandy hotel there--something new," [...] said Sam. [...] "We ought to get {{first-class}} accommodations there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] replied Millicent sharply, [...] "didn't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were worth}} sixteen shillings {{not very long}} ago? Why didn't you sell them then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} chatting with the Miss Mitfords, captain; {{they are in}} the cabin with my daughter. They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are under your special charge." ...|$|E
5000|$|Heinrich {{told the}} Los Angeles Times Mark Milian {{that he had}} {{received}} correspondence from satisfied customers, [...] "I've got e-mails from customers <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> really love the app and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had no trouble spending the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> all say at Greshamsbury that he {{is going}} to marry Lady Scatcherd." [...] Now Lady Scatcherd was a widow living in those parts; an {{excellent}} woman, but one not formed by nature to grace society of the highest order.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered, [...] "one of my rowers <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have towed her to {{an island}} out at sea, since the stench from her holds was more than could be borne. But {{how did you know}} that she lay at this {{particular}} quay, Sir Hugh?" ...|$|R
60|$|P. 16 [par. 30] Clarendon, in {{a letter}} from Montrevil--"They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will do more than can be expressed"--Swift. So the Scots did, and with a vengeance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see what}} you mean," [...] said Mrs. Ewbert, {{provisionally}} suspending her sense of the whimsical quality in his suggestion. [...] "But you need never <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't appreciate you more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But their corsairs seize all our craft, Signore, {{and treat}} their people {{as if they}} were no better than dogs; then, they <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not Christians--no, not even Luterani or heretics!" ...|$|E
60|$|Always, {{during my}} childhood, {{at this stage}} of the dream, did I wake up {{screaming}} with fright--to find, often, my mother or nurse, anxious and startled, by my bedside, passing soothing hands through my hair and <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were there and that there was nothing to fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{wife has}} been <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> knew you at home, Whitney; {{and that she}} and her people did you some terrible injustice, somehow. But she wouldn't go into the matter. Curious, isn't it, your meeting at this end of the world; and that, too, at such a moment?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ernest on Women's Rights: [...] "They {{tried it}} the wrong way. You can't expect anyone {{to take you}} seriously if you burn your undies and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I'm a pig. That's why it failed. Too many ugly broads <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don't want to sleep with me. Who wanted you anyway?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope, Lord Maltenby," [...] {{the former}} said, [...] "that you will excuse my men, but they <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> find it {{necessary}} to search your garage for a car which has been seen in the neighbourhood." ...|$|E
6000|$|He jerked up his chin, {{testing the}} growth of his beard {{with the back of}} his hand while he fixed her with a single eye. [...] "Ah, I don't say that they'd {{necessarily}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> ARE over the traces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the {{question}} precisely," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I only {{want you to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don't matter. There are times when you seem indifferent to everything. I'm vain, I've a thousand faults; but you know they're not everything; you know I care for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had an {{interesting}} talk with Furley this morning," [...] the Prime Minister observed. [...] "He <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are thinking of making an appeal to this man Paul Fiske to declare himself. They want a leader--they want one very badly--and thank heavens they don't {{know where to look}} for him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it was Richard's own doing," [...] he continued. [...] "Those sermons {{made a great}} impression, {{and they}} love the boy, because he has grown up among them. The old mayor waddled up to me, as I came in, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been talking it over, and they were {{unanimously}} agreed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not have a parson they should like better than Mr. Richard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{interesting}} experience {{while it}} lasts; that is all. Like Hans there, if {{what they say}} is true, my future is a matter of complete indifference to me. But I do not believe a word of what <b>they</b> say. Something <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> know a great deal which they do not choose to repeat--about my wife I mean. <b>That</b> is why <b>they</b> are so anxious that I should not accompany you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have surprised--you have perplexed me," [...] Iris said. [...] "I am {{at a loss}} to {{understand}} how you discovered what seems to have passed between your master and Mr. Vimpany. You don't surely mean to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> talked of their private affairs while you were waiting at table?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not, and by {{good luck}} neither do the Injuns, for why, they can't read handwritin' as {{is not meant}} for 'em, but I know somethin' of the tribe they are after, an' one or two small marks on the trees <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not far distant. No doubt they will attack the camp at night." ...|$|E
6000|$|And when I am far on {{the road}} to conviction, and eight men, be they {{grammatical}} or otherwise, come forward and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have seen the plates too; and not only seen those plates but [...] "hefted" [...] them, I am convinced. I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified.|$|E
5000|$|I told Rick Hendrick I didn't {{think the}} kid {{was ever going to}} make it. I mean, seriously, he hit {{everything}} but the pace car that year. At the time I thought I was right because he seemed to wreck almost every week. I remember Ray Evernham... <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had to replace something like 13 noses on the cars from where Jeff wrecked. ... I for one was pretty skeptical of his future at the time. Darrell Waltrip about Jeff Gordon ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is a man," [...] Beric replied. [...] "Across {{the sea to}} {{the south}} there are brown men many shades darker than the people here, and beyond these like lands {{inhabited}} by black men. Look at him showing his teeth and the whites of his eyes. He is as much surprised at our appearance, Boduoc, as we are at his. We shall see many like him in Rome, for Pollio <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are held in high estimation as slaves, being good tempered and obedient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{a letter}} from Ryan, yesterday," [...] Terence said. [...] "He <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have had no {{fighting}} since we left. They form only one battalion now, {{and he says the}} state of things in Madrid is dreadful. The people are dying of hunger, and the British officers have subscribed and started soup kitchens; and that he, with the other Portuguese regiments, were to march the next day, with three British divisions and the cavalry, to join General Clinton, who was falling back before Clausel." ...|$|R
6000|$|Blacky chuckled hoarsely. [...] "I didn't," [...] said he. [...] "I simply {{thought there}} might be {{something}} going on I didn't know about over here in the pond of Paddy the Beaver, so I came over to find out. Mr. Quack, you and Mrs. Quack are looking very fine this fall. And those handsome young Quacks, you don't mean to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are your children!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Dr. dear," [...] said Susan. [...] "I {{wish you}} would wake me up. Am I dreaming--or am I awake? Does that blessed boy realize what he is saying? Does he mean {{that he is going}} to enlist as a soldier? You do not mean to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> want {{children}} like him! It is an outrage. Surely you and the doctor will not permit it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I mourn over them," [...] said Sybil, [...] "the deep {{convictions}} {{that made}} me {{look forward to the}} cloister as my home. Is it that the world has assoiled my soul? Yet I have not tasted of worldly joys; all that I have known of it has been suffering and tears. They will return, these visions of my sacred youth, dear friend, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will return!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> before <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had several}} men you had met while under Dewey and some your brother Walter had met while {{fighting}} in Cuban waters?" ...|$|R
60|$|How {{it must be}} {{with the}} poor devils for'ard is beyond conceiving. The {{forecastle}} has been washed out several times, and everything is soaking wet. Besides, they have grown weaker, and two watches are required to do what one ordinary watch could do. Thus, they must spend as many hours on the sea-swept deck and aloft on the freezing yards as I do in my warm, dry bunk. Wada <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> never undress, but turn into their wet bunks in their oil-skins and sea-boots and wet undergarments.|$|R
6000|$|I {{know that}} many professors will fall short of eternal life, and my {{judgment}} <b>tells</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be of the slovenly sort of professors that so do. And for my part, I had rather run with the foremost and win the prize, than come behind, and lose that, and my labour, and all. 'If a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.' And when men have said all they can, they are the truly redeemed 'that are zealous of good works.'
