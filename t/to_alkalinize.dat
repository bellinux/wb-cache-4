40|$|Five {{strains of}} an {{unidentified}} fluorescent Pseudomonas sp. which {{were capable of}} growth at 42 degrees C were isolated over a 3 -year period and were examined and compared with chosen strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, and P. putida. The strains were examined {{in a range of}} biochemical and carbon substrate alkalinization tests. The outstanding properties of the unidentified fluorescent Pseudomonas sp. included monopolar arrangement of flagella, gelatin liquefaction, litmus milk peptonization, and growth on cetrimide and Salmonella-Shigella agars. All strains failed to produce pyocyanin, 2 -ketogluconate, and nitrogen gas, failed to acidify mannitol and xylose, and failed <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> acetamide and allantoin. Similarities to P. fluorescens and P. putida were reflected in their resistance to carbenicillin and susceptibility to kanamycin and tetracycline...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of inhibition of HCO 3 transport by parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the proximal tubule is not clearly defined. Previous studies in vitro {{have suggested that}} this effect is mediated via cAMP generation, which acts to inhibit Na/H exchange, resulting in cell acidification. To examine this question in vivo, intracellular pH (pHi) was measured in the superficial proximal tubule of the rat using the pH-sensitive fluoroprobes 4 -methylumbelliferone (4 MU) and 2 ', 7 '-bis(carboxyethyl) -(5, and 6) -carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). PTH was found <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> the cell. This alkalinization suggested inhibition of basolateral base exit, which was confirmed by in situ microperfusion studies: lowering HCO 3 in peritubular capillaries acidified the cell, an effect blunted by PTH. Removal of luminal Na promoted basolateral base entry, alkalinizing the cell. This response was also blunted by PTH. Readdition of luminal Na stimulated the luminal Na/H exchanger, causing an alkalinization overshoot that was partially inhibited by PTH. cAMP inhibited luminal H secretion but did not alkalinize the cell. Stimulation of phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate turnover by PTH was suggested by the effect to the hormone to increase cell Ca. Blocking the PTH-induced rise in cell Ca blunted {{the effect of the}} hormone <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> the cell, as did inhibition of phosphatidylinositol breakdown. Furthermore, stimulation of protein kinase C by a phorbol ester and a diacylglycerol applied basolaterally alkalinized the cell and inhibited luminal H secretion. The findings indicate that both arms of the phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate cascade play a role in mediating the effect of PTH on the cell pH. The results are consistent with the view that PTH inhibits base exit in the proximal tubule by activation of the phosphatidylinositol cascade. The resulting alkalinization may contribute, with cAMP, to inhibit apical Na/H exchange and the PTH-induced depression of proximal HCO 3 reabsorption...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{swelling}} {{is shown}} to induce an increase in acridine orange fluorescence intensity, an effect pointing to the alkalinization of acidic vesicles. Since autophagic hepatic proteolysis is accomplished by pH-sensitive proteinases within acidic lysosomes, this effect {{may contribute to the}} well-known inhibitory effect of cell swelling on proteolysis. In the present study, the role of microtubules in volume-dependent alterations of pH in acidic vesicles of rat and human hepatocytes was studied. Colcemid and colchicine were used to depolymerize microtubules and vesicular pH was monitored using two different fluorescent dyes, fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran and acridine orange. Colcemid and colchicine, but not the inactive stereoisomer gamma-lumicolchicine, blunted the increase of pH during osmotic cell swelling. The alkalinization of acidic vesicles by NH 4 Cl was not significantly modified by colcemid or colchicine, indicating that the vesicles were still sensitive <b>to</b> <b>alkalinizing</b> procedures other than cell swelling. Further, colchicine, but not gamma-lumicolchicine, inhibited the antiproteolytic action of osmotic cell swelling. The present observations point to an involvement of the microtubule network in the link of cell volume, lysosomal pH, and proteolysis...|$|R

Here we report and characterize the Cx induced inhibition of T-type channels in mouse spermatogenic cells. Unexpectedly, Cx can also induce the acrosome reaction (AR), an intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) increase and a sperm depolarization. This [Ca 2 +]i increase possibly results from the ability Cx has <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> intracellular pH (pHi), which is known to activate the sperm specific Ca 2 + channel CatSper. As the Cx induced [Ca 2 +]i increase is sensitive to mibefradil, a CatSper blocker, this channel may mediate the Cx-induced Ca 2 + entry leading to the AR.

40|$|Extracellular pH {{has been}} shown {{previously}} to influence transport via type-II Na+/phosphate (NaPi) transporters by modifying the affinity of the carrier for Na+ and by altering the availability of divalent and monovalent phosphate. As the transport of monovalent phosphate {{would be expected to}} acidify, and that of divalent phosphate <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> the cell interior, the effect of phosphate transport on cytosolic pH was studied using ion selective microelectrodes in Xenopus oocytes expressing NaPi- 3 or NaPi- 5. At an alkaline extracellular pH (pHe) of 8. 0, addition of phosphate elicited a strong inward current, depolarization of the cell membrane and cytosolic alkalinization. At pHe 6. 0 the phosphate-induced inward current and depolarization were reduced and the alkalinization completely abolished. In conclusion, at alkaline pHe phosphate transport is enhanced and the transport of divalent phosphate prevails. At pHe 6. 0, phosphate transport is attenuated and is accomplished by transport of both divalent and monovalent phosphate...|$|E

Sequence {{analysis of the}} 16 S rRNA genes revealed similarity of 100 % among the three strains and next highest similarity to the type strain of Acidovorax avenae (98. 16 %). The three strains were able to acidify lactose and rhamnose on low peptone phenol red agar and <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> citrate on Simmons' agar and were negative for nitrate reduction.

Based on these phylogenetic, phenotypic and genotypic analyses, the three strains could be distinguished clearly from all other recognized Acidovorax species and should be classified as representatives of a novel species of the genus Acidovorax, for which the name Acidovorax wautersii sp. nov. is proposed.

40|$|Aim: To compare {{self-reported}} {{pain and}} efficacy of warmed, alkalinized, and warmed alkalinized lidocaine with plain 2 &#x 0025; lidocaine {{at room temperature for}} peribulbar anesthesia in cataract surgery. Materials and Methods: Through a prospective, single-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial 200 patients were divided into four groups. They received either lidocaine at operating room temperature 18 &# 176;C, control group (Group C), lidocaine warmed to 37 &# 176;C (Group W), lidocaine <b>alkalinized</b> <b>to</b> a pH of 7. 09 &# 177; 0. 10 (Group B) or lidocaine at 37 &# 176;C <b>alkalinized</b> <b>to</b> a pH of 6. 94 &# 177; 0. 05 (Group WB). All solutions contained Inj. Hyaluronidase 50 IU/ml. Pain was assessed using a 10 -cm visual analog score scale. Time of onset of sensory and motor blockade and time to onset of postoperative pain were recorded by a blinded observer. Results: Mean pain score was significantly lower in Group B and WB compared with Group C (P < 0. 001). Onset of analgesia was delayed in Group C compared with Group B (P = 0. 021) and WB (P < 0. 001). Mean time taken for the onset of complete akinesia and supplementation required for the block was significantly lower in Group B. Time of onset of pain after operation was significantly earlier in Group W compared with Group C (P = 0. 036). Conclusion: Alkalinized lidocaine with or without warming produced less pain than lidocaine injected at room temperature. Alkalinization enhances the effect of warming for sensory nerve blockade, but warming does not enhance alkalinization, in fact it reduces the efficacy of alkalinized solution for blocking the motor nerves in the eye...|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{precursor}} cells extend multiple neurites during development, {{one of which}} extends to form an axon whereas others develop into dendrites. Chemical stimulation of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in fully-differentiated neurons induces projection of dendritic spines, small spikes protruding from dendrites, thereby establishing another layer of polarity within the dendrite. Neuron-enriched Na+/H+ exchanger NHE 5 contributes to both neurite growth and dendritic spine formation. In resting neurons and neuro-endocrine cells, neuron-enriched NHE 5 is predominantly associated with recycling endosomes where it colocalizes with nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor TrkA. NHE 5 potently acidifies the lumen of TrkA-positive recycling endosomes and regulates cell-surface targeting of TrkA, whereas chemical stimulation of NMDA receptor rapidly recruits NHE 5 <b>to</b> dendritic spines, <b>alkalinizes</b> dendrites and down-regulates the dendritic spine formation.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 195 : 1 - 7, 1975. Two carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, acetazolamide and benzolamide, are capable of in-creasing the toxicity of sodium salicylate in mice. Beginning at about 2 mg/kg, each of the inhibitors, in combination with a fixed (400 mg/kg) dose of salicylate, generates a dose-mortality curve that reaches a plateau at about 60 % deaths at 6 to 8 mg/kg. This effect can be duplicated by 8 to 10 % inspired CO 2. It appears that the respiratory acidosis secondary to the inhibition of red cell carbonic anhydrase is responsible for the increased toxicity; earlier work by others shows that acidosis in’creases the con-centration of salicylate in the brain. In the treatment of salicylate poisoning by car-bonic anhydrase inhibitors, the goal is <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> the urine and increase the excre-tion of salicylate. With the newer inhibitor, benzolamide, it is possible to dissociate the respiratory acidosis from the renal effect. Maximal alk. alinizatioh of the urine is possibl...|$|E
40|$|A gene {{encoding}} a preprohydroxyproline-rich systemin, SnpreproHypSys, {{was identified}} from {{the leaves of}} black nightshade (Solanum nigrum), which {{is a member of}} a small gene family of at least three genes that have orthologs in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum; NtpreproHypSys), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum; SlpreproHypSys), petunia (Petunia hybrida; PhpreproHypSys), potato (Solanum tuberosum; PhpreproHypSys), and sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas; IbpreproHypSys). SnpreproHypSys was induced by wounding and by treatment with methyl jasmonate. The encoded precursor protein contained a signal sequence and was posttranslationally modified to produce three hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptide signals (HypSys peptides). The three HypSys peptides isolated from nightshade leaf extracts were called SnHypSys I (19 amino acids with six pentoses), SnHypSys II (20 amino acids with six pentoses), and SnHypSys III (20 amino acids with either six or nine pentoses) by their sequential appearance in SnpreproHypSys. The three SnHypSys peptides were synthesized and tested for their abilities <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> suspension culture medium, with synthetic SnHypSys I demonstrating the highest activity. Synthetic SnHypSys I was capable of inducing alkalinization in other Solanaceae cell types (or species), indicating that structural conformations within the peptides are recognized by the different cells/species to initiate signal transduction pathways, apparently through recognition by homologous receptor(s). To further demonstrate the biological relevance of the SnHypSys peptides, the early defense gene lipoxygenase D was shown to be induced by all three synthetic peptides when supplied to excised nightshade plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{anterior}} midgut of the larval {{yellow fever}} mosquito Aedes aegypti generates a luminal pH in excess of 10 in vivo and similar values are attained by isolated and perfused anterior midgut segments after stimulation with submicromolar serotonin. In the present study we investigated the mechanisms of strong luminal alkalinization using the intracellular fluorescent indicator BCECF-AM. Following stimulation with serotonin, we observed that intracellular pH (pHi) of the anterior midgut increased from a mean of 6. 89 to a mean of 7. 62, whereas pHi of the posterior midgut did not change in response to serotonin. Moreover, a further increase of pHi to 8. 58 occurred when the pH of the luminal perfusate was raised to an in vivo-like value of 10. 0. Luminal Zn 2 + (10 μmol l– 1), an inhibitor of conductive proton pathways, did not inhibit the increase in pHi, the transepithelial voltage, or {{the capacity of the}} isolated tissue <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> the lumen. Finally, the transapical voltage did not significantly respond to luminal pH changes induced either by perfusion with pH 10 or by stopping the luminal perfusion with unbuffered solution which results in spontaneous luminal alkalinization. Together, these results seem to rule out the involvement of conductive pathways for proton absorption across the apical membrane and suggest that a serotonin-induced alkaline pHi {{plays an important role in}} the generation of an alkaline lumen...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} soil {{sodicity}} on growth, ion content and yield of Sarsabz, Marvi and Kiran wheat varieties {{was investigated in}} a pot experiment at the Department of Soil Science, Sindh Agriculture University, Tando Jam. Soil was artificially <b>alkalinized</b> <b>to</b> varying levels of ESP ranging from 4 to 25. The {{results of this study}} revealed that the effects of soil sodicity increased with increase in ESP levels of the soil. The adverse effects of sodicity on seedling emergence, plant height and yield were associated with high Na +, low K + and K + /Na + ratio analyzed in the flag leaf sap. There were differences among 3 wheat varieties in terms of the performance in sodic environment. Variety Marvi was observed to be more tolerant to soil sodicity from emergence to maturity. The improved growth and yield of this variety were associated with lower leaf Na + and higher K + and K + /Na + ratio than Sarsabz and Kiran. These results indicated that the cause of low wheat yield in sodic soils may be due to poor soil structure caused by high exchangeable Na + and high soil pH. The results of this study support the selection of Marvi for its use in future breeding program to screen out new local genotypes that can tolerate poor soil structure as well as high sodium stress...|$|R
40|$|Cocaine {{abuse is}} {{widespread}} {{all over the}} world, and is performed generally by sniffing, injecting or smoking cocaine or crack. The distinction between the recreational use of cocaine from {{the practice of the}} so called ‘‘coqueo’’ is still an issue in those countries where this habit is diffused and where it is not considered an addiction, by this reason is necessary to develop a method for to distinguish the coca chewers and cocaine abusers. The use of an unique marker to distinguish between cocaine abuse and chewing of coca leaves is of fundamental importance in those countries where this habit is diffused. Certain alkaloids of the leaves of Erythroxylum coca are lost during the process of extraction/purification of cocaine and {{it is not possible to}} find them neither in seizures of chlorhidrate of cocaine nor urine samples of cocaine abusers. These markers are the hygrine and cuscohygrine that are present in the leaves of E. coca. A fast GC/MS method involving a liquid:liquid extraction procedure with tertbutylmethylether (TBME) is proposed for the determination of some alkaloids in cocaine leaves, cocaine seizures and biological samples. All specimens were <b>alkalinized</b> <b>to</b> pH 9 with a carbonate/bicarbonate buffer and then extracted with TBME. The analysis was carry out by GC/MS with electron impact at 70 eV and in full scan mode. The results demonstrate that hygrine and cuscohygrine are not found neither in the urine of cocaine abusers nor in cocaine seizures. For this reason this compounds could be considered as markers of coca chewing. This developed method permits to distinguish coca chewing from cocaine abuse in workplace drug testing through the analysis of urine samples...|$|R
40|$|Evidence for apical sodium proton {{exchange}} in macula densa cells. These studies {{were performed to}} determine if changes in luminal sodium chloride concentration ([NaCl]) might alter macula densa intracellular pH. Isolated thick ascending limbs with attached glomeruli were bathed in a 150 mM NaCl Ringer's solution and perfused in vitro with a 25 mM NaCl solution; N-methyl-D-glucamine cyclamate was used to substitute for NaCl. Macula densa cells were loaded with BCECF and intracellular pH was monitored using a microscope based-dual excitation photometer system. Control intracellular pH for all experiments in which tubules were initially perfused with 25 mM NaCl averaged 7. 22 ± 0. 06; N = 28. Increasing luminal [NaCl] from 25 to 150 mM elevated macula densa pH by 0. 15 ± 0. 03 (N = 6; P < 0. 05) while increasing just luminal [Na] from 25 <b>to</b> 150 mM <b>alkalinized</b> macula densa cells by 0. 17 ± 0. 05 (N = 6; P < 0. 05). In addition, there was a highly significant linear relationship between luminal [Na] and intracellular pH between 25 and 150 mM NaCl. Other studies were performed to assess the effects of amiloride, an inhibitor of Na:H exchange, on macula densa intracellular pH. Addition of amiloride, to the 25 mM NaCl perfusate acidified macula densa cells by 0. 09 ± 0. 03 (N = 6; P < 0. 001) and significantly attenuated the increase in pH obtained when luminal [NaCl] was raised from 25 to 150 mM. Other studies evaluated the effects of inhibition of Na: 2 Cl:K cotransport on macula densa pH. Furosemide (50 µm) alkalinized macula densa pH by 0. 11 ± 0. 02 (N = 5; P < 0. 01) {{in the presence of}} 25 mM NaCl in the lumen whereas amiloride entirely reversed the furosemide-induced alkaninization in these cells. These results demonstrate that changes in either luminal [NaCl] or furosemide-sensitive NaCl transport can alter macula densa intracellular pH presumably by varying the Na gradient across the apical membrane. The results of these studies are consistent with the existence of an apical Na:H antiporter in macula densa cells...|$|R

The diversity of phenotypic responses to pH changes has not been extensively explored within fungal populations. To investigate this question, the ability of 82 strains of a worldwide collection of the take-all agent Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt) to grow in controlled pH conditions, reflecting their pH sensitivity, was measured. Of these 82 strains, 37 belonged to the G 1 type and 45 to the G 2 type, the two main genetic groups identified in Ggt populations. The experiments were conducted in Petri dishes on Fahraeus solid media buffered at pH 46, 60 or 70 with citrate-disodium phosphate solutions. The 82 strains exhibited a wide range of hyphal growth rates at the three pH levels. Ten statistically different pH profiles were described. The G 2 strains grew significantly better than the G 1 on the slightly acidic (pH 60) and the neutral (pH 70) buffered media. The ability of three strains to change ambient pH was also measured on unbuffered Fahraeus solid media initially adjusted to pH 56 or 80. All three strains were able <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> the acidic medium. However, important variations between strains in the intensity, range and persistence of this alkalinization were measured.

Here we explore the relationship between astrocytic intracellular pH dynamics and the synchronous network activity that occurs during seizure-like activity. By combining confocal and two-photon imaging of genetically-encoded pH reporters with simultaneous electrophysiological recordings, we perform pH measurements in defined cell populations and relate these to ongoing network activity. This approach reveals marked differences in the intracellular pH dynamics between hippocampal astrocytes and neighboring pyramidal neurons in rodent in vitro models of epilepsy. With three different genetically-encoded pH reporters, 3 astrocytes are observed <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> during epileptiform activity, whilst neurons are observed to acidify. In addition to the direction of pH change, the kinetics of epileptiform-associated intracellular pH transients are found to differ between the two cell types, with astrocytes displaying significantly more rapid changes in pH. The astrocytic alkalinization is shown to be highly correlated with astrocytic membrane potential changes during seizure-like events and mediated by an electrogenic Na+/HCO 3 - cotransporter. Finally, comparisons across different cell-pair combinations reveal that astrocytic pH dynamics are {{more closely related to}} network activity than are neuronal pH dynamics. This work demonstrates that astrocytes exhibit distinct pH dynamics during periods of epileptiform activity, which has relevance to multiple processes including neurometabolic coupling and the control of network excitability...|$|E
40|$|Systemin is an {{important}} mediator of wound-induced defense gene activation in tomato plants, and it elicits a rapid alkalinization of the growth medium of cultured Lycopersicon peruvianum cells. A possible mechanistic link between proton fluxes across the plasma membrane and the induction of defense genes was investigated by modulating plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity. Inhibitors of H+-ATPase (erythrosin B, diethyl stilbestrol, and vanadate) were found <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> the growth medium of L. peruvianum cell cultures and to induce wound response genes in whole tomato plants. Conversely, an activator of the H+-ATPase (fusicoccin) acidified the growth medium of L. peruvianum cell cultures and suppressed systemin-induced medium alkalinization. Likewise, in fusicoccin-treated tomato plants, the wound- and systemin-triggered accumulation of wound-responsive mRNAs {{was found to be}} suppressed. However, fusicoccin treatment of tomato plants led to the accumulation of salicylic acid and the expression of pathogenesis-related genes. Apparently, the wound and pathogen defense signaling pathways are differentially regulated by changes in the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. In addition, alkalinization of the L. peruvianum cell culture medium was found to depend on the influx of Ca 2 + and the activity of a protein kinase. Reversible protein phosphorylation was also shown {{to be involved in the}} induction of wound response genes.

In the present study, acridine orange and fluorescein isothiocyanate coupled to dextran (FITC-dextran) {{have been used to}} examine the effect of cell swelling on pH in acidic compartments of cultured astroglial cells. Both NH 4 Cl (2 mM) and chloroquine (10 μM), known <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> acidic cellular compartments, led to the expected increase in acridine orange fluorescence intensity. Similar, albeit smaller, effects were elicited by a reduction of extracellular osmolarity (− 80 mOsm) and treatment of the cells with glutamate (1 mM), manoeuvres which enhanced cell volume. Determination of changes in the FITC-dextran fluorescence ratio (485440 nm) allowed quantification of the pH changes in lysosomal compartments. Treatment with NH 4 Cl, reduced extracellular osmolarity and glutamate increased lysosomal pH by 0. 65 ± 0. 07, 0. 85 ± 0. 14 and 0. 25 ± 0. 07, respectively. Measurement of cytosolic pH using 2 ′, 7 ′-bis-(2 -carboxyethyl) - 5 - (and - 6) carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) demonstrated a pronounced acidification following cell swelling, observed with both reduced extracellular osmolarity (by 0. 23 ± 0. 05 pH units) and 1 mM glutamate (by 0. 26 ± 0. 02 pH units). In conclusion, pH within lysosomes and possibly other acidic cellular compartments of astrocytes is increased by cell swelling, which may have important consequences for astrocyte function...|$|E
40|$|Objectives — To compare abomasal {{emptying}} {{rates in}} calves after suckling milk replacer or 3 common orally administered electrolyte solution components. Animals — 5 male calves &# 60; 35 days of age. Procedures — Calves with a cannula fitted in the abomasal body were fed 2 L of milk replacer {{with or without}} parenteral administration of atropine (0. 01 mg&# 47;kg, IV, then 0. 02 mg&# 47; kg, SC, q 30 min) or isotonic (150 mM) solutions of sodium acetate, NaHCO 3, or NaCl in a randomized crossover design. Abomasal emptying rates were determined via scintigraphy, acetaminophen absorption, ultrasonography, and change in abomasal luminal pH. Results — Scintigraphic half-emptying time, time of maximal plasma acetaminophen concentration, ultrasonographic half-emptying time, and pH return time indicated similar abomasal emptying rates following suckling of isotonic sodium acetate, NaHCO 3, and NaCl solutions, whereas the emptying rate of milk replacer was significantly slower. Mean maximal abomasal luminal pH was highest following suckling of NaHCO 3 (pHmax = 7. 85) and lowest following suckling of NaCl (pHmax = 4. 52); sodium acetate (pHmax = 6. 59) and milk replacer (pHmax = 5. 84) yielded intermediate pH values.

40|$|Transmembrane {{electrical}} potential differences (Δψ) of epidermal and cortical cells were measured in intact roots of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Klondike). The effects of exogenous NO 3 − on Δψ (in the concentration range from 100 micromolar to 20 millimolar) were investigated {{to probe the}} mechanisms of nitrate uptake by the high-affinity (HATS) and low-affinity (LATS) transport systems for NO 3 − uptake. Both transport systems caused depolarization of Δψ, demonstrating that the LATS (like the HATS) for NO 3 − uptake is probably mediated by an electrogenic cation (H+?) cotransport system. Membrane depolarization by the HATS was “inducible” by NO 3 −, and saturable with respect to exogenous [NO 3 −]. By contrast, depolarization by the LATS was constitutive, and first-order in response to external [NO 3 −]. H+ fluxes, measured in 200 micromolar and in 5 millimolar Ca(NO 3) 2 solutions, failed <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> external media as anticipated for a 2 H+: 1 NO 3 − symport. However, switching from K 2 SO 4 solutions (which were strongly acidifying) to KNO 3 solutions at the same K+ concentration caused marked reductions in H+ efflux. These observations are consistent with NO 3 − uptake by the HATS and the LATS via 2 H+: 1 NO 3 − symports. These observations establish that the HATS for nitrate uptake by barley roots is essentially similar to those reported for Lemna and Zea mays by earlier workers.

Human THP 1 and mouse J 774 macrophages were infected in vitro with P. marneffei conidia and treated with different doses of drugs for 24 to 48 h followed by cell lysis and the counting of P. marneffei CFU. CQ and amodiaquine exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth, whereas quinine and artemisinin were fungistatic and not fungicidal. The antifungal activity of CQ was {{not due to}} an impairment of fungal iron acquisition {{in that it was}} not reversed by the addition of iron nitrilotriacetate, FeCl 3, or iron ammonium citrate. Perl's staining indicated that CQ did not alter the ability of J 774 cells to acquire iron from the medium. Most likely, CQ's antifungal activity is due to an increase in the intravacuolar pH and a disruption of pH-dependent metabolic processes. Indeed, we demonstrate that (i) bafilomycin A 1 and ammonium chloride, two agents known <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> intracellular vesicles by different mechanisms, were inhibitory as well and (ii) a newly synthesized 4 -amino- 7 -chloroquinoline molecule (compound 9), lacking the terminal amino side chain of CQ that assists in drug accumulation, did not inhibit P. marneffei growth. These results suggest that CQ has a potential for use in prophylaxis of P. marneffei infections in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in countries where P. marneffei is endemic...|$|E
30|$|There are two special {{conditions}} requiring the preventive treatment of AKI: (1) {{high doses of}} methotrexate infusion [200]; (2) patients with {{a high risk of}} tumour lysis syndrome. Methotrexate at high doses (1 – 12  g/m 2) is a treatment required for numerous malignant tumours. This drug can induce AKI (up to 40  % of patients in a recent study), which is due to direct tubular toxicity and intratubular precipitation [201]. Intravenous hydration (≥ 2  l/m 2) and urine alkalinization are both recommended strategies for preventing AKI. Several historical observational and interventional studies highlighted that these strategies were associated with an increased methotrexate clearance and decreased episodes of severe toxicity [202 – 205]. Urine alkalinization decreases methotrexate crystallization [202]. Thus, it is recommended <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> the urine of patients who must receive high doses of methotrexate (1 – 12  g/m 2) in order to prevent AKI. About one-third of patients with a high risk of tumour lysis syndrome develop AKI [206, 207]. In this clinical condition, hyperuricaemia is one of the factors which contribute to AKI by different mechanisms [208]. In two randomized controlled studies and 2 recent meta-analyses, rasburicase administration was associated with a more rapid and profound decrease in uricaemia as compared with allopurinol [209 – 211]. However, there is no proof that rasburicase is associated with reduced AKI incidence [212]. Hyperuricaemia {{is only one of the}} numerous mechanisms implicated in renal injury during tumour lysis syndrome (phosphate and calcium crystals, hypovolaemia, renal tumour infiltration, nephrotoxic exposure, inflammation). In patients with a high risk of tumour lysis syndrome, rasburicase administration is proposed by four recent expert recommendations [198, 213 – 215].|$|E
40|$|Candida glabrata {{currently}} {{ranks as}} the second most frequent cause of invasive candidiasis. Our previous work has shown that C. glabrata is adapted to intracellular survival in macrophages and replicates within non-acidified late endosomal-stage phagosomes. In contrast, heat killed yeasts are found in acidified matured phagosomes. In the present study, we aimed at elucidating the processes leading to inhibition of phagosome acidification and maturation. We show that phagosomes containing viable C. glabrata cells do not fuse with pre-labeled lysosomes and possess low phagosomal hydrolase activity. Inhibition of acidification occurs independent of macrophage type (human/murine), differentiation (M 1 -/M 2 -type) or activation status (vitamin D 3 stimulation). We observed no differential activation of macrophage MAPK or NFκB signaling cascades downstream of pattern recognition receptors after internalization of viable compared to heat killed yeasts, but Syk activation decayed faster in macrophages containing viable yeasts. Thus, delivery of viable yeasts to non-matured phagosomes is likely not triggered by initial recognition events via MAPK or NFκB signaling, but Syk activation may be involved. Although V-ATPase is abundant in C. glabrata phagosomes, the influence of this proton pump on intracellular survival is low since blocking V-ATPase activity with bafilomycin A 1 has no influence on fungal viability. Active pH modulation is one possible fungal strategy to change phagosome pH. In fact, C. glabrata is able <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> its extracellular environment, when growing on amino acids as the sole carbon source in vitro. By screening a C. glabrata mutant library we identified genes important for environmental alkalinization that were further tested for their impact on phagosome pH. We found {{that the lack of}} fungal mannosyltransferases resulted in severely reduced alkalinization in vitro and in the delivery of C. glabrata to acidified phagosomes. Therefore, protein mannosylation may {{play a key role in}} alterations of phagosomal properties caused by C. glabrata...|$|E
40|$|The {{polarized}} {{distribution of}} HCO 3 − transport {{was investigated in}} human nasal epithelial cells from normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) tissues. To test for HCO 3 − transport via conductive versus electroneutral Cl−/HCO 3 − exchange (anion exchange, AE) pathways, nasal cells were loaded with the pH probe 2 ′, 7 ′-bis(carboxyethyl) - 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein and mounted in a bilateral perfusion chamber. In normal, but not CF, epithelia, replacing mucosal Cl− with gluconate caused intracellular pH (pHi) to increase, and the initial rates (ΔpH min− 1) of this increase were modestly augmented (∼ 26 %) when normal cells were pretreated with forskolin (10 μm). Recovery from this alkaline shift was dependent on mucosal Cl−, was insensitive to the AE inhibitor 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanatodihydrostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid (H 2 DIDS; 1. 5 mm), but was sensitive to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel inhibitor diphenylamine- 2 -carboxylate (DPC; 100 μm). In contrast, removal of serosal Cl− caused pHi <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> in both normal and CF epithelia. Recovery from this alkaline challenge was dependent on serosal Cl− and blocked by H 2 DIDS. Additional studies showed that serosally applied Ba 2 + (5. 0 mm) in normal, but not CF, cells induced influx of HCO 3 − across the apical membrane that was reversibly blocked by mucosal DPC. In a final series of studies, normal and CF cells acutely alkaline loaded by replacing bilateral Krebs bicarbonate Ringer (KBR) with Hepes-buffered Ringer solution exhibited basolateral, but not apical, recovery from an alkaline challenge that was dependent on Cl−, independent of Na+ and blocked by H 2 DIDS. We conclude that: (1) normal, but not CF, nasal epithelia have a constitutively active DPC-sensitive HCO 3 − influx/efflux pathway across the apical membrane of cells, consistent with the movement of HCO 3 − via CFTR; and (2) both normal and CF nasal epithelia have Na+-independent, H 2 DIDS-sensitive AE at their basolateral domain...|$|E
40|$|A {{collection}} of eight strains, NF 1366 (T), NF 450, NF 1101, NF 1107, NF 1123, NF 1413, CCUG 15260 and CCUG 15624, from various clinical origins, were characterized biochemically as similar to Kaistella koreensis and Chryseobacterium haifense. They differed from K koreensis, which is unable <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> acetate, and from C. haifense, which is ONPG-positive (beta-galactosidase) and acidifies sucrose, fructose and lactose. Based on 16 S rRNA gene sequence comparisons, this {{collection of}} strains was most {{closely related to the}} type strains of K. koreensis (97. 3 - 97. 5 %) and C. haifense (99. 1 %). Representative strain NF 1366 (T) showed only 41. 8 % DNA-DNA relatedness with K. koreensis DSM 12107 (T) and only 51. 9 % with C. haifense DSM 19056 (T). DNA-DNA hybridization of strains NF 450 and CCUG 15624 to strain NF 1366 (T) was 41. 7 and 74. 6 %, respectively, and relatedness of these strains with C. haifense DSM 19056 (T) was 72. 6 and 70. 2 %. With the present information, these two strains must be classified as intermediate between C. haifense and strain NF 1366 (T). The fatty acid composition and polar lipid profile of strain NF 1366 (T) were similar to those reported for other Chryseobacterium species. Like other chryseobacteria, strain NF 1366 (T) exhibited a polyamine pattern with the predominant compound sym-homospermidine and a quinone system consisting of menaquinone MK- 6 only. For {{this collection of}} clinical strains, the name Chryseobacterium anthropi sp. nov. is proposed, with NF 1366 (T) (=CCUG 52764 (T) =CIP 109762 (T)) as the type strain. K. koreensis was shown to be very similar genotypically and phenotypically to Chryseobacterium. Its polar lipid profile exhibited the major characteristics shown for recently described Chryseobacterium species and the fatty acid profile of K koreensis was also very {{similar to those of the}} Chryseobacterium species. Hence, no striking genotypic or phenotypic differences could be found that could justify the classification of this species into a separate genus, and we therefore propose to reclassify Kaistella koreensis in the genus Chryseobacterium as Chryseobacterium koreense comb. nov. (type strain Chj 707 (T) =IAM 15050 (T) =JCM 21512 (T) =KCTC 12107 (T) =NBRC 103027 (T)). An emended description of the genus Chryseobacterium is also proposed...|$|E
40|$|We {{monitored}} intracellular pH (pHi) {{in isolated}} perfused S 3 {{segments of the}} rabbit proximal tubule, and studied the effect of acetate (Ac-) transport on pHi. pHi was calculated from the absorbance spectrum of 4 ', 5 '-dimethyl- 5 -(and 6) carboxyfluorescein trapped intracellularly. All solutions were nominally HCO 3 (-) -free. Removal of 10 mM Ac- from bath and lumen caused pHi to rapidly rise by approximately 0. 2, and then to decline more slowly to a value approximately 0. 35 below the initial one. Removal of only luminal Ac- caused pHi changes {{very similar to those}} resulting from bilateral removal of Ac-. When Ac- was removed from bath only, pHi rose rapidly at first, and then continued to rise more slowly. Readdition of Ac- to bath caused pHi to rapidly fall to a value slightly higher than the one prevailing before the removal of Ac- from the bath. In experiments in which Ac- was first removed from both bath and lumen, readdition of 10 mM Ac- to only lumen caused a rapid but small acidification, followed by a slower alkalinization that brought the pHi near the value that prevailed before the bilateral removal of Ac-. The alkalinizing effects caused by the readdition of 10 or 0. 5 mM Ac- were indistinguishable. When Ac- was returned to only lumen in the absence of luminal Na+, there was a small and rapid pHi decrease, but no pHi recovery. Removal of Na+ from bath did not affect the pHi transients caused by the addition of Ac- to lumen. In experiments in which Ac- was first removed bilaterally, readdition of Ac- to only bath caused a large and sustained drop in pHi, whereas the subsequent removal of Ac- from the bath caused a slight alkalinization. These pHi changes caused by readdition or removal of Ac- from baths were unaffected by the absence of external Na+. We conclude that there is a Na+/Ac- cotransporter at the luminal membrane, and pathways for acetic acid transport at both luminal and basolateral membranes. The net effect of Ac- transport on pHi is <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> the cell {{as a result of the}} luminal entry of Na+/Ac-, which is followed by the luminal and basolateral exit of acetic acid...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the interactions between intracellular pH (pHi) and the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) in isolated rat pancreatic acinar cells. The fluorescent dyes fura- 2 and BCECF were used to measure [Ca 2 +]i and pHi, respectively. Sodium acetate and ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) were used to acidify and alkalinize pHi, respectively. Cytosolic acidification {{had no effect on}} [Ca 2 +]i in resting pancreatic acinar cells, whereas cytosolic alkalinization released Ca 2 + from intracellular stores. Cytosolic acidification using either acetate or a CO 2 -HCO 3 −-buffered medium enhanced Ca 2 + signals evoked by acetylcholine (ACh) and cholecystokinin (CCK). In contrast, both NH 4 Cl and trimethylamine (TMA) inhibited Ca 2 + signals during stimulation with either ACh or CCK. This inhibitory effect was also observed in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, and was therefore not due to changes in Ca 2 + entry. Calcium oscillations evoked by physiological concentrations of CCK were enhanced by cytosolic acidification and inhibited by cytosolic alkalinization. In order {{to determine the effects of}} pHi upon Ca 2 + handling by intracellular Ca 2 + stores, intraorganellar [Ca 2 +] was monitored using the low affinity Ca 2 + indicator mag-fura- 2 in permeabilized cells. Addition of NH 4 Cl, which is expected <b>to</b> <b>alkalinize</b> intraorganellar pH, did not alter intraorganellar [Ca 2 +] in permeabilized cells, suggesting that changing intraorganellar pH does not release Ca 2 + from intracellular stores. Addition of NH 4 Cl or acetate also did not affect the rate of Ca 2 + release induced by inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3). Modification of extraorganellar (‘cytosolic’) pH did not affect the rate of ATP-dependent Ca 2 + uptake into stores, but did modify the rate of Ca 2 + release evoked by submaximal concentrations of InsP 3. The rate of Ca 2 + release was increased at more alkaline extraorganellar pHs. These results would suggest that manipulation of intraorganellar pH does not affect Ca 2 + handling by the intracellular stores. In contrast, extraorganellar (‘cytosolic’) pH does affect InsP 3 -induced Ca 2 + release from the stores. In conclusion, changes in intracellular pH in pancreatic acinar cells can profoundly alter cytosolic [Ca 2 +]. This may shed light on earlier observations whereby cell-permeant weak acids and bases can modulate fluid secretion in epithelia...|$|E
