25|$|I see and {{understand}} both the symbolic {{as well as}} the substantive elements of my life. Sometimes I visualise it as a journey of an individual from a remote village on the sidelines of society to the hub of social standing. But at the same time I also realise <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> encapsulates the ability of the democratic system to accommodate and empower marginalised sections of society.|$|E

This you will permit me to do now, without any reserve, in the fear and in the presence of God.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's {{vision of}} {{a society in which}} class, money and {{personal}} ambition are the key players has been endorsed by critics of both left-wing and right-wing political persuasions. Marxist Friedrich Engels wrote: [...] "I have learned more [...] than from all the professional historians, economists and statisticians put together". Balzac has received high praise from critics as diverse as Walter Benjamin and Camille Paglia. He was also praised by James Baldwin, who said 1984: [...] "I’m sure <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> in France would have been very different had I not met Balzac. [...] the way that country and its society works." [...] In 1970 Roland Barthes published S/Z, a detailed analysis of Balzac's story Sarrasine and a key work in structuralist literary criticism.|$|E

500|$|... “I didn't {{write my}} raps down {{for my first}} four albums — like at all, I did it from the head {{straight}} to the booth. But on this last album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I wrote it. I really put myself in the zone <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> was dependent {{on the success of}} this album. With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter what anybody says about me, they won’t — I can write something that can make someone that hates me the most have to really respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night. Hall, who was having personal worship time during the drive, recounts that he wondered [...] "Who am I to think I can just call up to God whenever I want, from the middle of nowhere, and expect Him to hear me?" [...] Hall says [...] "immediately I started thinking I'm a new creation, I'm more than a conqueror... I'm [...] grass, that is rises up and is gone in a day". In an interview, he commented that [...] "me being a conqueror is true, {{but at the same time}} I need to understand <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> is a vapor, and me being able to even pray to [...] is because of what he's done for me". [...] "Who Am I" [...] was produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman. It was recorded at Glow In The Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, and it was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E
500|$|Both the King and Queen were fond {{of their}} niece, Princess Victoria of Kent. Their {{attempts}} {{to forge a}} close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the Duchess of Kent, the young princess' widowed mother. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Princess Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent. He said, [...] "I trust to God <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> may be spared for nine months longer... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not {{in the hands of a}} person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed." [...] The speech was so shocking that Victoria burst into tears, while her mother sat in silence and was only with difficulty persuaded not to leave immediately after dinner (the two left the next day). William's outburst undoubtedly contributed to Victoria's tempered view of him as [...] "a good old man, though eccentric and singular". William survived, though mortally ill, to the month after Victoria's coming of age. [...] "Poor old man!", Victoria wrote as he was dying, [...] "I feel sorry for him; he was always personally kind to me." ...|$|E

500|$|Lohan's next {{appearance}} was in Chapter 27 as a John Lennon fan who befriends Mark David Chapman, played by Jared Leto, {{on the day}} he murders Lennon. Filming finished in early 2006, but the film was not released until March 2008 due to difficulties in finding a distributor. In May 2007, the drama Georgia Rule was released. In the film, Lohan portrays an out-of-control teenager whose mother (Felicity Huffman) brings her to the house of her own estranged mother (Jane Fonda). Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Lohan hits a true note of spiteful princess narcissism." [...] During filming in 2006, Lohan was hospitalized, her representative saying [...] "she was overheated and dehydrated." [...] At the time Lohan was going through a breakup with Hard Rock Cafe heir Harry Morton, which contributed to her problems on the set, according to Allure. In a letter that was made public, studio executive James G. Robinson called Lohan [...] "irresponsible and unprofessional." [...] He mentioned [...] "various late arrivals and absences from the set" [...] and said that [...] "we are well aware that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called 'exhaustion.'" [...] In 2007, Lohan was cast in the film Poor Things. But in May of that year, she was arrested on a charge of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} (DUI.) The film's producers initially voiced support, and production was put on hold, as Lohan entered the Promises Treatment Center rehabilitation facility where she stayed for 45 days. She ultimately lost the Poor Things part. In July, less than two weeks out of rehab, Lohan was arrested a second time on charges of possession of cocaine, driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license. In August, Lohan pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine use and driving under the influence and was sentenced to an alcohol education program, community service, one day in jail, and was given three years probation. Lohan released a statement in which she said [...] "it is clear to me <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> has become completely unmanageable because I am addicted to alcohol and drugs." [...] The same month she entered the Cirque Lodge Treatment Center in Sundance, Utah for a third stint at rehabilitation, staying for three months until her discharge in October. In November Lohan served 84 minutes in jail. A sheriff spokesman cited overcrowding and the nonviolent nature of the crime as reasons for the reduced sentence.|$|E

2500|$|An {{eyewitness}} to the shooting, Feidin Santana, recorded {{video of}} the incident on his phone. At first Santana did not share the video {{out of fear of}} retribution, but he became angered when the police report differed from his view of the events. In an interview on MSNBC, Santana said, [...] "I felt <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> with this information, might be in danger. I thought about erasing the video and just getting out of the community, you know Charleston, and living some place else." [...] The video was subsequently shared with Scott's family through an activist of Black Lives Matter, and later with the news media.|$|E

Since then, I have often shared with appropriate groups the full story of my recovery to responsible adulthood as a professional, political and civic leader, husband and father.

2500|$|In July 1868 the Ottoman {{government}} further banished Bahá'u'lláh and {{his family}} to the prison-city of Acre, then part of the Syrian segment of the Ottoman Empire. As a young woman of twenty-one, Bahíyyih Khánum entered into Acre as a prisoner. This was her fourth place of exile, and her last. Despite her beauty and suitors — she was still determined to remain unmarried, and her father seemed to have advocated this. She was later respected for her choice. When arrived on the bay of Acre, the exiles were disorientated and demoralized. The populace spoke Arabic, which Bahíyyih Khánum understood, and she overheard them mocking and jeering how the family were to be thrown into the sea or imprisoned in chains. She later explained the impact this had on her: [...] "imagine, if you can, the overpowering impression made by all this upon {{the mind of a}} young girl, such as I was then. Can you wonder that I am serious, and <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> is different from those of my countrywomen?".|$|E
