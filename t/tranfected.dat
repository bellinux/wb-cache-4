40|$|It is {{currently}} {{thought that the}} dementia of Alzheimer’s disease {{is due to the}} neurotoxicity of the deposits or aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ). Drug discovery has employed mice <b>tranfected</b> with mutant genes responsible for early onset Alzheimer’s disease. Yet, nine trials of drugs that were effective in transgenic mice were ineffective in patients. Further, a major unresolved issue is that Aβ is produced in everyone but deposits are only seen in the elderly. Our published studies indicate that in CSF Aβ is only present as a complex with two chaperones, ERp 57 and calreticulin and is N-glycosylated thereby keeping Aβ in solution. This complex formation is catalyzed by the posttranslational protein processing system of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These findings suggest that both plaque and dementia are secondary to an age related decline in the capacity of the ER to catalyze the processing of the synaptic membrane proteins necessary for memory. In support of this paradigm components of this ER pathway decline with age. Our observations also suggest that declining ER function has a role in a loss of mitochondrial function and a decrease in myelin.

This {{study was}} to explore the association between the SIRT 1 expression and the clinical characteristics, the responsiveness to chemotherapy and prognosis in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: We enrolled 295 patients with inoperable advanced stage of NSCLC, namely, stage III (A+B) and IV NSCLC. All patients had received platinum-based chemotherapy after diagnosis and the chemotherapy response were evaluated. All patients were followed up for overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). In vitro, H 292 cells were <b>tranfected</b> with SIRT 1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). The cell biological behaviors and chemosensitivity to cisplatin treatment were studied. The in vivo tumorgenesis and metastasis assays were performed in nude mice.

Patients with high SIRT 1 expressions had a significantly higher chance to be resistant to chemotherapy than those with low SIRT 1 expression. Patients with high expression of SIRT 1 had significantly shorter OS and DFS than those with low expression.

The enzyme activity is found not only in peroxisomes but also is present in mitochondria of human liver and fibroblasts. The C terminus of the human racemase, a protein of 382 amino acids with a molecular mass of 43, 304 daltons as deduced from its cloned cDNA, consists of KASL. Hitherto this sequence has not been recognized as a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS 1).

To be recognized by Pex 5 p, however, the preceding lysine residue is critical.

40|$|Summary p 53 is {{activated}} {{in response to}} DNA damage and functions in the maintenance of genetic integrity. Loss of p 53 function because of mutation of the p 53 gene is associated with over half all human cancers. Certain human p 53 mutants are conformationally flexible in vitro and are temperature sensitive, with partial or complete recovery of wild-type (wt) properties at 320 C. We have now tested the functional capacities of selected p 53 mutants in vivo, by transfection into established human cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found that wt p 53 can be temperature sensitive for transactivation of a co-transfected target gene in vivo. Flexible mutants retained varying degrees of functional capacity in <b>tranfected</b> cells, and the recipient cell line {{appeared to be a}} significant determinant of both wt and mutant p 53 function; importantly, two p 53 null cell lines commonly used to study p 53 function (Saos- 2 and Hep 3 B) differed markedly in this latter respect. We also show that the p 53 mutant V 272 M, which exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding in vitro, is nonetheless defective for transactivation and is unable to induce apoptosis in vivo. The valine 272 residue may thus be crucial for properties (other than sequence-specific DNA binding) that are important for p 53 function(s) in vivo...|$|E

The interactions between epithelium and mesenchyme are believed to be mediated by paracrine signals such as cytokines and extracellular matrix components secreted from fibroblasts that affect adjacent epithelia. In this study, we sought to identify the repertoire of microRNAs (miRNAs) in normal lung human fibroblasts and their potential regulation by the cytokines TNF-a, IL- 1 b and TGF-b. Methodology/Principal Findings: MiR- 155 was significantly induced by inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL- 1 b while it was down-regulated by TGF-b. Ectopic expression of miR- 155 in human fibroblasts induced modulation of a large set of genes related to ‘‘cell to cell signalling’’, ‘‘cell morphology’ ’ and ‘‘cellular movement’’.

40|$|The {{phospholipase}} A 2 receptor (PLA 2 R) {{was recently}} discovered {{as a target}} autoantigen in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN). Published {{evidence suggests that the}} autoantibodies directed towards a conformation dependent epitope are currently effectively detected by a cell based assay (CBA) utilizing indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on tissue culture cells transfected with the PLA 2 R cDNA. Limitations of such IIF-CBA assays include observer dependent subjective evaluation of semi-quantitative test results and the protocols are not amenable to high throughput diagnostic testing. We developed a quantitative, observer independent, high throughput capture immunoassay for detecting PLA 2 R autoantibodies on an addressable laser bead immunoassay (ALBIA) platform. Since reactive domains of PLA 2 R (i. e. epitopes) could be used to improve diagnostic tests by using small peptides in various high throughput diagnostic platforms, we identified PLA 2 R epitopes that bound autoantibodies of IMN patients. These studies confirmed that inter-molecular epitope spreading occurs in IMN but use of the cognate synthetic peptides in immunoassays was unable to conclusively distinguish between IMN patients and normal controls. However, combinations of these peptides were able to effectively absorb anti-PLA 2 R reactivity in IIF-CBA and an immunoassay that employed a lysate derived from HEK cells <b>tranfected</b> with and overexpressing PLA 2 R.

Despite major advances {{in our understanding of}} this important functional response of neutrophils, the short lifespan of these cells and their resistance to transfection have always been an obstacle to the detailed dissection of signaling pathways and effector responses that is often possible in other cell types. Results Here, we report that granulocytic differentiation of human PLB- 985 cells with DMSO yields cells that are neutrophil-like with respect to surface markers, acquisition of responsiveness to physiological neutrophil stimuli (fMLP, LPS), cytokine expression and production profile, and transcription factor activation profile (NF-κB, C/EBP, AP- 1, STAT). We also show that granulocytic PLB- 985 cells can be reliably <b>tranfected</b> by nucleofection in a rapid and efficient manner. Indeed, we overexpressed several proteins and luciferase constructs into these cells. In particular, overexpression of a dominant negative IκB-α confirmed the central role of NF-κB in the production of cytokines by granulocytes. Moreover, the use of PLB- 985 granulocytes in which the NADPH oxidase is inactive due to the targeted disruption of a key component (gp 91 phox) revealed that NF-κB activation and κB-dependent responses are independent of endogenous reactive oxygen intermediates in these cells. Antioxidant studies performed in primary human neutrophils support this conclusion.

Cells transfected with insulin alone exhibited moderate increases in cell surface VCAM- 1 expression, whereas cells stimulated with TNFα alone or in combination with insulin, exhibited a significant (P, 0. 05) increase in VCAM- 1 surface expression. Cells transfected with shJNK alone showed increased VCAM- 1 expression at the cell surface as compared to mock-transfected positive controls. In contrast, cells transfected with shp 38 exhibited significant decreased insulin-stimulated VCAM- 1 expression at the cell surface, but only moderate decreased VCAM- 1 expression in cells stimulated by TNFα alone in combination with insulin. Interestingly, in cells first <b>tranfected</b> with shJNK and then shp 38, VCAM- 1 expression appeared to increase in an additive fashion. In contrast, cells transfected with shp 38 first then shJNK, VCAM- 1 expression exhibited increased VCAM- 1 expression even {{in the presence of}} shp 38. One can conclude that JNK is a potent negative regulator of insulin- and TNFα-stimulated cell surface expression of VCAM- 1, whereas p 38 is mild positive regulator of insulin-, but not TNFα-stimulated VCAM- 1 expression. JNK appears to be a more potent mediator of insulin- and TNFα-stimulated cells surface VCAM- 1 expression than p 38 MAP Kinase.

40|$|The {{neurodegenerative}} disease {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) results from the progressive loss of motoneurons, leading {{to death in a}} few years. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which decreases naturally occurring and axotomy-induced cell death, may result in slowing of motoneuron loss and has been evaluated as a treatment for ALS. Effective administration of this protein to motoneurons may be hampered by the exceedingly short half-life of CNTF, and the inability to deliver effective concentration into the central nervous system after systemic administration in vivo. The constitutive release of CNTF from genetically engineered cells may represent a solution to this delivery problem. In this work, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells stably <b>tranfected</b> with a chimeric plasmid construct containing the gene for human or mouse CNTF were encapsulated in polymer fibers, which prevents immune rejection and allow long-term survival of the transplanted cells. In vitro bioassays show that the encapsulated transfected cells release bioactive CNTF. In vivo, systemic delivery of human and mouse CNTF from encapsulated cells was observed to rescue 26 and 27 % more facial motoneurons, respectively, as compared to capsules containing parent BHK cells 1 wk postaxotomy in neonatal rats. With local application of CNTF on the nerve stump and by systemic delivery through repeated subcutaneous injections, 15 and 13 % more rescue effects were observed.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of Washington, 1998 Phosphorylation of the {{skeletal}} muscle α 1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel {{has been proposed}} to regulate the calcium current, allowing increased calcium flux during tetanus and during β-adrenergic activation. This stimulation {{has been shown to}} increase skeletal muscle contraction and calcium channel activity through cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of serine and threonine amino acid residues. The molecular mechanism of this phosphorylation has been studied by altering the serine and threonine residues to alanine to prevent phosphate transfer. These mutants have been analysed biochemically and physiologically for changes in calcium channel regulation. Oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis was used to alter serine and threonine amino acid residues to alanine in consensus sequences for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This prevented the incorporation of phosphate into this molecule. These wild type and mutant cDNAs were transiently <b>tranfected</b> into a heterologous expression system with the rat brain L-type calcium channel β 1 b subunit and the rabbit skeletal muscle L-type calcium channel α 2 /δ subunit in human embryonic kidney cells expressing the large T antigen. This system allowed analysis of protein expression, protein phosphorylation and electrophysiology. The calcium channels expressed dihydropyridine binding sites with K d at 136 - 215 pM and βmax at 141 to 718 fmol/mg protein. The wild type protein had a molecular mass of 212 kDa and the truncated mutant protein had a molecular mass of 190 kDa in western blot analysis. The wild type protein had normal in vivo and in vitro cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. A mutant protein containing 17 amino acid changes was not phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vivo or in vitro. The functional properties of wild-type and mutant channels and their regulation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase were studied by analysis of tail currents with barium as the permeant ion. These measurements showed no change in the wild type or mutant channel in the absence or presence of the activating agent, dcl-cBIMPS. This shows that the α 1 subunit of the rabbit skeletal muscle calcium channel is not the target of phosphorylation for the phenomena of increased calcium channel activity due to β-adrenergic stimulation...|$|E
40|$|CB 1 {{cannabinoid}} receptor activation is frequently associated with acute alterations of neurotransmitter release {{as well as}} more profound modifications of gene expression through regulation of complex intracellular signalling pathways. In addition to the well described Gi/o-mediated reduction of cAMP accumulation, cannabinoids have been shown to activate different MAPK family members, to regulate Ca 2 + and K+ currents. Putative coupling with Gs and Gq type G-proteins has also been suggested. We recently reported a CB 1 -mediated regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase expression in N 1 E- 115 neuroblastoma. Noteworthy, different classes of full CB 1 agonists were shown to induce opposite effects 1, raising the question of the activation of distinct cell signallings by unrelated CB 1 ligands. In order to investigate the CB 1 -mediated signalling pathways involved in the regulation of gene transcription, we performed luciferase reporter gene assay in N 1 E- 115 neuroblastoma. Cells were transiently <b>tranfected</b> with luciferase reporter plasmids containing repeats of either CRE or AP 1 cis-enhancer elements, both involved in the control of tyrosine hydroxylase expression 2, 3, 4. In this system, the properties of HU 210 and CP 55, 940, two synthetic analogues of  9 -THC, the major psychoactive component of the plant Cannabis sativa were evaluated. Consistent with their full agonist properties, both ligands strongly decreased cAMP accumulation and consecutively reduced CRE-driven luciferase expression (pEC 50 HU 210 : 7. 8  0. 2 and CP 55, 940 : 8. 3  0. 4). In contrast, in cells engineered to examine the AP 1 -controlled luciferase activity, HU 210 exhibited a dose-dependent reduction of luciferase activity (pEC 50 : 7, 5  0, 2) whereas no significant response was obtained with CP 55, 940. In the presence of SR 141716 A, a CB 1 selective antagonist, both responses were prevented, confirming the involvement of the CB 1 receptor. Different kinase inhibitors were used to discriminate between the signalling pathways involved in the paradoxical results obtained using the AP 1 construct. The use of PKC inhibitors was effective in blocking HU 210 -mediated decreased transcription in cells expressing the AP 1 construct, suggesting an agonist selective regulation of PKC-depending responses. In addition, these responses were sensitive to pertussis toxin, thus suggesting that they are Gi/o-mediated. Taken together, our results demonstrate that different agonists acting at CB 1 receptor may induce differential effects regarding AP 1 cis-enhancer element activity. This could be due to their ability to selectively regulate distinct intracellular signalling pathways, supporting the concept of functional selectivity...|$|E
40|$|In {{affinity}} protein biotechnology {{the selective}} bindingbetween a chosen protein and an interacting biomolecule isutilized {{for a variety}} of applications including bioseparation,detection and therapy. Traditionally, affinity proteinsrecruited for such applications have been derived from naturalproteins or immunoglobulins generated via immunization routes. More recently, advances in the construction and handling oflarge collections of proteins(denoted libraries) generated invitro have opened up for new routes for the development ofaffinity proteins with desired properties. In this study, phage display selection technology was usedfor the isolation of novel human CD 28 (hCD 28) -specific affinityproteins from a protein library constructed by combinatorialprotein engineering of a 58 aa protein domain (Z) derived fromstaphylococcal protein A (SPA). From selections using hCD 28 asa target molecule, several hCD 28 -specific affinity proteins(denoted affibodies) could be identified and analysis of theisolated affibody variants revealed a high degree of sequencehomology between the different clones. The biosensor analysisshowed that all variants bound to hCD 28 with micromolardissociation constants (KD) and no significant cross-reactivitytowards the structurally related T-cell receptor hCTLA- 4 couldbe observed. The apparent binding affinity for hCD 28 of one ofthe isolated affibodies was further improved through fusion toa human Fc fragment fusion partner, resulting in a homodimericversion of the affibody ligand showing avidity effects uponhCD 28 binding. Further, a co-culture experiment involvingJurkat T-cells and CHO cell lines <b>tranfected</b> to express eitherhuman CD 80 or LFA- 3 on the cell surface showed that apreincubation of Jurkat cells with one of the affibody variantsresulted in a specific concentration-dependent inhibition ofthe CD 80 induced IL- 2 production. This indicates that thisaffibody binds to hCD 28 and specifically interferes with theco-stimulation signal mediated via hCD 28 and hCD 80. ACD 28 -specific binding protein could have potential as an agentfor various immunotherapy applications. In a second study, anaffinity protein-based strategy was investigated forsite-specific anchoring of proteins onto cellulose for woodfiber engineering purposes. Here, affinity proteins derivedfrom different sources were used for the assembly of acellulosome-like complex for specific and reversible anchoringof affinity domain-tagged reporter proteins to acellulose-anchored fusion protein. A fusion protein between acellulose binding module (Cel 6 A CBM 1) derived from the fungalTrichoderma reesei and a five-domain staphylococcal protein A(SPA) moiety was constructed to serve as a platform for thedocking of reporter proteins produced as fusion to two copiesof a SPA-binding affibody affinity protein (denoted ZSPA- 1),selected by phage display technology from a Z domain basedprotein library. In a series of experiments, involving repeatedwashing and low pH elutions, affinity tagged Enhanced GreenFluorescent Protein (EGFP) and Fusarium solani pisi lipasecutinase reporter proteins were both found to be specificallydirected from solution to a region of a cellulose-based filterpaper where the SPA-CBM fusion protein previously had beenpositioned. This showed that the cellulose-anchored SPA-Cel 6 ACBM 1 fusion protein had been stably anchored to the surfacewith retained binding activity and that the interaction betweenSPA and the ZSPA- 1 affibody domain was selective. phage display, combinatorial, selection, CD 28, cellulosome,cellulose, affibodyNR 2014080...|$|E

Als zentraler Punkt dieser Dissertation wurden des Weiteren zwei differenzielle Methoden, die Acetylierung und die kombinierte Guanidinylierung/Nikotinylierung, zur massenspektrometrischen Quantifizierung von HLA-Liganden aus zwei unterschiedlichen Quellen entwickelt und getestet. Der Einsatz der Acetylierungsmethode führte in einem Tumor-/Normalgewebspaar eines Kolonkarzinompatienten zur Identifizierung von zwei auf HLA-Ebene überpräsentierten Tumorliganden aus dem ribosomalen Protein L 24 und dem als tumorassoziiert beschriebenen Protein Beta-Catenin. Unter Einsatz der Guanidinylierungs-/Nikotinylierungsmethode konnte in einer Awells-Keratin 18 -Transfektante ein neuer HLA-A* 0201 -Ligand aus dem Tumormarker Keratin 18 identifiziert werden und in Präproinsulin-transfizierten PRIESS-Zellen wurde zum ersten Mal ein MHC-Klasse-I-Ligand aus Präproinsulin charakterisiert. Außerdem wurde die {{relative}} mRNA-Expression eines Tumor-/Normalgewebspaars eines Nierenzellkarzinompatienten mit der relativen HLA-Ligandenpräsentation verglichen, was in weiterführenden Studien für Aussagen über eine Korrelation zwischen mRNA-Expression und HLA-Liganden-Präsentation genutzt werden kann. Des Weiteren wurden mittels massenspektrometrischer Techniken zahlreiche Tumorliganden aus verschiedenen soliden Tumoren, wie Kolonkarzinomen, Magenkarzinomen und Glioblastomen identifiziert. Im Fall von Nierenzellkarzinompatienten wurde eine Impfstudie initiiert, bei der, auf HLA-Ligandenidentifizierung und Genexpressionsdaten basierende, Patienten-spezifische Impf-stoffe eingesetzt wurden. Gezielte Suchen nach krankheitsassoziierten HLA-Liganden wurden mit der „Predict, Calibrate, Detect“-Methode durchgeführt. Dies führte zur Identifizierung eines HLA-Liganden aus dem Malaria-assoziierten MSP 1 -Protein und erstmals zum Nachweis zweier Hepatitis-C-Virus-Epitope auf molekularer Ebene. Das MHC-Motiv des WLA. 1 - 1 vom amerikanischen Waldmurmeltier, einem Hepatitis-B-Virus Modellsystem, wurde für T-Zellepitopstudien bestimmt. Des Weiteren konnten die HLA-Allele A* 2601, A* 24, B* 0702 und B* 4402 anhand von massenspektrometrisch identifizierten natürlichen HLA-Liganden verfeinert werden, so dass jetzt eine optimierte T-Zellepitopvorhersage für diese Allele möglich ist. In {{this thesis}} several mass spectrometric methods were used {{within the scope}} of different projects for the identification of MHC class I ligands. One main objective of this dissertation was the development and validation of two differential approaches, acetylation and a combination of guanidinylation and nicotinylation, for a quantitative analysis of HLA ligands from two different sources by mass spectrometry. The application of the acetylation method to a tumor/normal tissue pair derived from a colon carcinoma patient led to the identification of two HLA ligands overpresented in tumor tissue and derived from the ribosomal protein L 24 and the tumor-associated protein beta-catenin. By applying the guanidinylation/ nicotinylation method on an Awells/Keratin 18 transfectant a new HLA-A* 0201 ligand derived from the tumor marker Keratin 18 was identified. Also, for the first time an MHC class I ligand, which was derived from preproinsulin in <b>tranfected</b> PRIESS cells was characterised. Additionally, the relative mRNA expression of a tumor/normal tissue pair of a renal cell carcinoma patient was compared to the relative HLA ligand presentation, which can be used in further studies for the evaluation of a correlation between mRNA expression and HLA ligand presentation. Furthermore, numerous tumor ligands from different solid tumors, such as colon carcinoma, stomach carcinoma and glioblastoma were identified by mass spectrometric techniques. In the case of renal cell carcinoma a clinical study was initiated in which patient-specific vaccines based on HLA ligand identification and gene expression data were applied. Systematic searches for disease-associated HLA ligands were performed using the predict, calibrate, detect method. These analyses led to the identification of an HLA ligand of the malaria-associated MSP- 1 protein {{and for the first time}} to the characterisation of two hepatitis-C-virus epitopes on a molecular level. The peptide motif of the woodchuck MHC molecule WLA. 1 - 1 as a model system for hepatitis-B-virus infection was determined for T cell epitope studies. In addition, the peptide motifs of the HLA alleles A* 2601, A* 24, B* 0702, and B* 4402 were refined by newly identified natural HLA ligands, enabling an optimized T cell epitope prediction...|$|E
40|$|Transcription {{factors such}} as nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), {{activator}} protein- 1 (AP- 1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) may play important roles in atherogenesis, by regulating chronic subclinical vascular inflammation. In the first study, we showed that VLDL activates the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kB in endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. Oxidation of VLDL reduced its capacity to activate NF-kB in vitro, whereas free fatty acids such as linoleic and oleic acid activated NF-kB {{to the same extent}} as VLDL. Intravenous injection of human VLDL (6 mg protein per kg) into rats resulted in arterial activation of NF-kB as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Aortic endothelial cells showed positive nuclear staining for the activated RelA (p 65) subunit of NF-kB at 6 to 24 hours after injection. There was also a parallel expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1, as well as the cytokine TNF-alpha Pretreatment of the rats with diet containing 1 % of the antioxidant probucol for 8 weeks did not inhibit arterial activation of NF-kB in response to injection of VLDL. Moreover, injection of triglycerides (10 % Intralipid, 5 ml/kg) activated arterial expression of NF-kB to the same extent as VLDL. The upregulation of endothelial VCAM- 1 expression by linoleic acid in vitro was shown to be NF-kB dependent (study 2), as assessed by cells <b>tranfected</b> with a nonphosphorylatable IkB construct (IkB-alpha deletion mutant lacking amino acids 1 - 37). These results suggest that linoleic acid derived from VLDL particles promotes the development of atherosclerotic lesions by activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kB. VLDL enhances PAI- 1 production in cultured endothelial cells, and there is also a close relation between high plasma levels of PAI- 1 and hypertriglyceridemia. In the third study, we showed that acute VLDL elevation in the circulation stimulates PAI- 1 production in the vascular cells also in vivo. Both endothelial cells and medial smooth muscle cells appeared to be responsible for increased PAI- 1 production due to accumulated VLDL particles. Within the rat PAI- 1 promoter we identified a sequence (- 589 to - 571) with 74 % homology with the recently described VLDL responsive element in the human PAI- 1 promoter (- 675 to - 657) and adjacent to a 4 G motif presumably corresponding to the human 4 G/ 5 G polymorphism. Transient transfection studies showed that VLDL exerts its stimulatory effects on rat PAI- 1 gene expression in vascular cells by interaction with promoter sequences located within bp – 656 and – 505. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that VLDL stimulates the binding of unidentified protein(s) to this element. PAI- 1 produced by endothelial cells predisposes to thrombosis, the hallmark of acute coronary syndroms. PAI- 1 produced by vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) inhibits proteolysis by decreasing plasmin-dependent activation of metalloproteinases. The later effect increases matrix accumulation and reduces matrix degradation and inhibits SMC migration from the media into developing atherosclerotic lesions. In the fourth study, oxidized LDL was characterized as a possible candidate responsible for the increased PAI- 1 production of SMCs within the plaque. Lysophosphatidylcholine formed during the oxidation of LDL appeared to be the mediating substance, by activating PAI- 1 transcription through increased AP- 1 activity. Alpha 1 -Antitrypsin (AAT), the main physiological inhibitor of proteinases, undergoes conformational changes after inactivation of a target enzyme, yielding a cleaved hydrophobic C-terminal peptide (C- 36) which forms amyloid fibrils. In study 5, this C- 36 peptide but not native AAT nor related fibrils was found to activate PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma, NF-kB and AP- 1 in human monocytes. Furthermore, C- 36 peptide was detected in carotid atherosclerotic plaques...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Blutongue virus (BTV), the {{prototype}} {{member of the}} genus Orbivirus in the family Reoviridae, is an insect-borne virus that infects domestic and wild ruminants, causing a non contagious infectious disease spread by biting midges of some species of Culicoides genus, known as Bluetongue (BT). Historically, BT occurs most commonly and seriously in sheep and in some species of wild ruminants, occasionally in goats and rarely in cattle. In 2006, BTV serotype 8 (BTV- 8) emerged in Norhern Europe followed by a still ongoing epidemic; the BTV- 8 occurrence is remarkable for several reasons and, particularly, for its virulence not only in sheep between domestic ruminants. Currently, BTV, and particularly BTV- 8, is responsible of greet farming industries losses; for this reason {{it is critical to}} have effective molecular tools to define standardized, specific and sensitive serodiagnostic assay and successful and economic prophilatic immunization plans. BTV is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus and its genome consists of 10 dsRNA segments that encode 4 nonstructural proteins (NS 1 -NS 3 and NS 3 A) and 7 structural proteins (VP 1 -VP 7). Among the 7 structural proteins, VP 2, the outermost viral protein, is the cellular binding protein, elicitis virus-neutralizating antibody, and is responsible for hemagglutinin activity and serotype specifity. Although VP 2 has been expressed successfully throught many systems and particularly with insect cell-baculovirus expression system, its paracrin expression as a soluble form in mammalian cells represents a difficult task. In this work we have investigared a mammalian expression platform for BTV VP 2 production as a soluble form, generating several expression vector plasmids with BTV- 8 VP 2 sequence, whole or fragmented, by fusion peptides strategy. Starting from the assumption that VP 2 is strongly cell associated, the full length of VP 2 ORF was sub-cloned in frame with the immunoglobulin kappa light chain (IgK) signal peptide specifying secretion of heterologous proteins, generating pIgkVP 2. In order to attempting the expression of BTV- 8 VP 2 with pIgkVP 2 vector in mammalian cells and {{due to the lack of}} a suitable monoclonal antibody against BTV- 8 VP 2, a tag soluble epitope peptide belonging to the Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV- 1) glycoprotein D (gD) ectodomain was generated, obtaing pIgkVP 2 gD 106. After electroporation of HEK 293 T cells, we found that VP 2 was well expressed from the <b>tranfected</b> cells, but not secreted into the medium, showing that introduction of a heterologous signal peptide in the amino-terminus of VP 2 is not sufficient to specify its secretion. In previous studies was demonstrated that BTV VP 2 associates with Vimentin cytoskeleton protein, and deletions of amino acids between residues 65 and 114 into VP 2 sequence have shown to disrupt VP 2 -vimentin association. This aspect could be the cause of the missing VP 2 secretion. Thus, new plasmid vectors was generated with different fragments of VP 2 in frame upstream with Igk signal peptide, and downstream with gD 106 tag; although all VP 2 fragments are found in cell fraction, none is secreted into the medium. Based on the fact that BVDV gE 2 ectodomain was very well expressed and secreted by pIgK-E 2, gE 2 ectodomain was exploited as a leader sequence to get VP 2 and derived fragments secreted into the medium of transfected cells. Therefore, VP 2 and derived fragments were sandwiched between IgkE 2 and gD 106 tag. We found that two constructs, pIgkE 2 VP 2720 - 1425 gD 106 and pIgkE 2 VP 22070 - 2883 gD 106, successfully expressed and secreted the VP 2 fragments. Finally, BoHV- 4 U ΔORF 50 strain cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) was engineered to express VP 22070 - 2883. Thus, we inserted the IgkE 2 VP 22070 - 2883 gD 106 expression cassette into IE 2 gene of a mutant BoHV- 4 U ΔORF 50 strain, in which IE 2 locus is duplicated and one of them is inactivated by the insertion of 2004 bp KanaGalK DNA sequence stuffer double selecting cassette. So we obtained a recombinant BoHV- 4 strain virus-vector able to yeald hight quantity of soluble VP 22070 - 2883 gD 106 fragment from infected cells, which could be employed for immunodiagnostic assay development or vaccine purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of adenovirus vectors for cloning and foreign gene expression requires packaging cell lines that can complement missing viral functions caused by sequence deletions and/or replacement with foreign DNA sequences. In this study, packaging cell lines {{were designed to}} provide in trans the missing bovine adenovirus functions, so that recombinant viruses could be generated. Fetal bovine kidney and lUng cells, acquired at the trimester term from a pregnant cow, were <b>tranfected</b> with both digested wild type BAV 2 genomic DNA and pCMV-EI. The plasmid pCMV-EI was specifically constructed to express El of BAV 2 {{under the control of}} the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter (CMV). Selection for "true" transformants by continuous passaging showed no success in isolating immortalised cells, since the cells underwent crisis resulting in complete cell death. Moreover, selection for G 418 resistance, using the same cells, also did not result in the isolation of an immortalised cell line and the same culture-collapse event was observed. The lack of success in establishing an immortalised cell line from fetal tissue prompted us to transfect a pre-established cell line. We began by transfecting MDBK (Mardin-Dardy bovine kidney) cells with pCMV-El-neo, which contain the bacterial selectable marker neo gene. A series of MDBK-derived cell lines, that constitutively express bovine adenoviral (BAV) early region 1 (El), were then isolated. Cells selected for resistance to the drug G 418 were isolated collectively for full characterisation to assess their suitability as packaging cell lines. Individual colonies were isolated by limiting dilution and further tested for El expression and efficiency of DNA uptake. Two cell lines, L- 23 and L- 24, out of 48 generated foci tested positive for £ 1 expression using Northern Blot analysis. DNA uptake studies, using both lipofectamine and calcium phosphate methods, were performed to compare these cells, their parental MDBK cells, 8 and the unrelated human 293 cells as a benchmark. The results revealed that the new MDBKderived clones were no more efficient than MDBK cells in the transient expression of transfected DNA and that they were inferior to 293 cells, when using lacZ as the reporter gene. In view of the inherently poor transfection efficiency of MDBK cells and their derivatives, a number of other bovine cells were investigated for their potential as packaging cells. The cell line CCL 40 was chosen for its high efficiency in DNA uptake and subsequently transfected with the plasmid vector pCMV El-neo. By selection with the drug G 418, two cell lines were isolated, ProCell 1 and ProCell 2. These cell lines were tested for El expression, permissivity to BAV 2 and DNA uptake efficiency, revealing a DNA uptake efficiency of 37 %, comparable to that of CCL 40. Attempts to rescue BAV 2 mutants carrying the lacZ gene in place of £ 1 or £ 3 were carried out by co-transfecting wild type viral DNA with either the plasmid pdlElE-Z (which contains BAV 2 sequences from 0 % to 40. 4 % with the lacZ gene in place of the £ 1 region from 1. 1 % to 8. 25 %) or with the plasmid pdlE 3 - 5 -Z (which contains BAV 2 sequences from 64. 8 % to 100 % with the lacZ gene in place of the E 3 region from 75. 8 % to 81. 4 %). These cotransfections did not result in the generation of a viral mutant. The lack of mutant generation was thought to be caused by the relative inefficiency ofDNA uptake. Consequently, cosBAV 2, a cosmid vector carrying the BAV 2 genome, was modified to carry the neo reporter gene in place of the £ 3 region from 75. 8 % to 81. 4 %. The use of a single cosmid vector earring the whole genome would eliminate the need for homologous recombination in order to generate a viral vector. Unfortunately, the transfection of cosBAV 2 - neo also did not result in the generation of a viral mutant. This may have been caused by the size of the £ 3 deletion, where excess sequences that are essential to the virus' survival might have been deleted. As an extension to this study, the spontaneous E 3 deletion, accidently discovered in our viral stock, could be used as site of foreign gene insertion...|$|E

In 72 hrs, all the protein is in the cytoplasm. Apoptotic bodies {{can be seen in the}} 48 hrs and 72 hrs. Cell differentiation is inhibited by the expression of FLAG-IpaB 803 -His protein. On the other hand, after 24 hrs, nucleus is condensed in 50 % of cells but after 48 hr and 72 hrs, half of the cell's nuclei are condensed and the rest have broken nucleus. The CL 1 - 5 line was transfected with pFlAG-CMV 2 -IpaB-His and pFLAG-CMV 2 -IpaB 803 -His to check the effect of the protein expression to the mitochondria. It was found that the FLAG-IpaB-His protein did not change the shape of the mitochondria but the FLAG-IpaB 803 -His protein caused mitochondrial fragmentation. The pEGFP-N 2 -IpaB and pEGFP-N 2 -IpaB 803 plasmids were transfected into HEK- 293 T, CL 1 - 0, PA- 1, CHO-K 1, CL 1 - 5 cell lines and cultured for 48 hrs. The expression of IpaB-EGFP and IpaB 803 -EGFP recombinant protein expression was studied. The percentage of the 2 proteins in CHO-K 1 cells is < 5 % but in the other cell lines is < 1 % but the pEGFP-N 2 plasmid to the 5 cell lines contains 30 % to 40 % of EGFP protein. This shows that expression of IpaB-EGFP protein and IpaB 803 -EGFP protein in the five cell lines is susceptible to degradation resulting in the low levels of protein expression. CL 1 - 5 cell line containing the pEGFP-N 2 -IpaB and pEGFP-N 2 -IpaB 803 plasmid was cultured for 24 hr and 48 hr. The cell survival was the no different but the recombinant protein expression inhibited the cell differentiation but showed no fragmentation of the mitochondria. 目錄 中文摘要	I 前言	 1 材料	 7 1. 	菌種、質體、引子與培養基	 7 2. 	培養細胞用之培養基	 7 3. 	藥品與溶液	 8 方法	 9 I. 	蛋白質操作技術	 9 1.
