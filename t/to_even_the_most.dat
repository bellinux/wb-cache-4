25|$|According to {{the later}} hagiographical literature, Theodore {{received}} an education befitting his family's station, {{and from the}} age of seven was instructed by a private tutor, eventually concentrating in particular on theology. It is however not clear that these opportunities were available <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> well-placed Byzantine families of the eighth century, and it is possible that Theodore was at least partially an autodidact.|$|E
25|$|Ramakrishna was skilled {{with words}} {{and had an}} {{extraordinary}} style of preaching and instructing, which may have helped convey his ideas <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> skeptical temple visitors. His speeches reportedly revealed a sense of joy and fun, {{but he was not}} at a loss when debating with intellectual philosophers. Philosopher Arindam Chakrabarti contrasted Ramakrishna's talkativeness with Buddha's legendary reticence, and compared his teaching style to that of Socrates.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interpretation}} of the poem suggests that the statue does not actually come to life, but that Evgenii loses his sanity. Pushkin makes Evengii go mad to create “a terrrifying dimension <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> humdrum personality {{and at the same}} time show the abyss hidden in the most apparently common-place human soul”. In this regard, Evgenii is seen to become a disinherited man of the time in much the same vein as a traditional epic hero.|$|E

25|$|In 1992 the Canadian {{government}} {{declared a}} moratorium on the Northern Cod fishery that, for the past 500 years, had largely shaped the lives and communities of Canada's eastern coast. The interplay between fishing societies and the resources on which they depend is palpable <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> unacquainted observer: fisheries transform the ecosystem, which in turn pushes the fishery and society to adapt. In the summer of 1992, when the Northern Cod biomass fell to one percent of its earlier level, it became apparent to Canada's federal government that this relationship had been pushed {{to the breaking point}} and a moratorium was declared, ending the region's half-millennium run with the Northern Cod.|$|E
25|$|Homeless {{people often}} find it {{difficult}} to document their date of birth or their address. Because homeless people usually have no place to store possessions, they often lose their belongings, including their identification and other documents, or find them destroyed by police or others. Without a photo ID, homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services, including health care and clinic access. They can be denied access <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> basic assistance: clothing closets, food pantries, certain public benefits, and in some cases, emergency shelters. Obtaining replacement identification is difficult. Without an address, birth certificates cannot be mailed. Fees may be cost-prohibitive for impoverished persons. And some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification, creating a Catch-22. This problem is far less acute in countries which provide free-at-use health care, such as the UK, where hospitals are open-access day and night and make no charges for treatment. In the US, free-care clinics, for homeless and other people, do exist in major cities, but they often attract more demand than they can meet.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E

[...] Kirkus Reviews referred to the book as [...] "an enlightening cautionary take" [...] and [...] "a charmingly personal account", but also as [...] "loosely organized and occasionally sparse on detail". John Wilkes, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "Although naive and overdrawn at times, this heartfelt tale will bring tears and smiles <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> stubbornly objective reader."

500|$|In January 2011, a Daytime Emmy Awards [...] "final push" [...] by Canyon News {{suggested}} that Case's performance needed more Emmy attention. Soap Opera Digest praised Phyllis finding {{the evidence that}} freed Sharon from prison in 2011, writing: [...] "The twist that Phyl hijacked the glory from both Adam and estranged sister Avery was downright delicious—and made Sharon beholden her worst enemy. The cherry on top? Sharon giving Adam an overdue verbal beatdown. Justice has finally been served." [...] Case's performance in 2012, described as a [...] "whirlwind year", was met with critical acclaim due to writing by Bell (which, in turn, was criticized). On-Air On-Soaps commented, [...] "Surviving {{probably one of the}} worst on-screen character assassinations in soap opera history, which virtually left viewers wondering, what the heck are the writers doing to the integrity of Sharon Newman, the once befallen heroine of Genoa City?, Case rebounded by making her performances noteworthy, no matter what the creative teams decided to do to her character." [...] This led Soap Opera Uncensored to name her Entertainer of the Year in January 2013. In December 2015, Soap Opera Digest praised her portrayal of the character's [...] "emotional roller coaster" [...] and remarked, [...] "Sharon Case has a knack for bringing emotional depth and reality <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> outrageously soapy situations".|$|E
500|$|The {{record was}} not highly {{anticipated}} like the four-minute mile had been. In Philadelphia, {{there was little}} fanfare in The Philadelphia Inquirer or The Philadelphia Bulletin, which both had a box {{on the front page}} announcing the achievement with a story in the sports section. Philadelphia Daily News had no mention on its cover. The Bulletin wrote, [...] "Thus was fulfilled a prophecy made the first time the magnificent 7'1" [...] scoring star of the Warriors played a game in the National Basketball Association three years ago." [...] New York City papers ran stories from the news agencies. The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune ran the AP story on pages 14 and 11, respectively. The New York Daily News ran the UPI story on page 26. The New York Post gave prominent back-page coverage to Chamberlain's feat on Sunday.

500|$|... is a {{forbidden}} summoning jutsu {{that is used}} {{to revive}} the dead in a state of near-life. The process of this jutsu begins by obtaining a genetic sample from the deceased, either through grave robbery or blood stains and salvaged organs. A living person is then sacrificed for the deceased spirit to inhabit and serve as a slave to the user's will. However, the Jutsu can only function if the deceased soul is within the realm of Pure Land and not elsewhere in the afterlife like in the stomach of the Reaper. Though it was the Tobirama Senju who invented the Reanimation Jutsu for the purpose of creating an indestructible army used in suicide attacks, the jutsu was later completed by Orochimaru when he [...] revived Tobirama Senju and Hashirama Senju. Kabuto perfected the jutsu {{to the point where he}} is able to revive dozens of ninja in one execution, needing to focus all his mental energy to fully control them. People revived through this process are almost invulnerable <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> fatal attacks, as they will simply regenerate any damage taken (although it takes some time for especially damaging attacks like Rasengan and they can also be paralyzed by specific attacks, such as poison). Having already died, the resurrected expel any basic needs living people required; they have unlimited chakra and power due to not needing to replenish them. In addition, they cannot be subjected to genjutsu jutsu that affect living things like the Infinite Tsukuyomi. The only effective means to destroy a ninja brought back is with Yin-Yang Style techniques that damage the body beyond regeneration to the point of death.|$|E

2500|$|In Peru, {{students}} grade {{second and}} fourth students take a test called [...] "Evaluacion Censal de Estudiantes" [...] (ECE). The test assesses skills in reading comprehension and math.

In this much smaller work for a private chamber he wears riding clothes. Jan de Bray encouraged his sitters to pose costumed as figures from classical history, but many of his works are of his own family.

2500|$|By {{the height}} of the Empire, {{numerous}} international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> remote provinces, among them Cybele, Isis, Epona, and gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. [...] Foreign religions increasingly attracted devotees among Romans, who increasingly had ancestry from elsewhere in the Empire. Imported mystery religions, which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's family rites and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of [...] "magic", conspiratorial (coniuratio), or subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity, as with the senate's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue {{in the sense that it}} is for competing monotheistic systems. The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict. For example, religious disputes helped cause the First Jewish–Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt.|$|E
