500|$|After divorcing Hubbard, Northrup married Miles Hollister {{and bought}} a house in Malibu, California. Hubbard {{continued}} to develop Dianetics (and ultimately Scientology), through which he met his third and last wife, Mary Sue, in late 1951 – only a few months after his divorce. The controversy surrounding the divorce had severely dented his reputation. He sought <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his followers as being the result of his victimization by his ex-wife. Speaking to Dianeticists following the divorce, Hubbard blamed shadowy outside forces for the bad publicity: [...] "We have just been through the saw mill, through the public presses. Every effort was made to butcher my personal reputation. A young girl is nearly dead because of this effort. My wife Sara." [...] Around the summer of 1951, he explained his flight to Cuba as being a bid to escape Northrup's depredations: [...] "He talked a lot about Sara. When she ran off with another man Ron followed them and they locked him in a hotel room and pushed drugs up his nose, but he managed to escape and went to Cuba." [...] He publicly portrayed his marital problems as being entirely the fault of Northrup and her lover Hollister: ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{worked well}} with German {{producer}} Conny Plank on Whodini, and {{were trying to}} find a similar producer. According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of how <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided that we needed to get somebody from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

500|$|... "'97 Bonnie & Clyde", {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{featured on the}} Slim Shady EP as [...] "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead {{told her that he}} would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, [...] "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." [...] Eminem also said, [...] "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." [...] The song [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. [...] Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre [...] "fell out of his chair laughing" [...] upon hearing the lyric. [...] "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. [...] After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.|$|E
500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic.Translated quote: [...] "If you could use sorcery, what do you think would happen?" [...] Uraha, Yukito's mother,Translated quote: [...] "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother." [...] and Yukito himselfTranslated quote: A power that can move a puppet without touching it. To me, it's a power that's nothing out of the ordinary. But if I had <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> this girl using terminology she knew.....it's a kind of magic." [...] have the ability to use magic, though Yukito is the least skilled among them. Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon, she will gain the power to do magic. However, the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the joke}} becomes a {{national}} sensation. Comedian Carlos Mencia goes on Conan O'Brien's show claiming {{credit for the}} joke. The joke is played on rapper Kanye West, who does not understand it. West grows angry when others say he does not get it, and will not allow anyone <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him, because {{he claims to be}} a genius and [...] "the voice of a generation". Kanye abducts Carlos Mencia, who admits he stole the joke to compensate for not being funny and claiming that his [...] "dick don't work" [...] in a parody of Viggo Mortensen's character Lalin in Carlito's Way, but Kanye doesn't believe him and beats him to death {{with the help of his}} hired thugs. Cartman and Jimmy go on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and claim they invented the joke, prompting Kanye to go after them. Jimmy confronts Cartman, asking how he can live with himself for taking credit for a joke he did not write. They are interrupted by Kanye, who threatens to kill them. By now, Cartman has not only convinced himself he wrote the whole joke without Jimmy's help, but believes he also saved his life from a black widow, slew a dragon, defeated an army of Jew robots, and has powers similar to the Human Torch. Cartman thinks he realizes what Kyle was trying to tell him, but he gets it completely backwards: Cartman believes that Jimmy's ego is the one that is twisted and Jimmy's ego trying to convince itself that he wrote the joke, while not accepting that Cartman wrote the whole thing, and Jimmy believes him. Kanye has an epiphany about his own massive ego and believes he finally understands the joke. However, he incorrectly thinks it means he is, in fact, a gay fish. The episode ends with Kanye donning a wetsuit and diving off the Santa Monica Pier into the ocean to embrace his new identity as a gay fish in the form of a music video, in which he happily swims around the sea, kissing and humping random fish.|$|E

2500|$|Ned Kelly, {{in company}} with a Mr Living and Constable Richards went to the {{printing}} office. S. Gill, a journalist, when called upon to stand, ran instead and planted himself in the creek. They went to his home, where Richards tried to reassure his wife, and Kelly said, [...] "All I want him for is for your husband to print this letter, the history of my life, and I {{wanted to see him}} <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him." [...] Living said, [...] "For God's sake, Kelly, give me the papers, and I will give them to Gill."

Later in the day Kelly relaxed with townspeople at McDougall's.|$|E
2500|$|It {{appears that}} Hooke {{was one of}} a group of {{students}} whom Busby educated in parallel to the main work of the school. [...] Contemporary accounts say he was [...] "not much seen" [...] in the school, and this appears to be true of others in a similar position. [...] Busby, an ardent and outspoken Royalist (he had the school observe a fast-day on the anniversary of the King's beheading), was by all accounts trying to preserve the nascent spirit of scientific inquiry that had begun to flourish in Carolean England but which was at odds with the literal Biblical teachings of the Protectorate. [...] To Busby and his select students the Anglican Church was a framework to support the spirit of inquiry into God's work, those who were able were destined by God to explore and study His creation, and the priesthood functioned as teachers <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> those who were less able. [...] This was exemplified in the person of George Hooper, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, whom Busby described as [...] "the best scholar, the finest gentleman and will make the completest bishop that ever was educated at Westminster School".|$|E
2500|$|Monk had {{disappeared}} from the scene by the mid-1970s and made {{only a small number}} of appearances during the final decade of his life. His last studio recordings as a leader were made in November 1971 for the English Black Lion label, near the end of a worldwide tour with the Giants of Jazz, a group which included Gillespie, Kai Winding, Sonny Stitt, Al McKibbon, and Blakey. Bassist McKibbon, who had known Monk for over twenty years and played on his final tour in 1971, later said: [...] "On that tour, Monk said about two words. I mean literally maybe two words. He didn't say 'Good morning,' 'Goodnight,' 'What time?' Nothing. Why, I don't know. He sent word back after the tour was over that the reason he couldn't communicate or play was that Art Blakey and I were so ugly." [...] A different side of Monk is revealed in Lewis Porter's biography, John Coltrane: His Life and Music; Coltrane states: [...] "Monk is exactly the opposite of Miles : he talks about music all the time, and he wants so much for you to understand that if, by chance, you ask him something, he'll spend hours if necessary <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you." [...] Blakey reports that Monk was excellent at both chess and checkers.|$|E
