5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{from the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, HD 28185 has a parallax of 23.62 milliarcseconds, which {{corresponds to a}} distance of 42 parsecs (138 light-years). Since <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>is</b> located further than 25 parsecs from Earth, it is not listed in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars. With an apparent magnitude of 7.81, <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>is</b> not visible with the naked eye, though {{it can be seen}} using binoculars.|$|E
5|$|Estimating {{the age and}} {{metallicity}} of cool {{stars is}} difficult due {{to the formation of}} diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, which makes the spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>is</b> likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 billion years old, depending on the theoretical model used. However, the low rotational period of the star as well as its membership among the young disk population suggest that <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>is</b> between 0.1–5 billion years old.|$|E

5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, Mu Arae {{exhibits a}} parallax of 64.47 milliarcseconds as the Earth moves around the Sun. When combined with the known distance from the Earth to the Sun, this means <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>is</b> located {{at a distance of}} 50.6 light years (15.51 parsecs).

5|$|Among the {{earliest}} detected since time of detonation, {{and for which}} {{the earliest}} spectra have been obtained (beginning at 6 hours after the actual explosion), is the Type II SN 2013fs (iPTF13dqy) which was recorded 3 hours after the supernova event on 6 October 2013 by the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). <b>The</b> <b>star</b> <b>is</b> located in a spiral galaxy named NGC 7610, located 160 million light years away in the constellation of Pegasus.|$|E
5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years.

5|$|HD 2039 is {{a stable}} G-type star, meaning it shines with white light {{that can be}} seen in the Sun. In terms of mass, the star {{exhibits}} almost identical properties.

5|$|HD 28185 is {{a yellow}} dwarf star similar to our Sun located about 138 light-years away from Earth in the {{constellation}} Eridanus.

5|$|Mu Arae has a listed {{spectral}} type of G3IVV. The G3 part means <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} the Sun (a G2V star). The star may be entering the subgiant stage of its evolution as it starts {{to run out of}} hydrogen in its core. This is reflected in its uncertain luminosity class, between IV (the subgiants) and V (main sequence dwarf star stars like the Sun).|$|E
5|$|Observations {{have failed}} to note signs of {{accretion}} leading up to Type Ia supernovae, and this is now thought to be because <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>is</b> first loaded up to above the Chandrasekhar limit while also being spun up to a very high rate by the same process. Once the accretion stops the star gradually slows until the spin is no longer enough to prevent the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's {{writings}} combined {{religious and}} scientific objections and were fueled by political events. Scientific opposition came from Tycho Brahe and others and {{arose from the}} fact that, if heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was. Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax <b>was</b> negligible because <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> a little more distant than Saturn, and <b>the</b> Sun and <b>stars</b> <b>were</b> comparable in size.|$|R
