40|$|Effects of avocado seed extract (ASE) in {{different}} tris-extenders on sperm and seminal oxidative stress indices of vitrified spermatozoa of West African Dwarf (WAD) goats during vitrification were assessed. Semen samples were diluted with varying levels (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mL/ 100 mL of diluent) of ASE in tris citric acid (<b>TCA),</b> tris <b>sodium</b> phosphate (TSP) and tris sodium citrate (TSC) extenders while a tris-extender without citric acid, sodium phosphate and sodium citrate served as control. Diluted semen samples were vitrified and preserved. The results revealed higher (P TSP > TSC...|$|R
40|$|Guarana {{has great}} {{agricultural}} potential and is largely used therapeutically {{and in the}} production of non-alcoholic energy drinks. Genomic and proteomic studies are crucial to identify proteins that play central roles in the maintenance and viability of fruits, as well as to identify proteins related to the main metabolic pathways. However, the success of any protein analysis starts with the protein extract preparation, which needs to offer an extract that is free of contaminants. This study aimed to evaluate different extraction methods to obtain high-quantity and high-quality extracts that are compatible with analysis by 2 -dimensional electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry protein identification. Three different methods were tested: trichloroacetic acid (<b>TCA)</b> /acetone, <b>sodium</b> dodecyl sulfate (SDS) /phenol, and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) /SDS/phenol. 201...|$|R
40|$|C- 13 NMR {{relaxation}} parameters including T 1, the {{spin-lattice relaxation}} time, and NOE, the nuclear Overhauser effect, have been measured for mixtures of tricyclic antidepressants (<b>TCAs)</b> and <b>sodium</b> dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles. The relaxation parameters were measured at 75 and 100 MHz and were interpreted {{in terms of}} the overall and internal motion of these micellar aggregates. It is suggested that the drug molecules are partitioned almost totally within the SDS micelle, resulting in significant increases in micellar volume and a reduction in mobility of SDS alkyl chains. The mobility of the TCA molecules was also examined by using chemical shift data and 2 D NMR techniques. It is found that the TCA molecules adopt an extended conformation, with the tricyclic moiety occupying the hydrophobic region of the micelle and the dimethylammonium moiety residing at the micelle/water interface...|$|R
50|$|Administration of {{intravenous}} {{sodium bicarbonate}} {{as an antidote}} {{has been shown to}} be an effective treatment for resolving the metabolic acidosis and cardiovascular complications of <b>TCA</b> poisoning. If <b>sodium</b> bicarbonate therapy fails to improve cardiac symptoms, conventional antidysrhythmic drugs or magnesium can be used to reverse any cardiac abnormalities. However, no benefit has been shown from Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs; it appears they worsen the sodium channel blockade, slow conduction velocity, and depress contractility and should be avoided in TCA poisoning. Low blood pressure is initially treated with fluids along with bicarbonate to reverse metabolic acidosis (if present), if the blood pressure remains low despite fluids then further measures such as the administration of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine can be used to increase blood pressure.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper has}} {{examined}} copper uptake from CuHis 2 complexes by cytotrophoblast cells isolated from term human placenta. Uptake is time-dependent, reaching equilibrium after about 90 min, and saturable, with a calculated apparent Km of 0. 174 ± 0. 061 μM and Vmax, measured over 30 min, of 0. 721 ± 0. 092 pmol/min/μg DNA. To determine whether ATP {{was required for}} uptake, cells were incubated with inhibitors of glycolysis (iodoacetate) and the <b>TCA</b> cycle (<b>sodium</b> azide and cyanide). Iodoacetate and sodium azide {{had no effect on}} uptake, but cyanide decreased the initial rate of uptake. This effect was due to copper binding to the inhibitor and decreasing the effective substrate concentration rather than inhibition of uptake through ATP depletion. Ouabain and monensin had no effect, showing that neither the Na+ gradient nor endocytosis were involved in uptake. The monovalent ion chelator, bathocuproine sulphonate, had no effect on uptake but buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, did decrease both the rate of uptake and equilibrium copper levels, suggesting that copper may bind to glutathione within the cell. The data show that copper is taken up by a passive carrier-mediated transporter and, following uptake, binds to glutathione within the cell...|$|R
40|$|Perennial {{creeping}} grasses such as Cynodon dactylon are {{of major}} {{concern in the}} South African sugarcane industry, and investigations to establish optimum control measures for these species have been given high priority. Research results showed that herbicides with a base ofglyphosate (isopropylamine salt of glyphosate) or sulfosate (trimesium salt of glyphosate) produced consistent acceptable kill ratings for Cynodon spp., and products such as MSMA (720 g/Q monosodium methane arsenate) and <b>TCA</b> (960 g/kg <b>sodium</b> trichloroacetate) in combination controlled Digitaria abyssinica. The Cynodon species investigated included C. dactylon and C. plectostachyus, the former being both stoloniferous and rhizomatous and the latter stoloniferous only. D. abyssinica is a rhizomatous species (Gibbs Russell etal., 1991) Different application techniques such as controlled droplet applicators were compared with the conventional manually operated knapsack sprayers. In addition, certain physical operations intended to enhance product efficacy were tested. These included rotavating or slashing, with herbicide application commencing after sufficient regrowth had occurred. Tests extended from early to late summer to determine seasonal influence on control measures. Trials were conducted in a semi-controlled environment as well as under fallow conditions, and in plant and ratoon cane fields. Results indicated that creeping grass control in sugarcane can be improved by making specific changes to current recommendations. Observations in heavily infested fields indicated that good grass control and minimal cane damage {{can be achieved by}} slashing cane and spraying the grass after a suitable period...|$|R
