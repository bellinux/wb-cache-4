40|$|The {{effects of}} tumour {{inhibitory}} doses of <b>tretamine</b> (triethylenemelamine), busulphan, and melphalan on the fertility of male rats have been examined. The aromatic nitrogen mustard, melphalan, was inactive, but busulphan has a highly selective action on spermatogenesis which contrasts strikingly {{with that of}} <b>tretamine.</b> The main action of <b>tretamine</b> was exerted upon spermatocytes or spermatids, but, with increasing dose, the effects spread to involve {{a wide range of}} spermatogenic cells including mature sperm, so that infertility could be induced very rapidly. Busulphan, however, interfered with the development of spermatogonia for several weeks, although other germinal cells were unaffected and continued to develop into mature spermatozoa. This accounted for the continuation of normal fertility for 7 weeks after a dose, before sterility suddenly developed. The antifertility activity of <b>tretamine</b> could be simulated by a variety of other ethyleneimino compounds, potency being greatest in trifunctional and least in monofunctional compounds. The latter were, however, very destructive to the seminiferous epithelium with increasing dose. In the rat, there appeared to be no definite relationship between the ability of alkylating substances to interfere with the activity of normal and pathological proliferating tissues, as represented by the germinal epithelium, haematopoietic, and tumour tissue. Although carcinogenicity was a biological property of alkylating agents, other chemical types of carcinogen did not interfere with fertility...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Serial sperm counts {{have been}} made in rabbits treated with alkylating agents. After single {{injections}} of Busulphan, <b>Tretamine</b> and isopropyl methanesulphonate, aspermia developed during the 10 th and 11 th weeks. Other simple monofunctional esters of methane and ethane sulphonic acids, which induced sterility in rats {{as a result of their}} action on spermatozoa and late spermatids, did not depress the sperm count or interfere with sperm motility in the rabbit. The results suggest that the duration of spermatogenesis in the rabbit is about 10 weeks and indicate that in this species, as in rats and mice, a steady turnover of spermatozoa occurs. Fertility tests in male rabbits after administration of <b>Tretamine</b> showed that small doses readily induced sterility which could be maintained by continued administration...|$|E
