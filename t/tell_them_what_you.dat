She advised Rebecca Campbell, {{executive}} director of the Austin Film Society, [...] "Whenever you speak in public you’ve got to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need from them." [...] She put the spotlight on film as a genuine industry, brought more focus to Texas, and had a tremendous network of people in the entertainment industry. She gave more focus to film as a business than had been done before.|$|E

6000|$|... "That will be {{the best}} plan," [...] Reuben agreed; [...] "and I am sure the ladies will be greatly obliged to you, when I <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have undertaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it {{was only}} the bath--no, she ain't really hurt,--only wet, you know. Yes, ma, I'll <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say. No, it was a pure accident. Yes; good-night, papa." ...|$|R
5000|$|In essence, {{the above}} method {{can be seen}} as {{following}} the colloquialism [...] "Tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> you're gonna <b>tell</b> <b>'em,</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em,</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> told 'em" [...] with the first part referring to the introduction, the second part referring to the body, and the third part referring to the conclusion.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir! Bust up {{the quiet}} with a {{chugging}} motor? Not on your life! You just throw {{a pair of}} socks in the old pack, and <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want for eats. I'll be ready soon 's you are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Stewart, <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will, {{and they}} will tell you yet more in return, to show you how signally the light of grace hath been shed over me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When you <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have told}} me," [...] she continued, as though working {{it out in}} her own mind, [...] "they will never submit to it, if they can help it. My father will never submit to it. They will try to put you out, as a heretic,--won't they?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS GEORGE. Well, I did. I {{know what}} a woman is like when her hair's pulled. I {{know what a}} man is like when he's bit. I know what theyre both like when you <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> really feel about them. And thats how I know more of the world than you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{not send}} a long letter to your friends, <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have told me? You can add that I {{agree that the}} {{photograph}} resembles you closely, and that you wish to talk the matter over once again with this William Dill." ...|$|R

5000|$|The (second) {{conclusion}} {{section of}} a CRuPAC restates the introductory conclusion. It {{is important that the}} (second) conclusion not merely copy the introduction verbatim; but rather, that the second conclusion restate the introduction in a compelling manner. It is never proper to introduce new argument or rules in the conclusion. By using two conclusion sections, the CRUPAC applies the maxim: [...] "Tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> you're gonna <b>tell</b> <b>'em,</b> then <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> told 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{and what}} of it?" [...] he cried. [...] "They {{are not likely to}} bully you or {{cross-examine}} you. Just <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> saw from the balcony. Indeed you can't very well say anything else, or they will see that you are lying, and then heaven alone knows what may happen to you, as well as to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come with me," [...] the man said. [...] "I {{have friends}} in the forest, some {{distance}} from here. They will receive you gladly, when I <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done for me; {{and you will be}} safe until you choose to go. We are outlaws but, at present, we are masters of the forest. The government has its hands full, and there is no fear of their disturbing us." ...|$|E
6000|$|The priest {{took the}} mother {{by the hand}} and placed her on the chair in which she usually sat. Then, almost without a word, he led Kate from the room to her own chamber, and bade her wait a minute till he should come back to her. Then he {{returned}} to the sitting-room and at once addressed himself to Lord Scroope. [...] "Have you dared," [...] he said, [...] "to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> hardly dared to tell to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|While {{the people}} stamped and clapped hands, Ida {{went over to}} Bradley and said: [...] "You must talk to <b>them.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>them</b> just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think." ...|$|R
6000|$|Neale wheeled {{fiercely}} upon him. [...] "You're only saying those things! You don't believe <b>them!</b> <b>Tell</b> me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{do really}} think." ...|$|R
2500|$|That bad bowling on that Sunday, that's {{the only}} regret I have in cricket, and I'm sorry I can't have it over again, because knowing what I could do, in my opinion, that's what hurts {{most of all}} [...] [...] Sometimes it haunts me, but anyway, that's {{part and parcel of}} life, and you cop it sweet. Anyone who asks me , that's no problem, it brings back bad memories, but you cop it sweet and anyone decent <b>you</b> respond by <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think, and everyone's {{entitled}} to ask in that regard... The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'. I thought it was good of him to say that. Unfortunately I had one opportunity and I botched it; I lacked disposition on the day and after that I lost my confidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> please, sir. I {{know of no}} people, {{except in}} a legal sense, and under the limited powers that they {{exercise}} by law. As for this new power, which is rising up in the country, and has the impudence to call itself the people, though composed of little knots of men got together by management, and practised on by falsehood, it has neither my respect nor dread; and as I hold it in contempt, I shall treat it with contempt whenever it comes in my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Outsiders {{are allowed}} five-minute speeches," [...] the sick man urged. [...] "Get up and spout. Tell them why you don't want socialism. <b>Tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{think about them}} and their ghetto ethics. Slam Nietzsche into them and get walloped for your pains. Make a scrap of it. It will do them good. Discussion is what they want, and what you want, too. You see, I'd {{like to see you}} a socialist before I'm gone. It will give you a {{sanction}} for your existence. It is the one thing that will save you in the time of disappointment that is coming to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By and by we {{will talk}} about it,' was the answer; and they were taken to a new house, {{belonging}} to one of the Samoans, built of lath plastered and thatch, with one large room and a lesser one at each of its angles. There the Bishop and Mr. Patteson sat on a chest, and seventy or eighty men squatted on mats, John Cho and the native teacher foremost. There was a five minutes' pause. Lifu was not yet familiar to Coley, who spoke it less well than he had spoken German, and John Cho said to him: 'Shall I <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have said to me formerly?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will be no}} difficulty," [...] {{returned}} the wizard, [...] "for the feast {{is not to be}} held for twice seven days. By that time the Kablunet will be well, and getting strong. Of course he must rest and be well stuffed just now. So I will go back, and say that you are coming, and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> also <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have found--a Kablunet. Huk!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not half, not a quarter, so much worthier as I {{hope you}} may some day find me! Try me through some reverse, John--try me through some trial--and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> after THAT, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think of me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucretia smiled. She was so {{absolutely}} transparent, and so {{accustomed to}} her simple way of doing business, that I suppose she did not comprehend my difficulty. [...] "They ask me, of course, and I <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they owe. <b>You</b> owe us half-a-dollar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would say, Petronius, let us, your captives, {{be present}} {{when you take}} the oath. Release four of my band; choose those most sorely wounded, and who are the least able to support the journey to Rome. I will send them with my {{bracelet}} to the Fens. I will <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have said, and they will testify to having seen you swear before your gods; and I will send my last injunctions to them to return again to their land, to send for the fugitives to return from the north, and to say from me that they will return as free men, not as slaves, and that there is no dishonour in accepting such terms as you offer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{could go}} home by that boat just the same. All the {{difference}} would be that I should go with you. You could leave me on the quay, where I'd have a smoke, while you went and saw your father and mother privately; you could then <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> had done, and that I was waiting not far off; that I was a school-master in a fairly good position, and a young man you had known when {{you were at the}} Training College. Then I would come boldly forward; and they would see that it could not be altered, and so you wouldn't suffer a lifelong misery by being the wife of a wretched old gaffer you don't like at all. Now, honestly; you do like me best, don't you, Baptista?' ...|$|E

5000|$|I Want: Try to get {{others to}} comply {{for no reason}} other than you want them to. That is, try to gain their {{compliance}} by <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> to do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want because you desire it. Example: [...] "I {{want you to go}} with me to the city." ...|$|R
6000|$|Among {{the friends}} of the Hilarys there was misgiving on this point of their {{approval}} of Matt's marriage. Some of them thought that the parents' hands had been forced in the blessing they gave it. Old Bromfield Corey expressed a general feeling to Hilary with senile frankness. [...] "Hilary, you seem to have disappointed the expectation of the admirers of your iron firmness. I <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> keep for your enemies. But they seem to think that in Matt's case you ought to have been more of a Roman father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well; you {{can tell}} her so. You may {{take my word for}} this, too,--my sister hates Crosbie quite as much as you do. I think she'd 'pitch into him,' as you call it, herself, if she knew how. You come down to Guestwick for the Christmas, and then go over to Allington and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> all plainly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2008 it was {{revealed}} through The Age that the Victoria Police had been spying on several activist and community groups in Melbourne, including StWC, with {{an officer of the}} controversial Security Intelligence Group, posing as an activist and infiltrating these groups. Mick Armstrong of StWC and Socialist Alternative said [...] "On the one hand you've got police saying 'we will be open and co-operate with you' if you <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing ahead of a rally... but then you learn they are still spying on you. It's completely unjustified." [...] The revelation of the police action was widely condemned by activists and commentators.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} time, the station {{began to feel}} the threat of disco. They hired Gianettino and Meredith Advertising {{to come up with}} a way to {{communicate}} with the New York area. The pitch by creative director George Meredith to station manager Mel Karmazin: [...] "You can't <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want to say, which is 'Disco Sucks,' but you can tell them that 'Rock Lives.'" [...] That became their battle cry, and it could fairly be said that WNEW-FM earned the slogan [...] "Where Rock Lives". The station's television commercials during these years featured the song [...] "Layla" [...] by Derek and the Dominos and was considered one of the station's anthems.|$|E
30|$|Most of {{you will}} {{occasionally}} suffer under poor or self-serving leadership. When {{you find yourself in}} such a predicament, don’t buckle; <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> expect from them as supervisors and support personnel and how they can facilitate accomplishment of your assigned tasks. Then do their jobs as well as yours if need be.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{original}} interview {{first published in}} The New York Times, on 30 December 1988, Gussow quotes Pinter as stating: [...] "The character of the old man, Petey, {{says one of the}} most important lines I've ever written. As Stanley is taken away, Petey says, 'Stan, don't let <b>them</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do.' I've lived that line all my damn life. Never more than now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mo'Nique claimed on the January 28, 2008, Oprah Winfrey Show that Martin Lawrence {{gave her}} {{invaluable}} advice about show business: [...] "He pulled {{me to the}} side and he said, 'Listen, don't ever let <b>them</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can't have.' Since that day, I've made some of the best deals I've ever made in my career because it keeps ringing in my head. ... It will stay with me forever." ...|$|R
40|$|Local Rochester Musicians {{start off}} with limited {{resources}} to promote their music. One option would be to upload their music for free onto a website. A good example of a free website that introduces new and already familiar bands is MySpace. But sites like MySpace are not only focusing on music. MySpace has a primary focus on people interacting with other MySpace users, sharing their biography, photos, likes, dislikes etc. Amongst the users there are countless distractions that can almost drive a user away from the site. Is there another solution to promote local talent? What if a website can place the main focus onto just local artists? Band Space is a website that promotes local bands and their music on a more personal level. The website is devoted to music and {{to those who are}} devoted to loving and playing music. Band Space advertises the music that these bands love to play. Instead of cluttering the page with pointless friend requests and ads for a weight loss program, Band Space will update users on upcoming shows and new talent. Users are able to learn about a band on a more personal level through interviewing and footage from practices and shows. It 2 ̆ 7 s a story of how a band came to be and what their dreams are for the future. Endyga, Endever, Ruby Shooz, Pia Mater, and Phoenix are just the start of Band Space. The user can follow along with the interview and learn more about the bands. MySpace only provides a slot for the bands biography. To show the user is much different than <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> saw (or <b>what</b> <b>you</b> read). The user can take a walk into a practice space or onto a stage with the band. This is something that MySpace doesn 2 ̆ 7 t provide. Band Space is a new way of promoting local musicians on the web. It 2 ̆ 7 s something more special than what other free websites have to offer...|$|R
