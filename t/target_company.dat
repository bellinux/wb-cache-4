50|$|A {{standstill}} agreement {{may be used}} as a form of defence to a hostile takeover, when a <b>target</b> <b>company</b> acquires a promise from an unfriendly bidder to limit the amount of stock that the bidder buys or holds in the <b>target</b> <b>company.</b> By obtaining the promise from the prospective acquirer, the <b>target</b> <b>company</b> gains more time to build up other takeover defenses. In many cases, the <b>target</b> <b>company</b> promises, in exchange, to buy back at a premium the prospective acquirer's stock holdings in the target.|$|E
50|$|A {{consolidated}} merger is {{a merger}} {{in which an}} entirely new legal company is formed through combining the acquiring and <b>target</b> <b>company.</b> The purpose of this merger {{is to create a}} new legal entity with the capital and assets of the merged acquirer and <b>target</b> <b>company.</b> Both the acquiring and <b>target</b> <b>company</b> are dissolved in the process.|$|E

5000|$|Mergers, asset {{purchases}} and equity purchases are each taxed differently, {{and the most}} beneficial structure for tax purposes is highly situation-dependent. One hybrid form often employed for tax purposes is a triangular merger, where the <b>target</b> <b>company</b> merges with a shell company wholly owned by the buyer, thus becoming {{a subsidiary of the}} buyer. In a [...] "forward triangular merger", the buyer causes the <b>target</b> <b>company</b> to merge into the subsidiary; a [...] "reverse triangular merger" [...] is similar except that the subsidiary merges into the <b>target</b> <b>company.</b> Under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, a forward triangular merger is taxed as if the <b>target</b> <b>company</b> sold its assets to the shell company and then liquidated, whereas a reverse triangular merger is taxed as if the target company's shareholders sold their stock in the <b>target</b> <b>company</b> to the buyer.|$|E

Consistent with Bargeron, Schlingemann, Stulz and Zutter (2008), I show that financial acquirers do indeed pay smaller premium than strategic acquirers. Further, I find evidence that supports the hypothesis that financial acquirers prefer <b>target</b> <b>companies</b> in mature industries. Moreover, there is suggestive evidence that <b>target</b> <b>company’s</b> industry has a relatively high impact on the amount of premium paid by a financial acquirer...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{mergers and}} {{acquisitions}} are stated as favorable strategies and as free flows of capital applied by managers for the optimal implementation of resources and assets. Acquisition {{is associated with a}} condition where two businesses are placed under one shelter and are run like members of a group or are merged as a single corporate. In mergers, two businesses are combined in a new form based on the mutual interests of both parties. The shares of the two businesses are usually exchanged so that they could take part in the new business as shareholders. In acquisition, a business begins to control another business effectively by purchasing parts of its ownership. The present study explored the impact of acquisition on performance of Iranian <b>target</b> <b>companies</b> listed in Tehran Stock Exchange. The results of testing research hypotheses showed that performance of <b>target</b> <b>companies</b> did not significantly increase after acquisition, suggesting a decreasing trend in the performance of the <b>target</b> <b>companies</b> after acquisition compared with the period before acquisition. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{investigating}} the effect of mergers and acquisitions on the share prices and dividends involving South African companies in the food and beverage industry. A sample of 79 mergers from 1999 to 2005 was used. The data was analysed using the event study methodology and descriptive statistics. In addition, the paired t-test was also conducted to test {{the significance of the}} results. The results were presented using graphs, tables and charts. The results showed that <b>target</b> <b>companies</b> obtained negative abnormal returns during the announcement of mergers while acquiring companies on the other hand received positive abnormal returns. The results imply that it can no longer be generalized that <b>target</b> <b>companies</b> always win and acquiring companies lose during the merger activity. On the other hand, the dividends for <b>target</b> <b>companies</b> increased significantly after the merger, while the dividends for acquiring companies remained insignificantly negative after the merger.
