5000|$|<b>Tyuyamunite</b> {{is formed}} by the {{weathering}} of uraninite, a uranium-bearing mineral. <b>Tyuyamunite,</b> being a hydrous mineral, contains water. Yet when it is exposed to the atmosphere it loses its water. This process changes <b>tyuyamunite</b> into a different mineral known as metatyuyamunite Ca(UO2)2(VO4)2·3-5H2O ...|$|E
50|$|Several related mineral species exist, including: margaritasite ((Cs,K,H3O)2(UO2)(VO4)2·H2O) and <b>tyuyamunite,</b> (Ca(UO2)2(VO4)2·5-8H2O).|$|E
50|$|Francevillite is a uranyl-group {{vanadate}} mineral in the <b>tyuyamunite</b> series. Its {{chemical formula}} is (Ba,Pb)(UO2)2V2O8·5(H2O). Francevillite is a strongly radioactive mineral. It is typically orange, yellow or brownish yellow. It forms a series with curienite.|$|E
50|$|In the Little Mountain mining {{district}} {{on the west}} side of the Bighorn Mountains, Big Horn County, Wyoming, uranium was produced from 1955 to 1970 from paleokarst breccias in the Madison Limestone of Mississippian age. The uranium occurs as carnotite and <b>tyuyamunite.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{uranium ore}} mineral is {{uraninite}} (UO2) or pitchblende. A {{range of other}} uranium minerals {{can be found in}} various deposits. These include carnotite, <b>tyuyamunite,</b> torbernite and autunite. The davidite-brannerite-absite type uranium titanates, and the euxenite-fergusonite-samarskite group are other uranium minerals.|$|E
50|$|The uranyl ion {{occurs in}} {{minerals}} derived from uranium ore deposits by water-rock interactions {{that occur in}} uranium-rich mineral seams. <b>Tyuyamunite</b> (Ca(UO2)2V2O8·8H2O), autunite (Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·8-12H2O), torbernite (Cu(UO2)2(PO4)·8-12H2O) and uranophane (H3O)2Ca(UO2)2(SiO4)·3H2O) are examples of uranyl containing minerals. These minerals are of little commercial value as most uranium is extracted from pitchblende.|$|E
50|$|Uranium was {{discovered}} near Edgemont, South Dakota in 1951, quickly followed by mining. The uranium occurs in Cretaceous sandstones of the Inyan Kara group, where it outcrops {{along the southern}} edge of the Black Hills in Fall River County, South Dakota. Minerals in unoxidized sandstone are uraninite and coffinite; minerals in oxidized zones include carnotite and <b>tyuyamunite.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tyuyamunite</b> (pronounced tuh-YOO-ya-moon-ite) is a {{very rare}} uranium mineral with formula Ca(UO2)2V2O8·(5-8)H2O. It {{is a member of}} the {{carnotite}} group. It is a bright, canary-yellow color because of its high uranium content. Also, because of tyuyamunite's high uranium content, it is radioactive. It was named by Konstantin Avtonomovich Nenadkevich, in 1912, after its type locality, Tyuya-Muyun, Fergana Valley, Kyrgyzstan.|$|E
5000|$|A {{small amount}} of uranium ore was mined in the mid-1950s from a surface {{exposure}} at Cement in Caddo County. The uranium occurred as carnotite and <b>tyuyamunite</b> in fracture fillings in the Rush Springs Sandstone over the Cement anticline, where the sandstone is bleached. [...] The mined area was 150 ft long, 3 to 5 ft wide, and extended 3 to 5 ft below ground surface.|$|E
50|$|Uranium was {{discovered}} in 1952 in Cretaceous sandstones of the Inyan Kara Group near its outcrop in Crook County, Wyoming, near the northeast edge of the Black Hills. Production began in 1953. Ore minerals are uraninite and coffinite in unoxidized sandstone, and carnotite and <b>tyuyamunite</b> in oxidized sandstone. Gangue minerals in unoxidized deposits are pyrite, marcasite, and calcite; in oxidized deposits calcite and iron oxide.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{kinds of}} mineral {{deposits}} contain roscoelite, either gold-silver-tellurium low temperature epithermal deposits where it occurs along with quartz, fluorite, pyrite and carbonates, or oxidized low temperature uranium-vanadium ores in sedimentary rocks, where it occurs with corvusite, hewettite, carnotite and <b>tyuyamunite.</b> Roecoelite {{is considered a}} gangue mineral of no value when found with gold. [...] However {{it has also been}} used as a vanadium ore.|$|E
5000|$|The uranium mineral {{autunite}} {{was reported}} in 1874 {{near the town of}} Mauch Chunk (present-day Jim Thorpe) in Carbon County, eastern Pennsylvania. [...] A small amount of test mining was done in 1953 at the Mount Pisgah deposit near Jim Thorpe. The uranium at the Mount Pisgah deposit is primarily in an unidentified black mineral in pods and rolls in the basal conglomerate of the Mauch Chunk Formation (Mississippian). Also present are the secondary uranium and uranium-vanadium minerals carnotite, <b>tyuyamunite,</b> liebigite, uranophane, and betauranophane.|$|E
50|$|Mining of uranium-vanadium ore in {{southeast}} Utah {{goes back to}} the late 19th century, at the northern end of the Uravan mineral belt (see Uranium mining in Colorado), where it crosses into Grand County, Utah. Uranium occurs in the Salt Wash member of the Morrison Formation of Jurassic age. Because much of the value depended on the vanadium content, the only economic ore minerals were carnotite and <b>tyuyamunite.</b> Following World War II buying for nuclear weapons programs made uranium valuable for its own sake, and attracted hundreds of prospectors to southeast Utah.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1948 for an occurrence in the Hillside mine, north of Bagdad, Yavapai County, Arizona and named for mineralogist William Shirley Bayley (1861-1943) of the University of Illinois. It occurs as an efflorescence or coating on other secondary minerals and often is deposited on mine walls and workings. It occurs with schrockingerite, andersonite, swartzite and gypsum in the Hillside mine; with schrockingerite and gypsum in the Hideout mine in Utah; and with <b>tyuyamunite,</b> uranophane, liebigite and carnotite in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.|$|E
50|$|Prospectors {{examined}} copper-stained sandstone a mile {{south of}} Garo in Park County in 1903, but the copper content was {{too low to}} mine. In 1919, prospectors discovered that the sandstone contained uranium and vanadium, and about 40 tons of ore containing up to 1% uranium was mined from underground workings. The mine was reactivated as an open-pit uranium mine in 1951 and closed in 1952. The ore consisted of the uranium-vanadium minerals <b>tyuyamunite,</b> metatyuyamunite, and carnotite, along with the copper minerals covellite, chalcocite, azurite, and malachite, and the copper-vanadium mineral volborthite, in the Maroon Formation of Pennsylvanian-Permian age. The ore is associated with faulting-induced fractures in the sandstone.|$|E
40|$|Solution-collapse breccia pipes {{are common}} {{features}} in northwestern Arizona. They were mineralized with uranium, but {{associated with it}} are a suite of elements (e. g., As, Mo, V, Ba, Cu, Pb, and Fe) that may form other ore minerals. Breccia bodies are in some cases cut by cave passages, such as at Corkscrew Cave, Arizona, where such structures are exposed along the walls and on the cave ceilings. The abundance of gypsum and barite throughout the cave and their isotopically light δ 34 S value (− 11 to − 7 ‰) suggest deposition from warm sulfidic solutions that were also responsible, at least in part, for development of the recent cave passages that dissect older paleokarst breccia bodies. The presence of calcite showing depleted δ 18 O values (− 11. 3 and − 16. 9 ‰) is considered indicative of a low-temperature hydrothermal episode in the deposition history of cave minerals. Groundwater percolating through the breccia-pipe bodies mobilized and transported ore-related ions into the cave, where they formed a unique assemblage of minerals (i. e., hörnesite, talmessite, carnotite, <b>tyuyamunite,</b> claudetite, and powellite) that mirror breccia-pipe mineralization...|$|E
40|$|Nevadaite, (Cu 2 +,, Al, V 3 +) 6 (PO 4) 8 F 8 (OH) 2 (H 2 O) 22, {{is a new}} {{supergene}} mineral {{species from}} the Gold Quarry mine, near Carlin, Eureka County, Nevada, U. S. A. Nevadaite forms radiating clusters to 1 mm of prismatic crystals, locally covering sur-faces more that 2 cm across; individual crystals are elongate on [001] with a length:width ratio of> 10 : 1 and a maximum diameter of ~ 30 m. It also occurs as spherules and druses associated with colorless to purple-black fluellite, colorless wavellite, strengite– variscite, acicular maroon-to-red hewettite, and rare anatase, kazakhstanite, tinticite, leucophosphite, torbernite and <b>tyuyamunite.</b> Nevadaite is pale green to turquoise blue with a pale powder-blue streak and a vitreous luster; it does not fluoresce under ultra-violet light. It has no cleavage, a Mohs hardness of ~ 3, is brittle with a conchoidal fracture, and has measured and calculated densities of 2. 54 and 2. 55 g/cm 3, respectively. Nevadaite is biaxial negative, with 1. 540, 1. 548, 1. 553, 2 V(obs.) = 76 °, 2 V(calc.) = 76 °, pleochroic with X pale greenish blue, Y very pale greenish blue, Z blue, and with absorption Z>> X> Y and orientation X = c, Y = a, Z = b. Nevadaite is orthorhombic, space group P 21 mn, a 12. 123 (2), b 18. 999 (2), c 4. 961 (1) Å,...|$|E
40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used to study a selection of uranyl vanadate minerals including carnotite, curienite, francevillite, <b>tyuyamunite</b> and metatyuyamunite. The minerals are characterised by an intense band in the 800 to 824 cm- 1 region, assigned to the ν 1 symmetric stretching vibrations of the (UO 2) 2 + units. A second intense band is observed in the 965 to 985 cm- 1 range and is attributed to the ν 1 (VO 3) symmetric stretching vibrations in the (V 2 O 8) units. This band is split with a second component observed at around 963 cm- 1. A band of very low intensity is observed around 948 cm- 1 and is assigned to the ν 3 antisymmetric stretching vibrations of the (VO 3) units. Bands in the range 608 - 655 cm- 1 may be attributed to molecular water librational modes or the stretching modes ￮(V 2 O 2) units. Bands in the range 573 - 583 cm- 1 may be connected with the ￮ (U-Oequatorial) vibrations or ￮ (V 2 O 2) units. Bands located in the range 467 - 539 cm- 1 may be also attributed to the ￮ (U-Oequatorial) units vibrations. The bending modes of the (VO 3) units are observed in the 463 to 480 cm- 1 range – there may be some coincidence with ￮ (U-Oequatorial). The bending modes of the (V 2 O 2) in the (V 2 O 8) units are located in a series of bands around 407, 365 and 347 cm- 1 (ν 2). Two intense bands are observed in the 304 to 312 cm- 1 range and 241 to 264 cm- 1 range and are assigned to the doubly degenerate ν 2 modes of the (UO 2) 2 + units. The study of the vibrational spectroscopy of uranyl vanadates is complicated by the overlap of bands from the (VO 3) and (UO 2) 2 + units. Raman spectroscopy has proven most useful in assigning bands to these two units since Raman bands are sharp and well separated as compared with infrared bands. The uranyl vanadate minerals are often found as crystals on a host matrix and Raman spectroscopy enables their in-situ characterisation without sample preparation...|$|E
