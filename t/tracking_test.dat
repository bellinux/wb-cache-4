50|$|For <b>track</b> <b>testing,</b> a {{detergent}} based solution {{has historically}} been used to provide low adhesion test conditions. European and international standards often refer to this test method (BS-EN 15595, UIC 541-05). In the UK, British Rail Research adopted two approaches including a laboratory simulation method to all WSP approvals from around 1992, and <b>track</b> <b>testing</b> using carefully conditioned paper tape adhered to the railhead. The paper tape method used in the UK is believed to offer a realistic representation of the challenging very low adhesion conditions encountered during the autumn leaf fall.

40|$|The rutting {{performance}} of asphalt pavement structure {{relies on the}} high temperature properties of asphalt mixture {{as well as the}} pavement structure and thickness. In order to investigate the influence of the structure and thickness, a full-depth wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> is developed in this research by improving the conventional wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> apparatus. The newly proposed test method is capable of varying its load speed and load size, controlling its specimen temperature gradient, and simulating the support conditions of actual asphalt pavement. The full-depth wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> based rutting performance evaluation of different asphalt pavement structures indicates that it is not reasonable to explain the rutting {{performance of}} asphalt pavement structure {{from the point of view}} of single-layer asphalt mixture rutting performance.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} study the {{effectiveness}} of new type modified asphalt additive SBP on pavement performance of asphalt mixture, the experiments were carried out to evaluate the mixing and compaction temperature, high-temperature stability and water stability of SBP modified asphalt mixture. The high-temperature stability of the SBP modified asphalt mortar was studied by DSR. The heating temperature of mineral aggregate and the asphalt mixture mixing temperature and compacted temperature were determined by three different temperature asphalt mixture SCB test, which were got SGC (Superpave Gyratory Compactor). The wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> of asphalt mixture was carried to evaluate the high-temperature stability and freeze-thaw split test were studied the water stability. Through the wheel <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> and water stability test in harsh condition, the high-temperature stability and water stability was evaluated again.

40|$|Silicone rubber based {{composites}} {{are widely}} used to produce outdoor insulators. In adverse weather conditions these can be damaged by surface discharge activity resulting in deterioration of their dielectric properties and an eventual need for replacement. Inclined plane <b>tracking</b> <b>tests</b> are frequently {{used to determine the}} relative performance of different material formulations used in their construction. An alternative approach to characterisation is to use an infra-red laser to deposit known amounts of energy at a known rate to the sample’s surface allowing comparative ranking of different materials. In this paper several silicone based composites have been ranked using a laser ablation technique and the results were then compared to those obtained from <b>tracking</b> <b>tests</b> on the same materials. The comparison indicates that laser ablation ranks the materials in the same order as the <b>tracking</b> <b>tests</b> and may therefore constitute a quick and cost effective method for the routine characterisation of outdoor insulation components...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} {{can cause}} the insulator material to become progressively coated with dirt and chemicals in the long run. In the presence of wet atmospheric conditions, the leakage current flows due {{to the development of}} conducting path across the insulator surface. The level of leakage current depends on the surface wetting and the degree of electrolyte contamination as well as the environmental factors. An analytical approach based on dimensional analysis technique is applied to develop a mathematical model of leakage current in correlation with the environmental stresses. In order to verify the developed model, an inclined-plane <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> is conducted on the polymeric insulating materials. The experimental work is carried out by measuring the magnitude of surface leakage current at different levels of contamination. Simulation results of the model have shown good agreement to the experimental results and provide useful information on describing the test condition of the <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> procedures...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{volunteer}} subjects underwent psychomotor testing when {{wearing an}} integral crash helmet {{in a variety}} of conditions which lead to rebreathing. There was a wide individual variation in the extent of rebreathing. In the worst conditions the minimum inspired carbon dioxide tension (PICO 2) increased to 2. 6 kPa. The psychomotor test was a <b>tracking</b> <b>test</b> based on a microcomputer. There was a significant deterioration in the ability to perform the test when the helmet was worn with the visor down and restricted airflow into the helmet (P = less than 0. 05). In those tests when the minimum PICO 2 exceeded 0. 5 kPa the decrease in performance was more highly statistically significant (p = less than 0. 005). Rebreathing wearing integral crash helmets results in a variable impairment in the subjects' ability to perform a <b>tracking</b> <b>test.</b> We recommend that the maximum level of CO 2 retention inside integral crash helmets should not exceed 0. 5 kPa minimum PICO 2...|$|E
