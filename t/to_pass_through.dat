5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood. Lead is able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> the placenta and into breast milk, and {{blood lead level}}s in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|According to Transport for London (TfL), {{the station}} is at {{capacity}} {{because of the large}} number of passengers leaving and entering the station, as well as the large numbers of passengers changing between lines. Currently, everyone who uses the station has <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> the intermediate concourse {{at the bottom of the}} main escalators. This causes congestion and delays.|$|E
5|$|August 23, 2000– The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} Hurricane Debby <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> the Florida Keys as a Category 2 hurricane, {{with one}} computer model predicting a Category4 hurricane in the area. This results in officials declaring a mandatory evacuation for all non-residents in the keys, causing a significant loss of tourism revenue for Monroe County. Debby dissipates {{before hitting the}} area, though its remnants produce heavy rainfall across southern Florida.|$|E

5|$|CMVs are {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> weigh stations at {{the borders of}} most states and some large cities. These weigh stations are run by state DOTs, and CMV weight and size enforcement is overseen by the FHWA. Weigh stations check each vehicle's gross weight and axle weight using a set of in-ground truck scales, and are usually where a truck's compliance with the formula is checked.|$|E
5|$|Capesize {{ships are}} {{too large to}} {{traverse}} the Panama canal and must round Cape Horn to travel between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Earlier, capesize ships could not traverse the Suez and needed {{to go around the}} Cape of Good Hope. Recent deepening of the Suez canal to 66ft (20m) permits most capesize ships <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Early in its life, Debby was {{forecast}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> {{the southern}} Cape Verde islands as a tropical storm, potentially causing life-threatening flooding. Most computer models consistently predicted Debby to track {{to the northwest}} throughout its lifetime, though intensity was more problematic for forecasters. The National Hurricane Center continually predicted Debby to intensify to hurricane status, though strong vertical shear ultimately prevented the storm from becoming a hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly {{comparable to those}} found in neutron stars – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> it with no resistance.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Greenwood Lake, NY17A climbs {{once again}} to cross another ridge before {{descending}} and expanding to a four-lane with median strip <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> Sterling Forest and reach its eastern terminus at NY17 in Southfields. The highway continues as County Route106 (CR106) in Orange and Rockland counties east to that route's eastern terminus at U.S. Route9W (US9W) and US202 in Stony Point. CR106 was once part of NY210 before it was truncated to NY17A in Greenwood Lake.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes in the Dublin Journal. However, this edition led to controversy, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had publication rights, under English copyright law, {{to many of}} the works included in Faulkner's edition. The English, in 1735, attempted to pass a law that would allow a copyright holder to prohibit works that may violate their copyright, but this law failed <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Proteins can be informally {{divided into}} three main classes, which {{correlate}} with typical tertiary structures: globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and membrane proteins. Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes. Fibrous proteins are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails. Membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Spores of S.thiersii {{are white}} and roughly spherical. They measure {{approximately}} 7.8 – 9.8 by 7.3 – 9.0µm and are amyloid. In an analysis, both monokaryotic (one nucleus per cell) and dikaryotic (two nuclei per cell) strains were isolated from fruit bodies. All the spores {{were found to}} be binucleate but the researchers believed that in the monokaryotic strain, the second nucleus had failed <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> the germ tube.|$|E

5|$|The deputies {{turned their}} {{attention}} to Cripple Creek itself. They arrested and imprisoned hundreds of citizens without cause. Many inhabitants of the town were seized on the street or pulled from their homes, then clubbed, kicked or beaten.
