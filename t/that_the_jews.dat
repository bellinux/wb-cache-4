5|$|Goebbels had {{frequent}} {{discussions with}} Hitler {{about the fate}} of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met.

5|$|The war {{was still}} ongoing, and since {{transporting}} masses of {{people into a}} combat zone was impossible, Heydrich decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> currently living in the General Government (the German-occupied area of Poland) would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland, as would Jews {{from the rest of}} Europe.|$|E

5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that, not only were conditions in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> were being singled out for extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape and hide {{in order to survive}} the war. Many Polish Gentiles concealed hundreds of thousands of their Jewish neighbors. Many of these efforts arose spontaneously from individual initiatives, but there were also organized networks dedicated to aiding the Jews.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time rebellions began in Roman Syria and Palaestina Prima in the wake of Heraclius' revolt. In 609 or 610 the Patriarch of Antioch, Anastasius II, died. Many sources claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> were {{involved}} in the fighting, though it is unclear where they were members of factions and where they were opponents of Christians. Phocas responded by appointing Bonus as comes Orientis (Count of the East) to stop the violence. Bonus punished the Greens, a horse racing party, in Antioch for their role in the violence in 609.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new plan for the {{elimination}} of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E

5|$|It {{became clear}} that Auschwitz was not a normal {{internment}} camp with above-average SS rations, but that it served an additional function.

5|$|The Bible {{may contain}} an early account of rhabdomyolysis. In , the Pentateuch says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> demanded meat while {{traveling}} in the desert; God sent quail {{in response to the}} complaints, and people ate large quantities of quail meat. A plague then broke out, killing numerous people. Rhabdomyolysis after consuming quail was described in more recent times and called coturnism (after Coturnix, the main quail genus). Migrating quail consume large amounts of hemlock, a known cause of rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E

5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E
5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that {{the removal of the}} screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann stated at {{his later}} interrogations that Heydrich told him in mid-September that Hitler had ordered that all Jews in German-controlled Europe {{were to be}} killed.

However, with the entry of the United States into the war in December and the German failure in the Battle of Moscow, Hitler decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Around this time, Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel), the highest rank he achieved.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his rhetoric}} Hitler fed {{on the old}} {{accusation}} of Jewish deicide. It has been speculated that Christian anti-Judaism influenced Hitler's ideas, especially such works as Martin Luther's essay On <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> and Their Lies and the writings of Paul de Lagarde. Others disagree with this view. Hitler biographer John Toland offers <b>the</b> opinion <b>that</b> Hitler [...] "carried within him its teaching <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> was <b>the</b> killer of God. The extermination, therefore, could be done without a twinge of conscience since he was merely acting as the avenging hand of God...". Toland wrote that in 1941 Hitler was still [...] "a member in good standing of the Church of Rome despite his detestation of its hierarchy" [...] and" [...] he carried within himself its teaching <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> was <b>the</b> killer of God.

5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics required him to do so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> be fined one billion marks.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem was an {{important}} city of the Byzantine province of Palestina Prima. Just 23 {{years prior to the}} Muslim conquest, in 614, it fell to an invading Sassanid army under Shahrbaraz during the last of the Byzantine-Sassanid Wars. The Persians looted the city, and are said to have massacred its 90,000 Christian inhabitants. As part of the looting, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was destroyed and the True Cross captured and taken to Ctesiphon as a battle-captured holy relic. The Cross was later returned to Jerusalem by Emperor Heraclius after his final victory against the Persians in 628. It was believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews,</b> who were persecuted in their Roman-controlled homeland, had aided the Persians.|$|E
5|$|Khubeza, a {{local variety}} of the mallow plant, became an {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites {{went out to the}} fields to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.|$|E

The loss of these relics was thought by many Christian Byzantines to be a clear mark of divine displeasure. Some blamed the Jews for this misfortune and {{for the loss of}} Syria in general. There were reports that Jews helped the Persians capture certain cities and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> tried to slaughter Christians in cities that the Persians had already conquered but were found and foiled from doing so.

5|$|In {{the city}} of Trieste, then subject to Austrian rule, the Jewish {{community}} saw positive change under Maria Theresa's rule. On 19 April 1771, Maria Theresa granted two Sovereign Licenses to the Jews of Trieste, licenses that constitute real regulations. In 1782, with the famous Edict of Tolerance, her son Joseph II admitted the Jews to some charges in the Stock Exchange and to other liberal professions. A year later the Jewish primary school was opened {{with the name of}} Scuole Pie Normali Israelitiche. The following year, in 1784, the gates of the Ghetto were opened so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Trieste could live together with their fellow citizens of different religions; however most of them continued to live in the Ghetto. Maria Theresa's influence and personal prejudices were limited by the 1780s, and the Jews of Trieste lived in relative peace until the beginning of French rule in the region.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere {{around the}} time of the failed {{offensive}} against Moscow in December 1941, Hitler resolved <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Europe were to be exterminated immediately. Plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalised at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942. Some would be worked to death and the rest would be killed in the implementation of Die Endlösung der Judenfrage (the Final Solution of the Jewish question). Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or by Einsatzgruppen firing squads, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. By 1941, killing centres at Auschwitz concentration camp, Sobibor, Treblinka and other Nazi extermination camps replaced Einsatzgruppen as the primary method of mass killing. The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people, including over a million children. Twelve million people were put into forced labour.|$|E
