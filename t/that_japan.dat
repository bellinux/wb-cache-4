5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} and early historical accounts suggest <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> was originally an animistic culture, which viewed {{the world as}} infused with kami (神) or sacred presence as taught by Shinto, {{though it is not}} a philosophy as such, but has greatly influenced all other philosophies in their Japanese interpretations.|$|E
5|$|Project Alberta {{still had}} three test assemblies, F101, F102 and F103, but the damaged F32 was unserviceable, so new {{explosive}} blocks {{would have to}} be flown in from Project Camel. There were also shortages of some components, notably detonator chimneys. These were fabricated on Tinian. Seven B-29s of the 509th Composite Group flew Pumpkin bomb missions on 14 August. Word <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> had surrendered reached Tinian the following day.|$|E

5|$|The Alaskas were officially {{funded in}} September 1940 {{along with a}} plethora of other ships {{as a part of}} the Two-Ocean Navy Act. Their role had been altered slightly: in {{addition}} to their surface-to-surface role, they were planned to protect carrier groups. Because of their bigger guns, greater size and increased speed, they would be more valuable in this role than heavy cruisers, and would provide insurance against reports <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> was building super cruisers more powerful than U.S. heavy cruisers.|$|E
5|$|With {{their victory}} in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, the Japanese became {{concerned}} {{about the potential for}} conflict with the US. The theorist Satō Tetsutarō developed the doctrine <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> should have a battlefleet at least 70% the size of that of the US. This would enable the Japanese navy to win two decisive battles, the first early in a war against the US Pacific Fleet, and the second against the US Atlantic Fleet which would inevitably be dispatched as reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Indies in early 1942, Oerip {{was held in}} a mixed prisoner of war camp in Cimahi. Upon his release {{three and a half}} months later, Oerip refused an offer to form a new, Japanese-backed police force and returned to KEM, where he and his wife rented paddy fields to grow rice while continuing to operate their flower garden. To protect their land, they surrounded their property and home with a high bamboo fence. Although no longer active in the military, Oerip occasionally received former KNIL members, including Abdul Haris Nasution and Sunarmo, who brought news of events outside the village. The couple continued their work, harassed and surveilled by the Japanese and pro-Japanese Indonesians, until the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945 signified <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> would soon withdraw. It was during this period that Oerip began having heart problems.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack as the RAAF lacked modern {{aircraft}} and the RAN was too small and unbalanced to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. Additionally, the Army, although large, contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response to this threat most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Government appealed to the United States for assistance. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to Burma while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{represented}} {{a huge number}} of available aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) was still recovering from losses suffered at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June. While units were largely reconstituted in terms of quantity by this time, pilot quality was in clear decline. Moreover, though the overall number of planes committed to battle by 12October dwarfed any force <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> had previously fielded in the air, the U.S. Navy's Fast Carrier Force was capable of committing a much larger, significantly better-trained force.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{tentative}} {{plans for}} a joint German-Japanese approach against the USSR were hinted on in the 1936 Anti-Comintern Pact, the years 1938 and 1939 were already decisive for Japan's decision to not expand northward (i.e., against the USSR) but to the south. The Empire decisively lost two border fights against the Soviets, the Battles of Lake Khasan and Khalkin Gol, thereby convincing itself that the Imperial Japanese Army, lacking heavy tanks and the like, would be {{in no position to}} challenge the Red Army at that time. Nevertheless, Hitler's anti-Soviet sentiment soon led to further rapprochements with Japan, since he still believed <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> would join Germany in a future war against the Soviet Union, either actively by invading southeast Siberia, or passively by binding large parts of the Red Army, which was fearing an attack of Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchukuo, numbering ca. 700,000 men as of the late 1930s.|$|E

5|$|In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces {{won their}} first major victory at Taierzhuang {{but then the}} city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May. In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by {{flooding}} the Yellow River; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan, but the city was taken by October. Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> had hoped to achieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{perceptions}} of the Hinomaru exist in former colonies of Japan as well as within Japan itself, such as in Okinawa. In one notable example of this, on October 26, 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner burned the Hinomaru {{before the start of}} the National Sports Festival of Japan. The flag burner, Shōichi Chibana, burned the Hinomaru not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the Japanese army and the continued presence of U.S. forces, but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of Kimigayo. In the capital city of Naha, Okinawa, the Hinomaru was raised for the first time since the return of Okinawa to Japan to celebrate the city's 80th anniversary in 2001. In the People's Republic of China and South Korea, both of which had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, the 1999 formal adoption of the Hinomaru was met with reactions of Japan moving towards the right and also a step towards re-militarization. The passage of the 1999 law also coincided with the debates about the status of the Yasukuni Shrine, US-Japan military cooperation and the creation of a missile defense program. In other nations <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> occupied, the 1999 law was met with mixed reactions or glossed over. In Singapore, the older generation still harbors ill feelings toward the flag while the younger generation does not hold similar views. The Philippines government not only believed <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> was not going to revert to militarism, but the goal of the 1999 law was to formally establish two symbols (the flag and anthem) in law and every state has a right to create national symbols. Japan has no law criminalizing the burning of the Hinomaru, but foreign flags cannot be burned in Japan. Some people have humorously drawn an analogy between the Japanese flag and the appearance of a menstruation stain on a white bedsheet.|$|E
5|$|Second, it {{was then}} <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> {{underwent}} a period of intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, {{it was not until}} after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.|$|E
30|$|In Table  3, {{the average}} {{value-added}} ratio {{to the total}} product is 0.304 for China-JS. The ratio is almost {{the same as that}} of China-NJS, 0.323, and differs from <b>that</b> of <b>Japan,</b> 0.511. It seems a bit curious in the sense that the technology adopted in China-JS is not similar to <b>that</b> of <b>Japan.</b> However, the average ratio within manufacturing sectors is 0.291 for China-JS, which is larger than that of China-NJS, 0.209, and is similar to <b>that</b> of <b>Japan,</b> 0.315. This happens because the share of the tertiary sector, which usually has a high value-added ratio, is not so large as that in China-NJS.|$|R

5|$|The Rhodesian African Rifles {{were based}} at Borrowdale in {{north-east}} Salisbury between 1940 and 1943. Apart from a contingent sent south to Durban to guard Italian prisoners {{on their way}} to Rhodesia, the regiment's main role was garrison duties within the colony. The Rhodesian Air Askari Corps, a unit of black volunteer troops under white command, guarded the air bases and also provided manpower for non-armed labour. The perceived possibility <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> might attempt an invasion of southern Africa via Madagascar led to the consolidation of a few hundred rural whites into the Southern Rhodesia Commando, a part-time cadre intended as the basis for a guerrilla-style resistance movement, from 1942.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{is governed by}} the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises. The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II. Japan Business Federation has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} September 1941, Sorge {{transmitted}} information <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> would not initiate hostilities against the USSR in the East, thereby freeing Red Army divisions stationed in Siberia for the defence of Moscow. In October 1941 Sorge was unmasked and arrested by the Japanese. Apparently, he was entirely trusted by the German ambassador Eugen Ott, and was allowed access to top secret cables from Berlin in the embassy in Tokyo. Eventually, this involvement would lead to Heinrich Georg Stahmer replacing Ott in January 1943. Sorge {{on the other hand}} would be executed in November 1944 and elevated to a national hero in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|From the company's inception, Takahashi and Sugiura {{wanted to}} give {{creative}} freedom to pursue projects outside genre standards, in addition to hiring young staff. An early aim was to encourage younger developers to make their mark in the industry, {{which at the time}} was dominated by people in the late 30s and up. This outlook was the reason why the Xenosaga series was provided to a younger group of developers. Kojima stated that younger developers were preferred as they could bring interesting ideas to a project. According to Sugiura, a major element during the period in which Monolith Soft was under Namco was the focus on creativity. They wanted to balance this with the financial logistics of game design rather than having budgetary concerns stifle the creative flare of the staff. When talking about their Wii U projects in 2012, Monolith Soft staff member Michihiko Inaba stated that the company wanted to show <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> could keep up with the Western market in terms of ambitious games that pushed forward the industry, comparing Monolith Soft to Bethesda Softworks in this desire.|$|E
5|$|In September 1931, Japanese army units {{invaded the}} Chinese {{province}} of Manchuria, transforming {{it into the}} puppet state of Manchukuo. In December 1932, Hiei was reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy's training squadron. On 25 February, the League of Nations ruled <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> had violated Chinese sovereignty and international law in her invasion of Manchuria. Refusing to accept the League's judgment, the Empire of Japan withdrew from the League the same day. This also signaled its exit from the Washington and London Naval Treaties, which removed all restrictions on the Imperial Japanese Navy's construction of capital ships. From the end of May 1933 to 13 August, Hiei received upgrades that allowed her to perform regular duties for the Emperor, and she served as the Emperor's observation ship for the Imperial Naval Review three days later. From January to March 1934, her No. 4 turret and ammunition magazine were refitted. In November 1935, Hiei served as the Emperor's ship for his official visit to the Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures.|$|E

The {{government}} fears that if they converge on a single state, they could win a seat in the United States Senate. Garcian travels to Coburn Elementary School near Seattle, Washington and discovers tapes that reveal the school as a front for the UN Party to train children as assassins. The tapes focus on Emir Parkreiner, a gifted killer trained at the school. Garcian learns <b>that</b> <b>Japan</b> uses Coburn to control the vote of the US presidential election. The assassins battle a group of invincible Smiles and all but Garcian are incapacitated. Garcian travels to the Union Hotel where he witnesses visions of the other members being killed in their rooms. At the top, he discovers that his true identity is Emir Parkreiner, the one who killed the killer7 at the Union Hotel over 50 years ago. Following that incident, Harman absorbed Emir as a persona and Emir's memories were lost.|$|E
