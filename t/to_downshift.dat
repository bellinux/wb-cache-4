Laboratory tests {{were carried out}} at the Tainan Hydraulics Laboratory of the National Cheng Kung University of Taiwan, where a special setup aimed at accelerating/decelerating currents was designed, constructed and employed. In the case of accelerating adverse currents, the wave behaviour is strongly nonlinear and leads <b>to</b> <b>downshifting</b> of the wave energy which allows the waves to penetrate the blocking current. For the case of decelerating currents, linear behaviour should lead to amplification of wave amplitude and increase in steepness, which is indeed observed, but downshifting also happens if the initial waves are steep enough.

40|$|Many {{molecular}} glass forming liquids show a {{shift of}} the glass transition T-g to lower temperatures when the liquid is confined into mesoporous host matrices. Two contrary explanations for this effect are given in literature: First, confinement induced acceleration {{of the dynamics of}} the molecules leads <b>to</b> an effective <b>downshift</b> of T-g increasing with decreasing pore size. Second, due to thermal mismatch between the liquid and the surrounding host matrix, negative pressure develops inside the pores with decreasing temperature, which also shifts T-g to lower temperatures. Here we present dynamic mechanical analysis measurements of the glass forming liquid salol in Vycor and Gelsil with pore sizes of d= 2. 6, 5. 0 and 7. 5 nm. The dynamic complex elastic susceptibility data can be consistently described with the assumption of two relaxation processes inside the pores: A surface induced slowed down relaxation due to interaction with rough pore interfaces and a second relaxation within the core of the pores. This core relaxation time is reduced with decreasing pore size d, leading <b>to</b> a <b>downshift</b> of T-g proportional to 1 /d in perfect agreement with recent differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Thermal expansion measurements of empty and salol filled mesoporous samples revealed that the contribution of negative pressure <b>to</b> the <b>downshift</b> of T-g is small (< 30 %) and the main effect is due to the suppression of dynamically correlated regions of size xi when the pore size xi approaches...|$|R

This provides maximum braking and optimal engine speed for exiting the corner while causing the least wear of the entire drive train. While this is not double clutching in the conventional sense, the term is used to describe this technique since the clutch pedal is pressed more than once.

40|$|Inorganic {{polyphosphate}} (polyP) kinase was {{studied for}} its roles in physiological responses to nutritional deprivation in Escherichia coli. A mutant lacking polyP kinase exhibited an extended lag phase of growth, when shifted from a rich to a minimal medium (nutritional downshift). Supplementation of amino acids to the minimal medium abolished the extended growth lag of the mutant. Levels of the stringent response factor, guanosine 5 ′-diphosphate 3 ′-diphosphate, increased in response <b>to</b> the nutritional <b>downshift,</b> but, {{unlike in the}} wild type, the levels were sustained in the mutant. These results suggested that the mutant was impaired in the induction of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes. The expression of an amino acid biosynthetic gene, hisG, was examined by using a transcriptional lacZ fusion. Although the mutant did not express the fusion in response <b>to</b> the nutritional <b>downshift,</b> Northern blot analysis revealed a significant increase of hisG-lacZ mRNA. Amino acids generated by intracellular protein degradation are {{very important for the}} synthesis of enzymes at the onset of starvation. In the wild type, the rate of protein degradation increased in response <b>to</b> the nutritional <b>downshift</b> whereas it did not in the mutant. Supplementation of amino acids at low concentrations to the minimal medium enabled the mutant to express the hisG-lacZ fusion.

40|$|Large Stokes shift {{downshifting}} organolanthanide complex, Eu(tta) (3) phen, {{is examined}} {{for inclusion in}} polymeric layers to replace the UV blocking layer in {{dye sensitized solar cell}} (DSSC) technology. The UV blocking layer increases stability but power conversion efficiency decreases as incident UV photons are not converted into photocurrent. Eu(tta) 3 phen doped polymeric film are prepared and attached to DSSC devices following optimized thickness and concentration from a ray-trace numerical model for the specific DSSC. External quantum efficiency is significantly increased in the UV spectral region compared to DSSCs utilizing a passive, non-luminescent, UV-BL. High Eu(tta) (3) phen film transparency in the visible range minimizes DSSC EQE losses at visible wavelengths. Short-circuit current (I-sc) enhancement due <b>to</b> <b>downshifting</b> is demonstrated (similar to 1 %) in small-scale DSSC prototypes, where the specific geometry limits the photon collection efficiency and overall enhancement. Model predictions indicate that 2 %- 3 % I-sc enhancement is realizable in flexible single DSSC compared to, non-luminescent, UV-BL. Added to this, in outdoor conditions taking into account diffuse light, the increment in Isc can increase 50 % more. Although photostability of the blended LSS-DS polymer films is not sufficient to be useful for medium-long term outdoor PV applications, the results demonstrate that significant efficiency enhancement can be realized.

5000|$|The {{shift pattern}} for most underbone or {{miniature}} motorcycles {{with an automatic}} centrifugal clutch is also modified for two key reasons—to enable the less-experienced riders to shift the gears without problems of [...] "finding" [...] neutral, and also due to the greater force needed to [...] "lift" [...] the gearshift lever (because the gearshift pedal of an underbone motorcycle also operates the clutch). The gearshift lever of an underbone has two ends. The rider clicks down the front end with the left toe {{all the way to}} the top gear and clicks down the rear end with the heel all the way down to neutral, while miniatures still retain a single-end lever, with the rider clicks down to upshift and lift the lever up <b>to</b> <b>downshift</b> (or vice versa). Some underbone models such as the Honda Wave have a [...] "rotary" [...] shift pattern, which means that the rider can shift directly to neutral from the top gear, but for safety reasons this is only possible when the motorcycle is stationary.
