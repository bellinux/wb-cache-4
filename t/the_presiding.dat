5|$|After each {{election}} to the Scottish Parliament, {{at the beginning of}} each parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer, the equivalent of the speaker in other legislatures, and two MSPs to serve as deputies. <b>The</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer (currently Ken Macintosh) and deputies (currently Linda Fabiani and Christine Grahame) are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of <b>the</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. When chairing meetings of the Parliament, <b>the</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial. During debates, <b>the</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of <b>the</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, <b>the</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer is {{responsible}} for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate. Convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber, is another of the roles of <b>the</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer. Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of <b>the</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer and one representative from each political party with five or more seats in the Parliament. Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber, establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the Parliament. <b>The</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer (or Deputy Presiding Officer) decides {{who speaks}} in chamber debates {{and the amount}} of time for which they are allowed to speak. Normally, <b>the</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer tries to achieve a balance between {{different}} viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. <b>The</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of <b>the</b> <b>Presiding</b> Officer. The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.|$|E
50|$|From {{the void}} {{that was the}} rest of the universe, the first god, Ometeotl, created itself.

5|$|Since the Romans used a form {{of direct}} democracy, citizens, and not elected representatives, voted before each {{assembly}}. As such, the citizen-electors had no power, other than to cast a vote. Each assembly was presided over by a single Roman Magistrate, and as such, it was <b>the</b> <b>presiding</b> magistrate who made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>presiding</b> magistrate's power over the assembly was nearly absolute. The only check on that power {{came in the form}} of vetoes handed down by other magistrates.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to another}} version of the myth, Quetzalcoatl {{is one of the}} four sons of Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, the four Tezcatlipocas, each of whom presides over one of the four {{cardinal}} directions. [...] Over <b>the</b> West <b>presides</b> <b>the</b> White Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcoatl, the god of light, justice, mercy and wind. Over <b>the</b> South <b>presides</b> <b>the</b> Blue Tezcatlipoca, Huitzilopochtli, the god of war.

And over <b>the</b> North <b>presides</b> <b>the</b> Black Tezcatlipoca, known by no other name than Tezcatlipoca, the god of judgment, night, deceit, sorcery and the Earth. Quetzalcoatl was often considered the god of the morning star, and his twin brother Xolotl was the evening star (Venus). As the morning star, he was known by the title Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, meaning [...] "lord of the star of the dawn." [...] He was known as the inventor of books and the calendar, the giver of maize (corn) to mankind, and sometimes as a symbol of death and resurrection. Quetzalcoatl was also the patron of the priests and the title of the twin Aztec high priests. Some legends describe him as opposed to human sacrifice while others describe him practicing it.|$|R

5|$|In Roman {{constitutional}} law, the assemblies are {{a sovereign}} authority, {{with the power}} to enact or reject any law, confer any magistracies, and make any decision. In fact, with a single law, they held the authority to override the norms and precedents of the Republic as well as ancient laws long unchanged. There are two necessary components to any assembly: (1) the convening magistrate and (2) the citizens in the assembly itself. Assemblies did not participate or discuss matters laid before them, they heard the speakers put forth by <b>the</b> <b>presiding</b> officer. And after such discussion, <b>the</b> <b>presiding</b> officer could call for a direct up or down vote. Without a magistrate, there would be nobody to legally call upon the assembly; and without the citizens, there is naught but a magistrate.|$|E
