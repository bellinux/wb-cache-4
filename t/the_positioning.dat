5|$|Frogs and {{all other}} living {{tetrapods}} have a rod-like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum —or homologous tympanum— to the inner ear. Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity.

Some temnospondyls, such as Cryobatrachus and Kryostega, even inhabited Antarctica, which was covered in temperate forests at the time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Position-based routing {{protocols}} make routing {{decisions based on}} <b>the</b> geographical <b>position</b> of <b>the</b> destination of a packet. Such protocols scale well since they do not require nodes to maintain explicit routes. Instead each node must know only its own <b>position,</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of its neighbors, and <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of <b>the</b> destination. Thus, {{a critical component of}} position-based {{routing protocols}} is <b>the</b> <b>position</b> service that allows nodes to obtain <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of a destination node. In this paper we analyze the security vulnerabilities of positionbased routing protocols and virtual home region (VHR) -based distributed position service systems. We propose methods to protect <b>the</b> <b>position</b> information from both external and internal attackers. We then discuss and propose several mitigation mechanisms against position abuse by internal attackers that exploit <b>the</b> <b>position</b> service to trace their targets. Finally, we propose a position verification mechanism that allows <b>the</b> <b>position</b> service to verify that <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> reported by nodes are correct. I...|$|R

Near the 5th-magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy, NGC 6051, is a radio galaxy that is probably responsible for this enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD radio galaxy, 3C 317. This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago. The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.|$|E

5|$|Choice is a {{significant}} aspect of the game, requiring a non-linear design to accommodate the customized characters. Level design began {{with a list of}} factors such as Disciplines, stealth and feats. Each area had to be viable for a shooting character (sufficient ammunition), a discipline-focused character (sufficient blood sources to keep the powers fueled) and a melee specialist (to reach enemies without being killed), with stealth options and option combinations. Level design began with a focus on stealth, taking into consideration <b>the</b> <b>positioning</b> of guards and the character's potential stealth capability at that point in the game. Then direct, combat-heavy and dialog paths were added. The amusement arcade area was to feature playable versions of Activision arcade games such as Pitfall!, though the idea was abandoned due to time constraints.|$|E

For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him.
