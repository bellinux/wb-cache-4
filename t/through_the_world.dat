5|$|Muller was a {{prolific}} writer. Over {{the course of}} his life he published well over two hundred articles, brochures, and books about his travels <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> about South Africa and the Boers, and about Dutch foreign policy and diplomacy, apart from a range of other subjects. Muller gathered a large fortune with well appointed private investments. He bequeathed his considerable wealth to a private fund in support of academic research and cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|As they progress, players gain {{experience}} points through defeating {{enemies and}} completing quests for non-player characters (NPCs) scattered around environments: these raise a character's experience level, which grant access to fresh skills and points {{that can be}} used to upgrade character attributes such as health and energy levels, dexterity, intelligence, or strength. If the player dies, they respawn at rebirth fountains scattered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> although they lose some accumulated experience points. Quests are divided into Main Quests related to the central narrative, and side quests unique to particular areas of the world. Other NPCs can be found in towns and cities that act as Merchants selling equipment and items: these can be both bought and sold. Player characters have multiple equipment slots, which can take armor for limbs and torso, weapons or shields, and accessories that grant passive boons.|$|E
5|$|Data {{for most}} of the storms were {{provided}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Wide Consolidated Tropical Cyclone data file known as TD-9636. The document utilized several sources to indicate where storms were located, and as a result there were duplications. During the season, the Philippine Weather Bureau issued monthly bulletins, which later provided info for tropical cyclone tracks. The agency used weather stations that were established by Spain and the United States after each country ruled over the archipelago. The weather data ceased in August 1940, which were later rebuilt in 1945. Also in 1940, meteorology records were disrupted in Hong Kong, which were later restored in 1947, due to World War II.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Luka Rijeka d.d., {{operator}} of the Port of Rijeka, {{signed a contract}} of strategic partnership with the ICTSI and Jadranska vrata d.d.. The partnership aims to expand {{the capacity of the}} container terminal to 600,000 TEUs. The contract also stipulates that the concession regarding operation of the terminal is to last for 30 years with an investment of 54 million euro. It is estimated that ICTSI and Luka Rijeka d.d. will invest up to one billion kuna (135million euro) in the Port of Rijeka. Upgrades of other port terminals are also planned, with investments <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Bank and through build-operate-transfer and public–private partnership schemes. They include cargo terminals in the city of Rijeka and the new passenger terminal opened in October 2009.|$|E
5|$|Merrick {{concluded}} that his only {{escape from the}} workhouse might be <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of human novelty exhibitions. He knew of a Leicester music hall comedian and proprietor named Sam Torr. Merrick wrote to Torr, who came and visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided {{that he could make}} money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, {{he would have to be}} a travelling exhibit. To this end, he organised a group of managers for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.|$|E
5|$|Spindizzy is {{an action}} and puzzle game played from an {{isometric}} perspective. Players can view {{the playing field}} from four angles, and rotate between them. The game {{takes place in a}} fictional landscape of interconnected stages suspended in a dimensional space. The player controls a probe called a Gyroscopic Environmental Reconnaissance And Land-Mapping Device (GERALD), via keyboard commands or a joystick. The craft is able to transform—and modify its mobility as a result—between three configurations: a ball, an inverted square pyramid, and a gyroscope. Players navigate the probe through the stages to explore the world within a time limit. The time limit can be extended by collecting power jewels scattered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and is decreased by falling off a stage. Stages feature ramps, corridors, and other obstacles that hinder the player from quickly traversing them. The game ends when time expires or the world is completely explored.|$|E

5|$|The protagonist, Samus Aran, {{must travel}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of Tallon IV searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that {{will open the}} path to the Phazon meteor impact crater, while {{collecting}} power-ups that enable the player to reach previously inaccessible areas. The Varia Suit, for example, protects Samus' armor against dangerously high temperatures, allowing her to enter volcanic regions. Some of the items are obtained after boss and mini-boss fights, which are encountered in all regions except Magmoor Caverns. Items must be collected in a specific order so that the player may progress. For example, players cannot access certain areas until they find a certain Beam to open doors, or discover new ordnance with which to beat bosses. Like the rest of the series, players are incentivized to explore the open world to find upgrades such as ammunition packs and extra health.|$|E
5|$|The tower's {{electrical}} service was supplied by Consolidated Edison (ConEd) at 13,800volts. The electricity passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center Primary Distribution Center (PDC), and was then sent up the building's core to electrical substations {{located on the}} mechanical floors. The substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277volts, and the voltage was then further lowered to 208/120volts for general power and lighting services. The complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and {{on the roof of}} Five World Trade Center.|$|E
5|$|Across the {{affected}} areas, the Red Cross spent about $247,000 to provide food and blankets. In {{the weeks and}} months following the flooding, various international groups provided aid totaling nearly $11million. The United States donated $622,732 worth of assistance, mainly to help with logistical work and relief efforts. The United States military also worked to purify drinking water in Honduras. Canada donated $412,201 worth of assistance, including providing shelter in Honduras and rebuilding schools. The country of Brazil donated about $1.68million worth of food. The Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department of the European Commission provided nearly $2.2million for relief efforts. Other European country donations included nearly $500,000 from Ireland for hygiene and food supplies, $675,675 from the Netherlands for general relief efforts, $154,570 from Spain <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Food Programme, $159,559 from Germany for shelters, and $892,468 from Sweden. Several Asian countries donated to the relief efforts, including $123,810 from Japan to Honduras to purchase emergency goods, $22,000 from South Korea, and $10,000 from Singapore to Honduras. Non-governmental organizations and other groups providing aid included $1.5million from the Central Emergency Response Fund, $300,000 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, $120,000 from Catholic Relief Services, and $289,000 from ACT Alliance.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy Xs {{development}} {{began in}} 1999, costing approximately ¥4 billion (approximately US$32.3 million) {{with a crew}} of over 100 people, most of whom worked on previous games in the series. Executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that although he had concerns about the transition from 2D to 3D backgrounds, the voice acting, and the transition to real-time story-telling, {{the success of the}} Final Fantasy series can be attributed to constantly challenging the development team to try new things. Producer Yoshinori Kitase was also the chief director of Final Fantasy X, while the direction of events, maps and battles was split up between Motomu Toriyama, Takayoshi Nakazato and Toshiro Tsuchida, respectively. The development of the script for the game took three to four months, with {{the same amount of time}} dedicated to the voice recording afterwards. Kazushige Nojima collaborated with Daisuke Watanabe, Toriyama and Kitase on writing the scenario for Final Fantasy X. Nojima was particularly concerned with establishing a connection in the relationship between player and main character. Thus, he penned the story such that the player's progress <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and growing knowledge about it is reflected in Tidus' own understanding and narration.|$|E
5|$|On 2November, the Canadian International Development Agency contributed C$150,000 (US$203,964) to the International Federation of the Red Cross {{to aid the}} {{recovery}} effort; Canada eventually doubled their contributions through the Canadian Lutheran World Relief and CARE. The European Commission channeled €2million (US$2.1million) through the European Community Humanitarian Office for use by various relief organizations. Contributions to aid agencies were also made by the British Department for International Development (DFID), with initial contributions made to Christian Aid and CARE totaling £330,000 (US$540,837). DFID's initial emergency assistance was later increased to £3million (US$4.9million) and supplemented by a £25million ($40.9million) contribution {{over the course of}} six months. The Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit allocated CHF 800,000 (US$779,666) to five Swiss relief organizations operating in India. Food aid worth A$300,000 (US$191,700) was sent by the Australian Government and delivered to approximately 1million people <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Food Program. Other countries sent aid through their respective International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies branch. Following an initial disaster declaration by United States Ambassador to India Dick Celeste, the United States Agency for International Development contributed US$7,482,000 through Food for Peace and the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance to complement recovery efforts. The United Nations Children's Fund allocated more than US$100,000to help supply basic health and shelter needs, while the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs made a similar allocation through an emergency grant and with reserves from an earlier grant from Norway.|$|E
