5|$|According to Graham Spinardi in {{his book}} From Polaris to Trident (1994), STRAT-X was a {{response}} by the U.S. Department of Defense's Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Lloyd Wilson, to the U.S. Air Force; the service was demanding a large ICBM called the WS-120A. Spinardi suggests that STRAT-X was allowed to proceed so it could <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> study for such a missile. Funding for the WS-120A would not be released by Secretary McNamara, and plans for such a missile were canceled in 1967.|$|E
5|$|All this time, Bradbury {{remained}} nominally {{a professor}} in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed the University to <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> contract {{three months after the}} end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California.|$|E

5|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E
5|$|By then, SAS {{had taken}} sixteen {{aircraft}} out of service, reduced production with 12% and fired 1,000 employees. The airline {{stated that they}} wished to renegotiate the agreement with the Braathens family and KLM to reduce the price. Because there had arrisen a situation with high over-capacity of aircraft, the value of planes had fallen. In addition, SAS demanded that Braathens reduce its fleet from 33 to 23 aircraft if the deal was to go through, threatening to <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> purchase if the airline did not abide.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the strong}} win, bitter {{feelings}} at Johns Hopkins {{continued to grow}} into the next season. The school's attitude towards the series worsened {{to the point where}} the 1889 game was rescheduled away from the traditional Thanksgiving Day playing and was moved to a week earlier. That year's game ended in a 36–0 shutout victory for the Naval Academy, and wound up being the breaking point for Johns Hopkins. Hopkins decided to <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> series following that game. However, Hopkins' students returned to the Naval Academy the following year, yet again to root against Navy, this time supporting Lehigh.|$|E
5|$|HISD paid around $200,000 USD {{to lease}} the Las Américas units. In October 2006, Michael Marquez, {{president}} of the Hispanic Housing and Education Corporation, which operated Las Américas, announced to HISD in a letter that the organization would <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> lease agreement because of issues related to maintenance and management. The district decided to vacate the property instead of appealing the decision. In summer 2007, the former Las Américas Education Center closed. The early childhood center merged with Mistral and the middle schools moved to the Long Middle School campus.|$|E

In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010.

The Jewish leadership accepted the proposal, but the Arab Higher Committee rejected it; a civil war began immediately after the Resolution's adoption. The State of Israel was declared in May 1948.|$|E
5|$|The Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{estimated}} that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the existing fleet, and later implementing a successor program would cost $14–$21billion.

Following the President’s decision to <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded {{it would be more}} cost effective and less time consuming to continue with a variation of the existing VH-71 program.|$|E
