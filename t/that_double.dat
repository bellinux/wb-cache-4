5|$|Connectivity to the Game Boy Advance was {{discussed}} {{as an opportunity}} among the developers, but they eventually agreed <b>that</b> <b>Double</b> Dash!! was not suited to these connectivity ideas and decided to exclude it. It was desirable to narrow down {{the gap between the}} ability of veteran and novice players. Therefore, gameplay features like the ability to escape the banana were removed; the staff wanted both veteran and novice players to enjoy themselves.|$|E
5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant <b>that</b> <b>double</b> jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 2016, Nickelodeon {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Double</b> Dare {{would be}} returning to television for a half-hour commemorative special celebrating the 30th anniversary of the show's premiere. The Double Dare Reunion Special aired on November 23, 2016, on Nick at Nite, with a special encore airing on The Splat. The special included vintage clips, behind-the-scenes footage, and a new game recorded at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 played by cast members from All That. Marc Summers, announcer Harvey, and stage assistant Robin Russo (née Marrella) appeared in the special. The Double Dare Reunion Special was watched by 1.126 million viewers on Nick at Nite, outperforming all other shows on the network for the evening, and finishing as the third-most viewed of all non-sports original cable telecasts among viewers ages 18 to 34 for that day. In {{the first half of}} 2017, Marc Summers stated that due {{to the success of the}} special, he is in negotiations to return to Double Dare in some form with Nickelodeon, possibly in a version with adult contestants on Nick at Nite.|$|E

25|$|Cardenio – the {{original}} {{of a late}} play by Shakespeare and Fletcher, referred to in several documents, has not survived. It {{is believed to have}} re-worked a tale in Cervantes' Don Quixote. In 1727, Lewis Theobald produced a play he called Double Falshood, which he claimed to have adapted from three manuscripts of a lost play by Shakespeare that he did not name. Double Falshood does re-work the Cardenio story, and modern scholarship generally agrees <b>that</b> <b>Double</b> Falshood includes fragments of Shakespeare's lost play.|$|E
25|$|As {{time went}} on by, space {{constraints}} posed a growing concern. Catechism classes for children were conducted {{in places like the}} sacristy and kitchen, thereby impeding on the priests’ privacy and opportunity for interaction. Hence, the Church decided to build a new extension that would {{meet the needs of the}} growing community. Construction on the new 4 storey extension began in early 2003.

Titled My Alien Buddy, it built on their experience on augmented reality that they gained while making Double Fine Happy Action Theater and Kinect Party for Microsoft. The alien buddy is a deformable toy with which the player can interact. My Alien Buddy was released on December 24, 2013.|$|E

25|$|Single sided disks were {{coated on}} both sides, despite the {{availability}} of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was <b>that</b> <b>double</b> sided disks were certified error-free {{on both sides of}} the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|E
25|$|During {{the regular}} season on July 8, 2000, the Yankees {{defeated}} the Mets by identical 4-2 scores in both ends of an unusual day-night doubleheader. With the first game played at Shea Stadium and the nightcap at Yankee Stadium, {{it was the first}} time since 1903 that two teams played two games in different stadiums on the same day. Dwight Gooden won the first game with a six inning effort in his first start since returning to the Yankees. Roger Clemens won the nightcap. However, in the second game of <b>that</b> <b>double</b> header, an event occurred that made the rivalry between the two teams more contentious. Clemens hit Mets' star Mike Piazza in the helmet with an inside fastball, causing Piazza to suffer a concussion and placing him on the disabled list.|$|E
25|$|At the Limebank Quarry near Loerie, quarried {{limestone}} {{was crushed}} and loaded into buckets carried on an overhead ropeway from the quarry to bunkers at Loerie. In 1954, the cement company doubled its quarry output capacity when a second parallel ropeway {{was placed in}} service. A limitation in {{the capacity of the}} limestone trains throughout the steam haulage era was <b>that</b> <b>double</b> heading by Garratt locomotives was not permitted to protect their pivots from excessive stresses. It therefore became common practice to run heavier Garratt-headed trains of up to 14 wagons with a Class NG10 helper cut in to the train some eight to ten wagons back. From a passing loop at Summit, the Garratt would continue to Chelsea unassisted whilst the helper returned down the hill to Loerie.|$|E

25|$|Crick {{taught himself}} the {{mathematical}} theory of X-ray crystallography.

Linus Pauling {{was the first to}} identify the 3.6amino acids per helix turn ratio of the alpha helix. Crick was witness to the kinds of errors that his co-workers made in their failed attempts to make a correct molecular model of the alpha helix; these turned out to be important lessons that could be applied, in the future, to the helical structure of DNA. For example, he learned the importance of the structural rigidity <b>that</b> <b>double</b> bonds confer on molecular structures which is relevant both to peptide bonds in proteins and the structure of nucleotides in DNA.|$|E
25|$|There are {{approximately}} 400 entries for plants and non-botanical items. Of these, 150 plants are English natives. Some plant entries are mugwort, cypress, mandrake root, grapes, chamomile, muscat, and marrubium (horehound). Animals recommended for their medicinal value include hare, fox (fox grease {{is recommended for}} muscle cramps), goat, ox, elephant ivory, and beaver. Some of the minerals and liquids listed are lyme, glass, magnets, pearls, amber, sulpher, water, and vinegar. Foods <b>that</b> <b>double</b> as remedies are also present, with cheese prescribed for purgation, butter, honey, and zipules (a type of heavy fritter) recommended for toothaches. Some of the entries feature truly unusual remedies, such as a lengthy section {{on the use of}} mummy (spelled as mommie), the powdered version of which is described as a remedy for stopping nosebleeds. Besides medical uses, these entries also provide information on cosmetic applications of items, such as the bones of sepia (cuttlefish) for whitening the teeth and complexion.|$|E
