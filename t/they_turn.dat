5|$|American public {{education}} is operated {{by state and}} local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school {{from the age of}} six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh was banished by Sultan Abdülâziz a {{final time}} in 1868 to the Ottoman penal colony of `Akká, in present-day Israel. Towards {{the end of}} his life, the strict and harsh {{confinement}} was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akká, while still officially a prisoner of that city. He died there in 1892. Bahá'ís regard his resting place at Bahjí as the Qiblih to which <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> in prayer each day.|$|E
5|$|Brynn's sister Katharine Omdahl and {{brother-in-law}} Mike Wright {{raised the}} two Hartman children. Hartman's will stipulated that each child will receive their inheritance {{over several years}} after <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> 25. The total value of Hartman's estate was estimated at $1.23million. In accordance with Hartman's will, his body was cremated by Forest Lawn Memorial Park and Mortuary, Glendale, California, and his ashes were scattered over Santa Catalina Island's Emerald Bay.|$|E

5|$|Graendal's {{hiding place}} is {{traced to a}} remote palace. Confirming her presence, Rand uses the Choedan Kal, a {{powerful}} magical artifact, to eliminate the entire building with balefire, a magic that wipes the target from time. This horrifies Min and Nynaeve al'Meara and <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> to Cadsuane for help. Giving up on saving Arad Doman from the Seanchan and starvation, Rand returns {{to the city of}} Tear.|$|E
5|$|The {{caissons}} {{are required}} to turn with the wheel {{in order to remain}} level. Whilst the weight of the caissons on the bearings is generally sufficient to rotate them, a gearing mechanism using three large identically sized gears connected by two smaller ones ensures that <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> at precisely the correct speed and remain correctly balanced.|$|E
5|$|The figure {{eventually}} {{turns to}} {{its right to}} look at the hand. By this time, the leaves outside are still. The figure turns {{to look at the}} camera, now steady, again briefly, then back to its hand. After a series of jump cuts in which <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> rapidly {{back and forth between the}} two positions, the figure looks directly at the camera and points to it.|$|E
60|$|It {{was early}} {{next morning when}} they left the valley with an escort of twenty miners to help them across the divide, and Hetty stood by Ingleby's side when <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> for a moment to look back from among the {{climbing}} pines. Then, as <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> again, Ingleby met the girl's clear eyes.|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of worm depending on which direction <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> when encountering a new type of intersection. The different varieties of worm can be classified systematically by assigning every direction a number and listing the choice made every time a new type of intersection is encountered.|$|E
5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} {{is looking at}} the camera again with hands at its sides. After a few more jump cuts in which <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> to the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|All {{students}} {{have the right to}} enter upper secondary education when <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> sixteen. Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to this sort of education, a general program of study is available for those students who may fail to meet requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may need to turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} other majors, winning the Masters gives a golfer several {{privileges}} which make his career more secure. Masters champions are automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors (the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship) {{for the next five years}} (except for amateur winners, unless <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations to The Players Championship for five years.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Pierre Christin was {{dividing}} {{his time between}} Paris and Bordeaux, where {{he was working on}} founding the school of journalism at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie (IUT). Meeting up with Mézières one day, Christin suggested that they work on creating a comic strip together. Both had their experiences in the American West to draw upon but felt, thanks to Lucky Luke, Jerry Spring and Blueberry, that the market for Westerns was already crowded. Instead, Christin suggested that <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> their hands to science fiction, a genre that, at that time, was not prevalent in French comics. Although Goscinny was not a science fiction fan, he wanted to promote innovation and originality in Pilote and so commissioned them to produce a strip.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{contacted}} Beshear, {{asking for}} an executive order to protect clerks who have moral objections against personally issuing such marriage licenses, as Kentucky law requires county clerks to issue marriage licenses in their names. She began turning away gay couples from her county office who were seeking marriage licenses. David Ermold and David Moore, a same-sex couple from Morehead, Kentucky and alumni of Morehead State University, released video footage on July 7, 2015 of Davis refusing to issue them a marriage license and requesting that <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> off their camera. The video went viral overnight.|$|E

5|$|In {{the prose}} section {{at the end}} of Lokasenna, the gods catch Loki and bind him with the innards of his son Nari, while <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> his son Narfi into a wolf. Skaði places a venomous snake above Loki's face. Venom drips from the snake and Loki's wife Sigyn sits and holds a basin beneath the serpent, {{catching}} the venom. When the basin is full, Sigyn must empty it, and during that time the snake venom falls onto Loki's face, causing him to writhe in a tremendous fury, so much so that all earthquakes stem from Loki's writhings.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm orchestrates {{a meeting}} between Savage, Barry, and Oliver. Savage demands <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> over Kendra and Carter or he will destroy both Central City and Star City with the Staff of Horus. Oliver has Barry perform a {{paternity}} test on William and it confirms that Oliver is William's father. Confronting Samantha, she agrees to let him see William on the condition he tell no one, including William himself, {{that he is the}} boy's father. Felicity learns of Oliver's paternity and feels betrayed because Oliver is still willing to keep secrets from her, so she ends their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Wilis have cornered {{a terrified}} Hilarion. They use their magic {{to force him}} to dance until he is nearly dead, and then drown him in a nearby lake. Then <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> on Albrecht, {{sentencing}} him to death as well. He pleads to Myrtha for his life, but she coldly refuses. Giselle's pleas are also dismissed and Albrecht is forced to dance until sunrise. However, the power of Giselle's love counters the Wilis' magic and spares his life. The other spirits return to their graves at daybreak, but Giselle has broken through the chains of hatred and vengeance that control the Wilis, and is thus released from their powers. After bidding a tender farewell to Albrecht, Giselle returns to her grave to rest in peace.|$|E

5|$|On Christmas morning, {{everybody}} {{wakes up}} to find no presents under their trees. <b>They</b> <b>turn</b> on the news, which is broadcasting the same story. Brian and Stewie appear on the broadcast and bring the dying Santa out in a wheelchair, explaining that humanity's greed is killing him and if they don't shorten their demands to one Christmas present a year, {{they may have to}} give up Christmas altogether. Chastened, everyone agrees and by one year later, Santa has recovered, the workshop is once again a lively, colorful cottage and the elves and reindeer are all rejuvenated.|$|E
5|$|The episode opens {{showing a}} horde of walkers as they follow a {{helicopter}} overhead, leaving Atlanta and migrating to the countryside over several days. As they near the Greene farm, they {{hear the sound of}} a gunshotfrom the shot that Carl (Chandler Riggs) used to kill a reanimated Shane Walshand <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> to head towards the farm. As Rick (Andrew Lincoln) escorts Carl back to the others, the walker horde emerges from the forest, and Rick and Carl take shelter in the barn.|$|E
5|$|An ice core is a {{vertical}} column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; but at a density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. The bubbles disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.|$|E
