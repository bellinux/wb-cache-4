5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kirk, {{played by}} John Belushi, orders {{the ship to}} outrun the strange craft. Unable to do so, he orders phasers and photon torpedoes to destroy the craft. Unfortunately, all of the ship's {{equipment}} fails for no reason and the Enterprises systems break down. Suddenly, Dr. Leonard McCoy, played by Dan Aykroyd, runs onto the bridge saying that the aliens are on the ship. He says they did not beam aboard, but merely walked out from behind <b>the</b> <b>curtains.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first flames {{were spotted}} at 6:00pm, {{under the door}} of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> and wood panels, and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace {{initially}} panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did not call for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, {{at the other end of}} the palace complex.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{cancellation}} of Lost in Space: [...] "When <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> comes down, you're disappointed. Always, <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> comes down. I've done so much work, and then <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> comes down and {{you go on to}} something else." ...|$|R
50|$|Cookie {{tries to}} bring down <b>the</b> <b>curtain,</b> but only succeeds in {{trapping}} the boys in front of <b>the</b> <b>curtain,</b> causing them to scramble underneath as Spanky closes out the show (with <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> hiding his corset, garters and lace leggings) and sends the audience of kids home.|$|R
5000|$|Underwood's {{property}} included {{shares in}} the King's Men's theatres, the Globe and the Blackfriars, {{as well as a}} share in <b>the</b> <b>Curtain</b> Theatre in Shoreditch. The last is a significant point. Thomas Pope, a member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men who died in 1603, had also possessed a share in <b>the</b> <b>Curtain</b> and had listed it in his will. As far as is known, Henry Lanman, who built <b>the</b> <b>Curtain</b> in 1577, had originally run that theatre as his private business; yet sometime before 1603 <b>the</b> <b>Curtain</b> had clearly been re-organized into a shareholders' enterprise. The fact that two men of Shakespeare's troupe owned shares in <b>the</b> <b>Curtain</b> suggests that this re-organization occurred around the time the Lord Chamberlain's Men were acting at <b>the</b> <b>Curtain</b> in <b>the</b> 1597 - 99 period. (Pope {{was a member of the}} company at that time, while Underwood was not; the implication is that Underwood purchased his share in <b>the</b> <b>Curtain</b> from another troupe member.) ...|$|R
5|$|Kramer {{is almost}} {{immediately}} out, {{due to the}} presence of a beautiful exhibitionist woman in the apartment across the street who walks around in her apartment naked with <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> open. The others are distracted by various temptations: George is distracted in the hospital his mother is staying at by an attractive nurse giving an even more attractive woman a daily sponge bath; Elaine visits a fitness club which is also patronized by John F. Kennedy, Jr.; Jerry is tempted by the naked woman across the street and frustrated because the woman he's dating won't have sex with him since she wants to remain a virgin. One method he uses to distract himself is by watching wholesome shows like Tiny Toons on Nickelodeon.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
50|$|A curtain hook stopper is {{a device}} used to stop <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> from {{falling off the}} end of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> rail.|$|R

60|$|It lay {{perfectly}} motionless midway on {{the side}} of the bed, where <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> at <b>the</b> head and <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> at <b>the</b> foot met. Nothing more was visible. <b>The</b> clinging <b>curtains</b> hid everything but the long white hand.|$|R
5|$|When {{the boys}} regain consciousness, they are {{backstage}} at the Televised Jonas Brothers' 3D concert spectacular at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Mickey interrogates them and eventually threatens {{them with a}} chainsaw, refusing to believe they are not working for another company. As Mickey once again rants about his true intentions, this time insulting the Jonas Brothers' fans and Christians, Kyle stealthily turns {{on one of the}} microphones and Cartman raises the curtain, broadcasting Mickey's rant to both the concert-goers and the national television audience. When Mickey realizes that <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> are raised, the crowd turns on Mickey and the Jonas Brothers leave the stage in a huff. An enraged Mickey grows to an enormous size and begins blowing fire and destroying most of Denver. Tammy and Kenny remove their purity rings, and Tammy suggests they go to T.G.I. Friday's, much to Kenny's excitement. The show immediately cuts to Kenny's funeral, where the audience learns that he contracted syphilis after receiving a blowjob from his girlfriend Tammy Warner and died as a result.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, under Ashcroft, {{curtains}} {{were installed}} blocking the Spirit of Justice statue in the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building, {{which is of}} a woman wearing a toga-like dress with one breast revealed, from view during speeches. <b>The</b> <b>curtains</b> were first used on a rental basis during the administration of Dick Thornburgh. Justice officials long insisted that <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> were put up to improve the room's use as a television backdrop and that Ashcroft {{had nothing to do}} with it. Ashcroft's successor, Alberto Gonzales, removed <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> in June 2005.|$|E
50|$|The London theatres, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>Curtain,</b> {{were closed}} {{for much of}} the period from September 1592 to April 1594 due to the bubonic plague. In 1597, people wrote to the local magistrates' court demanding that no plays take place at <b>the</b> <b>Curtain</b> or <b>the</b> Theatre that year. <b>The</b> <b>Curtain</b> was named in John Stow's Survey of London in 1598, but was not listed in the 1603 edition. In 1600, the Privy Council tried unsuccessfully to shut down <b>the</b> <b>Curtain</b> theatre, and in 1603, <b>the</b> <b>Curtain</b> became <b>the</b> playhouse of Queen Anne's Men (formerly known as Worcester's Men, and formerly at the Rose Theatre, where they'd played Heywood's A Woman Kill'd With Kindness in February of that year). In 1607, The Travels of the Three English Brothers, by Rowley, Day, and Wilkins, was performed at <b>the</b> <b>Curtain.</b>|$|R
40|$|Refrigerated air {{curtains}} {{are used}} in supermarket display cases to keep warm ambient air from entering the refrigerator case. Entrainment of ambient air into <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> by shear layer mixing contributes to both the sensible and the latent heat load on the cases. In order to reduce this entrainment, {{a closer look at}} <b>the</b> air <b>curtain</b> is undertaken here. Particle Image Velocimetry was used to examine idealized air curtains of various Reynolds and Richardson numbers. <b>The</b> air <b>curtain</b> entrainment was seen to be dominated by eddies that engulfed ambient air into <b>the</b> air <b>curtain.</b> For <b>the</b> isothermal (Ri= 0) curtains, it was observed that <b>the</b> air <b>curtain</b> dynamics and entrainment were not sensitive to Reynolds number variation between Re= 3800 and Re= 8500. At low air velocities (Re= 1500), <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> was found to detach, leading to extremely high entrainment rates. Variations in Richardson number of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> affected <b>the</b> flow at <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> inlet most dramatically, where the acceleration of gravity caused <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> to neck inwards. The overall thermal entrainment was shown to reduce with reducing Reynolds number, implying that a reduction in air curtain entrainment could be achieved by reducing the air velocity of <b>the</b> <b>curtain,</b> as long as air curtain integrity is maintained.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{performance}} of <b>curtain</b> flow chromatography column technology with MS detection was evaluated {{for the analysis}} of labile compounds. <b>The</b> <b>curtain</b> flow column design allows for separations that are faster and/or more sensitive than conventional columns, depending on how exactly <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> flow column is configured. For example, when mass spectral detection is employed, <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> flow column can yield separations that are 5 -times faster than conventional columns when <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> flow and <b>the</b> conventional columns have the same internal diameter. Or when the internal diameter of the conventional column is reduced in order to yield the same analytical through-put as <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> flow column, <b>the</b> sensitivity on <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> flow column can be as much as 66 -fold higher than the conventional column. As a consequence of the higher analytical through-put less standardization is required in the analysis of labile compounds because less sample degradation is apparent. Consequently the sample integrity is preserved yielding data of a higher quality...|$|R
25|$|While VLocity {{carriages}} have tinted windows, {{they lack}} <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> as provided by older V/Line rolling stock. Passengers may move freely {{between the two}} or three semi-permanently coupled vehicles in a set, but not between the sets themselves. Conductors move between coupled sets at station stops.|$|E
25|$|The {{green of}} the woman's dress symbolizes hope, {{possibly}} the hope of becoming a mother. Her white cap could signify purity, but probably signifies her being married. Behind the pair, <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> of the marriage bed have been opened; the red curtains might allude to the physical act of love between the married couple.|$|E
25|$|The horseshoe-shaped {{auditorium}} with stalls, four {{tiers of}} boxes and a gallery (or loggione, i.e. the gods) is richly decorated with frescoes, stucco, gilding and velvet. <b>The</b> <b>curtains</b> {{of the royal}} box hang from a structure supported on stucco caryatids by Abbondio Sangiorgio who also designed the equestrian statue in Piazza Mazzini.|$|E
50|$|At times, while {{songs were}} being sung by Agnes Bernelle, <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> was an opaque surface, {{like a white}} chalk board, and at other times, <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> became transparent, {{revealing}} {{a scene from the}} play behind (see photos, right). <b>The</b> <b>curtain</b> was suspended on a simple set of wires, and parted in the middle to reveal each scene.|$|R
50|$|A curtain knob {{consists}} of a decorative metal or wooden knob projecting directly out from {{the wall next to}} <b>the</b> <b>curtain.</b> <b>The</b> width of the knob serves to hold <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> from spilling back into the window.|$|R
50|$|A weight can be {{attached}} to a long string and the string attached to <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> rod in <b>the</b> middle of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> (on <b>the</b> inside). Hanging the weight low against <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> just above <b>the</b> rim of the shower pan or tub makes it an effective billowing deterrent without allowing the weight to hit the pan or tub and damage it.|$|R
25|$|In Exodus 25:18-22, Yahweh tells Moses to make {{multiple}} {{images of}} cherubim at specific points around the Ark of the Covenant. Many appearances {{of the words}} cherub and cherubim in the Bible refer to the gold cherubim images on the mercy seat of the Ark, as well as images on <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> of the Tabernacle and in Solomon's Temple, including two measuring ten cubits high.|$|E
25|$|His straitjacket escape was {{originally}} performed behind curtains, with him popping out free at the end. Houdini's brother, (who {{was also an}} escape artist, billing himself as Theodore Hardeen), discovered that audiences were more impressed when <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> were eliminated so they could watch him struggle to get out. On more than one occasion, they both performed straitjacket escapes while dangling upside-down {{from the roof of}} a building in the same city.|$|E
25|$|The University of the East (UE) Red Warriors finally closed <b>the</b> <b>curtains</b> for the Far Eastern University (FEU) Tamaraws {{on their}} way to the UAAP Season 72 Finals. The Warriors lost the crucial last game of the best-of-three finals with the Ateneo de Manila University Blue Eagles with honor. They thus lost their shot at the Season 72 UAAP crown. First year head coach, Lawrence Chongson lauded his boys for their efforts, {{especially}} for their will for not giving up.|$|E
40|$|The authors conduct shock-tube {{experiments}} to investigate Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) instability {{of a narrow}} curtain of heavy gas (SF{sub 6 }) embedded in lighter gas (air). Initial perturbations of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> can be varied, producing different flow patterns in the subsequent evolution of <b>the</b> <b>curtain.</b> Multiple-exposure video flow visualization provides images {{of the growth of}} the instability and its transition to turbulence, making it possible to extract quantitative information such as the width of <b>the</b> perturbed <b>curtain.</b> They demonstrate that the width of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> with initial perturbation on the downstream side is non-monotonic. As the initial perturbation undergoes phase inversion, the width of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> actually decreases before beginning to grow as the RM instability evolves...|$|R
25|$|On {{the stone}} wall, (in {{the same way}} as Milecastles,) {{additional}} structures known as Wing Walls were incorporated on the east and west side, allowing bonding to <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. This is interpreted as evidence that turrets (and milecastles) were constructed before <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. Where turrets were built with the intention of bonding to a broad gauge curtain wall, they were given broad wing walls. However, there are many cases where <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall actually constructed was of narrow gauge, giving a point of reduction where <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall and turret wing walls join. To facilitate bonding with <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall, wing walls were constructed longer at the base, and stepping inwards as they were built upwards. Turrets thought to have been constructed later in the plan were built with much shorter wing walls.|$|R
50|$|Dead load {{is defined}} as the weight of {{structural}} elements and the permanent features on the structure. In <b>the</b> case of <b>curtain</b> walls, this load is made up of the weight of the mullions, anchors and other structural components of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall, as well as the weight of the infill material. Additional dead loads imposed on <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall, such as sunshades, must be accounted for in the design of <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall components and anchors.|$|R

25|$|As a {{fire safety}} precaution, the carrier's two hangars {{were divided into}} {{sections}} (five on the upper and four on the lower), separated by fire-proofed fabric curtains. <b>The</b> <b>curtains</b> were intended to limit the supply of air to and delay the spread of any fire breaking out on the hangar decks. Further protection against fire was supplied by a foam spray system fed by two rows of pipes and nozzles running along the walls and ends of the hangars. The lower hangar could also be flooded with carbon dioxide where the likelihood of fuel vapor build-up was greatest.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, between Reveilles {{completion}} and release, Chris Cohen joined Deerhoof on guitar. Over {{the next three}} years this quartet shared the stage with a variety of increasingly established artists including Le Tigre, Stephen Malkmus, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio, The Roots, and Wilco. Legendary radio DJ John Peel invited the band twice to record sessions for BBC Radio 1, and Deerhoof was selected by both Sonic Youth and The Simpsons creator Matt Groening to perform at All Tomorrow's Parties festivals, marking their first two of many appearances at that festival. During those same years Saunier also joined Cohen's band <b>The</b> <b>Curtains</b> as keyboardist.|$|E

50|$|Curtains are {{manufactured}} {{from a variety}} of thick fabrics, each with a differing degree of light absorption and heat insulating qualities. For maximum temperature control, <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> gap to <b>the</b> window should be small, with minimum convection drafts below or above <b>the</b> <b>curtain.</b> Various architectural structures around <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> can minimize these air drafts, but usually they are just used for decoration and make rooms feel more cozy.|$|R
