5|$|The {{emotional}} {{story is}} inspired by Maxim Gorky's sentimental novel Mother, which is considered the first socialist realist novel, and a story that Han was familiar with. Myers traces the story's foundation back to anti-Christian stories in rural colonial Korea {{as well as in}} fascist Japan. <b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> the villain as a beast, too, is more readily associated with wartime Japanese propaganda than socialist realism. It had, however, featured in the works of early Soviet writers as whose work Han knew, as well as in textual genres not bound by the official socialist realist dogma, such as journalism.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or host. In its broadest sense, it could include various types of exploitation, as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms of exploitation involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian mimicry (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. <b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the caveat that mimics are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up as and imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive mimics, nor would a human angler. Treated separately is molecular mimicry, which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E
5|$|Goffman uses <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> {{conversation}} being a stage play. A plays tone {{will shift}} throughout the performance {{due to the}} actions taken by the actors; {{this is similar to}} how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to empathize and, as was explained above, they’re often not meant to be stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century, René Descartes' {{mechanical}} philosophy encouraged the use of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> the universe as a machine, a concept that would come to characterise the scientific revolution. Between 1650 and 1800, some naturalists, such as Benoît de Maillet, produced theories that maintained that the universe, the Earth, and life, had developed mechanically, without divine guidance. In contrast, most contemporary theories of evolution, such of those of Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Gottfried Herder, regarded evolution as a fundamentally spiritual process. In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species, a description that anticipated in general terms the concept of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or the placenta that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows. Each season of The Wire consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E

According to this general aim which categories <b>the</b> <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> preservice teachers’ {{come together and}} if there is a difference between metaphors according to their departments and class level is investigated. In order {{to determine}} <b>the</b> <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> preservice teachers’ thorough their educational faculty, phenomenology was used which is a qualitative research pattern. Study group of this research consisted of 1 st and 4 th grade students who study Elementary Science Education, Elementary Mathematics Education, Elementary Education, Early Childhood Education, English Language Teaching, Turkish Language Teaching, Psychological Counselling and Guidance programs in Kocaeli University at 2011 - 2012 academic year. Study group consisted of 420 students. In order to examine <b>the</b> <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> preservice teachers through educational faculty, “Faculty of Education which I study is like …………; because ………………… [...] ” stated forms were distributed. Naming, organization, metaphor sampling and categorization stages were followed in the process of analyzing and interpretation <b>of</b> <b>metaphors.</b> Nvivo qualitative data analyze program and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences data analyze program were used in analyzing stage. 55 forms of preservice teachers were eliminated based on these stages. Thereby <b>metaphors</b> <b>of</b> 365 preservice teachers’ were included in the analyses. Regarding <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> sample <b>metaphors,</b> 12 conceptual categories were constituted by analyzing <b>the</b> <b>metaphors,</b> resources <b>of</b> <b>metaphors</b> and <b>the</b> relation between <b>the</b> <b>metaphors</b> and <b>metaphor</b> resources.

Regarding to the other mostly stated metaphors; it is determined that Faculty of Education have been seen as a component of “Disappointment and sadness” and “Reserving diversity”. Also ıt has been determined that there is a significant difference between metaphors according to class level and preservice teachers’ departments. According to the study results, creating educational environments for preservice teachers to express themselves freely, guidance studies to support their self efficiency and to reduce exam anxiety can be suggested...|$|R

Bertolucci presented the cricket's container as a magic black box that opens up the memories of Puyi. According to Bruce Sklarew, the cricket, mysteriously emerging from the box, carries at least three meanings: it is <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> Puyi himself, it is <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> his wisdom acquired through suffering, and a symbol of the ultimate freedom that comes with death.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> <b>metaphor</b> in <b>the</b> processes <b>of</b> cultural production. The authors {{believe that}} <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>metaphors</b> {{should be viewed}} as a mechanism for such production. This approach involves <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>metaphor</b> as a way of creating new meanings. The development of this idea requires a revision of the widespread substitution view <b>of</b> <b>metaphor.</b> So, if <b>the</b> literal meaning is known, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>metaphors</b> should be considered excessive. To avoid <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> <b>metaphor</b> as a simile or analogy, it must be assumed that through <b>metaphor</b> <b>the</b> common feature is created rather than explicated. To do this, a hypothesis is developed that <b>the</b> primary effect <b>of</b> <b>metaphor</b> is simply to capture imagination...|$|R
25|$|According to Ronald M.

Likewise, tantric yogis reconfigured their practice through <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> being consecrated (abhiśeka) as the overlord (rājādhirāja) of a mandala palace of divine vassals, an imperial metaphor symbolizing kingly fortresses and their political power.|$|E

And when the wind increased, it was said, the dust swirled up, it roared, howled, became dark, blew in all directions; there was lightning; it grew wrathful.The metaphor served to not only describe a powerful seasonal phenomenon, but was also the title of rulership and priestly office; additionally, the name figured in Toltec ties as a military title and emblem.|$|E

25|$|Sternberg & Lubart’s Investment Theory. Using <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> a stock market, they {{demonstrate}} that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique {{ideas that are}} initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence {{is just one of}} the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two kinds}} of intent analysis, {{reflecting}} two meanings of the word intent. The first, a rule of common law construction during the Founding Era, is functional intent. The second is motivational intent. To understand the difference, one can use <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>of</b> an architect who designs a Gothic church with flying buttresses. The functional intent of flying buttresses is to prevent the weight of the roof from spreading the walls and causing a collapse of the building, which can be inferred from examining the design as a whole. The motivational intent might be to create work for his brother-in-law who is a flying buttress subcontractor. Using original intent analysis of the first kind, we can discern that the language of Article III of the U.S. Constitution was to delegate to Congress the power to allocate original and appellate jurisdictions, and not to remove some jurisdiction, involving a constitutional question, from all courts. That would suggest that the decision was wrong in Ex Parte McCardle.|$|E
