5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E
5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis are the result of spillover between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre virus, has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus from the small rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E
5|$|Since then, thermal {{anomalies}} (hot spots) and {{gas emissions}} (including hydrogen sulfide) have occurred {{especially on the}} summit plateau and indicate that Adams is dormant, not extinct. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of andesite or basalt. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams {{tend to have a}} low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens {{and some of the other}} Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> for very large landslides and other debris flows.|$|E

5|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{activated}} charcoal {{if the person}} presents soon after the overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> for toxicity, the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. A liver transplant may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E

25|$|In some nations, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and New Zealand, {{imported}} alien crayfish are {{a danger}} to local rivers. The three species commonly imported to Europe from the Americas are Orconectes limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. Crayfish may spread into different bodies of water because specimens captured for pets in one river are often released into a different catchment. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> for ecological damage when crayfish are introduced into non-native bodies of water (e.g., crayfish plague in Europe).|$|E
25|$|The AWS {{states that}} for an {{equivalent}} carbon content above 0.40% <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> for cracking in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) on flame cut edges and welds. However, structural engineering standards rarely use CE, but rather limit the maximum percentage of certain alloying elements. This practice started before the CE concept existed, so just {{continues to be}} used. This has led to issues because certain high strength steels are now being used that have a CE higher than 0.50% that have brittle failures.|$|E

More recently, scientists have also begun using transgenic goats to study genetic disorders related to fertility.|$|E
25|$|Insurance {{may also}} be {{purchased}} through an agent. A tied agent, working exclusively with one insurer, represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys (while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies). Just as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly for the insurance company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.|$|E
25|$|This {{vasodilation}} {{does not}} decrease {{the volume of}} blood the heart pumps, but rather it decreases the force the heart muscle must exert to pump the same volume of blood. Nitroglycerin pills, taken sublingually (under the tongue), are used to prevent or treat acute chest pain. The nitroglycerin reacts with a sulfhydryl group (–SH) to produce nitric oxide, which eases the pain by causing vasodilation. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> role {{for the use of}} nitric oxide in alleviating bladder contractile dysfunctions, and recent evidence suggests that nitrates may be beneficial for treatment of angina due to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption both by decreasing preload and afterload and by some direct vasodilation of coronary vessels.|$|E
50|$|Most pesticide-related {{illnesses}} have {{signs and}} symptoms {{that are similar to}} common medical conditions, so a complete and detailed environmental and occupational history is essential for correctly diagnosing a pesticide poisoning.
