5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain, and vice versa. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull is very {{different from that of the}} left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.|$|E

30|$|Thus, the {{post-processing}} algorithm of {{the obstacle}} SOR (3.9), L_SOR(ω), can be formulated by replacing the two terms in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> (3.2) with <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> (4.9) and (4.10), and computing u_GS,pq in (3.9.a) correspondingly at all neighboring points.|$|R
50|$|Elephant pupinid snails are {{dioecious}} (having separate {{male and}} female sexes).

5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence collected from Frank's body, there were also samples of residue taken from the air vents and hat rack located on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft near {{the leading edge of}} the wing. These samples contained sodium carbonate, sodium nitrate, and mixtures of sodium-sulfur compounds.|$|E

5|$|The body of {{an adult}} {{butterfly}} or moth (imago) has three distinct divisions, called tagmata, connected at constrictions; these tagmata are the head, thorax and abdomen.

5|$|La Tante DC10 Restaurant is a {{restaurant}} located inside a converted McDonnell Douglas DC-10 formerly {{used by the}} defunct Ghana Airways.

Jones was pronounced dead at the scene. He was wearing a helmet, and alcohol was not a factor. The accident is still under investigation.|$|E

The tank has combat damage taken during the Great Patriotic War (many marks from armour-piercing bullets and a welded hole on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turret from a 50mm shell).|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case, so it had to be placed on the left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E

5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold {{on the left side of}} the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} of each patrol adopted their own markings. The New Zealand 'R' Patrol used a green Hei-tiki {{with a red}} tongue painted on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bonnet of the vehicle, and on the left a Māori place name beginning with the letter 'R' (for example, 'Rotowaro'). The 'T' Patrol vehicles had a black Kiwi over green 'grass' and a Māori name starting with 'Te' (for example, 'Te Anau') in the corresponding places. The 'W' Patrol vehicles had a Māori name or word starting with 'W' painted on their vehicles.|$|E
5|$|To {{distinguish}} between OHS {{and various other}} lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as a chest X-ray or CT/CAT scan), spirometry, electrocardiography and echocardiography may be performed.

5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed {{that the risk of}} thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly square frame {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen and the enemies {{on the left side of}} the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
