The option to make any last minute changes to their character occurs when the player steps {{beyond the boundaries of}} the starting location of Goodsprings.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the area}} of a curve is reduced at a {{constant}} rate, and (by the isoperimetric inequality) a circle has the greatest possible area among simple closed curves of a given length, it follows that circles are the slowest curves to collapse to a point under the curve-shortening flow. All other curves <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> to collapse than a circle of the same length.|$|E
5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time,</b> materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E

5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time.</b> His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E
25|$|Relative {{abundance}} of food available is gauged {{by the average}} time spent foraging per seed, rather than the distance traveled to find each seed. Foragers <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> when food is more abundant. Faster foraging signals faster rates of outgoing foragers, maximizing the harvest of food relative to the abundance in the area. Seeds are used {{as a source of}} water for ants, and are often kept in the nest for a few months to several years.|$|E
25|$|When {{workers are}} foraging, {{it is characterised by}} three steps: searching, recruitment, and transportation. Workers tend {{to search for}} honey more often than other food sources, and the weight of food has no impact on searching time. Workers may recruit other nestmates if the food they have found is too heavy, taking as much as 30 minutes for the maximum number of {{recruited}} workers to arrive. Lighter food sources <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> and are usually transported rapidly. Foraging workers become scouts and search solely for food outside the surface, and may subsequently die two weeks later from old age.|$|E

25|$|Motor {{planning}} {{is an important}} component of becoming a fluent semantic compaction user. Icon sequencing should be the initial focus of learning to use semantic compaction devices. A beginner needs to be fluent in a given icon set before progressing to a more advanced level. The Language Acquisition through Motor Planning (LAMP) strategy aids individuals in developing motor plans for sequencing icons for messages. Minspeak relies upon the motor-based learning principles that when motor patterns are repeated, these processes become automatic and simplified. Common automated motor patterns include typing on a keyboard without looking, riding a bicycle, or swallowing food and drink. Increased automaticity and simplification with the production of language allows experienced Minspeak users to delegate cognitive attention to their intended message (language) instead of to the formulation of their message. This allows users to focus on communicating a specific message rather than focus on how to build the message by searching for icons across different pages and or screens. The use of LAMP strategies has been associated with increased natural expression through unique combinations of words in non-verbal children with autism. Ideally, once the system of Minspeak is mastered, productions of communication should <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> and effort across communication contexts.|$|E
2500|$|Prefabricated {{post and}} cores <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> to place, {{as they do}} not involve any lab work and can be {{inserted}} immediately upon the decision to utilize them, once the endodontic therapy has been completed and the post space cleared of gutta percha. [...] After the prefabricated post is properly cemented into the post space, a core material, such as dental composite, can be packed around the cemented post. [...] After the material has been cured or has {{had a chance to}} set and properly formed into a crown preparation, an impression can be taken for the fabrication of a prosthetic crown.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the Forth Replacement Crossing Study was {{commissioned}} by Transport Scotland to examine various options for new bridges or tunnels across the Forth. The report recommended adoption of a cable-stayed bridge, located {{to the west of}} the Forth Road Bridge, as the preferred solution. The study concluded that this option was significantly cheaper than a tunnel, would <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> to construct, and would represent better value for money, though it was noted that a tunnel would have fewer environmental impacts. In December 2007 finance secretary John Swinney announced that a new cable-stayed bridge would be constructed, with an estimated cost of between £3.25billion and £4.22billion. He claimed it would be [...] "the largest construction project in a generation in Scotland".|$|E

2500|$|Almost all appeals require permission, a major {{innovation}} {{from the}} previous system, where appeals were, on the request of counsel, almost all automatically put through. The application for permission {{should be made to}} the lower court, although this is not mandatory; it may be asked of the appellate court itself. In Re T (A Child) [...] EWCA Civ 1736, the Civil Division strongly advised that counsel apply at the lower courts, since the judge, fully aware of the facts, will <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> to process, there is no harm if the application fails or if it is approved but counsel decides not to proceed with the case and there are no additional costs involved. The only problem here is that judgments may occasionally be reserved, and only given later by post – there may not be an opportunity to ask for permission to appeal at the lower court.|$|E
2500|$|... "Weekend band" [...] PA {{systems are}} a niche market for small, {{powerful}} touring SR gear. Weekend bands need {{systems that are}} {{small enough to fit}} into a minivan or a car trunk, and yet powerful enough to give adequate and even sound dispersion and vocal intelligibility in a noisy club or bar. As well, the systems need to be easy and quick to set up. Sound reinforcement companies have responded to this demand by offering equipment that fulfills multiple roles, such as powered mixers (a mixer with an integrated power amplifier and effects) and powered subwoofers (a subwoofer with an integrated power amplifier and crossover). These products minimize the amount of wiring connections that bands have to make to set up the system and they <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> to set up. Some subwoofers have metal speaker mount holes built into the top, so that they can double as a base for the stand-mounted full-range PA speaker cabinets.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of new coaches allowed for improvements in service on the Dover Plains Branch. The first peak through service since the 1970s was inaugurated in October 1991. At the same time, a Sunday night through train was added. The reduced travel times made the line more attractive to commuters. In 1994, Metro-North conducted a train movement analysis of service on the branch to determine whether trains would pass one another based on speeds and the condition of tracks. As a result, a new [...] passing siding was constructed at Wingdale, increasing service flexibility and allowing for increased service in 1996. Also around this time, 447 additional parking spaces were added to stations on the Branch. In 1996, four car length high-level platforms with heated shelters were built at Patterson, Pawling, Harlem Valley–Wingdale and Dover Plains, replacing low-level platforms that could only accommodate two cars. These platforms were made {{to be compliant with}} the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Travel times could be reduced further as it would <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> for passengers to exit and board the trains.|$|E
