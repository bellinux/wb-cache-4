25|$|The 25th Amendment {{explicitly}} states <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> dies, resigns or {{is removed}} from office, the Vice President becomes President, and also establishes a procedure for filling a vacancy {{in the office of}} the Vice President. The Amendment further provides that the President, or the Vice President and Cabinet, can declare the President unable to discharge his duties, in which case the Vice President becomes Acting President. If the declaration is done by the Vice President and Cabinet, the Amendment permits the President to take control back, unless the Vice President and Cabinet challenge the President and two-thirds of both Houses vote to sustain the findings of the Vice President and Cabinet. If the declaration is done by the President, he may take control back without risk of being overridden by the Congress.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was very}} clear, {{based upon the}} {{information}} given to me, and it's 100% accurate, that in October 2004, the President of the United States ordered the Pentagon {{to be prepared to}} launch military strikes against Iran as of June 2005.

More importantly, there would be a tension in the separation of powers, as the Constitution explicitly vests power to run the Government in the Prime Minister and his Cabinet and makes them accountable to Parliament. [...] "roblems would arise as to how the differences can be resolved and who would be held responsible for the outcome", and [...] "f the EP [...] takes sides on political issues, the institution will inevitably become politicised, and with the high risk that it would be diminished as a result".|$|E

This act stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> incumbent <b>president</b> was unable to carry out his office's duties for a year or more, the Federal Assembly had the right to elect a permanent successor. In Svoboda's case, he had been in ill health for some time, making the act relevant.|$|R

However, the Federalist electors scattered their second votes, resulting in the Democratic-Republican Party presidential candidate, Thomas Jefferson, receiving the second highest number of electoral votes and thus being elected Vice President. It became apparent <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> was a defeated electoral opponent of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>the</b> two might not work together effectively.

Wyden added, [...] "While I continue to have concerns about ensuring that taxpayers are protected if this loan is to occur, I believe <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> can unwisely provide $750 billion of taxpayer money for the investment banks who took horribly unacceptable risks and helped trigger an economic collapse, we certainly have a duty to attempt to preserve a cornerstone domestic industry and the jobs {{of hundreds of thousands of}} working people whose personal actions are in no way responsible for the current economic crisis." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{wording of}} this clause caused much {{controversy}} {{at the time}} it was first used. When William Henry Harrison died in office, a debate arose over whether the Vice President would become President, or if he would just inherit the powers, thus becoming an Acting President. Harrison's Vice President, John Tyler, believed that he had the right to become President. However, many Senators argued that he only had the right to assume the powers of the presidency long enough to call for a new election. Because the wording of the clause is so vague, it was impossible for either side to prove its point. Tyler took the Oath of Office as President, setting a precedent that made it possible for later Vice Presidents to ascend to the presidency unchallenged following the President's death. The [...] "Tyler Precedent" [...] established <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> dies, resigns or is removed from office, the Vice President becomes President.|$|E
2500|$|A {{session of}} the MPRS was {{scheduled}} to open 12 May, but eventually began on 20 June and continued until 5 July. One of its first actions was to appoint General Abdul Haris Nasution as chairman. It then set about dismantling the apparatus Sukarno had built around himself. It passed several decrees, {{one of which was}} the ratification of the Supersemar, thus making revocation of it almost impossible. It also ratified the banning of the PKI and the teaching of Marxist ideology, instructed Suharto to form a new cabinet, called on Sukarno to provide an explanation for the economic and political situation in the nation and stripped him of the title [...] "president for life". It also passed a decree stating <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was unable to carry out his duties, the holder of the Supersemar would assume the presidency. Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president amongst elements of the armed forces (particularly the Marines, the navy, and some regional army divisions).|$|E

On July 25, 1938, Irizarry was killed during an assassination attempt against colonial governor Winship in one of several confrontations between the government and the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party following the events of the Ponce massacre. Col. José Enrique Colom took over the 296th Regiment.|$|E

60|$|The tall, large {{figure of}} Mr. ------ {{has a certain}} air of state and dignity; he carries {{his head in a}} very awkward way, but still looks like a man of long and high authority, and, with his white hair, is now quite venerable. There is {{certainly}} a lack of polish, a kind of rusticity, notwithstanding which you feel him to be a man of the world. I should think he might succeed very tolerably in English society, being heavy and sensible, cool, kindly, and good-humored, {{with a great deal of}} experience of life. We talked about various matters, politics among the rest; and he observed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> had taken the advice which he gave him in two long letters, before his inauguration, he would have had a perfectly quiet and successful term of office. The advice was, to form a perfectly homogeneous cabinet of Union men, and to satisfy the extremes of the party by a fair distribution of minor offices; whereas he formed his cabinet of extreme men, on both sides, and gave the minor offices to moderate ones. But the antislavery people, surely, had no representative in the cabinet. Mr. ------ further observed, that he thought the President had a fair chance of re-nomination, for that the South could not, in honor, desert him; to which I replied that the South had been guilty of such things heretofore. Mr. ------ thinks that the next Presidential term will be more important and critical, both as to our foreign relations and internal affairs, than any preceding one,--which I should judge likely enough to be the case, although I heard the sane prophecy often made respecting the present term.|$|E

50|$|In March 2006, the National Assembly {{approved}} {{changes to}} the coat of arms and the flag of Venezuela, which were made official on March 12, 2006, coinciding with Flag Day. Prior to 2006, the horse was running to the sinister side of the shield with its head turned to the dexter (to the viewer, this appears as the horse galloping towards his right and looking back to the left). In heraldic practice, animals and beasts are to appear facing to the dexter, which is considered the natural and honorable position. The Economist observed that Hugo Chávez ordered the seal changed after his daughter, Rosinés Chávez Rodríguez, had described the previous horse as “looking backwards”. Government supporters state, however, <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> daughter was <b>the</b> one who sparked the discussion, both the legislative and executive branch agreed to changes.
