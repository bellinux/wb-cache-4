40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{summarized}} the effects <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> chronic hepatitis B (CHB) by lamivudine combined with traditional Chinese medicine or Western {{medicine in the}} past few years. Combined <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> lamivudine and the other medicine had higher efficiency than lamvudine alone in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> CHB. The Combined treatment should be a tendency <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> for chronic hepatitis B. The focal point is that the traditional Chinese recipe produces a multitarget effect in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> CHB. The combined <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> lamivudine and traditional Chinese recipe can reduce the treatment course and the recurrence rate. Combined <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine has notable superiority and broad developing prospect in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> CHB...|$|R

5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the {{repeated}} reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Beno√Æt, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration {{as soon as it}} is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E

5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E

5|$|Hope is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by the English painter George Frederic Watts, {{who completed the}} first two versions in 1886. Radically different from previous <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, {{at the time of}} its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.|$|E
