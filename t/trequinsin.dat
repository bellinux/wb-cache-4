40|$|Two cyclic {{nucleotide}} phosphodiesterase (PDE) {{activities were}} identified in pig aortic endothelial cells, a cyclic GMP-stimulated PDE and a cyclic AMP PDE. Cyclic GMP-stimulated PDE had Km values of 367 microM for cyclic AMP and 24 microM for cyclic GMP, and low concentrations (1 microM) of cyclic GMP increased the affinity of the enzyme for cyclic AMP (Km = 13 microM) without changing the Vmax. This isoenzyme was inhibited by <b>trequinsin</b> [IC 50 (concn. giving 50 % inhibition of substrate hydrolysis) = 0. 6 microM for cyclic AMP hydrolysis {{in the presence of}} cyclic GMP; IC 50 = 0. 6 microM for cyclic GMP hydrolysis] and dipyridamole (IC 50 = 5 microM for cyclic AMP hydrolysis in the presence of cyclic GMP; IC 50 = 3 microM for cyclic GMP hydrolysis). Cyclic AMP PDE exhibited a Km of 2 microM for cyclic AMP and did not hydrolyse cyclic GMP. This activity was inhibited by <b>trequinsin</b> (IC 50 = 0. 2 microM), dipyridamole (IC 50 = 6 microM) and, selectively, by rolipram (IC 50 = 3 microM). Inhibitors of cyclic GMP PDE (M&B 22948) and of low Km (Type III) cyclic AMP PDE (SK&F 94120) only weakly inhibited the two endothelial PDEs. Incubation of intact cells with <b>trequinsin</b> and dipyridamole induced large increases in cyclic GMP, which were completely blocked by LY- 83583. Rolipram, SK&F 94120 and M&B 22948 did not significantly influence cyclic GMP accumulation. Dipyridamole enhanced the increase in cyclic GMP induced by sodium nitroprusside. Cyclic AMP accumulation was stimulated by dipyridamole and <b>trequinsin</b> with and without forskolin. Rolipram, although without effect alone, increased cyclic AMP in the presence of forskolin, whereas M&B 22948 and SK&F 94120 had no effects on resting or forskolin-stimulated levels. These results suggest that cyclic GMP-stimulated PDE regulates cyclic GMP levels and that both endothelial PDE isoenzymes contribute to the control of cyclic AMP...|$|E
40|$|Gravity {{alteration}} (micro- and hypergravity) {{is known}} to influence cell functions. As guanosine 3 ', 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) {{plays an important role}} in human melanocyte functions and different guanylyl cyclase isoforms are responsible for cGMP synthesis in human non-metastatic and metastatic melanoma cells, we investigated the effects of hypergravity on the regulation of cGMP levels in cultured human melanocytes and in melanoma cell lines with different metastatic potentials. Hypergravity was produced by horizontal centrifugal acceleration. Here we report that long-term application of hypergravity (up to 5 g for 24 h) stimulated cGMP efflux in cultured melanocytes and in non-metastatic melanoma cells in the presence of 0. 1 mM 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX), a non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. Under these conditions, cAMP synthesis and melanin production were up-regulated in pigmented melanocytes and non-metastatic melanoma cells. Hypergravity also stimulated cGMP transport in the presence of 1 microM <b>trequinsin,</b> an inhibitor of cGMP-binding PDE (PDE 5) and of transport by multidrug resistance proteins MRP 4 / 5, whereas 50 microM <b>trequinsin</b> partially inhibited cGMP transport. Transport was further inhibited by probenecid, an inhibitor of endogenous non-selective transporters as well as of MRP 4 / 5 and by cycloheximide as an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, hypergravity did not affect cGMP efflux in metastatic melanoma cells, which might be related to an up-regulated cGMP efflux at 1 g. The results of the present study indicate that hypergravity may stimulate cGMP efflux in melanocytes and in non-metastatic melanoma cells most probably by an enhanced expression of endogenous transporters and/or MRP 4 / 5. Thus, an altered acceleration vector may induce signaling events in melanocytic cell...|$|E

Solubilized PDE IV was {{at least}} 10 times more potently inhibited by selective PDE IV inhibitors (e. g. rolipram, denbufylline) than bound enzyme. Vanadate/glutathione complex (V/GSH) activated membrane-bound PDE IV and also increased potencies of these same inhibitors by at least 10 -fold. Neither solubilization nor V/GSH markedly influenced the inhibitory activities of non-selective inhibitors (e. g. <b>trequinsin,</b> dipyridamole). Inhibitor effects on solubilized PDE IV and cyclic AMP accumulation in intact cells were strongly correlated.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{the fifth}} common malignancy worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Targeted therapies for HCC are being extensively developed with the limited success of sorafinib. In the present study, we investigated the potential antitumor activity of zardaverine, a dual-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3 / 4 inhibitor in HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Although all zardaverine, PDE 3 inhibitor <b>trequinsin</b> and PDE 4 inhibitor rolipram increased intracellular cAMP levels through inhibiting PDE activity, only zardaverine significantly and selectively inhibited the proliferation of certain HCC cells, indicating that the antitumor activity of zardaverine is independent of PDE 3 / 4 inhibition and intracellular cAMP levels. Further studies demonstrated that zardaverine induced G 0 /G 1 phase cell cycle arrest of sensitive HCC cells through dysregulating cell cycle-associated proteins, including Cdk 4, Cdk 6, Cdk 2, Cyclin A, Cyclin E, p 21 and Rb. Notably, Rb expression was reversely related to the cell sensitivity to zardaverine. The present findings indicate that zardaverine may have potential as targeted therapies for some HCC, and the likely mechanism of action underlying its selective antitumor activity {{may be related to}} its regulation of Rb or Rb-associated signaling in cell cycles...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) donors {{increase}} {{heart rate}} (HR) through a guanylyl cyclase-dependent {{stimulation of the}} pacemaker current I(f), without affecting basal I(Ca-L). The activity of I(f) {{is known to be}} enhanced by cyclic nucleotides and by an increase in cytosolic Ca(2 +). We examined the role of cGMP-dependent signaling pathways and intracellular Ca(2 +) stores in mediating the positive chronotropic effect of NO donors. In isolated guinea pig atria, the increase in HR in response to 1 - 100 micromol/l 3 -morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN- 1; with superoxide dismutase, n= 6) or diethylamine-NO (DEA-NO, n= 8) was significantly attenuated by blockers of the cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE 3; <b>trequinsin,</b> milrinone or Ro- 13 - 6438, n= 22). In addition, the rate response to DEA-NO or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was significantly reduced following inhibition of PKA (KT 5720 or H- 89, n= 15) but not PKG (KT 5728 or Rp- 8 -pCPT-cGMPs, n= 16). Suppression of sarcoplasmic (SR) Ca(2 +) release by pretreatment of isolated atria with ryanodine or cyclopiazonic acid (2 micromol/l and 60 micromol/l, n= 16) significantly reduced the chronotropic response to 1 - 100 micromol/l SIN- 1 or DEA-NO. Moreover, in isolated guinea pig sinoatrial node cells 5 micromol/l SNP significantly increased diastolic and peak Ca(2 +) fluorescence (+ 13 +/- 1 % and + 28 +/- 1 %, n= 6, P< 0. 05). Our findings are consistent with a functionally significant role of cAMP/PKA signaling (via cGMP inhibition of PDE 3) and SR Ca(2 +) in mediating the positive chronotropic effect of NO donors...|$|E
40|$|Annexin 1 is {{secreted}} by mammalian cells but lacks {{a leader}} signal sequence necessary to lead {{it to the}} classical secretory pathway via the endoplasmic reticulum. The mechanisms involved in the secretion of leaderless proteins remain uncertain. It has been suggested to involve membrane translocation via an ABC-transporter (ATP binding cassette). Using cultured inflamed mucosa from rectocolitis induced in rats, we studied if annexin 1 secretion followed the two main characteristics of ABC-transporter substrates: dependency on ATP hydrolysis and competitive inhibition by several other ABC-transporter substrates. Annexin 1 secretion is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by two ATPase inhibitors. The inhibition reached 63. 2 +/- 3. 2 %, 66. 1 +/- 3. 73 % and 88. 6 +/- 1. 4 % {{in the presence of}} 2 mM vanadate, 0. 5 and 1 mM pervanadate, respectively. The efflux of calcein, a known ABC-transporter substrate, is similarly inhibited by 69. 4 +/- 2. 8 % in the presence of 1 mM pervanadate. Probenecid, an inhibitor of several ABC-transporters of the subfamilly ABCC or MRP (multidrug resistant associated protein), also inhibited annexin 1 secretion in a dose-dependent manner. As compared to control, 10 mM probenecid reduced annexin 1 secretion by 72 +/- 20 % and 20 mM by 95. 0 +/- 9 %. By contrast, annexin 1 secretion is not blocked by other inhibitors of MRP 1 (indomethacin, MK 571), MRP 2 (ochratoxin A 1 or MK 571), MRP 5 (<b>trequinsin</b> or sulfinpyrazone) or by verapamil, cyclosporin A or glyburide. Taken together, our results show that annexin 1 secretion appears to share the efflux properties of ABC-transporter substrates. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the cellular pathways along which nitric oxide (NO) stimulates renin secretion from the kidney. Using the isolated perfused rat kidney model we found that renin secretion stimulated 4 - to 8 -fold by low perfusion pressure (40 mmHg), by macula densa inhibition (100 μmol/liter of bumetanide), and by adenylate cyclase activation (3 nmol/liter of isoproterenol) was markedly attenuated by the NO synthase inhibitor nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-Name) (1 mM) and that the inhibition by l-Name was compensated by the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (10 μmol/liter). Similarly, inhibition of cAMP degradation by blockade of phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE- 1) (20 μmol/liter of 8 -methoxymethyl- 1 -methyl- 3 -(2 -methylpropyl) xanthine) or of PDE- 4 (20 μmol/liter of rolipram) caused a 3 - to 4 -fold stimulation of renin secretion that was attenuated by l-Name and that was even overcompensated by sodium nitroprusside. Inhibition of PDE- 3 by 20 μmol/liter of milrinone or by 200 nmol/liter of <b>trequinsin</b> caused a 5 - to 6 -fold stimulation of renin secretion that was slightly enhanced by NO synthase inhibition and moderately attenuated by NO donation. Because PDE- 3 is a cGMP-inhibited cAMP-PDE the role of endogenous cGMP {{for the effects of}} NO was examined by the use of the specific guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1 -H-(1, 2, 4) oxodiazolo(4, 3 a) quinoxalin- 1 -one (20 μmol). In the presence of 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxodiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one the effect of NO on renin secretion was abolished, whereas PDE- 3 inhibitors exerted their normal effects. These findings suggest that PDE- 3 plays a major role for the cAMP control of renin secretion. Our findings are compatible with the idea that the stimulatory effects of endogenous and exogenous NO on renin secretion are mediated by a cGMP-induced inhibition of cAMP degradation...|$|E
40|$|The human multidrug {{resistance}} proteins MRP 4 and MRP 5 are organic anion transporters {{that have the}} unusual ability to transport cyclic nucleotides and some nucleoside monophosphate analogs. Base and nucleoside analogs used in the chemotherapy of cancer and viral infections are potential substrates. To assess the possible contribution of MRP 4 and MRP 5 to resistance against these drugs, we have investigated the transport mediated by MRP 4 and MRP 5. In cytotoxicity assays, MRP 4 conferred resistance to the antiviral agent 9 -(2 -phosphonomethoxyethyl) adenine (PMEA) and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that, like MRP 5, MRP 4 transported PMEA in an unmodified form. MRP 4 also mediated substantial resistance against other acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, whereas MRP 5 did not. Apart from low-level MRP 4 -mediated cladribine resistance, the cytotoxicity of clinically used anticancer nucleosides was not influenced by overexpression of MRP 4 or MRP 5. In contrast, MRP 5 mediated efflux of the pyrimidine-based antiviral 2 ', 3 '-dideoxynucleoside 2 ', 3 '-didehydro- 2 ', 3 '-dideoxythymidine 5 '-monophosphate (d 4 TMP) and its phosphoramidate derivative alaninyl-d 4 TMP from cells loaded with the 2 ', 3 '-didehydro- 2 ', 3 '-dideoxythymidine prodrugs cyclosaligenyl-d 4 TMP and aryloxyphosphoramidate d 4 TMP (So 324), respectively. Moreover, only inside-out membrane vesicles derived from MRP 5 -overexpressing cells accumulated alaninyl-d 4 TMP.

40|$|Background: NO donors exert a {{positive}} chronotropic effect by stimulating the pacemaker current If in sino-atrial node cells via a mechanism requiring guanylyl cyclase (GC) and cGMP, and involving mobilization of sarcoplasmic (SR) Ca 2 +. Cyclic GMP can directly stimulate If {{but it is}} ∼ 10 -fold less potent than the 'physiological' If-gating nucleotide, cAMP. In ventricular myocytes, NO can increase cAMP levels through a cGMP-dependent inhibition of PDE 3. Aim: To elucidate the role of PDE 3, PKA and PKG in mediating the NO-If-dependent increase in HR. Methods and Results: In isolated guinea-pig atria with basal HR (B/L) of 174 ± 3 bpm (n= 69), we evaluated the HR response to increasing concentrations (from 0. 1 to 100 μmol/L) of the NO donors DEA-NO (n= 8) or SIN- 1 (+SOD 100 U/mL, n= 6) or to 10 μmol/L SNP (n= 9), (1) alone, and (2) after pretreatment (ca. 40 min) with inhibitors of (i) PDE 3 (milrinone, <b>trequinsin</b> or Ro- 13 - 6482, n= 22) or (ii) PKA (KT 5720 or H- 89, n= 15) or (iii) PKG (KT 5823 or Rp- 8 -pCPT-cGMPs, n= 16). Whereas PKG inhibition {{had no effect on}} the magnitude of the increase in HR with DEA-NO (see Fig; bars show the peak increase in HR, mean± SEM; =p< 0. 05 vs. B/L, †=p< 0. 05 vs. the HR response DEA-NO alone), inhibition of PDE 3 or PKA markedly attenuated the HR response to DEA-NO (and, similarly, to SIN- 1 or SNP; not shown). Conclusion: cGMP-PDE 3 -cAMP signalling plays a significant part in eliciting the 'direct' positive chronotropic response to NO donors. Since PKA is known to stimulate SR Ca 2 + release by phosphorylating ryanodine receptors, the present findings provide an important link between the activation of GC with NO donors and the NO-dependent mobilization of SR Ca 2 + in SA node which we reported previously.

40|$|Environmental signals such as {{an altered}} {{acceleration}} vector (micro- and hypergravity) may influence cell morphology, proliferation, response to growth factors, gene expression, and metabolism. Despite the growing interest in the regulation of signaling activities in normal and transformed cells under altered gravity conditions, little is known how normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells respond to such environmental factors. In human skin, melanocytes function as a pivotal protective barrier against UV irradiation and oxidative stress by generating the radical-scavenging pigment melanin. Moreover, as human skin is repeatedly exposed to mechanical stimuli, {{it has been found}} that human melanocytes may also sense mechanical forces such as mechanical pressure and cyclic stretch. As guanosine 3 ', 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) is known to play an important signaling role in human melanocytes and different guanylyl cyclase isoforms are responsible for the cGMP synthesis in nonmetastatic and metastatic melanoma cells, the effects of hypergravity on the regulation of cGMP levels in normal human melanocytes and in melanoma cell lines with different metastatic potential have been investigated. Hypergravity stimulus was provided using horizontal centrifugal acceleration. The present study demonstrates that long-term exposure of cultured human melanocytes and nonmetastatic melanoma cells to hypergravity (up to 5 g for 24 h) induced a decrease in intracellular and an increase in extracellular cGMP levels in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine as a nonspecific inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase-mediated cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis. Such alterations were equally prominent despite the presence of <b>trequinsin</b> and zaprinast as inhibitors of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases and of the cGMP transport by the multidrug resistance proteins MRP 4 and MRP 5. Importantly, expression and stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase isoform by a nitric oxide donor and of the membrane isoforms by natriuretic peptides were not changed by hypergravity in comparison to 1 g controls. Thus, the hypergravity-induced alteration in cGMP levels was due to a stimulation of the cGMP export into the extracellular space. On the other hand, cyclic AMP efflux in normal human melanocytes and nonmetastatic melanoma cells was not altered, but production of cAMP appeared to be stimulated by centrifugal acceleration as is evident by the similar increase in intra- and extracellular cAMP levels, which was associated with enhanced melanin formation in pigmented human melanocytes. In contrast, metastatic melanoma cells were apparently insensitive to hypergravity. Taken together, the present results indicate that the environment created by centrifugal acceleration represents a new factor for regulating cyclic nucleotide levels in human melanocytes...|$|E
40|$|Gravity {{alteration}} {{is known}} to affect cell proliferation, morphology, gene expression, and me-tabolism. To our knowledge, studies concerning the gravity influence on melanocyte physiol-ogy with respect to activation and cellular responses that are important for malignant trans-formation have been rarely reported. Since melanocytes are able to sense mechanical forces and transform them into biochemical signals {{it was assumed that}} these cells likewise respond to gravity alteration. We examined whether hypergravity (up to 5 g for 24 h) modulates the efflux of the second messenger cGMP under conditions of stimulated cGMP-synthesis. Due to the differential expression of functional guanylyl cyclase (GC) isoforms in normal human melanocytes (NHM) and melanoma cell lines we used direct NO donors (NONOates) which differ in their kinetics of NO release as stimulators of sGC and ANP as a GC-A modulator. Our results demonstrate that long-term application of hypergravity (5 g for 24 h) in the presence of DETA/NO induced a decrease in intracellular cGMP in NHMs and non-metastatic 1 F 6 melanoma cells compared to cGMP levels at 1 g. The corresponding extracellular cGMP levels increased suggesting that hypergravity enhances the cGMP efflux. This efflux was re-duced in the presence of <b>trequinsin</b> as a selective phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor and additionally a highly selective inhibitor of multidrug resistance protein 4 / 5, indicating that in melanocytes the hypergravity-stimulated cGMP efflux under PDE 5 inhibition is most proba-bly mediated by endogenous anion transporters and/or selective cGMP transporters like MRP 4 / 5. Short-term application (5 g up to 6 h) was not effective. Compared to the 1 g-controls there existed no differences between intra- and extracellular cGMP-levels. These results indicate that short-term centrifugation did not affect cGMP efflux in melanocytic cells. Interestingly, highly metastatic melanoma cells were apparently insensitive to a 24 hour centrifugation in the presence of ANP. These cells that do not express the NO-sensitive GC isoforms, showed no alteration in intra- and extracellular cGMP concentrations. Application of hypergravity did not alter the cAMP efflux in melanocytic cells, but the production of cAMP appeared to be stimulated by centrifugal acceleration. In summary, the presented in vitro experiments demonstrate that long-term exposure to hypergravity increases the cGMP efflux in NO-stimulated NHMs and non-metastatic melanoma cells, whereas highly metastatic melanoma cells are not sensitive. Thus an altered acceleration vector may induce cGMP-dependent signalling events in NO-stimulated human melanocytic cells...|$|E
