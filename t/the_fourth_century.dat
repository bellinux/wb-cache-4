5|$|During {{excavation}} of the site, four ceramic sherds {{were found in}} the vicinity which the excavator believed were possibly Early Iron Age in origin. Excavation also revealed 830 ceramic sherds dating from Roman Britain; although most of these were dated to <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> the sherds reflected all four centuries of this period. Dated to <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> was a hut that had been erected on a flat area adjacent to the barrow. Evidence of human activity at this hut was found in the form of 750 ceramic sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator noted that it was not typical of the item assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, thus suggesting that the building was a field shelter rather than a house.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> as the Roman Empire divided, Egypt {{found itself}} in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. In the waning years of the Empire, Egypt fell to the Sassanid Persian army (618-628 AD), was re{{captured}} by the Roman Emperor Heraclius (629-639 AD), and then was finally captured by Muslim Rashidun army in 639-640 AD, ending Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|The Eshmun {{sanctuary}} {{was damaged}} by an earthquake in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> BC, which demolished the marble temple atop the podium; this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed {{at the base}} of the podium.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of the games and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> that 5,000 animals were slain during the games.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} {{eighteen}} he inherited the baronetcy and became chief of the Clan Cumming; his line had been traced from <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> through Charlemagne. His inheritance included three Morayshire estates: Altyre near Forres, Gordonstoun near Elgin and Dallas. Though the estates totalled , they yielded poor revenues; the annual income from the estates in around 1890 {{has been described as}} either £60,000 or £80,000.|$|E
5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% by the end of <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> and 90% {{by the end of the}} fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on one end of the scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} fourth century Armenia, under king Tiridates III, {{became the first}} country to adopt Christianity as a state religion. A large number of Armenian monks are {{recorded}} to have settled in Jerusalem as early as <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> after the uncovering of Christian holy places in the city. However, the first written records are from the fifth century. Jerusalem is thus considered the oldest living diaspora community outside the Armenian homeland. Philip Marsden wrote that the survival of Armenians in Jerusalem–"most intense of all cities"—proves their extraordinary resilience.|$|E

50|$|A chapel at the site, {{dedicated}} to San Martino, is documented since <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>centuries.</b> Over <b>the</b> years the devotion the Virgin grew. By 1460, {{it was an}} arcipretale church with other dependant parishes. The church was rebuilt in the early 19th century, and completed in 1852. The interior has a sculpted late-gothic-style Ciborium.|$|R

5|$|Outside {{the temple}} {{building}} proper was the temple enclosure, {{surrounded by a}} rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of Persian invasion. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that {{the top of the}} wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.|$|E
5|$|Rituals {{in honor}} of Osiris are another major source of information. Some of these texts are found {{on the walls of}} temples that date from the New Kingdom, the Ptolemaic era (323–30 BCE), or the Roman era (30 BCE to <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> AD). Some of these late ritual texts, in which Isis and Nephthys lament their brother's death, were adapted into funerary texts. In these texts, the goddesses' pleas were meant to rouse Osiris—and thus the {{deceased}} person—to live again.|$|E
5|$|The Roman fortress' layout {{is similar}} to other {{imperial}} outposts in the region. An official Latin inscription that dates several area strongholds to the 3rd century CE was discovered on a large limestone slab at nearby Yotvata bears. This site was {{the largest in the}} area at , and included four projecting towers on the fortress' corners. Artefacts tell of probably destruction in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> CE, perhaps by a 344 earthquake, though it was promptly rebuilt with improved, stone flooring and again destroyed two decades later, probably from an earthquake in 363.|$|E

5|$|The {{roots of}} Christianity in Scotland were {{probably}} among {{the soldiers and}} ordinary Roman citizens {{who lived in the}} vicinity of Hadrian's Wall. The archaeology of the Roman period indicates that the northern parts of the Roman province of Britannia were among the most Christianised in the island. Chi-Rho inscriptions and Christian grave-slabs have been found on the wall from <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century,</b> and from the same period the Mithraic shrines (known as Mithraea) that existed along Hadrian's Wall were attacked and destroyed, presumably by Christians.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{it is seen}} in {{the time}} of Emperor Hadrian (r.117–138 CE), the {{punishment}} for parricide was basically made optional, in that the convict might be thrown into the arena instead. Furthermore, a rescript from Hadrian is preserved in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> CE grammarian Dositheus Magister that contains the information that the cart with the sack and its live contents was driven by black oxen.|$|E
5|$|Around 260 AD, {{the fall}} of the Agri Decumates {{territory}} north of the Rhine transformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire. Repeated raids by the Alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and economy, forcing the population to find shelter near Roman fortresses, like the Castrum Rauracense near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes), {{but at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>century</b> the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept, and the Swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of Germanic tribes.|$|E
