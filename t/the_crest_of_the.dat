5|$|The Household Brigade crossed <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied {{position}} and charged downhill. The cuirassiers guarding d'Erlon's left flank were still dispersed, {{and so were}} swept over the deeply sunken main road and then routed.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo {{position}} {{was a strong}} one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge ran the Ohain road, a deep sunken lane. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post {{for much of the}} day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge following the Ohain road.|$|E

5|$|American {{forces were}} quick to counter the attack. M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean forces {{were quick to}} advance up the Notch, to <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill {{that made up the}} pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
5|$|The crest is a {{modification}} of the Royal Crest of Canada: a lion wearing a crown and bearing a maple leaf. <b>The</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authority features the same lion, instead holding a white shield containing a red maple leaf, symbolising the governor general's authority under the Crown to grant armorial bearings to Canadians.|$|E
50|$|During the Ice Age, the Albanian Alps {{were covered}} with ice up to Vermosh, the northern-most village in Rugova. <b>The</b> layer <b>of</b> ice was thicker in Rugova, {{compared}} to the other mountain regions in Kosovo.

5|$|The New Zealand Division {{continued}} to advance, with the 2nd Brigade capturing Haplincourt on 3 September following a failed attempt the previous day. It moved onto the outer defences of the Hindenburg Line, including Trescault Spur, which overlooked the German positions. In conjunction with 37th Division and {{elements of the}} 38th Division, the New Zealanders attacked the spur on 12 September. <b>The</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spur was captured, although not the trench system on the far side. During this action, Sergeant Harry Laurent earned the VC for his exploits in leading a patrol that captured a company of Germans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For the particularity in <b>the</b> {{extraction}} parameters <b>of</b> ocean internal wave, a new {{intelligent system}} has been developed based on the author tool Multimedia ToolBook. In the intelligent system, the red dragged information point could be dragged on <b>the</b> positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding reference lines for MODIS remote sensing image including ocean internal wave, Dongsha Atoll, and <b>the</b> <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean internal waves. And the x or y coordinate value could be read through clicking the fill-able fields. Once meeting the calculated condition in intelligent system, it will estimate <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longest <b>crest,</b> <b>the</b> propagation direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean internal waves, and <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two adjacent <b>crests.</b> Moreover, it will reshow the Dongsha Atoll and <b>the</b> <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean internal waves as clicking <b>the</b> button <b>of</b> calculation. <b>The</b> new method that includes three steps adopted to display <b>the</b> measured <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean internal waves with the angled-lines, which has saved the interface resources, and has increased <b>the</b> measured number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crests</b> for <b>the</b> ocean internal waves from 6 in the previous intelligent system to 8 in this paper.

5|$|The {{earliest}} roads used by Europeans {{to cross}} the Sierra Nevada into California were branches of the California Trail. The first route near the present US 50 was the Carson Route, laid out in 1848 by an eastward Mormon party that wanted to avoid the Truckee Route and its deep crossings of the Truckee River. The group left Pleasant Valley, southeast of Placerville, on July 3, following Iron Mountain Ridge up to <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sierra at Carson Pass and then descending through Carson Canyon into the Carson Valley. Along the Humboldt River in Nevada, the Mormons met Joseph B. Chiles, who was leading a westward wagon train to California, and told him of their new trail. Although this new Carson Route crossed two summits— Carson Pass over <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sierra and West Pass over the Carson Spur just to the west, these crossings were easier than Donner Pass on the Truckee Route, and only three fords of the Carson River were required. The route became the primary westward route into California {{at the start of}} the Gold Rush. Through California, the general alignment of the Carson Route, in terms of today's highways, was State Route 88 over Carson Pass and Mormon Emigrant Trail and Sly Park Road to Pleasant Valley.|$|E
5|$|There is a clifftop {{walk from}} Jacob's Ladder along <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gorge {{and back to}} the road, with views of the gorge.

5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes dual {{carriageway}} from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford. There is then another section of single carriageway road, {{coming out of the}} valley and up to <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Ridge, before a further section of dual two lane road down from the hill crest near Berwick St Leonard. On reaching the valley, it reverts again to single carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts once more to single carriageway.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{represented}} {{in the form of}} a flag, the No. 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force uses the Saltire surmounted by a lion rampant as the device shown on the squadron crest. The station crest of the former RAF Leuchars, Fife, also showed the Saltire, in this case surmounted by a sword. <b>The</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former RAF East Fortune, East Lothian, also showed a sword surmounting the Saltire, however unlike Leuchars this sword was shown inverted, and the station crest of the former RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, showed a Saltire surmounted by an eagle's head. The East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron crest features a Saltire surmounted by an open book; the book itself being supported by red lions rampant.|$|E
5|$|High water {{remained}} in Salcha through the 31st, though <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flooding had passed. Water continued to cover roads {{in and around}} Salcha, and water-borne debris accumulated under several local bridges, causing impromptu dams. By August 1, the Salcha River had begun to recede to a noticeable extent. Though some roads remained underwater and falling trees knocked out power to areas of the town, residents began to pump out basements and begin recovery efforts. By early afternoon on the first, the Old Richardson Highway had been cleared of water and the National Weather Service canceled its flood warning for the Salcha area.|$|E

5|$|A popular {{hypothesis}} about <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lemuriform clade is {{that they}} evolved from European adapiforms known as adapids. In some adapids, <b>the</b> <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower incisors and canines align to form functional cropping unit, and the American paleontologist Philip D. Gingerich has suggested this foreshadowed <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lemuriform toothcomb.

5|$|In August, {{plans were}} {{in place for the}} Allied forces {{to break out of the}} ANZAC foothold. Key to this was seizing the Sari Bair Range. On 7 August, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade {{commenced}} its assault on Chunuk Bair, <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range, along what was known as Rhododendron Ridge. However, delays in getting the infantry battalions to their starting positions meant that the attack was launched in daylight rather than in the planned night time attack. As a result, heavy losses were incurred amongst the Auckland Infantry Battalion. Johnston, still in command of the brigade despite being clearly unfit for it, ordered Malone to take his battalion forward. Malone refused, arguing that his battalion could take Chunuk Bair that night. His refusal to advance in daylight meant that by the end of the day, his battalion was the only intact battalion in the brigade.|$|E

5|$|It rained for {{the next}} day and a half, {{preventing}} battle. During this time, Baum's men constructed a small redoubt at <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill and hoped that the weather would prevent the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived. Stark sent out skirmishers to probe the German lines, and managed to kill thirty Indians in spite of the difficulties of keeping their gunpowder dry. Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; travel was quite difficult due to the heavy rains. Burgoyne sent 550 men under Heinrich von Breymann, while Warner's company of about 350 Green Mountain Boys came south from Manchester under Lieutenant Samuel Safford's command.|$|E
40|$|An {{electron}} microscope study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cortex <b>of</b> Paramecium caudatum has revealed new details pertinent to several unresolved problems. <b>The</b> lateral boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alveoli do not regularly follow <b>the</b> <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polygonal ridges and thus their staining with silver cannot {{account for the}} external lattice seen by light microscopists. A granulo-fibrillar material is present, however, within <b>the</b> peaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridges, which would account for the external lattice if so stained. Perforations are present between adjacent alveoli which make <b>the</b> whole mosaic <b>of</b> alveolar sacs within the cell's cortex continuous—both the membranes and the lumen. A microfibrillar system exhibiting a cross-striated pattern lies in the superficial cortex. These bands are inserted at their ends in the epiplasm and have a fine structure and arrangement suggesting a muscular function. The infraciliary lattice is a branching system of fibers with electron-opaque posts at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> each branching locus. This system is distinct from the striated bands in morphology and in space. The epiplasm is discontinuous along <b>the</b> <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridges, which {{may account for the}} pellicles' disposition to tear along these lines. A three-dimensional drawing is presented to show the interrelationships between the above membranous and microfibrillar systems...|$|R

In the Ne, this storm-time effect is smaller than in VTEC, but also very well pronounced. In both VTEC and Ne, we observe a hemispheric asymmetry, as <b>the</b> northern EIA <b>crest</b> is better developed than the southern one.|$|R
