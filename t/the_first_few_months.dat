5|$|This {{action was}} {{one of a series of}} skirmishes known as the Forage War that persisted in {{northern}} New Jersey through <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of 1777, and it demonstrated that militia companies were capable of putting up a significant fight.|$|E
5|$|Carl Hans Lody, alias Charles A. Inglis (20 January 1877 – 6 November 1914; name {{occasionally}} {{given as}} Karl Hans Lody), was a reserve {{officer of the}} Imperial German Navy who spied in the United Kingdom in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the First English Civil War {{although}} Worcester {{changed hands}} three times, only one musket shot was fired, so until {{the start of}} the short unsuccessful siege of May 1643 the medieval walls were not subjected to bombardment by an early modern artillery train.|$|E
50|$|Mia Elliott was a {{groundbreaking}} character and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> protagonist on <b>the</b> American soap opera Love is a Many Splendored Thing. She was played for <b>the</b> show's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> by Nancy Hsueh, an American actress of Chinese and Scots-Irish origin.|$|R
50|$|The Shape of Things is Pere Ubu's fourth live album. It {{documents}} {{a performance}} within <b>the</b> band's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of existence, from the brief {{period in which}} Peter Laughner was a member. Initially produced only as a tour merchandise item, it has since been released to retail.|$|R
50|$|On October 26, 2011, {{audience}} member Hollee Chanel {{was chosen by}} Rosie {{to be the new}} announcer for the show, replacing actress Michelle Blakely. O'Donnell expressed that there would be further changes to the set and format over <b>the</b> show's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> as <b>the</b> program finds its vibe during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> season.|$|R
5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> {{the wing}} was not {{assigned}} any aircraft, and thus worked with other units {{who were in}} possession of the B-36 Peacemaker. In March and April, the base began preparing for operations of the B-36, which arrived later in April. This gave the newly activated 69th Bombardment Squadron {{a full complement of}} aircraft. By the end of August, the number had increased to 27 bombers, 322 officers, 313 airmen, and 350 civilians. Additionally, more buildings were constructed on base, making it more of a home for airmen and their families.|$|E
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of life.|$|E
40|$|During foetal life, {{at birth}} and in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> post-natal <b>months,</b> <b>the</b> brain is {{particularly}} vulnerable to damage. It is {{at this time that}} there is rapid development of the central nervous system, a merging of early primitive responses with more complex and later, highly integrated and adaptive responses, and the development of purposeful physical activities...|$|R
50|$|Each edition is {{hosted by}} main anchor McDevitt, with Early and Murphy. Regular guests include Shane Horgan, Richie Sadlier, Oisin McConville and Brian Murphy from San Francisco's KNBR radio station, who speaks weekly on US sports. Other guests in <b>the</b> show's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{included}} Irish football captain Robbie Keane, celebrated Irish rugby player Brian O'Driscoll, and respected authors Donald McRae, Jeremy Schaap and Paul Kimmage.|$|R
5000|$|One game in {{particular}} was cited for putting Sandberg (as well as the 1984 Cubs in general) [...] "on the map", an NBC national telecast of a Cardinals-Cubs game on June 23, [...] The Cubs had been playing well throughout <b>the</b> season's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> but as a team unaccustomed to winning, they had not yet become a serious contender {{in the eyes of}} most baseball fans.|$|R
5|$|In February 1937, Agnew entered Johns Hopkins University as a {{chemistry}} major. After <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{he found the}} pressure of the academic work increasingly stressful, and was distracted by the family's continuing financial problems and worries about the international situation, in which war seemed likely. In 1939 he decided that his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the University of Baltimore School of Law. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company.|$|E
5|$|Ridership {{initially}} {{fell short}} of forecasts, but grew from fewer than 40,000 passengers per day in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of operation to over 129,000 passengers per day in June 2013. Daily passenger traffic reached 130,000 in 2014, well below the forecast of 240,000 daily passengers for 2008. The system carried its first 100 million passengers by August 2010 and over 200 million passengers had taken the system by December 2012., followed by 400 million by December 2016.|$|E
5|$|Robson met Elsie Gray on a {{trip back}} to his parents' home in Langley Park. She was a student nurse, and later a teacher. They were married in June 1955 and Fulham {{teammate}} Tom Wilson was Robson's best man. After 1991, Robson was repeatedly diagnosed as suffering from cancer. He had several operations and, in 2006, was operated on for a brain tumour. This, on occasion, affected his work; while at Porto, for example, Robson suffered from malignant melanoma, which resulted in his missing <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the 1995–96 season.|$|E
25|$|Italy {{occupied}} Corfu two times: <b>the</b> <b>first</b> for a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> only in 1923 {{after the}} assassination of Italian officers; the second during World War II, from April 1941 to September 1943.|$|R
2500|$|The Tomahawk was {{superseded}} in North Africa by {{the more}} powerful Kittyhawk ("D"-mark onwards) types from early 1942, though some Tomahawks remained in service until 1943. Kittyhawks included many improvements and were the DAF's air superiority fighter for <b>the</b> critical <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of 1942, until [...] "tropicalised" [...] Spitfires were available. In 2012, the virtually intact remains of a Kittyhawk were found; it {{had run out of}} fuel in the Egyptian Sahara in June 1942.|$|R
50|$|The Rancho Los Amigos Scale is {{a complex}} scale that has eight {{separate}} levels, and is often used in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months</b> of coma while the patient is under closer observation, and when shifts between levels are more frequent.|$|R
5|$|Throughout <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the 2009 {{season the}} Mets and Phillies {{looked as though}} they would make this year into another close playoff race. By the end of May the Mets had won three out of the four games they played against each other; however, the Phillies {{retained}} a half game lead. Both clubs struggled in June as the Phillies slumped and the New York became plagued with injuries. By the end of June the Phillies had increased their division lead, but only to {{two and a half}} games.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws become {{sexually mature}} {{in their second}} year. Genetic {{analysis}} of pairs and offspring shows no evidence of extra-pair copulation {{and there is little}} evidence for couple separation even after multiple instances of reproductive failure. Some pairs do separate in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> but almost all pairings of over six months' duration are lifelong, ending only when a partner dies. Widowed or separated birds fare badly, often being ousted from nests or territories and unable to rear broods alone.|$|E
5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the Black Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that much in the Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> division's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> on <b>the</b> line, Chinese forces {{conducted}} three raids in its sector. In retaliation, the 245th Tank Battalion sent nine {{tanks to}} raid Agok. Two companies of Chinese forces ambushed and devastated a patrol from the 179th Infantry {{a short time}} later. In the spring, the division launched Operation Counter, which {{was an effort to}} establish 11 patrol bases around Old Baldy Hill. The division then defended the hill against a series of Chinese assaults from the Chinese 38th Army.|$|R
2500|$|The {{production}} {{opened at}} the St. James Theatre on April 19, 2001, and ran for 2,502 performances, closing on April 22, 2007. [...] The director and choreographer was Susan Stroman. The show originally starred Nathan Lane as Max Bialystock (who reprised that role during <b>the</b> show's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> on London's West End) and Matthew Broderick as Leo Bloom. Glen Kelly was the musical arranger and supervisor. The production won 12 Tony Awards, breaking the record held for 37 years by Hello, Dolly! which had won 10.|$|R

5|$|After an {{educational}} trip to Rome, undertaken in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of 1859, {{he spent the}} summer of that year studying at the University of Edinburgh under, among others, the chemist Lyon Playfair. In October, he matriculated as an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying {{for the first time}} and performed satisfactorily in examinations. In 1861, he transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was tutored in history by Charles Kingsley, Regius Professor of Modern History. Kingsley's efforts brought forth the best academic performances of Edward's life, and Edward actually looked forward to his lectures.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{after the}} election, Modi made trips {{to a number}} of {{different}} countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits. One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.|$|E

25|$|On 5 May 1967, the ensign was hoisted for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. A <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{later in}} September, the SNVF was renamed the People's Defence Force (Sea) under the Sea Defence Command (SDC). The SDC was again renamed the Maritime Command (MC) in 1968.|$|R
5000|$|A popular feature during <b>the</b> {{stations}} <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> Pirate Radio {{would invite}} listeners {{to call the}} station and [...] "flush your former station" [...] on the air. Callers would tell the on air personalities what Los Angeles area radio station they used to listen to before KQLZ signed on. After saying the competing radio stations id moniker or call letters, {{the sound of a}} toilet flushing could be heard. This was meant to insinuate that the listener dumped their former station and made the switch to [...] "Pirate Radio 100.3FM".|$|R
5|$|Further details, {{including}} {{the matter of}} Sinar Harapan share of stock and the publisher, were decided at a meeting at Wanandi's office in March 1983. The next month, on 25 April, the first edition— totalling eight pages— was published. The first newsroom of the new paper were located in Kompas former laundry room, a one story warehouse; the first employees {{had to do the}} layout by hand, using pica poles as straight edges. During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> the writers translated and recycled previously published stories from Indonesian media, which were later picked up by foreign wire services. Original reporting was rare as the editors at first did not want to deal with the censorship of Suharto's New Order government.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hero was an H-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides {{as part of the}} Mediterranean Fleet. During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of World War II, Hero searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean and participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940 before she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in May where she escorted a number of convoys to Malta. The ship took part in the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940, Operation Abstention in February 1941, and the evacuations of Greece and Crete in April–May 1941.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hunter was a H-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed on both sides by Britain and France, until she struck a mine in May 1937. She was under repair {{for the next year}} and a half, after which she rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet. During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of World War II, Hunter searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean until she was transferred back to Britain in February 1940. Returning to action in the Norwegian Campaign, she was sunk by German destroyers during the First Battle of Narvik in April 1940.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{acceptance}} to the yeshiva, {{a student}} must sign a document stating {{that he will}} not enter shidduchim for his first three months at the yeshiva. Students entering for the winter term can begin dating on Tu Bishvat; students entering for the summer term can begin dating on 17 Tammuz. The three-month periods are known colloquially as [...] "The Freezer." [...] The Freezer policy is designed to minimize students' distractions during <b>the</b> crucial <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of studies, allowing them to be better integrated into the yeshiva schedule and into the Yeshiva as a whole.|$|R
5000|$|Very severe SMA (type 0/1) can be {{sometimes}} evident {{before birth}} - reduction in fetal {{movement in the}} final months of pregnancy.

50|$|During its days as an {{independent}} station {{and then as a}} Fox affiliate, WFTS presented hourly news and weather updates, featuring a person reading the day's headlines or the current forecast. During <b>the</b> station's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> on <b>the</b> air, the newsbreaks were provided by WNSI-AM (1380, now WWMI) in an audio-only format, over a News Check slide. Later on, news updates began to feature on-camera newsreaders at WFTS's studios. By the late 1980s, the news and weather updates were titled 28 Newsbreak or 28 Weatherbreak. These news updates were discontinued in December 1994 upon the station's switch to ABC.|$|R
