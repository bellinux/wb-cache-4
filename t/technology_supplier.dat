40|$|International audienceThis paper explores how {{transaction}} {{attributes of}} technology affect {{differences in the}} relationship between <b>technology</b> buyers and <b>suppliers.</b> It also examines the impact on performance of different patterns of relationship between <b>technology</b> buyers and <b>suppliers.</b> Data obtained from 147 manufacturing firms in Malaysia are used to test several hypotheses, which were derived from {{a review of the literature}} on technology, transaction cost theory and buyer-supplier relationships (BSR). The research results indicate that the higher the level of technological complexity, specificity and uncertainty, the more firms are likely to engage in a closer relationship with <b>technology</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Even though the majority of firms reported improvements in their performance, results indicate that firms demonstrating a closer relationship with <b>technology</b> <b>suppliers</b> are more likely to achieve higher levels of performance than those that do not. It is also shown that with high levels of transaction attribute, implementation performance suffers more when firms have weak relationships with <b>technology</b> <b>suppliers</b> than with moderate and low levels of transaction attribute...|$|R

However, as these technologies are configurational, the notion of best practice is illusory. Data on the diffusion and design of information systems for production management across four European countries indicate distinctive national differences. It is argued that these can best be explained at two levels: first, national differences in the social institutional networks through which information about these systems is diffused socially shapes patterns of adoption and design; second pre‐existing patterns of work design and managerial practices may influence the degree of “fit” between particular design philosophies and prevailing organizational contexts in different countries.

40|$|This study {{proposes to}} analyse in an {{exploratory}} way {{the state of}} innovation and production systems in Swiss biotechnology and especially its innovative capacity and related factors. As biotechnology as such cannot be considered as an industrial sector {{but rather as a}} set of technologies developed in the field of life sciences, the direct link with science makes innovative capacity a major determinant of competitiveness. While large multinationals, such as biopharmaceuticals, may not need local <b>technology</b> <b>suppliers,</b> the presence of a local industry of research-based firms and <b>technology</b> <b>suppliers</b> is critical, because the industry is, by itself, a major source of growth and social progress.
