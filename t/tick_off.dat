5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback. Texas' offense thus began its drive at its 20-yard line. The first play of the drive was an end-around that gained 10yards and a first down for Texas. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Mitchell gained five yards on a counter run. On third down, Williams caught a six-yard pass for a first down at the Texas 41-yard line. Mitchell ran six yards on first down, but was stopped after a gain of just one yard on second down. The second-down play caused the final seconds to <b>tick</b> <b>off</b> the clock in the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 1410.|$|E
5|$|Cosell:... but (the game)'s {{suddenly}} {{been placed}} in total perspective for us; I'll finish this, they're in the hurry-up offense.Gifford: Third down, four. (Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds <b>tick</b> <b>off</b> to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, {{you have got to}} say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, we have to say it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E

500|$|Though Skelton {{had always}} done live engagements at Nevada hotels and {{appearances}} such as state fairs during his television show's hiatus, he focused his time and energy on live performances after {{he was no longer}} on the air, performing up to 125 dates a year. He often arrived days early for his engagement and would serve as his own promotion staff, making the rounds of the local shopping malls. [...] Before the show, his audiences received a ballot listing about 100 of his many routines and were asked to <b>tick</b> <b>off</b> their favorites. [...] The venue's ushers would collect the ballots and tally the votes. [...] Skelton's performance on that given day was based on the skits his audience selected. After he learned that his performances were popular with the hearing-impaired because of his heavy use of pantomimes, Skelton hired a sign language interpreter to translate the non-pantomime portions of his act for all his shows. He continued performing live until 1993, when he celebrated his 80th birthday.|$|E

60|$|But {{mostly the}} sport is Oriental. He {{believes}} his women-folk should not be too patent. Somewhere behind grilles or flower-ornamented fire escapes they await him. There, no doubt, they tread on rugs from Teheran and are diverted by the bulbul and play upon the dulcimer and feed upon sweetmeats. But away from his home {{the sport is}} an integer. He does not, as men of other races in Manhattan do, become the convoy in his unoccupied hours of fluttering laces and high heels that <b>tick</b> <b>off</b> delectably the happy seconds of the evening parade.

60|$|Nothing {{could now}} unfix his {{gaze from the}} little ring of metal with its black interior. The pain in his {{forehead}} was fierce and incessant. He felt it gradually penetrating the brain more and more deeply, until at last its progress was arrested by the wood {{at the back of}} his head. It grew momentarily more insufferable: he began wantonly beating his lacerated hand against the splinters again to counteract that horrible ache. It seemed to throb with a slow, regular recurrence, each pulsation sharper than the preceding, and sometimes he cried out, thinking he felt the fatal bullet. No thoughts of home, of wife and children, of country, of glory. The whole record of memory was effaced. The world had passed away--not a vestige remained. Here in this confusion of timbers and boards is the sole universe. Here is immortality in time--each pain an everlasting life. The throbs <b>tick</b> <b>off</b> eternities.|$|E

6000|$|... "The North Dakota did {{not take}} part in the {{movement}} of the morning of May 1. This was due to a slight accident of the preceding night that temporarily disabled her steering-gear. The morning of May 1 broke clear and calm. There was a slight breeze from the south-west that quickly died away. The North Dakota lay twelve miles off the island. At the signal the squadrons charged in upon the island, from all sides, at full speed. Our wireless receiver continued to <b>tick</b> <b>off</b> warnings from the island. The ten-mile limit was passed, and nothing happened. I watched through my glasses. At five miles nothing happened; at four miles nothing happened; at three miles, the New York, in the lead on our side of the island, opened fire. She fired only one shot. Then she blew up. The rest of the vessels never fired a shot. They began to blow up, everywhere, before our eyes. Several swerved about and started back, but they failed to escape. The destroyer, Dart XXX, nearly made the ten-mile limit when she blew up. She was the last survivor. No harm came to the North Dakota, and that night, the steering-gear being repaired, I gave orders to sail for San Francisco." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{think we}} can, {{if we are}} to see it in terms of college buildings, class rooms, tutors, professors and the like. Here again, just {{as in the case of}} schooling, we have to raise the {{neglected}} problem--neglected so far as education goes--of economy of effort; and we have to look once more at the new facilities that our educational institutions have so far refused to utilize. Our European colleges and universities have a long and honourable tradition that again owes much to the educational methods of the Roman Empire and the Hellenic world. This tradition was already highly developed before the days of printing from movable type, and long before the days when maps or illustrations were printed. The higher education, therefore, was still, as it was in the Stone Age, largely vocal. And the absence of paper and so forth, rendering notebooks costly and rare, made a large amount of memorizing necessary. For that reason the medi√¶val university teacher was always dividing his subject into firstly and secondly and fourthly and sixthly and so on, so that the student could afterwards <b>tick</b> <b>off</b> and reproduce the points on his fingers--a sort of thumb and finger method of thought--still to be found in perfection in the discourses of that eminent Catholic apologist, Mr. Hilaire Belloc. It is a method that destroys all sense of proportion between the headings; main considerations and secondary and tertiary points get all catalogued off as equivalent numbers, but it was a mnemonic necessity of those vanished days.|$|E
