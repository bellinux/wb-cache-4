50|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the tracking}} is {{the act of}} measuring the direction and magnitude of charged particles momenta. The particles entering a tracker (the device used for tracking), release part of their energy in the device: the tracker has to be finely segmented {{in order to be}} able to reconstruct with good precision where the particle passed. Since the tracking is usually made in a region where a magnetic field is present, it is possible to reconstruct part of the helix made by the particle inside the tracker (that is called track), and from the <b>track</b> <b>parameters,</b> and by knowing the mass of the particle under study (which is known by the use of particle identification), it is possible to reconstruct the actual direction and magnitude of the particle momenta.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of high-energy electrons in the ATLAS Inner Detector {{is dominated by}} radiative energy losses (bremsstrahlung) as they traverse matter.
