5|$|During {{his time}} in Kansas, Beilhart obsessively {{investigated}} a variety of beliefs, including Christian Science, Divine Science, Spiritualism, and <b>Theosophy.</b> He found, however, {{that none of these}} religions held his interest. In time, he came to the realization that he would not adhere to any one denomination, but develop a faith of his own by combining aspects of several different religions.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Theosophy,</b> it is {{believed}} the Seven Stars of the Pleiades transmit the spiritual energy of the Seven Rays from the Galactic Logos to the Seven Stars of the Great Bear, then to Sirius. From there is it sent via the Sun to the god of Earth (Sanat Kumara), and finally through the seven Masters of the Seven Rays to the human race.|$|E
5|$|Eric Oey of the University of California, Berkeley, {{writes that}} the novel's mysticism builds into a {{promotion}} of <b>theosophy</b> and Buddhist ideals: Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio read about both, then leave their materialistic lives to become more spiritual. Ultimately, he writes, the concept of reincarnation is put forth when Roosminah is discovered soon after Lily's death. Faruk of Gadjah Mada University also notes the novel's concept of reincarnation, drawing on its repeated emphasis on the parallels (both physical and psychological) between the half-sisters Marsiti and Gwat Nio, as well as Lily and Roosminah.|$|E
50|$|Modern Theosophists {{hold the}} book as a {{revealed}} work dictated to Blavatsky by <b>Theosophy's</b> Masters.|$|R
25|$|Given {{the spread}} of such ideas in the West, some critics have {{perceives}} <b>Theosophy's</b> role as being largely obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Oracle's spirituality school offers courses, workshops, conferences, and retreats which {{focus on}} the five primary {{religions}} (Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam), New Age <b>theosophies,</b> peace-building, and sustainability. Oracle also regularly hosts classes conducted by ambassadors from The Federation of Damanhur.|$|R
5|$|Fortune was a {{ceremonial}} magician. The magical principles on which her Fraternity was based were adopted {{from the late}} nineteenth century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with other influences coming from <b>Theosophy</b> and Christian Science. The magical ceremonies performed by Fortune's Fraternity were placed into two categories: initiations, in which the candidate was introduced to magical forces, and evocation, in which these forces were manipulated for a given purpose.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{claims that}} Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga {{correlate}} to Western esoteric traditions, {{and that both}} stem from a core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant's appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has {{much in common with}} <b>Theosophy,</b> although Grant differed from the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in <b>theosophy</b> and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt like he had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
500|$|Art {{critic and}} curator Jenny McFarlane {{considered}} Fuller's {{work to be}} complex, drawing not only on European modernist academic traditions and Australian subjects, but also at times, incorporating [...] "radical stylistic innovations" [...] that drew on Indian artistic tradition and <b>theosophy's</b> ideas.|$|R
25|$|The {{idea of a}} brotherhood {{of secret}} adepts had a long {{pedigree}} stretching back several centuries before the foundation of Theosophy; such ideas {{can be found in}} the work of the Rosicrucians, and was popularised in the fictional literature of Edward Bulwer-Lytton. The idea of having messages conveyed to a medium through by spiritually advanced entities had also been popularised at the time of <b>Theosophy's</b> foundation through the Spiritualist movement.|$|R
50|$|The Hollywood Krotona {{building}} {{located at}} Primrose and Vista Del Mar was erected in 1919. Tenants have included Annie Sullivan Knudsen (sugar cane heiress), New Yorker Grace Shaw Duff, Henry Hotchener, Marie Russak, silver screen stars Mary Astor and Charlie Chaplin, and record producer Joshua Rumer of Invengo Records. When the Krotonians, spurred by Madame Blavatsky, found Hollywood suffocating their peace-filled <b>theosophies,</b> {{they decided to}} move to Ojai California and that is where they have been ever since.|$|R
5|$|It was in {{this manner}} that Fortune and Loveday claimed that they {{received}} a text, The Cosmic Doctrine, which was dictated to them in segments by the Masters between July 1923 and February 1925. These communications discussed the existence of seven planes of the universe, and were {{very similar to the}} ideas promoted in Moriarty's writings, in particular his Aphorism of Creation and Cosmic Principles. The cosmology present in this book was also similar to that presented in <b>Theosophy.</b> In the following years, Fortune distributed this material among her senior students, before publishing an edited version of The Cosmic Doctrine in 1949.|$|E
5|$|New Age thought {{typically}} envisions {{the world}} as developing through cosmological cycles which can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from <b>Theosophy,</b> although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived {{in an age of}} spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.|$|E
5|$|Paradoxically, {{since the}} first decade of the 21st century, New World Order conspiracism is {{increasingly}} being embraced and propagandized by New Age occultists, who are people bored by rationalism and drawn to stigmatized knowledge—such as alternative medicine, astrology, quantum mysticism, spiritualism, and <b>theosophy.</b> Thus, New Age conspiracy theorists, such as the makers of documentary films like Esoteric Agenda, claim that globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order are simply misusing occultism for Machiavellian ends, such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of the New World Order for the purpose of taking advantage of the growing 2012 phenomenon, which has its origins in the fringe Mayanist theories of New Age writers José Argüelles, Terence McKenna, and Daniel Pinchbeck.|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, {{the minds}} of men, cut adrift from their ancient moorings, wandered wildly over pathless seas of {{speculative}} doubt, {{and especially in the}} more metaphysical and contemplative East, attempted to solve for themselves the questions of man's relation to the unseen by those thousand schisms, heresies, and <b>theosophies</b> (it is a disgrace to the word philosophy to call them by it), on the records of which the student now gazes bewildered, unable alike to count or to explain their fantasies.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the growth}} of the theosophical {{movement}} in the 19th century, and influenced by <b>theosophy's</b> articulations on the Maitreya, non-Buddhist religious and spiritual movements have adopted and reinterpreted the concept in their doctrines. Share International, which equates Maitreya with the prophesied figures of multiple religious traditions, claims that he is already present in the world, but is preparing to make an open declaration of his presence in the near future. They claim that he is here to inspire mankind to create a new era based on sharing and justice.|$|R
30|$|Undoubtedly Goldberg {{has done}} {{extensive}} research on Eugenia Vassilievna Peterson, the spirited {{woman who would}} become Indra Devi, yet The Goddess Pose {{is far from a}} scholarly treatise. Goldberg frequently veers off the main narrative into digressive expositions of historical people, places, and events with less success. Scholars and serious readers of modern yoga will recognize many of these vignettes as simplified reiterations of others writing in the field—such as early Western enthusiasm for Eastern esotericism and occult practices, <b>Theosophy’s</b> modernizing impact on the yoga tradition, and Thoreau’s oft-quoted, “to some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a yogin” (98).|$|R
5|$|Various esoteric {{organizations}} {{that emerged in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the Theosophical Society and the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, repeated the beliefs that had originated with Sethos: that Egyptians underwent initiation within the pyramids and that Greek philosophers were initiates who learned Egypt's secret wisdom. Esoteric writers influenced by <b>Theosophy,</b> such as Reuben Swinburne Clymer in his 1909 book The Mystery of Osiris and Manly Palmer Hall in Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians in 1937, also wrote of an age-old Egyptian mystery tradition. An elaborate example of these beliefs is the 1954 book Stolen Legacy by George James, which claims that Greek philosophy was built on knowledge stolen from the Egyptian school of initiates. James imagined this mystery school as a grandiose organization with branches on many continents, so that the purported system of Egyptian mysteries shaped cultures all over the world.|$|E
5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from <b>Theosophy.</b> Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E
25|$|As of 2001, {{the scholar}} of {{religion}} Olav Hammer could still note that books presenting the Theosophical doctrines were mostly apologetic in nature. Examples of such works include William Q. Judge's 1893 book Ocean of <b>Theosophy</b> and Robert Ellwood's 1986 book <b>Theosophy.</b> He noted {{that most of}} these works treated Theosophical doctrine {{as if it were a}} fixed entity and provided little or no discussion of how they have changed over the decades. Hammer also lamented that while scholarship on <b>Theosophy</b> was developing, it had not focused on the reformulation of <b>Theosophy</b> by Leadbeater and Besant or with the developing ideas of post-Theosophical writers like Steiner or Bailey.|$|E
50|$|Campbell {{noted that}} for non-Theosophists, the claims {{regarding}} {{the existence of}} the Masters are among the weakest made by the movement. Such claims are open to examination and potential refutation, with challenges to {{the existence of the}} Masters therefore undermining Theosophical beliefs.The idea of a brotherhood of secret adepts had a long pedigree stretching back several centuries before the foundation of Theosophy; such ideas {{can be found in the}} work of the Rosicrucians, and was popularised in the fictional literature of Edward Bulwer-Lytton.

5000|$|The {{process at}} Ojai, {{whatever}} its cause or validity, was a cataclysmic milestone for Krishna. Up until this time his spiritual progress, chequered {{though it might}} have been, had been planned with solemn deliberation by <b>Theosophy's</b> grandees. ... Something new had now occurred for which Krishna's training had not entirely prepared him. ... A burden was lifted from his conscience and he took his first step towards becoming an individual. ... In terms of his future role as a teacher, the process was his bedrock. ... It {{had come to him}} alone and had not been planted in him by his mentors ... it provided Krishna with the soil in which his newfound spirit of confidence and independence could take root.|$|R
40|$|A coyote in {{the outer}} world" is an {{observational}} exploration by an American Indian about the influences of culture change upon his own ancient Navajo traditions since 1868. The colonial model of an authoritarian bureaucratic state of faceless disempowered citizens serves as the abrupt change-agent for native and native American culture since circa 1780. Observations, opinions and culture specific models exemplify the culture-specific oral traditions contained in the complex mythologies, interpersonal <b>theosophies</b> and wisdom of the Navajo's kin-based community. Also included are strategies for self-definition that help distinguish between and revitalize one's ancient ancestral and contemporary historic oral traditions. Conveying American Indian perspectives about culture based self-definition in the United States reiterates that the Coyote is actively utilizing methodologies appropriate to his native perspective and acknowledges the dearth of scientific buttressing of culture specific observations...|$|R
25|$|<b>Theosophy</b> and spiritualism {{were both}} very popular metaphysical {{schools of thought}} {{especially}} in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs.

500|$|Fuller's time at Adyar was eventful. Leadbeater arrived {{around the}} same time as Fuller, and soon {{afterward}} he [...] "discovered" [...] the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, Jiddu Krishnamurti (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and Portrait of the Lord Buddha. McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is [...] "strikingly modern" [...] in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later. The painting owes much to <b>theosophy's</b> emphasis on seeing the subject [...] "through a psychic, visionary experience".|$|R
5000|$|Mundy {{followed}} this with Om: The Secret of Ahbor Valley, which was serialised in Adventure from October to November 1924, before publication by Bobbs-Merrill. The characters were based upon individuals {{that he knew}} at Lomaland, and the story expounded Theosophical ideas regarding the Masters {{and the existence of}} a universal [...] "Ancient Wisdom". Adventure included a disclaimer {{at the start of the}} story stating that they did not endorse the esoteric movement. Ellis described the work as Mundys [...] "most significant novel", and his [...] "literary masterpiece", while for Taves, it was [...] "his most distinctly literary book, surpassing earlier novels by exhibiting a maturing skill in choice of language, plot structure, theme, depth of character." [...] Mundy received hundreds of letters praising the work, and it also received good critical reviews from press. It proved popular among Theosophists, with Tingley asking Mundy if he would adapt it for one of her theaters. The British edition underwent six reprints in quick succession, while Swedish and German translations were soon commissioned for publication. At the prompting of several letters, Mundy began work on a sequel, Ramsden, which appeared in Adventure in June 1926 before being published by Bobbs-Merrill under the title of The Devils Guard. Upon publication it received good reviews. A third instalment in the trilogy, The Red Flame of Erinpura, appeared in Adventure in 1927. Taves later noted that these three works reflected <b>Theosophys</b> [...] "most direct influence upon Mundys writing", adding that in looking to Asia not only [...] "for exoticism, but for wisdom and an alternative mode of living superior to Western habits", they [...] "reinvigorated and revitalized fantasy-adventure literature".|$|R
5000|$|Gwenda Robb and Elaine Smith, {{in their}} Concise Dictionary of Australian Artists, {{considered}} Fuller's art {{to be created}} in [...] "a free painterly style indebted to Impressionism". During {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century, reviews drew attention to her distinctively Australian style. When one of Fuller's works was included in an exhibition of colonial artists in London (including paintings from Canada and Australia), the correspondent from the Adelaide Advertiser described Fuller's contribution as [...] "most Australian in feeling". Reviewing her work hung in the Royal Academy in 1904, a Perth critic reported: [...] "Of the 16 or 17 Australian artists exhibiting at the Academy, Miss Fuller was the only one who chose a typically Australian scene. Her picture shows a young girl in thin white, clinging, dress, standing on a bushy piece of country ... As the London Observer says, the atmosphere that bathes the graceful figure of the girl is capitally managed with its note of subtropical heat". One reviewer thought very highly of her portraits, but was less convinced about Fuller's approach to the Australian light, writing:She had less success with our landscapes than with her figure subjects. That was the result of her passion for toning her pictures for ultimate indoor hanging. Thereby she lost, or illuminated, the hard Australian, hard light and shade, and startling relative values. Observable too was the influence of the English school in her rendering of our foliage; never could she bring herself to see our trees as dim coloured as they usually are.Art critic and curator Jenny McFarlane considered Fuller's work to be complex, drawing not only on European modernist academic traditions and Australian subjects, but also at times, incorporating [...] "radical stylistic innovations" [...] that drew on Indian artistic tradition and <b>theosophy's</b> ideas.|$|R

25|$|Parallels between <b>Theosophy</b> and Bailey are many, for instance, one {{principle}} of <b>Theosophy,</b> the Law of Attraction was discussed in esoteric writings by Blavatsky, Annie Besant, William Quan Judge, and others; {{and was also}} discussed {{in the writings of}} Alice Bailey, including a whole chapter in one of her books.
