5000|$|Most {{originally}} fitted dTPMS {{have the}} sensors {{mounted on the}} inside of the rims and the batteries are not exchangeable. With a battery change then meaning that the whole sensor will have to be replaced and the exchange being possible only with the <b>tires</b> <b>dismounted,</b> the lifetime of the battery becomes a crucial parameter. To save energy and prolong battery life, many dTPMS sensors do not transmit information when not rotating (which eliminates spare tire monitoring) or apply a complex, expensive two-way communication which enables wake-up of the sensor. For OEM auto dTPMS units to work properly, they need to recognize the sensor positions and must ignore the signals from other vehicles. There are numerous tools and procedures to make the dTPMS [...] "learn" [...] or [...] "re-learn" [...] this information, some driver implemented, others done by workshops. The cost and variety of spare parts, procedures and tools has led to trouble and confusion for customers and workshops.|$|R
50|$|A {{tire changer}} is a machine {{used to help}} <b>tire</b> {{technicians}} <b>dismount</b> and mount <b>tires</b> with automobile wheels. After the wheel and tire assembly are removed from the automobile, the tire changer has all the components necessary to remove and replace the tire from the wheel. Different tire changers allow technicians to replace tires on automobiles, motorcycles and heavy-duty trucks. New tire and wheel technology has improved certain tire changers {{to be able to}} change a low profile tire or a run-flat tire.|$|R
25|$|Supposedly {{while serving}} in the Philippines, Wheeler {{encountered}} an infantryman who was complaining about the heat and being <b>tired.</b> Wheeler promptly <b>dismounted,</b> took the man's rifle and pack, told him to mount his horse, and marched {{the rest of the}} way with the infantry.|$|R

[...] "You would hardly know the <b>tired</b> jade you <b>dismounted</b> from last night, when she is brought out prancing and neighing the next morning, rested, refreshed, and ready to start again--especially if the brute hath some good blood, for such pick up unco fast." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, both my suitors {{came to the}} race; {{the youth}} on a large war-horse, trapped with gold, which curvetted in a prodigious manner, and seemed {{impatient}} for a gallop; the old roan on a mule, carrying a great bag at his side, and looking already <b>tired</b> out. They <b>dismounted</b> on the place chosen for the trial, which was a meadow. It was encircled by a world of spectators; and the greybeard and myself (for his age gave him the first chance) only waited {{for the sound of}} the trumpet to set off.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Rudolf {{wanted to}} prevent Henry's escape. The long pursuit had {{weakened}} the cavalry. Rudolf ordered the knights with <b>tired</b> horses to <b>dismount</b> {{and strengthen the}} infantry. The Saxon commander Otto of Nordheim led these forces on a direct assault across the swampy Gruna. Meanwhile, the remains of Rudolf's knights attempted to circle the swamp. While Henry and Rudolf's knights fought {{on the periphery of}} the swamp, Otto was able to force his way through Henry's screening force and broke into Henry's camp. Otto retained control of his force and prevented them from plundering the camp. Otto's force then fell on the remains of Henry's army engaged with the rest of Rudolf's forces.|$|R
50|$|However, Sun Jian's {{biography}} in the Sanguozhi did {{mention a}} similar incident about Sun's scarf, {{but it did}} not involve Hua Xiong. It stated that when Sun Jian garrisoned at Liangdong (梁東), he came under heavy attack by Dong Zhuo (led by Xu Rong) and he brought tens of horsemen with him {{to break out of the}} encirclement. He was wearing a red scarf then, so he took it off and passed it to Zu Mao. Dong Zhuo's men recognised the scarf and pursued Zu Mao, while Sun Jian took another path and escaped. Zu Mao became <b>tired</b> so he <b>dismounted,</b> tied the scarf to a half-burnt pillar, and hid in the bushes nearby. Dong Zhuo's men approached the pillar, surrounded it, and left when they saw that it was just a pillar. Zu Mao was not killed in that skirmish at Liangdong, but what happened to him after that incident was not recorded in history. Hu Zhen was not killed in that battle, and he served under Li Jue and Guo Si's government after Dong Zhuo's death.|$|R
