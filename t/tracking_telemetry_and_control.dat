The use of IP systems enables disadvantaged field users to access and task space capabilities. At the same time, it encourages common interfaces that lead to reconfigurable and standardized vehicle design for operationally responsive space missions. As such, IP can be an enabler for constellations of tactical small satellites. In order to utilize IP and distributed tasking, one must consider issues such as security, prioritization, and contention control. This {{is the role of}} the VMOC. Each user must log on through a VMOC server that authenticates the user, validates the operations that user is authorized to perform, and verifies the prioritization level that user holds.

There is uncertainty in the arrival time of new data sets to be processed, and resource allocation must be robust {{with respect to this}} uncertainty. The tasks to be executed by the platform are classified into two broad categories: high priority (e. g., <b>telemetry,</b> <b>tracking,</b> <b>and</b> <b>control),</b> <b>and</b> revenue generating (e. g., data processing and data research). In this environment, the resource allocation of the high-priority tasks must be done before the resource allocation of the revenue generating tasks. A two-part allocation scheme is presented in this research. The goal of first part is to find a resource allocation that minimizes makespan of the high-priority tasks. The robustness for {{the first part of the}} mapping is defined as the difference between this time and the expected arrival of the next data set. For the second part, the robustness of the mapping is the difference between the expected arrival time and the time at which the revenue earned is equal to the operating cost. Thus, the heuristics for the second part find a mapping that minimizes the time for the revenue (gained by completing revenue generating tasks) to be equal to the cost. Different resource allocation heuristics are designed and evaluated using simulations, and their performance is compared to a mathematical bound.
