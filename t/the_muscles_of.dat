5|$|Impaired {{muscle power}} – With {{impairments}} in this category, the force generated by muscles, such as <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> one limb, {{one side of}} the body or {{the lower half of the}} body is reduced, (e.g. spinal cord injury, spina bifida, post-polio syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre does so via motor neurons which activate <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E
5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E

5|$|The SA node {{is found}} in all amniotes but not in more {{primitive}} vertebrates. In these animals, <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Indeed, since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium. The rate of heartbeat varies enormously between different species, ranging from around 20 beats per minute in codfish to around 600 in hummingbirds and up to 1200 bpm in the ruby-throated hummingbird.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. <b>The</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E

5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers {{travel in the}} vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance {{the function of the}} vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E

5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically involves <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> {{the proximal}} {{arms and legs}} (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E

40|$|Background: Heavy metals {{contaminated}} environment constitutes {{a serious problem}} for human and other organisms. Moreover, metals such as Cd, Pb, and Cr are toxic metals. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to evaluation of Cd, Pb, and Cr in <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> cow, calf, and sheep slaughtered in Sanandaj city from Iran. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study in Sanandaj city in November 2014. A total number of 40 individual animals belonging to cow, calf, and sheep were analyzed for Cd, Pb, and Cr concentrations in <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> samples. Heavy metals were assayed by using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results: The results of present study indicated that the mean concentrations <b>of</b> Pb in <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> cow, calf, and sheep were 15. 1, 13. 1, and 9. 9 mg/kg.

40|$|The present {{experimental}} work w as planned, {{referring to the}} current theory of muscular contraction, to acquire some definite knowledge {{of the effect of}} physical training on the chemical components in <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> used for <b>the</b> energy sources in the muscular contraction. For this purpose, the comparative contents of phosphagen, orthophosphate, total acid soluble phosphorus, glycogen, lactic acid, and hemoglobin in <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> welltrained carrier pigeon, non-trained carrier pigeon and the domestic fowl, were determined quantitatively [...] Then, the same determination was done on <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carrier pigeon in which the training had been interrupted for the period of 1 to 4 months inclusively. There is {{no significant difference in the}} phosphorus compounds in <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> between <b>the</b> well-trained carrier pigeon and the non-trained one. The same is true for the lactic acid in <b>the</b> <b>muscle.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> glycogen and, hemoglobin in <b>the</b> <b>muscle,</b> however, conspicuous increase is dected in the well-trained carrier pigeons compared with the non-trained one. The increase of glycogen and hemoglobin in <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trained bird is surely resulted from the effects of physical training, for the increased glycogen and hemoglobin disappear gradually after the cessation of training, while disappearance occurs, rapidly in the former than in the latter. 近年に於て筋收縮學説が著しい發達を途げたにも拘らず, 運動の練習によつて筋肉内のエネルギー源に如何なる變動が起つて居るか, 即ち筋收縮のエネルギー源となる諸物質の中で何物が練習效果として蓄積量を増加するかに就いて研究した例が殆ど存在しない事に着目し, 著者は傳書鳩を材料として其の問題の解決を企てた。現行筋收縮學説に從へば筋の收縮に際しエネルギー源となる化學反應に最初から關係する物質は・燐化合物中の phosphagen(creatinephosphate),adenylpyrophosphate (addnosinetriphosphate), 含水炭素中の glycogen である。又是はエネルギ源とする譯には行かないが最近組織呼吸に關して重要視されて來た hemoglobin も相當問題になる物質である。故に以上の諸物質に加ふるに orthophosphate, 酸溶性燐總量及び乳酸の貯藏量の問題を探究する事とし, 先づ其の分祈法を吟味した。然るに以上諸物質の分析法として多くは既知の法を其の儘用ひで不都合を感じなかつたが, あるものは多少不完全と思はれる點もあつたので適宜改訂輩加へて利用する事とした。從つて先づ其の方法の概要を記載したる後, 實驗の結果を次のく順次に記載した...|$|R
