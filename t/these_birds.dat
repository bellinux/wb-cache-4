5|$|According to British writer Errol Fuller, aviculturalists are rumoured to have bred birds {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the Cuban macaw. <b>These</b> <b>birds,</b> however, are reportedly larger in size than the Cuban macaw, having been bred from larger macaw species.|$|E
5|$|After two failed attempts, {{about 60}} common {{starlings}} were released in 1890 into New York's Central Park by Eugene Schieffelin. He {{was president of}} the American Acclimatization Society, which tried to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare into North America. About the same date, the Portland Song Bird Club released 35 pairs of common starlings in Portland, Oregon. <b>These</b> <b>birds</b> became established but disappeared around 1902. Common starlings reappeared in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1940s and <b>these</b> <b>birds</b> were probably descendants of the 1890 Central Park introduction. The original 60 birds have since swelled in number to 150 million, occupying an area extending from southern Canada and Alaska to Central America.|$|E

30|$|Thousands {{of years}} of {{evolution}} speak volumes in terms of understanding what constitutes the natural environmental condition within which a given species evolved, and fire specialists (those species that are relatively restricted to a narrow range of post-fire conditions) can provide a window into what probably constitute natural fire regimes.

5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for <b>these</b> <b>birds</b> in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted <b>these</b> <b>birds.</b> Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that {{the discrepancy between the}} paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVarious {{combinations}} {{of data and}} expert opinion {{have been used to}} select species for indices of <b>bird</b> trends. Commonly <b>these</b> indices break species into groups based on their habitat preference such as woodland specialist, farmland specialist and generalist birds. It is unclear what influence differences in how species are allocated to these groups might have on trends in these indices. There is uncertainty surrounding reported trends in <b>these</b> <b>bird</b> groups with studies variously showing declines or increases in prevalence. This is usually attributed to ecological factors but if studies classify bird groups differently this variation may be due to inconsistency in classification. Disagreement about whether <b>these</b> <b>bird</b> groups are stable, increasing or declining has the potential to obscure important changes in bird prevalence and impede appropriate, timely conservation. We examined how consistently European and Australian researchers classified woodland, farmland and generalist birds, and whether this affected the trends in indices of these groups. Researchers from both regions classified species differently, and the population trends seen in these groups were strongly affected by differences in classification. While all classifications we studied suggest that populations are consistently declining for Australian woodland and European farmland birds and increasing for European woodland birds. European generalist and Australian farmland and generalist birds may be seen as increasing or decreasing in prevalence depending on classification. Our results question the current practice of idiosyncratically classifying indicators in scientific research and conservation. Current practice is making it more difficult to infer whether, when and how to preserve bird groups in Europe and Australia, potentially leading to sub-optimal biodiversity outcomes. We offer suggestions for building consensus on how to classify <b>these</b> <b>bird</b> groups in order to provide more reliable evidence to support conservation decisions...|$|R
