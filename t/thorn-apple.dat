6000|$|... [1] The Jamestown weed (or <b>thorn-apple).</b> [...] "This, {{being an}} early plant, was {{gathered}} very young for a boiled salad, {{by some of}} the soldiers sent thither [i.e. to Virginia] to quell the rebellion of Bacon; and some of them ate plentifully of it, the effect of which was a very pleasant comedy, for they turned natural fools upon it for several days: one would blow up a feather in the air; another would dart straws at it with much fury; and another, stark naked, was sitting up in a corner like a monkey, grinning and making mows at them; a fourth would fondly kiss and paw his companions, and sneer in their faces, with a countenance more antic than any in a Dutch droll. In this frantic condition they were confined, lest they should, in their folly, destroy themselves,--though it was observed that all their actions were full of innocence and good nature. Indeed, they were not very cleanly. A thousand such simple tricks they played, and after eleven days returned to themselves again, not remembering anything that had passed."--Beverly's History of Virginia, p. 120.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were other}} open spaces {{covered with a}} {{vegetation}} almost as interesting as the canes and the trees: this was where what were called [...] "weeds" [...] were allowed to flourish. Here were the <b>thorn-apple,</b> chenopodium, sow-thistle, wild mustard, redweed, viper's bugloss, and others, both native and introduced, in dense thickets five or six feet high. It was difficult to push one's way through these thickets, and one was always in dread of treading on a snake. At another spot fennel flourished by itself, {{as if it had}} some mysterious power, perhaps its peculiar smell, of keeping other plants at a proper distance. It formed quite a thicket, and grew to a height of ten or twelve feet. This spot was a favourite haunt of mine, as it was in a waste place at the furthest point from the house, a wild solitary spot where I could spend long hours by myself watching the birds. But I also loved the fennel for itself, its beautiful green feathery foliage and the smell of it, also the taste, so that whenever I visited that secluded spot I would rub the crushed leaves in my palms and chew the small twigs for their peculiar fennel flavour.|$|E
60|$|On {{approaching}} the house I {{saw that there}} had formerly been a large plantation behind it, of which only a few dead stumps now remained, the ditches that had enclosed them being now nearly obliterated. The place was ruinous and overgrown with weeds. Dismounting, I led my horse along a narrow path through a perfect wilderness of wild sunflowers, horehound, red-weed, and <b>thorn-apple,</b> up to some poplar trees where there {{had once been a}} gate, of which only two or three broken posts remained standing in the ground. From the old gate the path ran on, still through weeds, {{to the door of the}} house, which was partly of stone and partly of red brick, with a very steep, sloping, tiled roof. Beside the ruined gate, leaning against a post, with the hot afternoon sun shining on her uncovered head, stood a woman in a rusty-black dress. She was about twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, and had an unutterably weary, desponding expression on her face, which was colourless as marble, except for the purple stains under her large, dark eyes. She did not move when I approached her, but raised her sorrowful eyes to my face, apparently feeling little interest in my arrival.|$|E
60|$|As Martin grew {{in years}} and strength, his age being now about seven, his rambles began to extend beyond the waste grounds outside of the fenced orchard and gate. These waste grounds were a {{wilderness}} of weeds: here were the sunflowers that Martin liked best; the wild cock's-comb, flaunting great crimson tufts; the yellow flowering mustard, taller than the tallest man; giant thistle, and wild pumpkin with spotted leaves; the huge hairy fox-gloves with yellow bells; feathery fennel, and the big grey-green <b>thorn-apples,</b> with prickly burs full of bright red seed, and long white wax-like flowers, that bloomed only in the evening. He could never get high enough on anything {{to see over the}} tops of these plants; but at last he found his way through them, and discovered on their further side a wide grassy plain with scarcely a tree on it, stretching away into the blue distance. On this vast plain he gazed with wonderment and delight. Behind the orchard and weedy waste the ground sloped down to a stream of running water, full of tall rushes with dark green polished stems, and yellow water-lilies. All along the moist banks grew other flowers that were never seen in the dry ground above--the blue star, and scarlet and white verbenas; and sweet-peas of all colours; and the delicate red vinegar flower, and angel's hair, and the small fragrant lilies called Mary's-tears, and tall scattered flags, flaunting their yellow blossoms high above the meadow grass.|$|R
60|$|When I woke I did not {{remember}} for some moments where I was. Feeling about me, my hand {{came in contact with}} the grass wet with dew. It was very dark, only low down in the sky a pale gleam of light gave promise, as I imagined, of coming day. Then recollection flashed upon me, and I sprang up alarmed to my feet, only to discover with inexpressible relief that the light I had remarked was in the west, not the east, and proceeded from the young moon just sinking beneath the horizon. Saddling my two animals expeditiously, I rode to Peralta's estancia, and on arriving there carefully drew the horses into the shadow of a clump of trees growing on the borders of the ancient, wellnigh obliterated foss or ditch. I then dropped on to the ground so as to listen better for approaching footsteps, and began waiting for Demetria. It was past midnight: not a sound reached me except at intervals the mournful, far-away, reedy note of the little nocturnal cicada that always seemed to be there lamenting the lost fortunes of the house of Peralta. For upwards of half an hour I remained lying on the ground, growing more anxious every moment and fearing that Demetria was going to fail me, when I caught a sound like a human whisper. Listening intently, I found that it pronounced my name and proceeded from a clump of tall <b>thorn-apples</b> some yards from me.|$|R
60|$|The old, half-ruined {{house in}} the midst of the dusky desolation began to assume in the {{moonlight}} a singularly weird and ghost-like appearance. Near me on one side was an irregular row of poplar-trees, and the long, dark lines cast from them by the moon fell across a wide, open space where the rank-growing <b>thorn-apples</b> predominated. In the spaces between the broad bands made by the poplar-tree shadows, the foliage appeared of a dim, hoary blue, starred over with the white blossoms of this night-flowering weed. About these flowers several big, grey moths were hovering, suddenly appearing out of the black shadows and when looked for, noiselessly vanishing again in their mysterious ghost-like manner. Not a sound disturbed the silence except the faint, melancholy trill of one small night-singing cicada from somewhere near--a faint, aerial voice that seemed to be wandering lost in infinite space, rising and floating away in its loneliness, while earth listened, hushed into preternatural stillness. Presently a large owl came noiselessly flying by, and, perching on the topmost boughs of a neighbouring tree, began hooting a succession of monotonous notes, sounding like the baying of a bloodhound at a vast distance. Another owl by and by responded from some far-off quarter, and the dreary duet was kept up for half an hour. Whenever one bird ceased his solemn boo-boo-boo-boo-boo, I found myself with stilled breath straining my sense to catch the answering notes, fearing to stir lest I should lose them. A phosphorescent gleam swept by close to my face, making me start at its sudden appearance, then passed away, trailing a line of faint light over the dusky weeds. The passing firefly served to remind me that I was not smoking, and the thought then occurred to me that a cigar might possibly have the effect of relieving me from the strange, indefinable feeling of depression that had come over me. I put my hand into my pocket and drew out a cigar, and bit the end off; but when about to strike a vesta on my matchbox, I shuddered and dropped my hand.|$|R
60|$|One summer day, since this, I {{came this}} way, on foot, {{along the shore}} from Boston. It was so warm that some horses had climbed to {{the very top of}} the ramparts of the old fort at Hull, where there was hardly room to turn round, for the sake of the breeze. The Datura stramonium, or <b>thorn-apple,</b> was in full bloom along the beach; and, at sight of this cosmopolite,--this Captain Cook among plants,--carried in ballast all over the world, I felt as if I were on the highway of nations. Say, rather, this Viking, king of the Bays, for it is not an {{innocent}} plant; it suggests not merely commerce, but its attend-ant vices, as if its fibres were the stuff of which pirates spin their yarns. I heard the voices of men shouting aboard a vessel, half a mile from the shore, which sounded as if they were in a barn in the country, they being between the sails. It was a purely rural sound. As I looked over the water, I saw the isles rapidly wasting away, the sea nibbling voraciously at the continent, the springing arch of a hill suddenly interrupted, as at Point Alderton,--what botanists might call premorse,--showing, by its curve against the sky, how much space it must have occupied, where now was water only, On the other hand, these wrecks of isles were being fancifully arranged into new shores, as at Hog Island, inside of Hull, where everything seemed to be gently lapsing, into futurity. This isle had got the very form of a ripple,--and I thought that the inhabitants should bear a ripple for device on their shields, a wave passing over them, with the datura, which is said to produce mental alienation of long duration without affecting the bodily health, [1] springing from its edge. The most interesting thing which I heard of, in this township of Hull, was an unfailing spring, whose locality was pointed out to me, on the side of a distant hill, as I was panting along the shore, though I did not visit it. Perhaps, if I should go through Rome, it would be some spring on the Capitoline Hill I should remember the longest. It is true, I was somewhat interested in the well at the old French fort, which was said to be ninety feet deep, with a cannon at the bottom of it. On Nantasket beach I counted a dozen chaises from the public-house. From time to time the riders turned their horses toward the sea, standing in the water for the coolness,--and I saw the value of beaches to cities for the sea breeze and the bath.|$|E

5000|$|Datura quercifolia, {{commonly}} known as the oak-leaf <b>thorn-apple</b> or the Chinese <b>thorn-apple,</b> is a small shrub in the genus Datura. It can grow within dry or moist soils and requires large amount of sunlight to grow.|$|E

50|$|Datura innoxia, often spelled inoxia, (sometimes {{called by}} the common names pricklyburr, {{recurved}} <b>thorn-apple,</b> downy <b>thorn-apple,</b> Indian-apple, lovache, moonflower, nacazcul, toloatzin, tolguache or toloache) is a species in the family Solanaceae. It is rarely called sacred datura, but this name in fact refers to the related Datura wrightii. It is native to Central and South America, and introduced in Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe. The scientific name is often cited as D. innoxia. When English botanist Philip Miller first described the species in 1768, he misspelled the Latin word innoxia (inoffensive) when naming it D. inoxia. The name Datura meteloides was for some time erroneously applied to {{some members of the}} species, but that name has now been abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Datura discolor, {{also called}} the desert <b>thorn-apple,</b> is an {{herbaceous}} annual plant native to the Sonoran Desert of western North America, where it grows in sandy soils and washes. All parts of the plant contain a mix of alkaloids that are potentially lethal when enough is ingested. Deaths from careless recreational use of Datura and related plants are frequently reported.|$|E
50|$|Datura is a genus of nine {{species of}} {{poisonous}} vespertine flowering plants {{belonging to the}} family Solanaceae. They {{are commonly known as}} daturas, but also known as devil's trumpets, {{not to be confused with}} angel's trumpets, its closely related genus Brugmansia. They are also sometimes called moonflowers, jimsonweed, devil's weed, hell's bells, <b>thorn-apple,</b> and many more. Its precise and natural distribution is uncertain, owing to its extensive cultivation and naturalization throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the globe. Its distribution within the Americas and North Africa, however, is most likely restricted to the United States and Mexico and Southern Canada in North America, and Tunisia in Africa, where the highest species diversity occurs.|$|E
40|$|In {{the tomato}} (Lycopersicon esculentum) plant, the fruit juice {{was found to}} be the richest source of agglutinating activity. The lectin {{responsible}} could be inhibited by oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine, and this property was exploited to purify the lectin by affinity adsorption on trypsin-treated erythrocytes. The lectin is a glycoprotein that cross-reacts immunologically with the lectin from Datura stramonium (<b>thorn-apple)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} drought on young plants of <b>thorn-apple</b> were {{evaluated}} by (a) the area and water content of leaves, dry weight of leaves, stems, shoots and roots, (b) stomatal frequency of upper and lower leaf epidermis, (c) allelopathic activity of water extracts of leaves and roots on germination and root growth of cucumber. No {{differences were found between}} irrigated and droughted plants in leaf water content, leaf area, dry weight and derived parameters of growth analysis. Stomatal frequency was increased by drought in both upper and lower epidermis. Leaf extracts stimulated root length of cucumber, having no effect in the number of lateral roots. Root extracts reduced root length and number of lateral roots. Differences in allelopathic activity of irrigated and droughted plants were found only in root extracts. Therefore, even if <b>thorn-apple</b> growth is not affected, the drought treatment alters secondary metabolites activity and stomatal frequency. Differences of allelopathic activity between leaf and root extracts and within root extracts are discussed in terms of sites of production of alkaloids, their activity and relative investment on plant building vs. production of secondary metabolites...|$|E
40|$|Plants of Datura {{stramonium}} (<b>thorn-apple)</b> were dissected {{into their}} component tissues and examined {{for the presence}} of the Datura lectin. This lectin was easily detected in seeds and {{in various parts of the}} flowers of adult plants. Traces were also found in green (emerged) cotyledons and roots of seedlings. The specific lectin activity in seeds contained within the fruits increased as the seeds matured. Mature seeds were homogenized in sucrose and separated by differential centrifugation into four fractions, three of which were clearly of distinct composition. Most of the lectin activity sedimented with the low-speed (cell-wall/protein-body) pellet, but a similar specific activity was recovered from the other fractions. However, if EDTA was included in the homogenization medium, three or four times more lectin activity was recovered in the soluble fraction. Immunofluorescent staining of formaldehyde-fixed sections showed that the lectin was localized in the cytoplasm, with little associated with cell walls. The possible relevance of these results to the function of the lectin in plant cells is discussed...|$|E
