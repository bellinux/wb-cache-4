5000|$|The Acco Super Bulldozer is {{the largest}} tracked and most {{powerful}} <b>tracked</b> <b>bulldozer</b> ever made. It was built in Portogruaro in northern Italy, by the Umberto Acco company. The Acco super bulldozer was constructed mainly of Caterpillar parts, however many other components were specially adapted. The dozer blade, for example, is bigger than anything Caterpillar has ever made. This bulldozer has a gross weight of 183 tons and is powered by two [...] Caterpillar engines placed horizontally opposed, which deliver a total combined output of [...] The super bulldozer has a blade that is 23 ft wide and 9 ft high, whilst the total length of the bulldozer is over 40 ft, {{from the tip of}} the blade to the ripper on the rear. The ripper alone is about 10 ft tall, being powered by huge hydraulic rams.|$|E
50|$|While the 51st Battalion was {{climbing}} up the Hermon mountainside, the motorized column with two tanks kept advancing up the road toward the outpost. The tanks were followed by the 17th Battalion forces in the following order: Company C, under Captain Yaakov Sela, the reconnaissance company's squad commanders course company, totaling at thirty-three fighters on three half-tracks. The fourth half-track was the 17th Battalion commander's command post. Drori's command half-track, followed by Company B, with eighty fighters on seven half-tracks. The brigade doctor, Captain Doctor Shraga Myblum, with two paramedics from the brigade infirmary, joined one of the half-tracks. The advance was uneventful until the lower ski-lift position. The tanks deployed {{in the parking lot}} south of the ski lift and fired at the constructions, which were empty since the 13th Battalion fighters left them on Sunday. The constructions were searched and it turned out the Syrians did not reach them. The Israeli flag was removed to be hoisted on the outpost after its recapture. A <b>tracked</b> <b>bulldozer</b> belonging to a contractor who had worked on the upper ski lift was started on Drori's order and attached to the column in case a roadblock was needed. At 09:20, Drori reported to NC that he had passed the lower ski lift and was heading toward the upper ski lift.|$|E
50|$|Track Marshall was a {{brand of}} {{earthmoving}} equipment who were active during WWII building tanks. Later, they produced a range of crawler tractors, based on the wheeled tractor Field Marshall brand. In 1956 the first <b>Track</b> Marshall <b>bulldozer</b> model was introduced and later the Challenger 3 followed by the Challenger 33, the TM55 and also the successful six-cylinder TM70 (probably equivalent to a Caterpillar D5). They also built the TM 955 track loader (a drott) and also a range of rubber <b>tracked</b> <b>bulldozers.</b> The company was in business for some 50 years, eventually closing in 1990 after new machines replaced older technology.|$|R
5|$|Eglin steel uses a {{combination}} of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low-cost steel for use in bunker buster weapons. Hadfield steel (after Sir Robert Hadfield) or manganese steel contains 12–14% manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form an incredibly hard skin which resists wearing. Examples include tank <b>tracks,</b> <b>bulldozer</b> blade edges and cutting blades on the jaws of life.|$|R
50|$|Most often bulldozers {{are large}} and {{powerful}} tracked heavy equipment. The tracks give them excellent ground holding capability and mobility through very rough terrain. Wide tracks help distribute the bulldozer's weight over a large area (decreasing ground pressure), thus preventing it from sinking in sandy or muddy ground. Extra wide tracks are known as swamp tracks or LGP (low ground pressure) <b>tracks.</b> <b>Bulldozers</b> have transmission systems designed {{to take advantage of}} the track system and provide excellent tractive force.|$|R
40|$|A new hybrid {{electric}} <b>tracked</b> <b>bulldozer</b> {{composed of}} an engine generator, two driving motors, and an ultracapacitor is put forward, which can provide high efficiencies and less fuel consumption comparing with traditional ones.

40|$|The multi-energy {{management}} strategy of {{electric drive system}} of <b>tracked</b> <b>bulldozer</b> was researched. Firstly, based on power requirement of typical working condition of a <b>tracked</b> <b>bulldozer,</b> the power distribution strategy for three energy sources in the front power chain was proposed by using wavelet theory and fuzzy control theory. Secondly, the electric drive system simulation platform was built in MATLAB/Simulink. At last, a driver-controller based HILS (hardware-in-the-loop simulation) platform was built and the multi-energy {{management strategy}} was verified. The HILS result shows that front power chain’s power output can meet the back power chain’s requirement, the engine-generator set works near the best fuel consumption curve, and the battery pack’s charge-discharge frequency and current are low. Thus the designed multi-energy management strategy {{can be used in}} real-time control of electric drive bulldozer...|$|E

This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] series hybrid electric <b>tracked</b> <b>bulldozer</b> (HETB) ’s fuel economy heavily depends on its energy management strategy. This paper presents a model predictive controller (MPC) to solve the energy management problem in an HETB for the first time. A real typical working condition of the HETB is utilized to develop the MPC. The results are compared to two other strategies: a rule-based strategy and a dynamic programming (DP) based one. The latter is a global optimization approach used as a benchmark. The effect of the MPC’s parameters (e. g. length of prediction horizon) is also studied. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed approach has approximately a 6 % improvement in fuel economy over the rule-based one, and it can achieve over 98 % of the fuel optimality of DP in typical working conditions. To show {{the advantage of the}} proposed MPC and its robustness under large disturbances, 40 % white noise has been added to the typical working condition. Simulation results show that an 8 % improvement in fuel economy is obtained by the proposed approach compared to the rule-based one.

40|$|Pacific Island Countries {{including}} Fiji {{have large}} tract of forest areas and plantation forestry mainly for log production. With the current increases in world {{oil prices and}} Fiji’s dependence on oil for its transport and energy sector, Fiji is looking at renewable energy sources from forest biomass to minimise reliance on oil for energy production and also to utilise forest residues arising from annual harvesting operations. Fiji‘s current harvesting system is mainly semi-mechanised with manual felling, delimbing and conversion. Rubber tiered skidders are mainly used for tree hauling from the cut-over areas to the landings although in native forest logging <b>tracked</b> <b>bulldozers</b> are used. Current log supply volume form the forest totals to 300, 000 tonnes per annum {{and is expected to}} increase to 500, 000 tonnes from 2010. Fiji Pine Limited, the owners of the plantations, also see forest biomass sale as a source of revenue especially with the planned increase in log supply volume. Independent power producers will soon be demanding biomass for their renewable energy production. This research will compare conventional with integrated harvesting on Pinus caribaea plantations, establishing production estimates and costs for biomass supply. This research is to be undertaken for a PhD degree at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The forest residue production research based on commercial harvesting operations {{will be the first to}} be conducted for Pacific Island Countries and hence it is hoped the research findings can be widely applied...|$|R

50|$|This shrub {{grows on}} low-nutrient soils in cold regions, often soils that overlie permafrost. It is {{most common in}} moist areas, such as the shores of lakes and bays, riverbanks, bogs, and wet forest floors. It is often a pioneer species in the primary phase of {{ecological}} succession, taking hold in areas cleared of vegetation such as floodplains, bare tundra, cleared spots on taiga, and newly formed dunes. It grows along the scoured edges of receding glaciers and in old <b>bulldozer</b> <b>tracks.</b> Clearing events such as floods, oil spills, and wildfire may increase the abundance of the species. It is a good plant to use for revegetation efforts on wet, disturbed habitat in subalpine and boreal regions.|$|R
