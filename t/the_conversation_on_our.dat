40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{argue that the}} {{epistemology}} of trust and testimony should {{take into account the}} pragmatics of communication in order to gain insight about the responsibilities speakers and hearers share in the epistemic access they gain through communication. Communication is a rich process of information exchange in which epistemic standards are negotiated by interlocutors. I discuss examples which show the contextual adjustment of these standards as <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> goes <b>on.</b> <b>Our</b> sensitivity to the contextual dimension of epistemic standards make us more reponsible communicators...|$|R
40|$|At Purdue University, the Libraries {{participate}} in a provost-initiated, campus-wide course redesign program called Instruction Matters: Purdue Academic Course Transformation (IMPACT). This initiative aims to bring active-learning to foundational courses traditionally taught through lectures. Purdue librarians recognized the IMPACT initiative as one way to enter <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> blooming <b>on</b> <b>our</b> campus {{about the nature of}} learning, curriculum design, and how space design impacts potential learning. This article presents three perspectives: 1) the information literacy coordinator, 2) a libraries’ administrator with a gift for space planning, and 3) an in-the-trenches liaison to course redesign projects. Each discusses the IMPACT initiative from his or her unique perspective and view of its impact on librarian roles. Collectively, the article explains why we think it is essential that this kind of campus effort is supported by libraries...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{interesting}} things of watching a movie is understanding the implied meaning of <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> based <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own imagination. However, it can mislead the implied meaning of the movie itself. Therefore, the writer is interested in finding out the right way to get the implied meaning of conversation in a movie, especially <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> that flouted <b>the</b> maxims. In this research, the writer used the theory of conversational implicature and flouting of maxims by Grice (1975). In addition, the context of situation by Hymes (1964) is used to get the implied meaning more easily. Furthermore, the data is <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> among <b>the</b> main characters, that is, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger in ?Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire? movie which provide many examples of responding utterances that flouted the maxims. In analyzing the data, first, the writer found <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> that flouted <b>the</b> maxims based on the context and the scene. Second, the writer classified the types of the maxims. Then, the writer analyzed the implied meaning based on the context of situation. The result of the analysis shows that the context of situation gave contribution in analyzing the implied meaning...|$|R
40|$|While {{the most}} ambitious polls are based on {{standardized}} interviews with a few thousand people, millions are tweeting freely and publicly in their own voices about issues they care about. This data offers a vibrant 24 / 7 snapshot of people’s response to various events and topics. The sheer scale of the data on Twitter allows us to measure in aggregate how the various issues are rising and falling in prominence over time. However, {{the volume of the}} data also means that an intelligent tool is required to allow the users {{to make sense of the}} data. To this end, we built a novel, interactive web-based tool for mapping <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> landscapes <b>on</b> Twitter. <b>Our</b> system utilizes recent advances in natural language processing and deep neural networks that are robust with respect to the noisy and unconventional nature of tweets, in conjunction with a scalable clustering algorithm an interactive visualization engine to allow users to tap the mine of information that is Twitter. We ran a user study with 40 participants using tweets about the 2016 US presidential election and the summer 2016 Orlando shooting, demonstrating that compared to more conventional methods, our tool can increase the speed and the accuracy with which users can identify and make sense of <b>the</b> various <b>conversation</b> topics <b>on</b> Twitter...|$|R
