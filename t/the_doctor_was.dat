5|$|McKinley {{urged his}} aides {{to break the}} news gently to Ida, and to call off the mob that had set on Czolgosz—a request that may have saved his assassin's life. McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station, where <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> unable to locate the second bullet. Although a {{primitive}} X-ray machine was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds, it was not used. McKinley was taken to the Milburn House.|$|E
5|$|As the Doctor is a pacifist {{and did not}} use {{the guns}} {{commonly}} found in video games, The Adventure Games utilised a more strategy and puzzle-based gameplay. Much of the first game was based around stealth, exploration, and puzzle-solving. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> also equipped with his sonic screwdriver, but as this was often used as a skeleton key in the show the game employs the solving of puzzles to advance instead of simply using the screwdriver.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> Twelfth <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> an {{incarnation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> <b>the</b> protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme <b>Doctor</b> Who. He <b>is</b> portrayed by Scottish actor Peter Capaldi. Within the series' narrative, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> a time travelling, humanoid alien from a race {{known as the}} Time Lords. [...] When <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> critically injured, he can regenerate his body, {{and in doing so}} gain a new physical appearance, and with it a distinct new personality; this plot mechanism has allowed <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> to <b>be</b> portrayed by a series of actors over the decades since the programme's inception in 1963. Capaldi's portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> a spiky, brusque, contemplative, and pragmatic character who conceals his emotions in the course of making tough and sometimes ruthless decisions.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} in Texas, Harrison took the dangerous job of Chief of Medical Staff to Mexican revolutionary general Pancho Villa. In one situation, Harrison was captured by Villa's foe Venustiano Carranza, later the President of Mexico. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> sentenced to death, but when Carranza became ill, Harrison was spared as {{he was the only}} qualified physician available. Harrison kept the general in a state of near-recovery, enabling him to escape and deliver military information to US forces stationed along the border.|$|E
5|$|The first {{incarnation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> portrayed by William Hartnell. During Hartnell's tenure, the episodes were {{a mixture of}} stories set on earth of the future with extraterrestrial influence, on alien planets, and in historical events without extraterrestrial influence, such as Marco Polo, one of the lost serials. In his last story, The Tenth Planet, the Doctor gradually grew weaker {{to the point of}} collapsing {{at the end of the}} fourth episode, leading to his regeneration.|$|E

It appears there have been some deaths recently, but the Professor says the Yeti cannot be the culprit because of its shy nature.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> Ninth <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> an {{incarnation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> <b>the</b> protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme <b>Doctor</b> Who.

5|$|The {{production}} team's {{approach to}} the character and Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally different from his predecessors, with Eccleston stating that his character would be less eccentric. To fit in with a 21st-century audience, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> given a primary companion, Rose Tyler, who {{was designed to be}} as independent and courageous as himself. He also briefly travels with Adam Mitchell, a self-serving boy genius who acts as a foil to the companions but ultimately proves unworthy, and Jack Harkness, a reformed con man from the 51st century. The Doctor, Rose and Jack form a close team but are separated in the series finale in which each character has to make difficult choices and face sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|When Ruffing was 15 years old, he {{suffered}} an {{accident in the}} mine, where his left foot was crushed between two cars.

5|$|Freema Agyeman, {{who played}} Martha Jones in Doctor Who and Torchwood, {{introduced}} the episode, which was shown {{on a large}} screen above the stage and smaller screens {{around the edge of}} the Dress Circle in the Royal Albert Hall. As the Doctor addressed them, the Royal Albert Hall audience shouted back responses. Manuscript paper fell to the stage as <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> seen to feed his sheet music to the orchestra. When the Graske sneaked through the portal, he appeared in the audience carrying the Doctor's water pistol and squirting members of the audience. A cellist had to defend himself from an attack by the Graske who promptly exited as, on screen, the Doctor pulled him back to the TARDIS.

[...] As with previous incarnations of <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> <b>the</b> character has also appeared in other Doctor Who spin-offs. In the programme's narrative, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> critically injured beyond medical repair, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change, and a new actor assumes the role.

5|$|Starting the US hard-court {{season with}} the 2010 Farmers Classic, Murray reached the final but lost against Sam Querrey in three sets. This was his first loss to Querrey in five career meetings. In Canada, Murray became the first player since Andre Agassi in 1995 to defend the Canadian Masters. Murray {{defeated}} Nadal and then Federer in straight sets, ending his eight-month title drought. At the Cincinnati Masters, Murray first complained about {{the speed of the}} court, and then in a quarterfinal match with Fish, Murray complained that the organisers refused to put the match on later in the day With temperatures reaching 33°C in the shade, Murray won the first set in a tie-breaker but began to feel ill. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> called on court to actively cool Murray down. Murray said after the match that he had considered retiring. He lost the second set, but forced a final-set tie-breaker, before Fish won. After losing to Stanislas Wawrinka in the third round of the US Open, questions about Murray's conditioning arose, as he called the trainer out twice during the match.|$|E
5|$|Misery banishes {{the player}} to the Labyrinth {{deep inside the}} island as {{punishment}} for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture the player and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> {{a member of the}} research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Lloyd F. Lonergan, but {{the director of the}} film is uncredited. Little is known of the production, but a review in The New York Dramatic Mirror made the assumption that the scenes were shot in the morning. The film starred Florence La Badie, who was the most prominent player of the Thanhouser Company and frequently in the leading roles of films including the The Million Dollar Mystery which would captivate the United States. The role of the father was played, Sidney Bracy, was a stage actor of considerable experience who claimed to have been affiliated with the Thanhouser players since 1910. Though Q. David Bowers says that it is probably an incorrect assertion, it is possible that Bracy may not have been a full-time member of the company. Bracy's first credited work appears in 1913, but it would not be until The Million Dollar Mystery that Bracy would garner much attention in the role of Jones, the Butler. The role of <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> played by Arthur Bauer who was a veteran of the stage and film, through the Great Northern Film Company, before signing onto the Thanhouser Company. The announcement of Bauer's role at Thanhouser came after the release of sixteen films, including Adrift in the Great City, on March 21, 1914. Lila Chester, played the role of a nurse in the production. Chester was claimed by a Thanhouser publicist to have appeared in over 400 films by February 14, 1914. Bowers reasons that if these productions were with Thanhouser, than most of them had to be minor roles {{because of the lack of}} attention and credits she was given. The one reel drama film, approximately 1008 feet long, was filmed in New York City and New Rochelle, New York.|$|E
