25|$|From the beginning, many {{politicians}} wanted the Corps of Engineers {{to contribute to}} both military construction and works of a civil nature. Assigned the military construction mission on 1 December 1941 after the Quartermaster Department struggled with the expanding mission, the Corps built facilities {{at home and abroad}} to support the U.S. Army and Air Force. During World War II the mission grew to more than 27,000 military and industrial projects in a $15.3billion mobilization program. Included were aircraft, <b>tank</b> <b>assembly,</b> and ammunition plants, camps for 5.3million soldiers, depots, ports, and hospitals, as well as the Manhattan Project, and the Pentagon.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 5 saw the {{completion}} of the first spacewalk by Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson. The pair released the new ammonia <b>tank</b> <b>assembly</b> for transfer to station for installation on a later spacewalk. They also removed an experiment from outside on the Kibo Exposed Facility, replaced a Rate Gyro Assembly (RGA) and performed several get-ahead tasks. The spacewalking pair was assisted by the SSRMS which was operated by pilot Jim Dutton and mission specialist Stephanie Wilson. While the spacewalk was going on, Naoko Yamazaki was assisted by commander Alan Poindexter, and the Expedition 23 crew to move several of the large science racks from the MPLM Leonardo to their new location on the ISS.|$|E

40|$|In {{a period}} where the {{evolution}} of the space environment is causing increasing concerns for the future of space exploitation and sustainability, the design-for-demise philosophy has gained an increased interest. However, building a spacecraft such that most of it will demise through design-for-demise strategies may lead to designs that are more vulnerable to space debris impacts, thus compromising the reliability of the mission. Demisable designs will tend to favour lighter materials, thinner structures, and more exposed components, whereas survivability oriented designs will favour denser materials, thicker structures, and more protected components. Given the competing nature of the demisability and the survivability, we developed a multi-objective optimisation framework to evaluate the effect of preliminary design choices on the survivability and demisability of spacecraft components since {{the early stages of the}} mission design. Such method is applied to the representative test case of <b>tank</b> <b>assemblies</b> of Earth observation and remote sensing missions...|$|R
25|$|After {{the pieces}} are removed from the kiln and fully cooled, they are {{inspected}} for cracks or other defects. Then, the flushing mechanism may be installed on a one-piece toilet.

25|$|During flight day 4, the MPLM Leonardo was berthed to the Nadir (the Earth-facing port on Harmony) {{using the}} Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). Once it was berthed, the crews {{activated}} it {{and opened the}} hatch for ingress. Some more items were transferred from the shuttle mid-deck including the MDS experiment and the space suits Danny Olivas and Nicole Stott would use during EVA 1. The pair also prepared all the tools {{that would be used}} during the EVA with some help from Tim Kopra. Later during the night when the crews were asleep, the team of ground controllers vented the Port 1 (P1) Ammonia <b>Tank</b> <b>Assembly</b> (ATA) Nitrogen Vent lines in preparation for the ATA to be removed during EVA 1.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 9, Rick Mastracchio and Clay Anderson {{completed}} {{the third and}} final spacewalk of the STS-131 mission. Their tasks included hooking up the ammonia and nitrogen lines to the new Ammonia <b>Tank</b> <b>Assembly</b> (ATA), installing the old ATA in the shuttle's payload bay, retrieving some Micro-Meteoroid Orbital Debris (MMOD) shields, bolting a grapple bar (which had been removed from the old ATA) onto the new ATA, and preparation of some cables on the Z1 truss and tools to be used during STS-132. During the installation of the old ATA in Discoverys payload bay, the spacewalkers had some problems securing a bolt on the ATA to the LMC. The spacewalk took 6 hours and 24 minutes, bringing the total EVA time to 20 hours and 19 minutes. While the EVA was going on, commander Alan Poindexter and mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki continued transferring items from the MPLM to the ISS. Transfer is more than seventy-five percent complete.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 7 astronauts Clay Anderson and Rick Mastracchio {{performed}} {{their second}} spacewalk of the STS-131 mission. Mastracchio and Anderson exited the airlock at 05:30 UTC, a full 45 minutes {{ahead of the}} planned time, and spent 7 hours and 26 minutes outside the ISS. The pair removed the old Ammonia <b>Tank</b> <b>Assembly</b> (ATA) from the S1 truss and installed the new ATA. Anderson and Mastracchio ran into a small problem {{when one of the}} four bolts that holds the tank in place wouldn't turn. They loosened the other three and tried them all again and the fourth bolt was successfully tightened. The two spacewalkers helped guide the SSRMS to temporarily stow the old ATA on the truss structure. The new ATA had its electrical connections made, but the fluid connections were deferred until the third spacewalk since the EVA was behind the time-line. Mastracchio and Anderson also installed two radiator grapple fixture stowage beams on the P1 truss. While Anderson and Mastracchio were outside, members of the STS-131 crew continued transferring items from space shuttle Discoverys mid-deck and the MPLM Leonardo. Overall, the crew had completed about half of the transfer work.|$|E

40|$|Optimizing the {{workflow}} of {{hydraulic reservoir}} tanks” is a degree project made by Jonas Olsson, student within {{the faculty of}} technology and science, during spring semester 2012. The project comprise 22, 5 ECTS. Volvo Construction Equipment, located in Arvika, was the client in this project. The mentor at Volvo CE was Åsa Barck, and the mentor at Karlstad University was Monica Jakobsson. The examiner was Fredrik Thuvander, professor at Karlstad University. Volvo CE produces ten different kinds of wheel loaders. The main issues in this degree project were two different hydraulic reservoir tanks that Volvo CE assembles on various kinds of wheel loaders. The problem that the student faced in this project was that the hydraulic tank packaging, today are not safe enough. There is a risk that a tank may tumble over on today’s packaging when a mechanic moves the tank to the carrying structure. Much time and effort was spent on research and observations and subsequently {{it appeared that the}} workflow at the <b>tanks</b> <b>assembly</b> station wasn’t at top. By using the knowledge that the education has given the student, the goal was to optimize the workflow and prevent potential accidents from happening. The project resulted in a concept that contains four different parts. Stabilizing support fixtures, that strengthens the packaging. Transfer the assembly of smaller details {{on the bottom of the}} tanks to Volvo CE located in Hallsberg. Decrease the amount of non- ergonomic positions for the mechanics in Arvika by investing in lifting tables and torque wrenches.

40|$|As NASA has retired the Space Shuttle Program, a {{new method}} of {{transporting}} compressed gaseous nitrogen and oxygen {{needed to be}} created for delivery of these crucial life support resources to the International Space Station (ISS). One of the methods selected by NASA includes the use of highly pressurized, unprotected Recharge <b>Tank</b> <b>Assemblies</b> (RTAs) utilizing Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs). A COPV consists of a thin liner wrapped with a fiber composite and resin or epoxy. It is typically lighter weight than an all metal pressure vessel of similar volume and therefore provides a higher-efficiency means for gas storage. However COPVs {{are known to be}} susceptible to damage resulting from handling, tool drop impacts, or impacts from other objects. As a result, a comprehensive Damage Control Plan has been established to mitigate damage to the RTA COPV throughout its life cycle. The DCP is intended to evaluate and mitigate defined threats during manufacturing, shipping and handling, test, assembly level integration, shipment while pressurized, launch vehicle integration and mission operations by defining credible threats and methods for preventing potential damage while still maintaining the primary goal of resupplying ISS gas resources. A comprehensive threat assessment is performed to identify all threats posed to the COPV during the different phases of its lifecycle. The threat assessment is then used as the basis for creating a series of general inspection, surveillance and reporting requirements which apply across all phases of the COPV's life, targeted requirements only applicable to specific work phases and a series of training courses for both ground personnel and crew aboard the ISS. A particularly important area of emphasis deals with creating DCP requirements for a highly pressurized, large and unprotected RTA COPV for use during Inter Vehicular Activities (IVA) operations in the micro gravity environment while supplying pressurized gas to the ISS for crew life support...|$|R

50|$|The Integrated Truss Structure (ITS) houses vital {{equipment}} {{on the exterior}} of the ISS. Each segment of truss is given a designation of P or S, indicating whether the segment is on the port or starboard side, and a number which indicates its position on its respective side. The truss system itself consists of 12 total segments - four on each side, and one central segment - which are connected to the ISS by attachment points on the Destiny module. The thirteenth piece, known as the Zenith-1 (Z1) truss segment, is attached to the Unity module, and was originally used to hold the P6 solar arrays to provide power to the USOS. The Z1 segment now houses the Ku-band antennas and serves as a routing point for power and data cables on {{the exterior of the}} ISS. The Integrated Truss Structure houses four sets of solar arrays. Each set of solar arrays contains four arrays for a total of 16 solar arrays. Each of the four sets of arrays also has an associated cooling system and radiator for cooling the power supply equipment. The Integrated Truss Structure also houses the main cooling system for the ISS, which consists of two pumps, two radiator arrays, and two ammonia and two nitrogen <b>tank</b> <b>assemblies.</b> There are also several payload attachment points located on the Integrated Truss Structure. These points host the External Stowage Platforms, External Logistics Carriers, Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and the Mobile Base System for the Canadarm2. The Z1 truss was delivered by the STS-92 mission in October 2000. The P6 segment was installed on STS-97 in December 2000. The S0 truss was delivered to the ISS on STS-110, with the S1 segment following on STS-112. The P1 segment of the truss was brought to the ISS by STS-113, followed by the P3/P4 segment on STS-115, and the P5 segment on STS-116. The S3/S4 truss segment was delivered by STS-117, followed by the S5 segment STS-118. The last component of the truss segment, the S6 segment, was delivered by STS-119.|$|R

40|$|<b>Assemblies</b> of <b>tanks</b> having {{shapes that}} conform {{to each other}} and/or conform to other {{proximate}} objects have been investigated for use in storing fuels and oxidizers in small available spaces in upper stages of spacecraft. Such assemblies might also prove useful in aircraft, automobiles, boats, and other terrestrial vehicles in which space available for tanks is limited. The basic concept of using conformal tanks to maximize the utilization of limited space is not new in itself: for example, conformal tanks are used in some automobiles to store windshield -washer liquid and coolant that overflows from radiators. The novelty of the present development lies {{in the concept of}} an assembly of smaller conformal tanks, as distinguished from a single larger conformal <b>tank.</b> In an <b>assembly</b> of smaller <b>tanks,</b> {{it would be possible to}} store different liquids in different tanks. Even if the same liquid were stored in all the <b>tanks,</b> the <b>assembly</b> would offer an advantage by reducing the mechanical disturbance caused by sloshing of fuel in a single larger tank: indeed, the requirement to reduce sloshing is critical in some applications. The figure shows a prototype <b>assembly</b> of conformal <b>tanks.</b> Each tank was fabricated by (1) copper plating a wax tank mandrel to form a liner and (2) wrapping and curing layers of graphite/epoxy composite to form a shell supporting the liner. In this case, the conformal tank surfaces are flat ones where they come in contact with the adjacent tanks. A band of fibers around the outside binds the tanks together tightly in the assembly, which has a quasi-toroidal shape. For proper functioning, it would be necessary to maintain equal pressure in all the tanks...|$|R
