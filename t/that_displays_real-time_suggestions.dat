40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research findings}} and design strategies that illustrate how digital {{technology can be}} applied {{as a tool for}} hybrid placemaking in ways that would not be possible in purely digital or physical space. Digital technology has revolutionised the way people learn and gather new information. This trend has challenged the role of the library as a physical place, as well as the interplay of digital and physical aspects of the library. The paper provides an overview of how the penetration of digital technology into everyday life has affected the library as a place, both as designed by place makers, and, as perceived by library users. It then identifies a gap in current library research about the use of digital technology as a tool for placemaking, and reports results from a study of Gelatine – a custom built user check-in system <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> <b>real-time</b> user information on a set of public screens. Gelatine and its evaluation at The Edge, at State Library of Queensland illustrates how combining affordances of social, spatial and digital space can improve the connected learning experience among on-site visitors.

50|$|Kidd Field is an {{athletic}} facility used primarily by UTEP in El Paso, Texas. Constructed for its then-primary {{use as a}} football field in 1938, it {{was the site of}} the Sun Bowl until 1963 when Sun Bowl Stadium opened. Kidd Field is used for track and field meets today. Kidd Field cost $2,000 to build, and El Paso holds an annual Easter festival there. Built in the early 1930s, Kidd Field has been home to numerous All-Americans, national champions, national record-holders and Olympians. Named after UTEP (then Texas College of Mines and Metallurgy) professor and athletic booster John W. Kidd, the facility was shared with the UTEP football team until 1962, when the facility became sole home to the track and field team. The track features an eight-lane Mondo Track, the same surface used for the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. The track was made possible by generous donations from Wayne and Russ Vandenburg of EPT Management and Mark Fry. The track was dedicated in former Miner legend Larry K. Durham's name. His contribution gave Kidd Field a makeover in 2011, and it was dedicated in his name in April 2012. A state-of-the-art Daktronics video board was added in January of 2008. The 9x15-foot LED video display plants fans right into the action on the track, providing graphics and video elements <b>that</b> <b>display</b> <b>real-time</b> highlights throughout a meet. The lit facility also houses throws and jumps arenas, making Kidd Field one of the top track-only complexes in the country.|$|R

40|$|The Ames Power Monitoring System (APMS) is a {{centralized}} system of power meters, computer hardware, and specialpurpose software that collects and stores electrical power data by various facilities at Ames Research Center (ARC). This system is needed {{because of the}} large and varying nature of the overall ARC power demand, which has been observed to range from 20 to 200 MW. Large portions of peak demand can be attributed to only three wind tunnels (60, 180, and 100 MW, respectively). The APMS helps ARC avoid or minimize costly demand charges by enabling wind-tunnel operators, test engineers, and the power manager to monitor total demand for center in real time. These persons receive the information they need to manage and schedule energy-intensive research in advance and to adjust loads in real time to ensure that the overall maximum allowable demand is not exceeded. The APMS (see figure) includes a server computer running the Windows NT operating system and can, in principle, include an unlimited number of power meters and client computers. As configured at the time of reporting the information for this article, the APMS includes more than 40 power meters monitoring all the major research facilities, plus 15 Windows-based client personal computers <b>that</b> <b>display</b> <b>real-time</b> and historical data to users via graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The power meters and client computers communicate with the server using Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) on Ethernet networks, variously, through dedicated fiber-optic cables or through the pre-existing ARC local-area network (ARCLAN). The APMS has enabled ARC to achieve significant savings ($ 1. 2 million in 2001) in the cost of power and electric energy by helping personnel to maintain total demand below monthly allowable levels, to manage the overall power factor to avoid low power factor penalties, and to use historical system data to identify opportunities for additional energy savings. The APMS also provides power engineers and electricians with the information they need to plan modifications in advance and perform day-to-day maintenance of the ARC electric-power distribution system...|$|R
30|$|Previously, we {{demonstrated}} that preoperative SPECT/CT remains incremental in the SN identification process, even when fluorescence-based surgical guidance {{to the same}} target is available [20]. Given the revealed need for positional information during placement of the freehandSPECT VOI, we {{see no reason to}} deviate from this point of view. This study, however, does illustrate how freehandSPECT imaging and the matching “GPS-like” navigation capabilities can help strengthen the connection between the findings of both modalities [28]. The use of the hybrid tracer (ICG- 99 mTc-nanocolloid), a tracer that can be detected using both modalities [24], enabled complementary use of nuclear and fluorescent technologies. In the current study, a gamma probe was used for navigation, but in the future, other tools may be positioned using navigation, for example, a fluorescence camera <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> a <b>real-time</b> augmented reality overlay of freehandSPECT data within the fluorescence images (see Table 3) [26]. In such an integrated image guided surgery approach, the use of augmented reality displays, virtual navigation, and fluorescence guidance can all be used in the same setting [29].|$|R

40|$|Detecting the {{frequency}} of the mains supply is a crucial component of maintaining the grid frequency at its nominal level. Most frequency counters enable the user to monitor frequencies but monitoring frequency variations at a high resolution is often expensive. Electronic systems that measure frequency also have to generate a local time base to calculate {{the frequency}} upon. All time bases suffer from the effect of frequency jitter, which makes the timing source deviate from the nominal second by a quantified amount. Modern systems have improved drastically and have relatively insignificant jitter for most timing applications, but high-precision applications require a quantification of this source of timing error. The purpose of this thesis is to document the background, implementation, testing, results and identified future improvements for a frequency meter that can record minor fluctuations of the grid frequency. By achieving this objective, the grid supply and demand data can be logged and used for several applications, such as network forecasting or maintaining nominal grid frequency. An extensive research period was required to determine key design facets pertaining to the frequency meter. Key identified tasks included choosing a timing source, finding a suitable software development platform and associated hardware, developing a graphical software implementation <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> <b>real-time</b> frequency fluctuations, contingency alarming for nominal frequency deviation events, communications design between the frequency meter and the PC, quantifying clock precision and evaluating the performance of the final frequency meter. A GPS time source was chosen to provide an accurate source of 1 second pulses. An Arduino Due microcontroller used a KX- 7 quartz crystal oscillator to maintain its time base and the accuracy of the KX- 7 ’s time base was analysed against the Trimble Copernicus II and GlobalSat EM 406 -A GPS receivers’ time base. When analysed relative to the GPS receivers’ accurate time base, the KX- 7 maintained a low time base variation, well within it’s data sheet specifications. The Arduino Due microcontroller was programmed and provided relevant frequency data to a LabVIEW PC terminal, which allowed frequency visualisation, data storage, grid frequency contingency detection, recovery time logging, GPS initialisation data and cross-platform communication protocols. Frequency data was logged on the frequency meter and was able to provide a microHertz resolution. The primary limitation of the design was low-level noise on the mains supply line as this affected the designed electronics when logging frequency measurements below the milliHertz range. Multiple recommendations for future work have been identified and included in this report...|$|R

40|$|Passive {{acoustic}} mapping (PAM) {{has been}} recently demonstrated {{as a method}} of monitoring focused ultrasound therapy by reconstructing the emissions created by inertially cavitating bubbles (Jensen et al 2012 Radiology 262 252 - 61). The published method sums energy emitted by cavitation from the focal region within the tissue and uses a threshold to determine when sufficient energy has been delivered for ablation. The present work builds on this approach to provide a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment monitoring software <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> both <b>real-time</b> temperature maps and a prediction of the ablated tissue region. This is achieved by determining heat deposition from two sources: (i) acoustic absorption of the primary HIFU beam which is calculated via a nonlinear model, and (ii) absorption of energy from bubble acoustic emissions which is estimated from measurements. The two sources of heat are used as inputs to the bioheat equation that gives an estimate of the temperature of the tissue as well as estimates of tissue ablation. The method has been applied to ex vivo ox liver samples and the estimated temperature is compared to the measured temperature and shows good agreement, capturing the effect of cavitation-enhanced heating on temperature evolution. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that by using PAM and predictions of heating it is possible to produce an evolving estimate of cell death during exposure in order to guide treatment for monitoring ablative HIFU therapy...|$|R
