Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common uranium ore), carnotite, autunite, uranophane, <b>torbernite,</b> and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).|$|E

Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work.

500|$|In 1923, a {{year before}} Walter Law's death, the Law family leased the lodge to Chauncey Depew Steele for 20 years. Under Steele's management, the lodge reached its prominence. The lodge also was opened to {{a wider variety of}} clientele, but {{continued}} to be known as a resort for the wealthy and famous. A [...] 18-hole golf course was completed in 1923, designed by Devereux Emmet. In May 1925, The New York Times reported that the Briarcliff Lodge installed the first artificial spa; using radioactive mineral <b>torbernite</b> to affect the water, believed to counter ailments associated with old age. United States Senators Chauncey Depew, James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr., and Royal S. Copeland were to each place a bag containing the minerals into the lodge's swimming pool. In June of that year, the newspaper mentioned in its report of an upcoming Briarcliff Lodge performance that the swimming pool was popular in the summer heat and that [...] "the cool spring radioactive water gave considerable relief to several hundred guests".|$|E
5000|$|As a {{radioactive}} mineral, <b>torbernite</b> {{has some}} limited significance as a uranium ore. Its vibrant green color and well-developed distinctive crystals (size: mm {{to a few}} cm) make it a sought-after collector's mineral, as well. However, <b>torbernite,</b> like other hydrated minerals, can easily suffer from loss of water molecules. This loss {{of water from the}} mineral leads to an alteration of <b>torbernite</b> specimens into its pseudomorph, meta-torbernite. Some collector's websites assert that any <b>torbernite</b> specimen more than a few years old should be considered fully transitioned to meta-torbernite. However, it likely depends on the temperature and relative humidity of ambient air in which specimens are stored.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Torbernite,</b> {{whose name}} {{derives from the}} Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman (1735-1784), is a radioactive, {{hydrated}} green copper uranyl phosphate mineral, found in granites and other uranium-bearing deposits as a secondary mineral. <b>Torbernite</b> is isostructural with the related uranium mineral, autunite.|$|E

50|$|Metatorbernite (or meta-torbernite) is a {{radioactive}} phosphate mineral, {{and is a}} dehydration pseudomorph of <b>torbernite.</b> Chemically, it is {{a copper}} uranyl phosphate and usually occurs {{in the form of}} green platy deposits. It can form by direct deposition from a supersaturated solution, which produces true crystalline metatorbernite, with a dark green colour, translucent diaphaneity, and vitreous lustre. However, more commonly, it is formed by the dehydration of <b>torbernite,</b> which causes internal stress and breakage within the crystal lattice, resulting in crystals composed of microscopic powder held together using electrostatic force, and having a lighter green colour, opaque diaphaneity, and a relatively dull lustre. As with <b>torbernite,</b> it is named after the Swedish chemist Tornbern Bergmann. It is especially closely associated with <b>torbernite,</b> but is also found amongside autunite, meta-autunite and uraninite.|$|E

50|$|The {{most obvious}} factor in {{identifying}} <b>torbernite</b> is its radioactivity. However, {{since it is}} frequently found in association with other radioactive minerals, {{this may not be}} useful in separating one uranium mineral from the rest. A next step would be to check color. Most uranium-bearing minerals are bright yellow or green. As <b>torbernite</b> is exclusively green, this can be a useful secondary fact. Crystal habit is also useful, but as it shares a similar structure and color with autunite. Nonetheless, regardless of identification, it is likely {{that at least some of}} the specimen will have already altered to meta-torbernite.|$|E
50|$|Autunite was {{discovered}} in 1852 near Autun, France. It occurs as an oxidation product of uranium minerals in granite pegmatites and hydrothermal deposits. Associate minerals include metaautunite, <b>torbernite,</b> phosphuranylite, saleeite, uranophane and sabugalite.|$|E

50|$|As <b>torbernite</b> is {{radioactive}} and outgases radon (222Rn), collectors {{are urged}} to take proper precautions in the handling and storage of any specimens.

To limit radon inhalation, naked specimens should never be stored in rooms in which one spends much living or working time. An alternative is to store specimens in gas tight transparent containers in which radon will accumulate and decay to secular equilibrium.|$|E
