40|$|<b>Tyre</b> <b>bead</b> grade wire is {{used for}} tyre making application. The wire is used as {{reinforcement}} inside the polymer of tyre. The wire is available in different size/section such as 1. 6 – 0. 80  mm thin Cu coated wire. During tyre making operation at tyre manufacturer company, wire failed frequently. In this present study, different broken/defective wire samples were collected from wire mill for detailed investigation of the defect. The natures of the defects were localized and similar in nature. The fracture surface was of finger nail type. Crow feet like defects including button like surface abnormalities were also observed on the broken wire samples. The defect was studied at different directions under microscope. Different advanced metallographic techniques {{have been used for}} detail investigation. The analysis revealed that, white layer of surface martensite was formed and it caused the final breakage of wire. In this present study we have also discussed about the possible reason for the formation of such kind of surface martensite (hard-phase) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} Cu-Sn coating on steel towards {{improving}} the adhesion between steel and typical {{styrene butadiene rubber}} (SBR) based <b>tyre</b> <b>bead</b> composition has been investigated in this work. Steel coupons were coated with varying compositions of Cu-Sn via immersion coating, where the electrolyte bath composition was varied. Chemical analysis of the coatings using ICP-OES confirmed increase in Sn content with increasing SnSO 4 concentration in the coating baths, keeping other parameters constant. No change in the coating weight was observed with change in Sn concentration in the coatings. Bare spots on the coating surface was observed under SEM XPS analysis confirmed formation of Fe oxide at the bare locations. The coated steel plates were vulcanized with SBR based rubber and peel strength was measured. The results confirmed an optimum Sn concentration of 3 - 4 wt % in the coatings up to which an increase (~ 25 %) in adhesion strength was exhibited compared to only Cu coatings. Stereo-microscopic analysis of the peel tested samples validated mixed mode i. e. both adhesive and cohesive modes of failure. 1...|$|E
5000|$|Trials bike rims are {{significantly}} wider than those used for cross country, downhill and BMX bikes. Wider rims mean that any given tyre fitted {{to the rim}} will hold a bigger volume of air thanks to the <b>tyre</b> <b>beads</b> being held further apart by the rim. This means the tyre has a wider contact patch and therefore can be run at lower tyre pressure. The change in volume of a tyre on a wide rim when landed on a sharp corner will tend to be {{greater than that of}} a narrow rim, which again leads to improved pinch puncture resistance, critical for trials as landing on sharp edges is a very common requirement of both competition and street trials. A wider rim also makes it much harder for a tyre to roll off the rim when exposed to side loads, again a very common occurrence in trials riding.|$|R
40|$|Two laboratory-scale hybrid {{biological}} reactors (HBRs) containing both suspended {{and attached}} biomass {{were used for}} treating a synthetic dairy waste. The relative specific biological activities between the two phases of biomass were evaluated. The suspended growth was maintained at a concentration up to 2500 mg/L (MLSS) by recycling the settled sludge while the attached growth (biofilm) was maintained at between 100 and 600 mg/L by using shredded automotive <b>tyre</b> <b>beads</b> (1 to 3 mm in diameter) as biocarriers, which were added at a concentration of up to 15 g/L in the biological reactor. The synthetic dairy waste was fed continuously at an increasing concentration from 300 mg/L to 1100 mg/L as COD, which corresponded to a volumetric organic loading of 0. 9 kg COD/m 3 -day to 3. 3 kg COD/m 3 -day. Throughout the study, the COD removal was over 80 %, of which a significant fraction was contributed by the attached growth. In general, the specific bioactivity (expressed as mg O 2 uptake per g sludge-hour) of the attached biomass was somewhat {{higher than that of}} the suspended growth at a given substrate concentration. Thus, the actual percent of waste stabilization contributed by the attached growth was somewhat higher than its biomass percentage in the reactor.

40|$|Carbon {{black is}} a generic term for an {{important}} {{family of products}} used for the reinforcement of rubber, {{which is also a}} black pigment, and an electrically conductive properties of filler material. It is a fluffy powder of extreme fineness and high surface area, composed essentially of elemental carbon. Carbon black is one of thermo-stable product among the chemicals used in rubber compounding. Carbon black in general is the most widely used filler material in rubber industry. Carbon black is made from hydrocarbon fuel and therefore costly and has to be imported to Srilanka. Paddy husk is a natural source which can be converted to Carbon black and can be very cost effective. In an Agricultural country like Srilanka, paddy husk is abundantly available and also it would be uplifting to local industry as a readily available renewable raw material source. Carbon black particle size plays a major role with regard to cured rubber properties. It is directly related to strength of cured article. When a compound is used for tyre tread or plies, Carbon black particle size will be the most critical parameter. Carbon black particle size is not so critical when compounding in <b>tyre</b> <b>bead,</b> inner liner, and chafer compounds. When Carbon black is to be produced from paddy husk, first, it is under gone pyrolysis in inert atmospheric conditions and converted into carbonized paddy husks. Then, carbonized paddy husk is ground in a grinder and further fined by ball milling. Accordingly it can be made fine 200 nm level of particle size which is confirmed by Iodine adsorption number analysis. As per the tensile, hardness, rheological test results, it was decided to use Paddy Husk Carbon Black (PHCB) for the inner liner compound of tube type pneumatic bias ply tyre. Accordingly, differently proportionate compound samples were prepared by replacing the existing normal carbon black with PHCB. Seven compound batches were prepared and rheological and physical properties were analyzed. According to test results, it was found that 40 % of Normal carbon black could be replaced by PHCB for inner liner compound. Then selected sample is compared with the existing compound by Ply adhesion, Tear resistance tests and Age analysis so as to confirm suitability of inner liner compound. Further, selected compound was applied in actual tyre and feasibility of curing optimization in a normal manufacturing press is confirmed by thermocouple test...|$|E
40|$|Two bench-scale hybrid systems, {{employing}} tyre {{beads and}} Kaldnes elements as carriers, respectively, {{were used in}} this research. The aim was to evaluate the dynamic changes of carbonaceous and nitrifying bioactivities in suspended and attached growth under different operating conditions such as SRT, carrier concentrations and loading rates. The distinct advantage of hybrid systems in achieving nitrification at short SRT operation was demonstrated in the comparison with an activated sludge system. With the operating SRT of suspended growth varying from 0. 17 d to 7. 1 d, the two hybrid systems gradually changed from a biofilm-dominant to a suspended-growth-dominant system. At the fixed loading rates of 4. 2 kg COD/m 3 -d and 0. 78 kg TKN/m 3 -d, the relative contribution of attached growth towards the overall organic removal was reduced from 50 % at 0. 17 -d SRT to 5 % at 7. 1 -d SRT and its corresponding contribution to nitrification was reduced from 95 % to 15 %. For both growth types, with the increasing SRT, carbonaceous activities decreased due to the limiting substrate while nitrifying activities increased because of the accumulation of nitrifiers. It {{was found that the}} attached growth always showed a higher nitrifying activity but a lower carbonaceous activity as compared to the suspended growth. The long SRT of the biofilm favored the nitrifying growth at the short operating SRT, which enabled the hybrid systems to achieve a remarkable nitrification rate of 0. 45 - 0. 6 kg TKN/m 3 -d at a short SRT of 1 to 2 days. This rate was about 3 to 8 times as high as that of the activated sludge system. In addition, the suspended growth in the hybrid systems also showed a considerable nitrification rate of 0. 2 to 0. 4 kg TKN/m 3 d at short SRT operation because of the continuous input of nitrifiers from the biofilm detachment. Moreover, the suspended growth was found to shoulder 80 to 90 % of total organic loading when the SRT was 1 to 2 d. This greatly relieved the organic burden on attached growth and exempted it from the negative influence of increased organic loading rate. With this kind of cooperation between suspended and attached growth, the hybrid system was able to achieve a higher nitrification rate at a fixed organic loading rate, as compared to an activated sludge system. As biofilm became dominant at short SRT operation, the hybrid system encountered a severe oxygen deficiency in biofilm at a high organic loading rate, which greatly limited the system nitrification rate. Both the operating DO and the surface organic loading rate were found to have profound impacts on the nitrification rate of the biofilm. At the same loading rate (4. 2 kg COD/m 3 -d and 0. 78 kg TKN/m 3 -d), the surface organic loading was reduced by varying the carrier concentration from 10 to 30 g/L. This drastically boosted the system nitrification rate from 0. 01 kg TKN/m 3 -d to 0. 40 kg TKN/m 3 -d and also made the biofilm less sensitive to the changes of operating DO concentration and applied volumetric loading rate. As comparing the two carriers used in this study, it was found that Kaldnes elements were able to maintain a relatively constant attached biomass concentration under the varying surface organic loading rate due to its relatively closed structure. This feature would be favorable for treating a seasonally fluctuating loading. However, the closed structure of Kaldnes element also incurred a significant diffusion resistance. Therefore, more energy input was needed to overcome the diffusion resistance to increase the nitrification rate.

The reactor was operated initially under suspended growth only and then hybrid system containing 20 g/L of <b>tyre</b> tube <b>beads.</b> The reactor was operated continuously with the high strength composite synthetic wastewater containing COD and NH 4 +-N {{in the range of}} (1000 – 3500) mg/L and (500 – 1750) mg/L respectively that follows COD: NH 4 +-N equals to 2 : 1. About 80 % removal of COD was achieved at a HRT of 8 hrs. even under purely suspended growth condition. At least 12 hrs. HRT was needed to achieve more than 90 % NH 4 +-N removal for an influent NH 4 +-N of 1000 mg/L or more. Nitrite and nitrate formation was promoted with the addition of attached biomass by means of bio-carriers. The maximum extent of nitrite and nitrate formation was about 43. 9 % and 35. 3 % of influent NH 4 +-N respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{investigation}} into the modelling and simulation of an aircraft tyre and wheel assembly in finite element environment. The finite element simulations basing on aircraft tyre test and operational scenarios could predict the loads transferred from tyre and the stresses distributed to the wheel rim. The virtual analysis could assess the safety criteria of different tyre structures, which would lead to the cost and time circle reduction in tyre R&D process. An H 41 x 16. 0 R 20 radial ply aircraft test tyre and its corresponding test wheel, provided by Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Limited, are adopted as the subject of this research. The material properties, especially the rubber and fabric materials, have been investigated. The finite element hyperelastic models have been utilized to represent rubbers and been correlated to experimental data. The 2 D and 3 D finite element tyre models, along with the finite element wheel models are created in the commercial finite element code, LS-Dyna. The finite element models have been validated with either industrial standardised simulation results or experimental data. Basing on the validated models, simulations that duplicating static test and dynamic operational scenarios have been developed. The researches have provided knowledge in comparing single and double <b>bead</b> <b>tyre</b> designs with respect to wheel loading mechanisms. The computational model also allowed manufacturers to assess the performance and safety criteria of a particular tyre at its design stage. The development of such models would add to the general drive towards the use of more virtual prototypes in an area traditionally reliant on experimental testing...|$|R
