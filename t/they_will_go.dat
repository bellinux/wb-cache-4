25|$|The monks do not {{fix their}} times for walking and sitting meditation, for {{as soon as}} they are free they just start doing it; nor do they {{determine}} for how long <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> on to meditate.

Some may decide to fast for days or stay at dangerous places where ferocious animals live in order to aid their meditation.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that one male sires all of the {{offspring}} there is less genetic diversity in the community, which is disadvantageous to females. Additionally, females sometimes encounter infanticide, which is when a breeding male is overthrown and a new breeding male becomes dominant and kills all of their current offspring, as he has not fathered them. Because the females no longer have offspring to nurse, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> into estrous sooner, which allows the new breeding male to mate with the females earlier.|$|E
25|$|The cock {{performs}} {{with his}} wings, alternating wing beats, until he attracts a mate. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> to the mating area {{and he will}} maintain privacy by driving away all intruders. They graze until their behaviour is synchronized, then the feeding becomes secondary and the process takes on a ritualistic appearance. The cock will then excitedly flap alternate wings again, and start poking {{on the ground with}} his bill. He will then violently flap his wings to symbolically clear out a nest in the soil. Then, while the hen runs a circle around him with lowered wings, he will wind his head in a spiral motion. She will drop to the ground and he will mount for copulation. Common ostriches raised entirely by humans may direct their courtship behaviour not at other ostriches, but toward their human keepers.|$|E

25|$|A {{long period}} without feeding {{seems to have}} cured her {{completely}} of the hunger. Now Black Panther's adviser and friend, she is forced to infect him when an Acolyte assassin attempts to kill him. This incident is orchestrated by Malcolm Cortez, the son of Fabian Cortez, wanting to take leadership from Black Panther. When the hunger resurfaces, she nearly eats Panther's wife before being stopped by him. Instead, they eat the assassin and they state <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> into isolation {{in order to control}} their hunger. This is a success. Multiple powered zombies soon threaten the colony. Wasp fights alongside Panther, Hawkeye (who had also been decapitated and inhabits Janet's own former cybernetic body), Forge, and a reformed Luke Cage and Spider-Man to save the people of New Wakanda from Firelord, Giant-Man, Wolverine, Gladiator, Hulk, Jean Grey and Iron Man seeking to finish off humanity and retain the inter-dimensional portal so they can enter a new universe. Eventually the zombies discover, as Janet has, that the hunger fades with time, and they stop their rampage only to have their numbers halved by the Hulk. Janet, along with the other remaining zombies (the new Colonel America, Spider-Man, Cage, Giant-Man, Wolverine and Black Panther), end up teleported to another universe by Malcolm Cortez.|$|E
25|$|Just a week later, Nadal won {{his sixth}} Barcelona Open crown, winning the 2011 Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell final against Ferrer in {{straight}} sets. In doing so, Nadal {{became the first}} man in the open era to have won two tournaments at least six times each. Nadal was then the leader in terms of matches won in the year, with 29. He did not gain any points for this victory, however, as only four ATP 500 tournaments can be counted towards a players ranking at one time, but <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> into effect 8 August 2011, when {{the result of the}} 2010 Legg Mason Tennis Classic expires. At the 2011 Mutua Madrid Open in May, he defeated Marcos Baghdatis, had a walkover against Juan Martín del Potro, and defeated Michaël Llodra and Roger Federer, before losing the final to Novak Djokovic in two sets. Nadal again lost in straight sets to Novak Djokovic in the Rome Masters final. This marked the first time that Nadal has lost twice on clay to the same player in a single season. However, Nadal retained his No. 1 ranking during the clay-court season and won his sixth French Open title by defeating Roger Federer.|$|E
25|$|Short-period {{planets in}} close orbits around their stars will undergo {{reflected}} light variations because, like the Moon, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> through phases from full to new and back again. In addition, as these planets receive {{a lot of}} starlight, it heats them, making thermal emissions potentially detectable. Since telescopes cannot resolve the planet from the star, they see only the combined light, and {{the brightness of the}} host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner. Although the effect is small — the photometric precision required is about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit across a solar-type star – such Jupiter-sized planets with an orbital period of a few days are detectable by space telescopes such as the Kepler Space Observatory. Like with the transit method, it is easier to detect large planets orbiting close to their parent star than other planets as these planets catch more light from their parent star. When a planet has a high albedo and is situated around a relatively luminous star, its light variations are easier to detect in visible light while darker planets or planets around low-temperature stars are more easily detectable with infrared light with this method. In the long run, this method may find the most planets that will be discovered by that mission because the reflected light variation with orbital phase is largely independent of orbital inclination and does not require the planet to pass in front of the disk of the star. It still cannot detect planets with circular face-on orbits from Earth's viewpoint as the amount of reflected light does not change during its orbit.|$|E

[...] An hour later he was dead. One of his regiments while fighting in an interval of the Russian army, was shot down and cut to pieces by the Cossacks; only eighteen of them escaped. General d'Hautpoul, three times forced to recoil with his division, thrice rallied them to the charge; the third time, he again rushed on the enemy, crying in a loud voice: [...] "Cuirassiers, forward, in the name of God! forward, my brave cuirassiers!"

500|$|The ship {{stopped in}} New London, Connecticut, {{to pick up}} a {{replacement}} assistant engineer, leaving on July 3, 1871. By the time the ship reached St. John's, there was dissension among the officers and scientific staff. Bessels, backed up by Meyer, had openly rejected Hall's command over the scientific staff. The dissension spread to the crew, which was divided along nationalist lines. In his diary, Assistant Navigator George Tyson wrote that {{by the time they reached}} Disko Island, Greenland, [...] "...expressions are freely made that Hall shall not get any credit from this expedition. Already some have made up their minds how far <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> and when they will get home again." [...] Hall asked Captain Davenport of the supply ship Congress to intervene. Davenport threatened to have Meyer shackled for insubordination and sent back to the United States, at which point all of the Germans threatened to quit. Hall and Davenport were forced to back down, however Davenport delivered a strongly worded speech on naval discipline to the crew.|$|E
500|$|... "Motorbreath" [...] {{was written}} by Hetfield during his time in Leather Charm and tells about life on the road. The song {{is based on a}} four-chord verse and a stop-and-start chorus. The most {{recognizable}} parts are Ulrich's drum rolls in each chorus and the riff that accompanies Hammett's solos. Because of its speed, the song requires fast picking by the bassist. [...] "Jump in the Fire" [...] was originally written by Mustaine, with lyrics about teenage sexual experience. Hetfield's revised lyrics for the album were written from Satan's point of view, describing how the devil watches people killing each other, and is sure <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> to hell for their actions. [...] "Jump in the Fire" [...] was released as a single in the UK in February 1984 to promote a UK tour with Venom. The single featured [...] "Phantom Lord" [...] and [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] as live tracks, although they are actually studio recordings with fake crowd noise dubbed over them. The single's cover art features an oil painting titled The Devils of D-Day, created by artist Les Edwards in 1978.|$|E

Kunal and Sam admit that they manipulated the boy, angering Neha and Abhi. Kunal and Sam climb onto the stage and beg Neha's forgiveness. The crowd encourages them to beg on their knees, say that they love her and blow her kisses, but nothing softens her. When the crowd tells them to kiss each other, they refuse. Neha and Abhi turn to leave, and Kunal kisses a reluctant Sam. Abhi and Neha are both amazed by the lengths to which <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> to regain her trust; Neha forgives them. Kunal and Sam then get down on their knees and propose to Abhi on her behalf. Amused, Abhi agrees. Two months later, Neha playfully asks Kunal and Sam if they felt anything for each other when they pretended to be gay; they say [...] "no", remembering their kiss.|$|E
