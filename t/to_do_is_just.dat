500|$|To {{cast the}} series, Jeremy Simmons and Thairin Smothers posted to LGBT Internet forums and {{electronic}} mailing lists, and visited college campuses. In August 2004 they {{traveled around the}} country to meet the shortlisted candidates. Smothers said that their main casting goal was diversity. Diverse representation was also important to T.J. Jourian, one of the four students cast for the show: [...] "What pushed me to do it was the idea of showing trans people of color, pushing beyond the American image of a gay white man." [...] "I didn’t want to be in anything where I was representing the whole community.… What I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> give another example of a way to be." ...|$|E
500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down {{of all of these}} things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E

500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect for myself and that way you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's always a little bit confusing. The best thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> to ignore the fact, I think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E
500|$|Only days later, Carey began posting {{irregular}} voice {{notes and}} messages on her official website: [...] "I'm {{trying to understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should {{have done in the}} first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself." [...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|Generally men aged 50 years, and on some islands men aged 60 years, {{do most of}} {{the talking}} and {{decision}} making at meetings of the community councils (Falekaupule), which are organised according to the law and custom of each island. Although women have the vote in meetings of the Falekaupule on [...] 7 of the 9 islands, but most do no exercise their voting rights. Milikini Failautusi, young Tuvaluan activist, has argued that cultural issues in Tuvalu are preventing women from working in equal partnership with men. For example, women cannot be appointed as an aliki (chief). Ms Failautusi is quoted as saying [...] "hen it comes to cultures, women they don't [...] to say anything at all. They don't have a say. They only have to sit at the back and support the elders or their husbands or the leaders in their families [...] [...] [...] All they have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> support them in terms of looking for money, looking for food, and looking after the babies and the families".|$|E

2500|$|Ishiro Honda {{wanted the}} theme of the movie to be a satire of the Television {{industry}} in Japan. In April 1962, TV networks and their various sponsors started producing outrageous programming and publicity stunts to grab audiences attention after two elderly viewers reportedly died at home while watching a violent wrestling match on TV. The various rating wars between the networks and banal programming that followed this event caused widespread debate over how TV would effect Japanese culture with Soichi Oya stating TV was creating [...] "a nation of 100 million idiots". Honda stated [...] "People were making {{a big deal out of}} ratings, but my own view of TV shows was that they did not take the viewer seriously, that they took the audience for granted....so I decided to show that through my movie" [...] and [...] "the reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times". Honda addressed this by having a pharmaceutical company sponsor a TV show and going to extremes for a publicity stunt for ratings by capturing a giant monster stating [...] "All a medicine company would have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> produce good medicines you know? But the company doesn't think that way. They think they will get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.". Honda would work with screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa on developing the story stating that [...] "Back then Sekizawa was working on pop songs and TV shows so he really had a clear insight into television".|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked what}} the goal was in making Instrument, Cohen responded: [...] I did feel {{that there were a}} lot of people that either didn't have access to the band or had {{something}} of a misconception of what they were like. I wanted to address those issues to some degree, but what I really wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> capture music-making and try to make something that felt, visually, like music, and something where the music was inextricably tied in with the moving pictures.|$|R

5000|$|Lyrically {{the album}} {{contains}} elements including depressing emotions, anger and recovery. Explaining to MTV, Bennington said: [...] "We don't talk about situations, {{we talk about}} the emotions behind the situations. Mike and I are two different people, so we can't sing about the same things, but we both know about frustration and anger and loneliness and love and happiness, and we can relate on that level." [...] In the same interview, Shinoda explained it as: [...] "What we really wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> push ourselves and push each other to really find new ways to be creative."

A hasty survey of his surroundings discovered a fire blackened hollow stub split its full length on one side. It was the very thing he was looking for.
