It was truly alarming that the Sandinistas were intent on providing the very services that establish a government's political and moral legitimacy.|$|E
25|$|The foul strike {{rule was}} a major rule change <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few years, sent {{baseball}} from a high-scoring game to a game where scoring any runs was a struggle. Prior to this rule, foul balls did not count as strikes. Thus, a batter could foul off a countless number of pitches with no strikes counted against him—except for bunt attempts. This gave the batter an enormous advantage. In 1901, the National League adopted the foul strike rule, and the American League followed suit in 1903.|$|E

25|$|Once the rebellions {{had been}} put down, Abu Bakr began a war of conquest.

Abu Bakr began with Iraq, the richest province of the Sasanian Empire. He sent general Khalid ibn Walid to invade the Sasanianan Empire in 633. He thereafter also sent four armies to invade the Roman province of Syria, but the decisive operation was only undertaken when Khalid, after completing the conquest of Iraq, was transferred to the Syrian front in 634.|$|E
25|$|When in 1551 the {{mismanagement}} of Sir William Dansell, King's Merchant to the Low Countries, {{had caused the}} English Government much financial embarrassment, the authorities called Gresham for advice, thereafter following his proposals.

The Government sought Gresham's advice in all their money difficulties, and also frequently employed him in various diplomatic missions.

This would set in motion a historical trajectory (continued later on by Umar and Uthman ibn Affan) <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history.

40|$|In an era {{in which}} Europe is {{experiencing}} a new wave of emigration {{as a result of the}} economic crisis, it seems socially relevant to study the processes that underlie emigrants’ adjustment to their new place of living. Research has thoroughly supported the assumption <b>that</b> believing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>just</b> world is <b>an</b> adaptive mechanism that helps people to deal with uncertainty and harsh realities in life. We propose that the endorsement of such beliefs might also contribute to a positive identification with the host country. Using a sample of Portuguese emigrants (N = 144), we demonstrate in a cross-sectional design <b>that</b> belief <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>just</b> world predicts <b>a</b> positive identification with the host country. In addition, positive levels of identification with the host country predicted higher levels of satisfaction with emigrant life. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
