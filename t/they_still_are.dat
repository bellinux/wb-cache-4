500|$|In some instances, {{the colour}} {{combinations}} look garish: {{this is particularly}} {{the case with the}} Prophet Daniel. A comparison of the [...] "restored" [...] and [...] "unrestored" [...] figure gives strong evidence that Michelangelo worked over this figure in a wash of carbon black, and that the technique was preplanned. The bright red used on the robes of Daniel and the Libyan Sibyl does not, on its own, create effective shadows. In these and many other cases it appears to have been intended as underpainting, to be seen only through a thin black wash and with the deepest shadows picked out in more intense black, as <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> on the Cumaean Sibyl. This use of bright, contrasting colours as underpainting is not a common feature of frescoes, but it is commonly employed in both oil painting and tempera. Like Daniel, the Libyan Sibyl's yellow garment once had much more subtlety in its folds and shadows than it has now.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} over Andrew Lincoln's performance. Despite citing {{that his}} accent was [...] "dodgy", Pierce lauded Lincoln's acting. [...] "his body language and expression here is totally different {{now than when}} we saw him before," [...] he opined. [...] "He's a fast learner." [...] Gilbert referred to his accent as [...] "spotty", while Goldman professed that Lincoln fit into character very well; [...] "For much of the pilot, he's {{on his own and}} exudes a lot of believable, shocked emotion, as Rick tries to process what he is seeing. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln's performance was one of the episode's drawbacks. He wrote: [...] "One drawback in [...] is that Lincoln plays his emotion a little too close to his deputy's badge. We're told– by him– that all he wants to do is find his wife and kid. His belief that <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> alive is the emotional drive of the story, but there's not enough deep pain that seeps up to coat the dialogue Lincoln delivers." ...|$|E
500|$|Another critic, Maria Tatar, {{notes that}} there is little to admire in Puss—he threatens, flatters, deceives, and steals in order to promote his master. She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a [...] "linguistic virtuoso", a {{creature}} who has mastered the arts of persuasion and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth. [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> found. The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative, or beside the point. The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth, but the moral is belied by the poor miller's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage, but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat. The second moral stresses womankind's vulnerability to external appearances: fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts. In an aside, Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning, [...] "it {{has something to do with}} inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters." ...|$|E
500|$|For these concerts, Bache {{programmed}} five of Liszt's symphonic poems, the Faust and Dante symphonies, the Thirteenth Psalm and the Legend of St. Elisabeth. Works of Berlioz, Schumann and Wagner {{were also}} featured, but Liszt's compositions predominated. While {{the performances of}} the Faust and Dante symphonies were British premieres, the symphonic poems had previously been introduced at the Crystal Palace; nevertheless, Bache felt that offering repeat performances of the symphonic poems was important in making them familiar to audiences. Les préludes was performed three times at the Bache concerts, Mazeppa, [...] Festklänge and Orpheus each twice and Tasso once. Part of this strategy of familiarity was {{the inclusion of the}} two-piano arrangements of the symphonic poems as a way to prepare audiences for the orchestral versions. Bache had begun this practice with his first concert in 1865, when he and Dannreuther presented the two-piano arrangement of Les préludes. Another part of this strategy was supplying learned, well-considered and thoroughly detailed essays for program notes. Sometimes Bache wrote them himself; at other times, he relied on prominent theorists such as Carl Weitman and Frederick Niecks. According to musicologist Alan Walker, they [...] "are filled with insights that were both new and original for their time, and they are lavishly illustrated with music examples—a sure sign that they were aimed at a sophisticated public and were intended to have a potential life after the concert was over." [...] According to Walker, <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> worth study for Liszt scholars as many of the ideas, while transmitted through members of Liszt's inner circle, probably originated with the composer himself. These notes, along with the inclusion of the two-piano arrangements and what musicologist Michael Allis calls [...] "a thoughtful approach to programming ... all contributed to an aggressive marketing of Liszt's new status as a composer".|$|E

500|$|In {{the colonies}} {{of a few}} ant species, there are {{physical}} castes—workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major ergates. Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger mandibles. These are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates. Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called [...] "soldier" [...] ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> workers and their [...] "duties" [...] typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors. Weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution. Some other species show continuous variation {{in the size of}} workers. The smallest and largest workers in Pheidologeton diversus show nearly a 500-fold difference in their dry-weights. Workers cannot mate; however, because of the haplodiploid sex-determination system in ants, workers of a number of species can lay unfertilised eggs that become fully fertile, haploid males. The role of workers may change with their age and in some species, such as honeypot ants, young workers are fed until their gasters are distended, and act as living food storage vessels. These food storage workers are called repletes. For instance, these replete workers develop in the North American honeypot ant Myrmecocystus mexicanus. Usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes; and, if repletes are removed from the colony, other workers become repletes, demonstrating the flexibility of this particular polymorphism. This polymorphism in morphology and behaviour of workers initially was thought to be determined by environmental factors such as nutrition and hormones that led to different developmental paths; however, genetic differences between worker castes have been noted in Acromyrmex sp. These polymorphisms are caused by relatively small genetic changes; differences in a single gene of Solenopsis invicta can decide whether the colony will have single or multiple queens. The Australian jack jumper ant (Myrmecia pilosula) has only a single pair of chromosomes (with the males having just one chromosome as they are haploid), the lowest number known for any animal, making it an interesting subject for studies in the genetics and developmental biology of social insects.|$|E

Most albums included three or four records, with two sides each, making six or eight tunes per album. When the 12-inch vinyl LP era began in 1949, the single record often had the same or similar number of tunes as a typical album of 78s, and was still {{often referred to as}} an [...] "album", as <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> today.|$|E

2500|$|Other anti-social {{species have}} an effect, though rather small, on the {{relationship}} between wolves and moose on Isle Royale. Before wolves hunted them to extinction, coyotes used to inhabit the island. Beavers and snowshoe hares also have an effect on both populations, because beavers and snowshoe hares are the only two animals that wolves prey on excluding moose, constituting a tenth of an Isle Royale wolf's diet. The beaver population has sharply declined since the arrival of wolves, but <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> present, and though they are not a prime food source for typical wolves, they are the second to moose as the most consumed animal by the wolves on the island. [...] Beavers benefit both species. They are as easy prey for wolves and they create aquatic macrophytes, very nutritional plants for moose, although the macrophytes are also consumed by the beavers. Though wolves are thought to contribute to the decline in beaver, researchers believe that the decline of aspen, the primary food source of beavers, which used to be plentiful, could have led to their decrease. Beavers have been exposed to predation by having to travel long distances to find only parts of the island where aspen remains.|$|E
2500|$|Allegheny {{requires}} {{students to}} choose a minor {{as well as a}} major and encourages [...] "unusual combinations" [...] of majors and minors. A student's major can be in the humanities, social sciences or natural sciences, but that student's minor must be in a different division than his or her major. A reporter explained: [...] "a student enrolled in a humanities major such as English, art, or religious studies, would still take 20 to 24 credits – five to six courses – of science-related study if they decided to pick their minor within the natural sciences division... Even if they don't, <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> required to pick two courses from within the natural science areas. One of those science courses must be a lab class." [...] The interdisciplinary approach is reflected in how graduates have fared with their careers. For example, Kathleen Harrill earned degrees in music and psychology at Allegheny, and used them to become a music therapist to help children diagnosed with autism; her 300-page thesis on music and healing won recognition. Another graduate studied both English and bioethics at Allegheny, and became a lawyer at Bayer corporation helping to work on ethics and compliance issues. One student who wanted to become a special education teacher found a new love of documentary filmmaking after majoring in communication arts; her senior film [...] "Finding Matty's Voice" [...] won the Best Documentary and Grand Jury prizes at the Ivy Film Festival at Brown University in 2008.
