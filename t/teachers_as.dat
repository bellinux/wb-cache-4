5|$|Always {{one of the}} {{smallest}} children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his <b>teachers</b> <b>as</b> a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
5|$|At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration {{among the}} <b>teachers</b> <b>as</b> well as students. He befriends an older student named Vetch, but {{generally}} remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges {{him to a}} duel. He casts a powerful spell intended to raise {{the spirit of a}} dead woman, but the spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature, which attacks Ged and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle banishes the shadow and saves Ged's life, although it costs Nemmerle his own.|$|E

Focusing first on how these teachers see themselves and how they articulate their roles, the study then turns to an analysis based on Judith Butler's theories of identity formation. The role of normative power in identity formation is exemplified by what the paper calls "The Regime of Teacher Norms," i. e., <b>Teacher</b> <b>as</b> Expert, <b>Teacher</b> <b>as</b> Guide, <b>Teacher</b> <b>as</b> Professional and <b>Teacher</b> <b>as</b> Boss...|$|R
5|$|Showing acting skill {{early in}} life, Bana began doing {{impressions}} {{of family members}} {{at the age of}} six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather's walk, voice and mannerisms. In school, he mimicked his <b>teachers</b> <b>as</b> a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, however, so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables.|$|E

5|$|Congregational {{prayers were}} {{reestablished}} at al-Azhar during the Mamluk Sultanate by Sultan Baibars in 1266. While Shāfi‘ī teachings, which Saladin and the Ayyubids followed, stipulated {{that only one}} mosque should {{be used as a}} congregational mosque in a community, the Hanafi madh'hab, to which the Mamluks adhered, placed no such restriction. Al-Azhar had by now lost its association with the Fatimids and Ismāʿīli doctrines, and with Cairo's rapid expansion, the need for mosque space allowed Baibars to disregard al-Azhar's history and restore the mosque to its former prominence. Under Baibars and the Mamluk Sultanate, al-Azhar saw the return of stipends for students and <b>teachers,</b> <b>as</b> well as the onset of work to repair the mosque, which had been neglected for nearly 100 years. According to al-Mufaddal, the emir 'Izz al-Din Aydamur al-Hilli built his house next to the mosque and while doing so repaired the mosque. Al-Maqrizi reports that the emir repaired the walls and roof as well as repaving and providing new floor mats. The first khutbah since the reign of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim took place on January 16, 1266 with the sermon delivered on a new pulpit completed five days earlier.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine the role of the ballet <b>teacher</b> <b>as</b> a {{perceived}} source of weight loss pressure for the ballet student. Another purpose was to examine whether there could be a positive relationship between the reported use of unhealthy methods of losing weight and the perception of the <b>teacher</b> <b>as</b> a source of weight loss pressure. Finally, we sought to identify the forms of communication used by the teachers that could be construed as weight loss pressures by the students. Forty ballet students participated in the study and completed the BALLET Scale, Eating Behaviors Scale and the Athletic Image Scale. Students were placed into one of two groups based on their answers to the Athletic Image Scale (combined-pressures, no-pressures). The results showed that students did perceive the <b>teacher</b> <b>as</b> a source of weight loss pressure. Further, a positive relationship existed between students who perceived the <b>teacher</b> <b>as</b> a source of weight loss pressure and unhealthy eating behaviors. The results also showed that students in the combined-pressures group perceived more forms of communication by the <b>teacher</b> <b>as</b> weight loss pressures...|$|R
