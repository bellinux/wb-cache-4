60|$|Assuredly {{this is a}} false interpretation, {{and utterly}} unpoetical. It is even {{doubtful}} whether [Hebrew: unable to transliterate. txt Ed.] ('ruach') in this place means 'spirit' in contradistinction to 'matter' at all, and not rather air or wind. At all events, the poetic decorum, the proportion, and the antithetic parallelism, demand a somewhat as much below God, as the horse is below man. The opposition of 'flesh' and 'spirit' in the Gospel of St. John, who thought in Hebrew, though he wrote in Greek, favours our common version,--'flesh and not spirit': but the place in which this passage stands, namely, {{in one of the}} first forty chapters of Isaiah, and therefore written long before the Captivity, together with the majestic simplicity characteristic of Isaiah's name gives perhaps a greater probability to the other: 'Egypt is man, and not God; and her horses flesh, and not wind'. If Mr. Oxlee renders the fourth verse of Psalm civ.--'He maketh spirits his messengers', (for our version--'He maketh his angels spirits'--is without a violent inversion senseless), this {{is a case in point}} for the use of the word, 'spirits', in the sense of incorporeal beings. (Mr. Oxlee will hardly, I apprehend, attribute the opinion of some later Rabbis, that God alone and exclusively is a Spirit, to the Sacred Writers, easy as it would be to quote a score of texts in proof of the contrary.) I, however, cannot doubt that the <b>true</b> <b>rendering</b> of the above-mentioned verse in the Psalms is;--'He maketh the winds his angels or messengers, and the lightnings his ministrant servants'.|$|E

In fact, as I {{said some}} time ago, the whole {{landscape}} of Claude {{was nothing but}} a more or less softened continuance of the old traditions of missal-painting, of which I gave examples in the previous volume. The general notion of rock which may be traced in the earliest work, as Figs. 1 and 2 in Plate +10+ Vol. III. is of an upright mass cut out with an adze; as art advances, the painters begin to perceive horizontal stratification, and, as in all the four other examples of that plate, show something like <b>true</b> <b>rendering</b> of the fracture of rocks in vertical joints with superimposed projecting masses. They insist on this type, thinking it frowning or picturesque, and usually exhibit it to more advantage by putting a convent, hermitage, or castle on the projection of the crag. In the blue backgrounds of the missals the projection is often wildly extravagant; for instance, the MS. Additional, 11,696 Brit. Mus., has all its backgrounds composed of blue rocks with towers upon them, of which Fig. 85 is a characteristic example (magnified in scale about one-third; but, I think, rather diminished in extravagance of projection). It is infinitely better drawn than Claude's rocks ever are, in the expression of cleavage; but certainly somewhat too bold in standing. Then, in more elaborate work, we get conditions of precipice like Fig. 3 in Plate +10+, which, indeed, is not ill-drawn in many respects; and the book from which it is taken shows other evidences of a love of nature sufficiently rare at the period, though joined quaintly with love of the grotesque: for instance, the writer, giving an account of the natural productions of Saxony, illustrates his chapter {{with a view of the}} salt mines; he represents the brine-spring, conducted by a wooden trough from the rock into an evaporating-house where it is received in a pan, under which he has painted scarlet flames of fire with singular skill; and the rock out of which the brine flows is in its general cleavages the best I ever saw drawn by mediæval art. But it is carefully wrought to the resemblance of a grotesque human head.|$|E

The archaic coin is sharp and hard; every line decisive and numbered, set unhesitatingly in its place; nothing is wrong, though everything incomplete, and, to us who have seen finer art, ugly. The central coin is as decisive and clear in arrangement of masses, but its contours are completely rounded and finished. There is no character in its execution so prominent that you can give an epithet to the style. It is not hard, it is not soft, it is not delicate, it is not coarse, it is not grotesque, it is not beautiful; and I am convinced, unless you {{had been told that}} this is fine central Greek art, you would have seen nothing at all in it to interest you. Do not let yourselves be anywise forced into admiring it; there is, indeed, nothing more here than an approximately <b>true</b> <b>rendering</b> of a healthy youthful face, without the slightest attempt to give an expression of activity, cunning, nobility, or any other attribute of the Mercurial mind. Extreme simplicity, unpretending vigor of work, which claims no admiration either for minuteness or dexterity, and suggests no idea of effort at all; refusal of extraneous ornament, and perfectly arranged disposition of counted masses in a sequent order, whether in the beads, or the ringlets of hair; this is all you have to be pleased with; neither will you ever find, in the best Greek Art, more. You might at first suppose that the chain of beads round the cap was an extraneous ornament; but I have little doubt that it is as definitely the proper fillet for the head of Hermes, as the olive for Zeus, or corn for Triptolemus. The cap or petasus cannot have expanded edges; {{there is no room for}} them on the coin; these must be understood, therefore; but the nature of the cloud-petasus is explained by edging it with beads, representing either dew or hail. The shield of Athena often bears white pellets for hail, in like manner.|$|E

The spatial scales are also modulated to be physically accurate.

Despite this, the resulting pattern elicits almost as vivid an impression of the object's 3 -D shape as a <b>true</b> <b>rendering.</b> Such images were used in depth comparison and gauge figure tasks to assess the relative contribution of spatial scales and orientation fields to shape perception; as well as the dramatic breakdown of shape perception resulting from physically unrealistic orientation and scale configurations.

40|$|Consider college {{success as}} a 1000 -piece pyramid shaped puzzle, with each student {{representing}} one unique piece that fits precisely into a racial hierarchy. This puzzle represents the normative racial paradigm through which the stratification of educational success is viewed, studied, and understood. But, what if one of those pieces does not fit? What becomes of outliers to that dominant hierarchy? Asian Americans illustrate the need for reconsidering this hierarchy, as they do not hold a static position within it. As such, my dissertation aims to answer the broader question: How does complicating the Asian American race category, through the examination of ethnicity, change the outcomes of educational “success” for Asian Americans? To answer this question, I utilize a multilevel mixed-effects approach to examine {{the factors that influence}} educational success – measured as enrollment, persistence and attainment – using longitudinal data, disaggregated by Asian American ethnic subgroup. Guided by racial formation theory, the study finds that the despite the success normally associated with Asian American students, those who are economically disadvantaged face a pronounced disadvantage in enrollment and transfer – one that is more distinctly negative than any other racial group. The study also reveals that counter to former research, as high school GPA increases, Vietnamese students become less likely to enroll in a four-year university than comparable Chinese peers. Together, the study necessitates the questioning of assumptions related to how success and race are linked. Additionally, it undergirds the broader point that being Asian American, despite perceived or actualized success, does not equate freedom from structural discrimination. Thus, whether Asian Americans feel represented by the dominant racial hierarchy or not, there is an immediate need to challenge misconceptions about how the invisibility of some may be {{part and parcel of the}} discrimination faced by all.

40|$|Dear {{readers of}} the All Results Journals:Biol, We are pleased to {{introduce}} to you The All Results Journals: Biol (All Res. J. Biol), a very unique journal that publishes articles and reviews with negative results {{in the field of}} Biology. This journal represents the first total open access source for research concerning negative results and will be a valuable resource for researchers all over the world; experts and those new to the field alike. Our immediate goal is to provide scientists with responsible and balanced information in order to advance faster, improve experimental designs and clinical decisions. Many journals skew towards only publishing “positive” data; that is, data that successfully proves a hypothesis. The All Results Journals: Biol is the home for negative or “secondary” data: experimental documentation of hypotheses that turn out not to be true, or other experiments that do not lead to an advance of a specific hypothesis but are, nevertheless, a <b>true</b> <b>rendering</b> of that experiment. For example, if a researcher set up a cell-based experiment and the experiment did not work in a particular set of conditions, it would be very useful for other researchers to know this (to avoid time and money wasting and better planning). There is a huge untapped resource of experimental data locked up in laboratory notebooks that could be of great service to the scientific community at large. Many experiments fail to produce results or expected discoveries. This high percentage of ‘failed’ research can still generate high quality knowledge. The main objective of The All Results Journals: Biol is to recover and publish these valuable pieces of scientific information. As we publish negative results, the newer generation of researchers will not waste their time and money repeating the same studies and finding the same results (negative in this case). We believe that negative results are high-level pieces of knowledge that deserves to be published. The All Results Journals: Biol is a peer reviewed journal developed to publish original, innovative and novel research articles resulting in negative results. This peer-reviewed scientific journal publishes theoretical and empirical papers that report negative findings and research failures in Biology and related fields. Submissions should have a negative focus; experiments that yield negative results will be given more preference. All theoretical and methodological perspectives are welcomed. We also encourage the submission of short papers/communications presenting counter-examples to usually accepted conjectures or to published papers. Negative results in Biology Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy. Biology is a vast subject containing many subdivisions, topics, and disciplines. It seems with our ever increasing ability to dissect biological systems to finer detail, simplicity of explanation becomes more elusive. With this in mind, The All Results Journals serves as a platform and resource for your important negative observations that stand the test of rigorous scientific scrutiny and methodology in the complex fields of biology. Data collected under exceptional experimental design that may not support a convention in a given area of research should and can be reported. Negative results shape the development of effective therapeutic agents, help us understand what cell types are critical for autoimmune pathogenesis and redefine the molecular targets of a drug. These data serve to drive the scientific method forward by showing the path not to follow. As scientists we strive for remarkable observations within biological systems that will further expand our understanding of the human condition, aging, cancer, autoimmunity, etc. At the All Results Journal we know how science gets done; sometimes the pieces just don’t add up. These negative results drive our next step at the bench but are rarely published. We are working to bring to light these types of observations to be published under peer review for the greater good. Our goal is to make accessible a manuscript about what didn’t work so you can build on the mistakes of others rather than simply repeat them. Instead of three steps forward and two steps back, Science could just move forward. We now have an unbiased forum to present a negative finding. In Cancer research or chemotherapeutic development, for example, the trend is to publish data showing efficacy. We’d offer that inefficacy could also be of great importance to the scientific community. What agents failed, in what types of cancer and why; the latter question albeit difficult to answer. One could imagine the same trends emerging from this type of work in terms of gene expression profiling, proteomics and biomarkers. Agent X will not be effective in cancer Y because of overexpression of biomarker Z. A manuscript focused on the inefficacy of a particular chemotherapeutic agent could assist in moving the cancer biology field forward by offering a forum to share with the greater cancer research community the same negative findings that {{may have contributed to the}} development of a highly effective agent. Breaking this cycle of publishing only positive results will undoubtedly improve our ability to make educated decisions at the bench in biology. Furthermore, there are many research based scientific disciplines that would benefit from bringing this important work to the mainstream of scientific publication and peer review. This trend (resistance to publish negative results or unsuccessful experiments) has been recently defined as “publication bias” and has major ramifications for the health of citizens. Publication bias is a growing problem and some authors are now extensively writing about it. 1 Not only Health but also Ecology has shown this publication bias and have been widely discussed by different authors in recent years. 2 - 5 Generally, results that either fail to reject a null hypothesis or do not accord with the current consensus are often not published, which may lead to a biased representation of natural processes. 6 Although it is believed that publication and dissemination bias is less pronounced in Ecology than Medicine, 3, 4 there is the same resistance among the authors of several fields to submit their negative results. This problem does exist in Ecology and others sub-fields of Biology (Botany, Biochemistry, Genetics, etc.) and is probably accentuated by the lack of a venue for publishing negative results like The All Results Journals: Biol. Contradictions of current expectations can also suffer bias. This trend might be perpetuated by the attitude of researchers who have deliberately hidden negative results or by the ones who neglected or forgot about results entirely (mainly due to lack of time). Large research groups might continue with other experiments without stopping, analysing or reporting negative results. In these cases, the authors contribute to a growing problem because they consider those results to be less interesting and important than they actually are. 3 It may contribute to biases in meta-analytical studies due to negative results being less accessible to the wider scientific community. Another important type of publication bias in Ecology (as in other sub-fields) arises from replication. Biological systems are difficult and costly to replicate under natural conditions (i. e. natural variables are very heterogeneous in space and time) and replicate studies often reveal nothing new and/or produce negative results. 5 The All Results Journals: Biol can help to fight the publication bias problem in Biology (and its sub-fields) first, providing an excellent way for negative results (non-significant, contradict current expectations, lack of replication, etc.) publication and second, contributing to increase the negative results’ knowledge for scientific progress. Additionally, researchers must overcome their self-imposed barriers to the publication of negative results and give them the attention they deserve. In this issue In this first issue we feature an updated review on malaria, highlighting some negative results obtained in treatments. The paper highlights the plasmodium genes of interest playing a role in resistance to first line therapies such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethanine. The respective mode of action of these and other second generation compounds are discussed and presented as the next line of combination therapies that will hopefully overwhelm resistance genes. The authors provide the scope and history of antimalarial drug development as well as the problems facing implementation of drug regimens, diagnosis and follow-up statistics of patients. At the heart of this review is the failure and limitations of some of the most recently developed anti-malarial agents at various stages of clinical development. Therein the authors review shortcomings in study design germane to current non-human primate models available. They go on to discuss the biochemical rationale of the various agents and offset this with potential side effects of the drugs. The subject matter at hand, namely the difficulties with development of an effective antimalarial agent and achieving clinical success are in the spirit of the All Results Journal. The second article describes the negative results obtained when testing a new protecting ischemic stroke drug. Thromboembolic occlusion of intracerebral vessels is responsible for the majority of ischemic strokes. The intrinsic pathway for thrombus formation is initiated when coagulation factor XII (FXII) becomes activated on a negatively charged surface followed by successive activation of factor XI (FXI) and factor IX (FIX). It has been shown that FXII-deficient mice were protected from pathological thrombus formation so the use of FXII inhibitors would be associated with relatively low rates of therapy-related hemorrhages, the major clinical complication associated with current anticoagulant therapies. The authors tested the new chemical COU 254, a 3 -carboxamide-coumarine that selectively inhibits FXIIa, in a rodent model. The authors found no differences between controls and mice treated with COU 254 when they induced cerebral ischemia. In addition, they didn’t find any significant differences in infarct volumes in both groups. Furthermore, analysis of the neurological status in both groups did not reveal any beneficial effects of COU 254 in acute ischemic stroke or any differences in thrombus formation. The authors pointed out some reasons why these negative results were obtained like optimum dosage or correct timing of drug administration after ischemic stroke induction. We agree with the authors that further preclinical evaluation is needed. This negative result opens the door to new antithrombotic drug improvements. Epilogue We strongly believe that the total Open Access format of the new journal has clear benefits for science, medicine and the general public: First, all articles are freely and universally accessible online, and so an author's work can be read by anyone at no cost. The easy and widespread availability of articles significantly enhances reading and citation of the results. Second, all accepted articles are immediately published with no delay and therefore, allow particularly rapid dissemination of new results. Third, The All Results Journals: Biol. allows interactive discussion and annotation of articles providing an online tool for open discussion of data. Fourth, there is no size restriction for articles and no publication charges to authors. Authors hold copyright for their work and grant anyone the right to reproduce and disseminate the article, provided that it is correctly cited. There is an ethical imperative and a significant challenge to ensure that finite research resources are better used, avoiding replication of previous experiments leading to an optimization on the use of resources. The All Results Journals: Biol is tackling that challenge, providing to scientists a new tool for publishing their negative results. We invite you to dig into your file drawer or hard drive for the negative results and submit them to The All Results Journals: Biol. All results are good results. ...|$|E
40|$|Proefskrif (DPhil) [...] PU vir CHO, 1985 At the {{beginning}} of this thesis it was mentioned that God created man in a unique way, namely as an integrated body-soul-being, to His image with the instruction to rule the earth. According to this assignment man is therefore involved in his corporeality since he is also corpulently created to this image. Although this study is concerned with physical preparedness, continuous consideration should be given to man as an integrated body-soul-being. This point of view necessitates a proper definition of the concept "physical preparedness". Accordingly the concept "physical preparedness" is eluoidated with the related concepts "preparedness", "physical preparedness", "mental preparedness" and "moral preparedness". "Physical preparedness" is seen as an integral component of man's total preparedness equipment. Furthermore it concerns man's physical welfare and involvement with all aspects of his being. The point of view that physical preparedness is an integral and indispensable part of the total preparedness equipment, is related to the first problem of this study, namely that when making the child physically prepared he is involved as a person in totality. In other words he is present as a physical-moral being. The need for educational institutions to become involved in physical preparedness programmes arises from the fact that man is no longer physically fit because {{there are a number of}} factors within modern society which hamper the physique of man. Education must also take into consideration that mismanagement of leisure time also threatens man's standard of physical preparedness. Education furthermore has to find ways in which youth can become involved and will be made prepared. The abovementioned problems lead to the objectives of this study, namely to point out that physical preparedness is an integral part of every person's preparedness equipment and as such will constitute part of the total preparedness program at educational institutions. To achieve these objectives with this investigation and to place physical preparedness in an educational perspective it was firstly regarded necessary to provide; by way of a literature study, views of various commentators on the subject. Secondly questionnaires were implemented and interviews were conducted to determine from the attitude of practising teaching personnel, whether a need for a physical preparedness program exists. Finally a functional physical preparedness program is introduced on an inductive basis. Since the education system discussed in this thesis is Christian by nature, physical preparedness is also discussed from a Christian-Calvinistic point of view and founded on Biblical preparedness knowledge. Biblical views and revelations about the reality of man's physical existence are used as points of reference. Man in totality was created to God's image not man's soul, or his spirit, or his body, or any aspect of his being which was created to God's image, but man himself. This means that man's body is a likeness of God's body and therefore must continually be related to God and His actions. The fact that the Bible refers to man's body as the temple of the Holy Ghost, places a tremendous responsibility on the shoulders of every Christian educator. This view undoubtedly gives priority and status to physical education and physical preparedness in education. Everywhere in the Bible man is presented as a being in whom soul and body are inseparably joined to the innermost being. This points to the fact that man does not have a body (and a soul), but that he is his body (and soul). It is important for the educator to know that man, according to Biblical terms is also an integrated and complete unity that cannot be divided dualistically into material and spiritual functions. It is essential for the physical preparedness educator to believe that the human body has a glorious eternal destination in the Kingdom of God. With the belief in the resurrection of the flesh education and training has a definite responsibility to bring home a positive religious physical consciousness to its pupils. According to the Bible man is indebted to God for the rendering of physical service. The physical preparedness educator must also accept it as his task to educate the child in deep dependence on submission and responsibility to God for <b>true</b> <b>rendering</b> of service. Faith is therefore a primary requirement for physical preparedness. It is seen as a prerequisite with respect to all the essences of physical preparedness. Various authors agree that physical fitness is the foundation of physical preparedness while emotional fitness, mental fitness, spiritual fitness and social fitness are also described as essential for effective physical preparedness. Health relation to the physical, spiritual, mental and social abilities of man is regarded as an equally important essence of physical preparedness. It is essential that every youth and adult should regard physical health as his/her personal responsibility. The school in conjunction with the parental home has an important role to play in the provision of health education to bring about a healthy and prepared nation. Thorough knowledge of the structure and functioning of the body as well as a knowledge of all the basic essentials of physical preparedness are regarded as imperative for the actualisation of physical preparedness in the life of man. A positive attitude, outlook on life and convictions with regard to physical preparedness are seen as additional requirements for the manifestation of physical preparedness. It is the responsibility of educators to literally lead the youth to obtain out of own desire, a physically prepared style of life. The own acceptance of responsibility for the actualisation of physical preparedness of the self is also described as a fundamental feature. Since learning activities and behaviour are influenced by motivation, it is seen as an indispensable prerequisite for physical preparedness. Motivation is an internal process that can serve to rouse physical preparedness. Optimal motivational possibilities must be built into the physical preparedness pro= gram in order to enrich the preparedness equipment of the child. Physical preparedness is not automatically brought about it is a dynamic event closely related to or influenced by the individual's personality and character. Personality development and character shaping are also described as primary requirements for physical preparedness. Before an actual structure was introduced according to which these physical preparedness essences can be realised, it was considered necessary to review the historical course of physical preparedness after the implementation of the youth preparedness program and also to look at physical preparedness in the current education system. According to the findings of the historical investigation physical preparedness had already been viewed as an important component of youth preparedness even before the introduction of the youth preparedness program. In 1968 the Committee of Teaching Heads already accentuated the development of basic physical and moral preparedness as objectives of preparedness. This committee recommended that physical preparedness should form part of the physical education program. It was, however, found that since the physical preparedness program was introduced in 1971 there has been no evidence of a physical preparedness program or of physical preparedness as a component of the youth preparedness program. Physical preparedness has, however, been continuously characterised as important. The establishment of the "Preparedness Year" and the "Health Year" in 1979 naturally also accentuated the importance of physical preparedness. The investigation into physical preparedness does not imply that no physical preparing is done at schools; it has on the contrary been established by means of questionnaires that teachers are of the opinion that satisfactory physical preparing does occur. It has been established that teachers who completed questionnaires are exceptionally positive about the introduction of a physical preparedness program. They also regard the actualisation of all aspects of physical preparedness as very important. It can be concluded that they regard physical preparedness as an integral part of man's preparedness equipment. They also regard it as essential that man has to be prepared against the negative results of the modern ease-loving way of living on his physique. Teachers attach much importance to the input of education authorities and of everyone else concerned with the education and involvement of all pupils in physical preparedness at school. In the exposition of the task of the teacher in preparing the child physically, it is important to stress that it is a highly demanding task. To lead the toddler who is to a great extent physically unprepared to become a completely physically prepared school-leaver demands a lot of all concerned. Specific aims of physical preparedness have to be achieved before the child is physically prepared. These aims are thoroughly formulated and cover a wide spectrum. In the first place it is pointed out that physical preparedness constitutes an integral part of the general aims of teaching, namely to reach adulthood and become a fully mature citizen. Secondly the specific aims of physical preparedness are based on the following: physical considerations mainly comprising all man's physical abilities; health reasons that among others include the promoting of health and healthy ways of life; spiritual considerations comprising the strengthening of the belief in the Biblical preparedness knowledge with regard to the physique; psychological considerations comprising the raising of specific moral aspects that are related to physical preparedness; social considerations that among others include increasing social acceptance and promoting mass participation. In order to propose a new structure through which these aims can be realised it is necessary to look critically at the present situation first. Then it can be determined, if this is the case, why physical preparedness does not come into its own. According to the South African Defence Force, heads of departments at teachers' training colleges, the HSRC snort investigation and superintendents of education, the contribution to physical preparedness is at present inadequate and the "product" that leaves school does not comply with expectations. Many shortcomings exist in the presentation of physical preparedness, extramural sports and youth preparedness with regard to physical preparedness. There does, however, exist satisfactory opportunity within the present teaching situation to fully equip the child as physically prepared. The foundation for physical preparedness must already be laid during the important first five years of the child's life. It is the responsibility of education, to provide guidance to parents, so that they, in co-operation with the nursery school can help the child to reach school readiness with regard to his physical maturity. This co-operation with the parents must be kept up continuously, it must also be extended to other sectors of society since the school cannot on its own be responsible for a physically prepared youth. In educational context it is especially the teacher who is important, because he influences the child with his enthusiasm and example to physical preparedness. All teachers can contribute to physical preparedness, but some are in a more favourable position, because of the specific nature of the contents of certain subjects. It is especially the physical training teacher who has unparalleled opportunities to influence and motivate the children for physical preparedness due to the unique contact he has with pupils. The physical training teacher can endeavour to realise all the aims of physical preparedness, and especially those that are formulated on physical grounds are to be pursued. The subject "health education" offers the teacher the opportunity to lay health as foundation of physical preparedness. He can inspire the children to maintain a high standard of personal health. The Christian religious instruction teacher's task is to convey the Christian outlook on life with regard to man's physical existence to the child by means of religious instruction. The teacher has to encourage the child to serve God gratefully with his body. Through his subject the biology teacher can heighten the child's understanding, perception, respect and appreciation of his body. In the history class the pupil's attention must be drawn to the important role that a healthy and strong body has played throughout the ages in the survival of his ancestors. The language teacher has to compel the child to self-tuition with regard to certain aspects of physical education. The extramural program is regarded as a very important area for physical preparedness. When extramural activities are handled systematically and correctly they can make a justifiable contribution to the physical preparedness of the child. The sport program especially has educational possibilities for the physical preparedness teacher. Sport has a potential educational power which gives the teacher the opportunity in conjunction with the physical education teacher to pursue all the aims of physical preparedness. The major task of the teacher is to involve all the pupils and to direct their attitudes in such a way that participation in sport will form an integral part of a healthy Christian and physically prepared life style. The cultural societies at school also aim to develop the child in totality. These societies must therefore also take the foundations for physical preparedness into consideration and make a contribution to the development of a healthy body and a healthy way of life. Well planned recreational programs, in which especially the non-achiever in sport is involved has to be introduced at schools. It has to provide in the need for involvement and offer the opportunity for the development of the child's physical abilities. The component "physical preparedness" must be added to the youth preparedness program in the same way as the "moral preparedness" component. This means that it will not be reduced to only physical activities, but that it will be part of the total preparedness action in which every teacher and every educational act (where possible) will continuously be mindful of and directed at physical preparing. The head of department for educational guidance and the headmaster must take care that all the aspects of physical preparedness are co-ordinated and consolidated. Certain periods, as part of the component "physical and moral preparedness", must be incorporated in the section "physical preparedness" in order to impart the necessary theoretical knowledge to the child. By confronting the child with challenges concerning his physique the veld-school can provide him with the opportunity to discover his physical abilities and to use these in the solution of problems with which he is confronted. He also discovers that others are dependent on his physical conduct and his attitude to venturing. The importance of spending leisure time is also realised. The school must motivate, shape his attitude and supply the necessary help and knowledge with regard to useful spending of leisure time. By educating pupils to voluntarily partake in swimming, tennis, jogging, mountaineering, exercise, cycling and other recreational activities during their leisure hours during school term and also during holidays, the school can contribute to the establishment of lasting physical preparedness patterns. In conjunction with the abovementioned physical preparedness actions taken by primary and secondary teaching institutions, the tertiary institutions must extend on what already has been done. It is the responsibility of the college and the university, acting in the interest of a country and its people, to see that every student who completes his studies will do so as a physically and morally prepared adult. The tertiary institution has the special task to fully train the teaching student to efficiently and professionally prepare his pupils physically. This investigation has accentuated the need for and the importance of physical preparedness as an integrated facet of man's preparedness equipment. Modern society with its ease-loving life style makes the implementation of a physical preparedness program by educational institutions imperatively necessary. Through the input of educational authorities and the contributions of all those concerned with education and training as well as the involvement of all pupils, the youth of South Africa can be guided, formed and trained as totally rounded off, fully equipped, mature, physically and morally prepared adults and citizens.
