Included in this evaluation area mesh development study, methodology sensitivity studies, {{and the effects of}} applied loads on the stress in a rolled <b>thread</b> <b>root.</b> A finite element analysis of the thread forming process using implicit modeling methodology, incremental large deformation, elastic-plastic material properties, and adaptive meshing techniques was performed. Results of the study indicate the axial component of the residual stress in the <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> of the fastener is highly compressive. Results also indicate that a rolled threaded fastener loaded to an average tensile stress equal to yield through the cross-section will retain compressive stresses in the <b>thread</b> <b>root.</b> This compressive stress state will be advantageous when evaluating fasteners for fatigue and environmental concerns...|$|E

40|$|Fine {{screw threads}} {{are widely used}} for the bolted joints under severe running conditions. It {{is well known that}} they are {{effective}} to prevent thread loosening due to fine pitch. As for other mechanical characteristics, it has been reported in the previous paper using complex stress functions that the stress concentration at bolt <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> is higher than coarse screw threads and the fatigue strength of threaded fasteners shows a minimum value for varying pitch. However, the latter is questionable since the calculations were conducted under lots of hypotheses. In this study, stress concentration and stress amplitude along <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> are evaluated by three-dimensional finite element analysis, in which numerical models of the bolted joints are constructed so as to accurately represent the effect of thread helical geometry. It is shown that the stress concentration at <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> of fine screw threads is higher than that of coarse screw threads, and the maximum stress amplitude is likely to be lower on the contrary. Meanwhile, it is sometimes recognized that clamping forces of fine screw threads are smaller comparing to those of coarse screw threads when tightened with same torque. To clarify this contradictory phenomenon, tightening experiments are conducted, and it is found that the difference of the energy needed for tightening screw threads is found to be the major cause. 1...|$|E

40|$|Presently, {{the rotary}} wing-head and hub {{subassemblies}} of the Army’s Black Hawk helicopter require almost complete disassembly to inspect failure critical threads {{of the main}} spindle. Even with {{direct access to the}} threads, detection of fatigue cracks in the <b>thread</b> <b>roots</b> is very difficult using visual and penetrant methods. Therefore, the purpose of this project was twofold: (1) to demonstrate an improved nondestructive inspection method for the spindle threads applicable to routine teardown maintenance, and (2) to determine the feasibility of performing safety-of-flight inspections on the spindle with only minimal disassembly. Recent projects funded by the Air Force have shown that the electric current perturbation (ECP) method is capable of detecting very small surface fatigue cracks in gas turbine engine disks 1 and second layer defects in relatively thick structural wing sections. 2 Based on these results, the ECP method was evaluated for its capability to inspect the spindle <b>thread</b> <b>roots</b> not only by scanning the outside diameter (crest of the threads), but also by scanning the hollow spindle bore under the threads and inspecting through the wall thickness for flight-critical cracks. With an ECP probe located on the crest of the threads, high sensitivity to very small defects in the <b>thread</b> <b>roots</b> was achieved and thumbnail shaped EDM slots as small as 0. 53 mm long by 0. 23 mm deep by 0. 064 mm wide were detected. Inspection from the bore requires only that the rotary wing be removed so that a probe can be inserted into the spindle bore. Since this inspection is performed through the spindle wall, sensitivity is reduced and only larger defects are detectable. From the bore, detection of a thumbnail shaped EDM slot measuring 7. 75 mm long by 2. 21 mm deep by 0. 102 mm wide was successfully demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{comprehensive}} usable engineering design approach to the fatigue analysis of threaded connections. Although primarily concerned with the fatigue-fracture mechanics behaviour of screw threads, a broad review of stress analysis investigations in such connections is reported. Connection types, their functions and standardisation authorities are presented {{with the purpose of}} familiarising the reader with the subject and the options available to the design of threaded fasteners. Fatigue crack initiation is discussed with reference to the specific setting of a critical <b>thread</b> <b>root.</b> A crack initiation model is adapted for employment in <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> design. A novel weight function approach is developed for use in the determination of stress intensity factors for threaded connections. A generic solution is proposed valid for the fatigue crack growth from any <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> under any symmetrical stress system. Its development and discussion is examined in detail, remaining close to its proposed application. Two engineering situations where the chief structural components are comprised of threaded members are taken as case studies. The background to each situation is elaborated in detail and full-scale fatigue tests were conducted on the critical components. In all, fourteen full-scale tests under constant and variable amplitude loading are reported. The results of these are analysed and used to validate the fatigue crack initiation and propagation models. Useful observations which are helpful to understanding the fracture mechanisms operating during the fatigue of threaded connections are reported. Material and environmental considerations are examined and a survey of relevant materials and their behaviour in environments associated with threaded fasteners is presented. The merits or otherwise of some common engineering practices are discussed with regard to fatigue. A method has been developed for predicting fatigue life in large threaded connections under random loading. Experimental results have been gathered on two types of components used on certain oil rigs, tether joints and drill strings. The agreement found between prediction and experiment is appreciably better than by previous methods of analysis and also points to aspects open to further improvement...|$|E

40|$|Nondimensional stress {{intensity}} factor (K) solutions for continuous circumferential cracks in threaded fasteners were calculated using finite element methods that determined the energy release rate during virtual crack extension. Assumed loading conditions included both remote tension and nut loading, whereby the effects of applying the load to the thread flank were considered. In addition, K solutions were developed for axisymmetric surface cracks in notched and smooth round bars. Results showed that the stress concentration of a thread causes a considerable increase in K for shallow cracks, but has much less effect for longer cracks. In the latter case, values of K can be accurately estimated from K solutions for axisymmetric cracks in smooth round bars. Nut loading increased K by about 50 % for shallow cracks, but this effect became negligible at crack depth-to-minor diameter ratios (a/d) greater than 0. 2. An evaluation of <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> acuity effects showed that root radius {{has no effect on}} K when the crack depth exceeds 2 % of the minor diameter. Closed-form K solutions were developed for both remote-loading and nut-loading conditions and {{for a wide range of}} <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> radii.

So the axisymmetric model can be used to study the axial-load and the stress distributions of the threaded connection subjected to axial-load. The axial-load and stress distributions in threads are very sensitive to the applied load. With increasing the applied forces, the axial-load and stress distributions over teeth become homogeneous eventually...|$|R

The use of MTP to create segmented chips requires a different approach for threading operations than for normal MTP turning operations, although the fundamental principal is the same.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} recovering from failures of distributable threads with assured timeliness. When a node hosting {{a portion of a}} distributable thread fails, it causes orphans — i. e., segments of distributable threads that are disconnected from the <b>thread’s</b> <b>root.</b> We consider a termination model for recovering from such failures, where the orphans must be detected and aborted, resources held by them must be released and rolled back to safe states, and exceptions must be delivered to farthest, contiguous surviving thread segment from where execution can be resumed. Since distributable threads are subject to time constraints in real-time distributed systems, such recovery must be conducted with assured timeliness. Toward this, we present 1) a real-time scheduling algorithm called AUA, and 2) a distributable thread integrity protocol called TP-TR. We show that AUA and TP-TR bound the orphan cleanup and recovery time (thereby bounding thread starvation durations), maximize total thread accrued timeliness utility, and satisfy thread mutual exclusion constraints. We implement AUA and TP-TR in a real-time middleware that supports distributable threads. Our experimental studies with the implementation validate the algorithm/protocol’s time-bounded recovery property and confirm their effectiveness. in...|$|R
40|$|Rhizobia can infect {{roots of}} host legume plants and induce new organs called nodules, {{in which they}} fix {{atmospheric}} nitrogen. Infection generally starts with root hair curling, then proceeds inside newly formed, intracellular tubular structures called infection threads. A successful symbiotic interaction relies on infection threads advancing rapidly at their tips by polar growth through successive cell layers of the root toward developing nodule primordia. To identify a plant component that controls this tip growth process, we characterized a symbiotic mutant of Medicago truncatula, called rpg for rhizobium-directed polar growth. In this mutant, nitrogen-fixing nodules were rarely formed due to abnormally thick and slowly progressing infection <b>threads.</b> <b>Root</b> hair curling was also abnormal, indicating that the RPG gene fulfils an essential function in the process whereby rhizobia manage to dominate the process of induced tip growth for root hair infection.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a single 7 / 8 ” nominal diameter stud bolt and nuts assembly would fail to perform its required function in a flange assembly when the nut was corroded. This work was undertaken to form a basis for further work in development of a Fitness-For-Service (FFS) assessment for corroded nuts. No current quantitative assessments exist for this area. A failure criterion was defined as a minimum 206. 8 MPa stress in the stud, based on the bolting requirements stated in ASME B 16. 5 - 2003 Pipe Flanges and Flanges Fittings. A simple test rig was manufactured for testing the compliance of the corroded nuts subjected to the 206. 8 MPa stress level and the corrosion was simulated by removing uniform layers of material from the surface of the nut. Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS 12. 0) was also performed to evaluate the test rig and to consider the interaction between the nut and stud at the <b>thread</b> <b>roots.</b> It was found that no failure occurred in the threading and that failure of the assembly only occurred when there was a > 60 % material loss from the nut.
