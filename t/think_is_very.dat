I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording, marketing and distribution which I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> important to any product you want to bring to market ... but I never had that with the record industry. Now that I'm {{on the other side of}} it trying to be the artist and the industry, I realize what the importance of the system was, but I also realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now." [...] He also said that he intends on recording another album [...] "at least one more time and then go on tour, and then I don't know." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Joan Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 in March 2005, Flew rejected the fine-tuning argument as a conclusive proof: [...] "I don't think it proves anything {{but that it is}} entirely reasonable for people who already have a belief in a creating God to regard this as confirming evidence. And it's a point of argument which I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> important – to see that what is reasonable for people to do in the face of new evidence depends on what they previously had good reason to believe." [...] He also said it appeared that there had been progress made regarding the naturalistic origins of DNA. However, he restated his deism, with the usual provisos that his God is not the God of any of the revealed religions. In the same interview, Flew was asked whether he was retracting belief in an Aristotelian God, but answered no.|$|E
2500|$|Conwell first {{appeared}} in the role of Leslie Michaelson on December 2, 2010, introduced by the soap opera's former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell on a recurring status. Conwell auditioned for the role because her [...] "entire family watches the show", she explained [...] "the character was one that I really wanted to play. When I went to the audition, I just really felt it and I think it came off in the audition. I really enjoy working with the cast. They are such great actors which I don’t {{think a lot of people}} realize. The whole experience has been just great". Conwell prepared for the role by researching characteristics of lawyers. Additionally, she said, [...] "I also watched a lot of movies where actors or actresses I admire played lawyers. I then added my own spin on it which I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> important. I had been a fan of the show, so I had an idea of the role. But thank goodness for the internet." [...] Conwell said that she enjoys playing Leslie, a role which signifies [...] "growth" [...] for her career. In December 2012, after two years on recurring, Conwell was placed on contract by Bell's successor, Jill Farren Phelps however, was dropped back to recurring in August 2014.|$|E
2500|$|... "Everyone Will Die" [...] ("a {{celebration of}} life, not {{necessarily}} a death song," [...] said Pierre) was first recorded as a scratch demo on the band's tour bus, and the original vocal track from that recording was kept for the album version, as it represented the emotion the band were striving for. A string section was employed for the bridge. [...] "Having real strings was like {{a dream come true}} for me. I've always wanted to arrange parts, and I finally got to," [...] said Taylor. [...] "The Coma Kid" [...] relates to procrastination: [...] "The Coma Kid...somebody who's unable to 'do.' Somebody who's thinking of 'doing,' but not actually 'doing.'" [...] The song was described as a throwback of sorts to [...] "Modern Chemistry", a track from the band's debut, I Am The Movie. [...] "Boxelder" [...] was written uniquely, in an attempt to break songwriting routine; as a result, the song switches between time signatures, going from seven to four-four during the chorus. [...] "A boxelder needs the tree to live, because they infest the trees, but for them to live they end up killing the tree, and [...] relates that to a relationship, which I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> interesting," [...] said Johnson. [...] "The Worst Is Yet to Come" [...] dates as far back as 2009, and was recorded in the span of one day. Tony Thaxton was not involved in the initial writing due to an arm infection, which also was an issue in the recording process of My Dinosaur Life. Because of his absence, Claudio Rivera of Saves the Day stood in as the drummer for the original demo; Thaxton's drum part was developed later and is present on the album. Likewise, [...] "Bad Ideas" [...] is the oldest song on the album, first attempted during sessions for 2005's Commit This to Memory.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to obtaining {{his record}} deal, Mika sent demos to many record {{companies}} in Britain, but was never signed. One record label in particular claimed that Mika {{had a good}} voice, but insisted he write more conventional songs like Robbie Williams {{in order to become}} more commercial. Mika rejected this advice. [...] The song [...] "Grace Kelly" [...] was inspired by these problems. In 2006 Mika signed with Island Records and began recording his debut album. His musical influences are based in classical music. Before Mika released his debut album he promised the media that [...] "It was a magical world that you could live in. A parallel universe for people that is illusory and enchanting and amazing." [...] Some songs on the album are sexually ambiguous, prompting some questioning regarding Mika's sexuality. On this, Mika comments that he has no taboos about what he can use to tell a story or what stories he can actually tell. He believes that sexualizing music is great, but politically sexualizing music and making the artist's sexuality the defining point of someone's music is [...] "boring". He says about his own sexuality: [...] "...laying myself out on the table to almost a tabloid level and kind of sharing my entire personal life, I'm really not into that." [...] The songs on the album have different subjects. [...] "Grace Kelly", as stated before, is about the struggle of getting a record deal. Mika stated that the song is a very important song on the album mostly because:"...it's a flagpole for the record in terms of lyrical content and the whole pop vision I wanted to get across." [...] The cover for the album and booklet was designed by Mika's sister, Yasmine, who works under the pen name DaWack, Richard Hogg and Mika himself. In March 2007 the album was released in the United States. Before its release there was much publicity about the album, mainly due to its success in Europe. Mika commented on the hype by saying: [...] "I think I'm lucky. Hype can be good and hype can be bad. The good thing that's happening to me is that the hype is about the project, it's about the music ... I'm not the son of anyone famous, I haven't really slept with anyone particularly well known ... it's really just about music, and that's something I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> healthy." ...|$|E

If I write a song it's going to be about the Brady Bunch or Velveeta rather than {{something}} pretentious. I think it's pretty silly when bands get big heads and big egos." ...|$|R

We are {{children}} for the second time at twenty-one, and again when we are grey and put all our burden on the Lord. The young talk generously of relieving the old of their burdens, but the anxious heart is to the old when they see a load {{on the back of the}} young. Let me tell you, Mr. Dishart, that I would condone many things in one-and-twenty now that I dealt hardly with at middle age.

He permits a little bantering even; a rough joke against himself, if it spring sincerely from the complexion of the fact. The poor men are terribly tired of this work: such bivouacking, packing, unpacking; and continual waiting for the tug of battle, which never comes. Biscuits, meal are abundant enough; but flesh-meat wearing low; above all, no right sleep to be had. Friedrich's own table, I should <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> sparingly beset ("A cup of chocolate is my dinner on marching-days," [...] wrote he once, this Season); certainly his Lodging,--damp ground, and the straw sometimes forgotten,--is none of the best. And thus it has to last, night after night and day after day. On September 8th, General Bulow went out for a little butcher's-meat; did bring home [...] "200 head of neat cattle [I fear, not very fat] and 300 sheep." [...] [Tempelhof, v. 172.] ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{should be}} cautious, my child, how you propose {{anything}} {{to be done on}} a ship's board," [...] observed the aunt. [...] "It requires great experience and a suitable knowledge of rigging to give maritime advice. Now, as might have been expected, considering your years, and the short time you have been at sea, you have made several serious mistakes in what you have proposed. In the first place, there should always be a mate on the deck, as I have heard your dear departed uncle say, again and again; and how can there be a mate on the deck if Mr. Mulford `turns in,' as you propose, seeing that he's the only mate we have. Then you should never laugh at any maritime expression, for each and all are, as a body might say, solemnized by storms and dangers. That Harry is fatigued I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> probable; and he must set our watches, as they call it, when he can make his arrangements for the night, and take his rest as is usual. Here is my watch to begin with; and I'll engage he does not find it two minutes out of the way, though yours, Rosy dear, like most girl's time-pieces, is, I'll venture to say, dreadfully wrong. Where is your chronometer, Mr. Mulford? let us see how this excellent watch of mine, which was once my poor departed Mr. Budd's, will agree with that piece of your's, which I have heard you say is excellent." ...|$|E
60|$|But the {{institutions}} savor of superstition in their very principle; and they nourish it by a permanent and standing influence.--This I {{do not mean}} to dispute; but this ought not to hinder you from deriving from superstition itself any resources which may thence be furnished for the public advantage. You derive benefits from many dispositions and many passions of the human mind which are of as doubtful a color, in the moral eye, as superstition itself. It was your business to correct and mitigate everything which was noxious in this passion, as in all the passions. But is superstition the greatest of all possible vices? In its possible excess I think it becomes a very great evil. It is, however, a moral subject, and of course admits of all degrees and all modifications. Superstition is the religion of feeble minds; and they must be tolerated in an intermixture of it, in some trifling or some enthusiastic shape or other, else you will deprive weak minds of a resource found necessary to the strongest. The body of all true religion consists, to be sure, in obedience to the will of the Sovereign of the world, in a confidence in His declarations, and in imitation of His perfections. The rest is our own. It may be prejudicial to the great end,--it may be auxiliary. Wise men, who, as such, are not admirers, (not admirers at least of the munera terræ,) are not violently attached to these things, nor do they violently hate them. Wisdom is not the most severe corrector of folly. They are the rival follies which mutually wage so unrelenting a war, and which make so cruel a use of their advantages, as they can happen to engage the immoderate vulgar, on the one side or the other, in their quarrels. Prudence would be neuter; but if, in the contention between fond attachment and fierce antipathy concerning things in their nature not made to produce such heats, a prudent man were obliged to make a choice of what errors and excesses of enthusiasm he would condemn or bear, perhaps he would think the superstition which builds to be more tolerable than that which demolishes,--that which adorns a country, than that which deforms it,--that which endows, than that which plunders,--that which disposes to mistaken beneficence, than that which stimulates to real injustice,--that which leads a man to refuse to himself lawful pleasures, than that which snatches from others the scanty subsistence of their self-denial. Such, I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> nearly the state of the question between the ancient founders of monkish superstition and the superstition of the pretended philosophers of the hour.|$|E

6000|$|Nor is {{the fourth}} {{proposition}} (viz. [...] "Men must repent of their sins") much more instructive, till what those actions are that are meant by sins be set down. For the word peccata, or sins, being put, as it usually is, to signify in general ill actions that will draw punishment upon the doers, what great principle of morality can that be to tell us we should be sorry, and cease to do that which will bring mischief upon us; without knowing what those particular actions are that will do so? Indeed {{this is a very}} true proposition, and fit to be inculcated on and received by those who are supposed to have been taught WHAT actions in all kinds ARE sins: but neither this nor the former can be imagined to be innate principles; nor to be of any use if they were innate, unless the particular measures and bounds of all virtues and vices were engraven in men's minds, and were innate principles also, which I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> much to be doubted. And therefore, I imagine, it will scarcely seem possible that God should engrave principles in men's minds, in words of uncertain signification, such as VIRTUES and SINS, which amongst different men stand for different things: nay, it cannot be supposed to be in words at all, which, being in most of these principles very general names, cannot be understood but by knowing the particulars comprehended under them. And in the practical instances, the measures must be taken from the knowledge of the actions themselves, and the rules of them,--abstracted from words, and antecedent to the knowledge of names; which rules a man must know, what language soever he chance to learn, whether English or Japan, or if he should learn no language at all, or never should understand the use of words, as happens in the case of dumb and deaf men. When it shall be made out that men ignorant of words, or untaught by the laws and customs of their country, know that {{it is part of the}} worship of God not to kill another man; not to know more women than one not to procure abortion; not to expose their children; not to take from another what is his, though we want it ourselves, but on the contrary, relieve and supply his wants; and whenever we have done the contrary we ought to repent, be sorry, and resolve to do so no more;--when I say, all men shall be proved actually to know and allow all these and a thousand other such rules, all of which come under these two general words made use of above, viz. virtutes et peccata virtues and sins, there will be more reason for admitting these and the like, for common notions and practical principles. Yet, after all, universal consent (were there any in moral principles) to truths, the knowledge whereof may be attained otherwise, would scarce prove them to be innate; which is all I contend for.|$|E
