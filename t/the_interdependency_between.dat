In the CRU-TIAL 3 project <b>the</b> <b>interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> electricity infrastruc-ture (EI) and the information infrastructure (II) responsible for its con-trol, maintenance and management have been thoroughly studied; more-over countermeasures to substantially reduce the risk to interrupt the service have been developed in the project. The possible interdependen-cies have been investigated by means of model at different abstraction levels. In this paper, we present high level models describing <b>the</b> various <b>interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> EI and the II infrastructures, then we il-lustrate on a simple scenario how these models can be detailed to allow the evaluation of some measures of dependability. ...|$|R

30|$|To satisfy {{conditions}} of accuracy and computational efficiency, a mesoscopic model is proposed, in which four factors are considered: the direct impact of rainstorms; the secondary impact (waterlogging) caused by rainstorms; <b>the</b> <b>interdependency</b> <b>between</b> network components; and the recovery abilities of cities. Direct impact of rainstorms {{refers to the}} traffic volume loss caused by reduced visibility and surface friction in each city. Secondary impact of heavy precipitation refers {{to the influence of}} accumulated water on road surfaces (AWORS) and the traffic breakdowns caused by severe waterlogging on traffic volume. <b>The</b> <b>interdependency</b> <b>between</b> network components makes it possible for traffic volume reduction to spread between cities.

40|$|In {{order to}} promote {{collaboration}} among teacher-students {{it is essential that}} teacher educators themselves can collaborate and learn through participation in work organisation communities. Yet we do have quite limited understanding of teacher education organisations and how they promote collaboration and thus workplace learning among teacher educators. In this chapter our aim is to examine <b>the</b> <b>interdependency</b> <b>between</b> social context of teacher education department and individual agency of educators {{in order to get a}} better understanding of teacher educators' workplace learning. We ask how educators can practice their professional identity and agency and how to characterise <b>the</b> <b>interdependency</b> <b>between</b> social context and individual agency. We sought answers by interviewing eight Finnish teacher educators and analysed the interview data in accordance with data-driven qualitative approach. Findings suggest that social context in this organisation affords teacher educators many possibilities to practice their agency by developing their own practices and teaching. However, social context does not enhance boundary crossing between communities of practice and impedes collaboration of educators. Hence, this may prevent educators' workplace learning and also organisational development of the teacher education department...|$|E
