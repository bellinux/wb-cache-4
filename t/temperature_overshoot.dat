Differential Scanning Calorimetry was used to characterise cure kinetics variability of a commercial epoxy resin used in aerospace applications. It was found that cure kinetics uncertainty is associated with variations in the initial degree of cure, activation energy and reaction order. A cure simulation model was coupled with conventional Monte Carlo and an implementation of the Probabilistic Collocation Method. Both simulation schemes are capable of capturing variability propagation, with the collocation method presenting benefits in terms of computational cost against the Monte Carlo scheme with comparable accuracy.

The oscillation can remove the bubbles, which are forming in the nucleation sites as soon as they start growing on the outer surface. This increases efficiency of nucleation sites, which are very scarce. All of the oscillation amplitudes and frequencies, tested here, changed the boiling curve of highly wetting dielectric fluid, so that the apparent <b>temperature</b> <b>overshoot</b> has decreased.

These blisters consist of raised regions on the surface of fuel plates that occur when the cladding plastically deforms in response to fission-gas pressure in large pores in the fuel meat and/or mechanical buckling of the cladding over damaged regions in the fuel meat. The blister temperature threshold decreases with irradiation because the mechanical properties of the fuel plate degrade while under irradiation (due to irradiation damage and fission-product accumulation) and because the fission-gas inventory progressively increases (and, thus, so does the gas pressure in pores) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} focused on the effects of {{exothermic}} reactions during torrefaction, a mild heat treatment process in the temperature range 200 to 300 °C. Three different scalcs are considered, the micro-particle (podwer scale), the macro-particle (woodchips or larger) and the thick fixed bed (pilot reactor) together with three wood types, spruce, beech and locust. At the powder scale, TGA-DSC tests indicate that exothermic reactions are noticeable principally during the first stages of torrefaction. The mass loss kinetics are used to evaluate parameters for a DAEM (Distributed Activation Energy Method) model. At the macro-particle scale, temperature measurements within wood planks heated in an oven depict the presence of <b>temperature</b> <b>overshoots</b> due to the exotherrnic reactions that lead to unevenly treated particles. At the reactor scale, a large fixed bed of wood chips is heated in the same aven by an up-flowing recirculated mixture of inert gas and volatiles. The exothermic reactions are found to generate a heat wave that propagates up the bed. Overall mass losses are found to largely exceed those preclicted with the DAEM model based on recorded bed temperatures. This means that, in order to reach the measured product yields, the inner core temperatures of the wood chips must be higher than either their outer surface or the gas flow. Multi-scale modelling approaches are therefore required {{to take into account the}} combined exothemicity and diffusional limitations within the wood chips or at their exchange surfaces...|$|R

As non-condensable gas (NCG) {{is an important factor}} affecting the startup behavior, its effects on the startup performance of an ammonia-stainless steel LHP with and without preconditioning were experimentally investigated in this work. Nitrogen with controlled amounts was used to simulate the NCG, and the <b>temperature</b> <b>overshoot,</b> liquid superheat and startup time were employed as the evaluation criteria. Four situations relating to initial liquid/vapor distribution in the evaporator were examined: (1) both evaporator core and vapor grooves are filled with liquid, (2) vapor exists in vapor grooves and the evaporator core is filled by liquid, (3) vapor grooves are filled by liquid and vapor exists in the evaporator core, and (4) vapor exists in both evaporator core and vapor grooves. Experimental results showed that with NCG presence in the LHP, the startup could only proceed in situation 1 with preconditioning, while it could proceed in situations 1, 3 or 4 without preconditioning. For the startup in situation 1, a larger NCG inventory led to much degraded startup performance, and a higher startup heat load could benefit the startup. For the startup in situation 3, the most difficult startup situation, NCG resulted in a very high <b>temperature</b> <b>overshoot,</b> which may even exceed the maximum allowable value.

Recent developments in thermoelectrics (TE) may soon make them a viable solution for such applications. This team has been exploring the potential of using TE modules in combination with variable conductance heat pipes for transferring the exhaust heat to the generator with very low thermal resistance and at a constant, prescribed temperature. This passive temperature control {{eliminates the need for}} by-pass systems in the event of <b>temperature</b> <b>overshoots.</b> The operating <b>temperature</b> of a generator should be as high as possible in order to maximize the Seebeck effect. However, currently available modules are temperature limited. Moreover, the higher the HP temperature the less the usable thermal power at the exhaust will be (heat can only be transferred to from a hotter to a colder body). The present work assesses both theoretically and experimentally the influence of the HP temperature in the electric output of a thermoelectric generator. A small diesel engine and a generator were tested and it was found that a high HP operating temperature is only limitative for performance in the cases where low exhaust temperature and low engine power are present. In those cases it is possible to estimate an optimal HP temperature in order to maximize power output.

40|$|Abstract. The use {{of diesel}} fuel to power a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) {{presents}} several challenges. A major issue is deposit formation {{in either the}} external reformer, the anode channel, or within the SOFC anode itself. These deposits are generally poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) produced either by gas-phase pyrolysis of the fuel or by catalytic reactions. In this report we describe n-hexane and ethylene pyrolysis experiments under conditions relevant to reformer or SOFC operation (τ=~ 1 s, T= 550 ~ 900 ºC, P~ 0. 8 atm) to explore the potential for gas-phase reactions to produce deposit precursors. N-hexane is very reactive under these conditions and forms significant amounts of olefins (mainly ethylene) {{which can lead to}} deposits. The ethylene experiments also demonstrated that higher molecular weight species (deposit precursors) are rapidly formed. Under autothermal reforming conditions, such pyrolytic reactions are possible upstream of the catalyst bed if the fuel, air, and steam streams are not fully mixed. If part of the fuel does not mix with the oxidizer it will simply pyrolyze. At the same time, the remaining fuel fraction mixes with the entire oxidant inlet and thus creates higher local oxidant to fuel ratios than expected. Reaction of this leaner mixture can lead to <b>temperature</b> <b>overshoots</b> as more CO 2 is formed. We have used a validated detailed kinetic model for ethane to explore the impact of incomplete fuel mixing on reforming performance. If only half the fuel mixes with the oxidants, this approach predicts formation of ethylene in the pyrolysis zone and excess CO 2 with associated very high temperatures in the oxidation zone. This case could result in both excessive deposit formation as well as potential thermal damage to the downstream catalyst. On the other hand, assuming perfect fuel mixing under exothermic ATR conditions (τ=~ 1 s, Ti= 800 ºC...|$|R
