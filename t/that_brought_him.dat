5|$|As {{the fleet}} {{continued}} south from the Cape in early June, Burrough in the Roebuck took a Spanish flyboat {{after a long}} chase <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> near the Spanish coast. The flyboat's master revealed that a great fleet was prepared at Cadiz and Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Having received intelligence that Raleigh was fitted out with a strong force for the West Indies, Philip II of Spain had provided a large fleet to oppose Raleigh and to escort the rich East India carracks to port. Don Alonso de Bazán, brother to the Marquis of Santa Cruz and Captain General of the Armada, was to pursue and intercept Raleigh's fleet. As Burrough's men were burning the flyboat, part of the Spanish fleet was spotted, and Burrough, having rejoined his own fleet, soon sailed to the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Garfield's funeral train left Long Branch on {{the same}} special track <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> there, {{traveling}} over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags. His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial. More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin as his body lay in state in Washington; later, on September 25, 1881, in Cleveland, more than 150,000—a number equal to {{the entire population of}} that city—likewise paid their respects. His body was temporarily interred in a vault in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built.|$|E
5|$|Rome {{now turned}} its attentions to Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire to the east. After campaigns as far abroad as Bactria, India, Persia and Judea, Antiochus moved to Asia Minor and Thrace to secure several coastal towns, a move <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> into {{conflict}} with Roman interests. A Roman force under Manius Acilius Glabrio defeated Antiochus at the Battle of Thermopylae and forced him to evacuate Greece: the Romans then pursued the Seleucids beyond Greece, beating them again in naval battles at the Battle of the Eurymedon and Battle of Myonessus, and finally in a decisive engagement of the Battle of Magnesia.|$|E

5|$|Symeon {{taught that}} putting oneself under the {{guidance}} of a spiritual father was essential for those who were serious about living the spiritual life. That relationship was a historical tradition especially prominent among the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role of a spiritual father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; the vision of God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination as a priest was not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also taught that such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> into disagreement with church leaders of his time.|$|E
5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
5|$|Together with {{partners}} from Egypt and the Arab world, Qandil co-founded the Eastern Satellite Communications Company in 1987. Its main {{purpose was to}} serve broadcasting station that would target Arabic-speaking communities in the Western world and to counter what Qandil perceived as Western bias in global media. However, in 1992, {{as a result of}} financial difficulties the company was sold and subsequently became the Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC). Qandil worked at MBC for roughly three months until he quit, citing political differences with the station's managers, who considered him a Nasserist. That same year, he was offered to host his own show at Arab Radio and Television (ART), but initially opted to work on a project setting up a private Egyptian station for Al-Ahram. The station was not launched and Qandil took up a position at ART in 1996 where he hosted his own show called With Hamdi Qandil. Qandil's arrangements to interview Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on the anniversary of the 1969 coup <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> to power, and also Tariq Aziz, the vice president of Iraq at the time, aroused controversy among ART's managers. He quit thereafter.|$|E

25|$|On October 20, 2015, {{two police}} {{officers}} passing Barker's Los Angeles-area home saw him trip and fall on a sidewalk. They called an ambulance <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he received stitches for an injured forehead and was released; he also hurt his left knee.|$|E

The game was released by Maxis, a company Wright formed with Jeff Braun, and he built upon the game's theme of computer simulation with numerous other titles including SimEarth and SimAnt.|$|E
50|$|Although Joorabchian {{suffered}} {{in the stock market}} crash of 2001, his sale of American Capital after <b>that</b> volatility <b>brought</b> <b>him,</b> on his own estimate, between £50 million and £60 million.|$|R

He attended the United Nations Climate Conference in Bali.|$|E
25|$|Italian {{officials}} {{conducted an}} investigation after the crash. The {{cause of the}} crash was never exactly determined, but the most plausible reason is an accident or a suicide. The pilot was in fact victim of a scam <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> close to bankruptcy, so {{the possibility of a}} spectacular suicide is plausible.|$|E
25|$|Awais Zia was {{selected}} for the Pakistan national cricket team squad in the ODI and T20I series against England in 2012. He played all three T20I matches against the England cricket team, scoring 47 runs with a best of 23.

25|$|Bravo {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Trinidad and Tobago against Barbados in 2002, opening the innings and scoring 15 and 16 but not bowling. He scored his maiden first-class century {{a month later}} and {{was included in the}} West Indies A squad for their tour of England in 2002. In early 2003 he scored another century but it was a spell of bowling in which he took 6–11 against the Windward Islands <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> to prominence as an all-rounder.|$|E

25|$|Tugwell {{then became}} {{associated}} with the Tremont & Gulf Railway Company. In time he became the treasurer and auditor of the firm. Huey Long recognized Tugwell's executive ability and created for Tugwell the office of auditor for the Louisiana Railroad Commission.
