Timothy played both soccer and ice hockey, while Kate was a ballerina with the State Ballet of Missouri {{by the age}} of ten. During this time, Farrar worked long hours and Green accompanied the children to their activities, though perception of her by other parents at the activities varied—some felt she was a supportive mother, while others believed she drove her children <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> put down their efforts too often.|$|E
5|$|Van Cortlandt Park is {{a popular}} site for {{cross-country}} running, owing to its miles of cinder trails and hills {{as well as its}} steep terrain. One legend has it that a cross-country coach thought that Van Cortlandt Park's tracks were <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> instead went to the New Jersey Meadowlands to train. Its courses {{are some of the most}} utilized cross-country courses in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Paralympic {{wheelchair}} curling {{is played}} {{according to the}} rules of the World Curling Federation, the only modification {{is that there is no}} sweeping. The sport was open to both male and female athletes who competed in mixed teams, with a requirement that each team had at least one member of each sex. The format was a round-robin tournament; each nation played all others in a group stage with the top four qualifying for medal playoffs. Britain won their group games against the teams from Denmark, Sweden, Italy and the United States, and lost the matches against Switzerland, Norway and Canada. Their record of four wins and three loses meant they finished the group stage in second place and advanced directly to the medal rounds. In the first end of the semi-final, against Sweden, Britain stole three and went on to win the match 7–3. In the final the team faced Canada. Trailing 6–3 in the final end skip Frank Duffy had an opportunity, with the last stone of the tournament for an open hit of a Canadian stone. If successful he would have scored four for Britain and won them the gold medal but he threw <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> the shot tracked an inch wide. This meant that Canada scored one to win 7–4, leaving the British team as silver medallists.|$|E

5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters was not significantly large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> fast or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of the German people would be better served by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E

Today bread {{remains one of the most}} important foods in the Polish cuisine. The main ingredient for Polish bread is rye or wheat, Traditional bread has a crunchy crust, is soft but not too soft inside, and has unforgettable aroma. Such bread is made with sourdough which lends it a distinctive taste. It can be stored for a week or so without getting <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> is not crumbly when cut.|$|E
25|$|Montoya {{went into}} the Canadian Grand Prix desperately needing some points, after having had only 6 points from seven races. His {{qualifying}} did not help the cause at all though, as he qualified way down in 10th. He gained one place at the first corner but then could not keep {{the pace of the}} cars in front. He came under pressure from a charging Rubens Barrichello, and pushed his car <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> retired after crashing into a wall while trying to both fend off Barrichello and catch up with the cars in front.|$|E

And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{victories}} in India fill Xerxes with confidence, {{and despite the}} warnings of his counsellor Artabanus that he is pushing his army <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> extending his reach too far, he continues invading new territory. Fed up fighting, {{a small group of}} Persians revolt, but Xerxes, Demaratus, Mardonius, and Hydarnes brutally suppress the rebellion. Xerxes then turns his attention to Greece, invading and attacking Sparta. Demeratus is soon killed, but at the Battle of Thermopylae, the Spartans are defeated, although Hydarnes is also killed. Hearing that the Spartans brave defence at Thermopylae has inspired the previously passive Greek city states, Xerxes orders his soldiers to continue to attack without allowing them rest. At the Battle of Plataea, the Persians prove victorious, defeating the Greeks. At the conclusion of the battle, Xerxes looks for Artabanus with whom to celebrate, but he is unable to find him.|$|E
25|$|Feeling {{confident}} in his army after defeating the Union at Second Bull Run, Lee {{embarked on an}} invasion of the north that was stopped by McClellan at the bloody Battle of Antietam. Despite this, McClellan was relieved from command for refusing to pursue Lee's crippled army. The next commander, General Ambrose Burnside, suffered a humiliating defeat by Lee's smaller army at the Battle of Fredericksburg late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, while losing his top aide, Stonewall Jackson. But Lee pushed <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause war-weariness in the North. In perhaps the turning point of the war, Lee's army was badly beaten at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3, 1863, and barely {{made it back to}} Virginia.|$|E

25|$|The {{first race}} of the season was at Interlagos in Brazil, where Senna took pole position. He took an early lead, but Schumacher's Benetton was never far behind. Schumacher took the race lead for good after passing Senna in the pits. While trying for a win, he pushed <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> spun the car coming out of Junção on lap 56, {{stalling}} it and retiring from the race. The second race was the inaugural Pacific Grand Prix at Aida, where Senna again placed {{the car on the}} pole. However, after being beaten to the first corner by second-qualifier Schumacher, he was hit from behind in the first corner by Mika Häkkinen and his race came to a definitive end when, while spinning backwards into the first corner's gravel trap, the Ferrari driven by Nicola Larini T-boned the Williams. Both drivers retired with front-suspension damage. Hill also retired with transmission problems, while Schumacher took the victory again.|$|E

500|$|Barrymore {{decided to}} work on more Shakespeare roles. In June 1937, he signed up with NBC Radio to produce a series of six episodes under the name Streamlined Shakespeare, which also {{featured}} Barrie. The first program was Hamlet, which was well received by critics. The New York Times commented that [...] "Shakespeare's lines uttered dramatically by the voice of John Barrymore sweep through the 'ether' with a sound of finality; it seems that they are his words {{and no one else}} could speak them with such lifelike force". Peters disagrees however, and considers that [...] "because he was desperate he pressed <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> ended by caricaturing, not capturing, his great Shakespearean acting".|$|E

500|$|He learned {{baseball}} at {{an early}} age, his biggest rival being Juan González, whom he often played against in his youth. As a Little League player and just 8 years old, he moved from pitcher and third baseman(his favorite position) to catcher because his father, who was also his coach, thought he was throwing <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> scaring opposing players with his pitches. Rodríguez attended Lino Padron Rivera High School, where he was discovered by scout Luis Rosa. Rosa reported that [...] "He showed leadership at 16 that I'd seen in few kids.

[...] Alex Macpherson of British newspaper The Guardian, [...] "Umbrella" [...] is [...] "evidence" [...] that Rihanna's [...] "strict work ethic is paying off", {{adding that she}} [...] "delivers [...] an impassioned declaration of us-against-the-world devotion". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork, though he complimented the production, dismissed Rihanna's voice which [...] "takes on an unpleasant icepick edge when she tries to fill {{the space between the}} slow-tempo beats", adding that the song is [...] "uncompelling as event-pop, particularly because of the disconnect between Rihanna's cold, clinical delivery and the comforting warmth of the lyrics".|$|E

His best outing of the season occurred on August 3 against the Washington Senators. Grove pitched a complete game and threw to the minimum 27 batters, allowing three hits and a walk, {{all of which were}} negated by double plays. He finished the season with more losses than wins because he was eager to succeed and was trying <b>too</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> because of this the coaching staff planned to make Grove into [...] "as good a pitcher most of the time as he is some of the time".
