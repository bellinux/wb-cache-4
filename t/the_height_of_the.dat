40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>the</b> {{physical conditions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> two metric Type-II bursts associated with CME expansions with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> verifying <b>the</b> {{relationship between the}} shocks and <b>the</b> CMEs, comparing <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio sources and <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV waves associated with <b>the</b> CMEs. <b>The</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV waves associated with the events were determined in relation to <b>the</b> wave fronts. <b>The</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shocks were estimated by applying two different density models to <b>the</b> frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Type-II emissions and compared with <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV waves. For the 13 June 2010 event, with band-splitting, the shock speed was estimated from <b>the</b> frequency drifts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper and lower branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harmonic lane, {{taking into account the}} H/F frequency ratio fH/fF = 2. Exponential fits on <b>the</b> intensity maxima <b>of</b> <b>the</b> branches revealed to be more consistent with <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum <b>of</b> this event. For the 6 June 2012 event, with no band-splitting and with a clear fundamental lane on the spectrum, the shock speed was estimated directly from <b>the</b> frequency drift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental emission, determined by linear fit on <b>the</b> intensity maxima <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lane. For each event, the most appropriate density model was adopted to estimate <b>the</b> physical parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio source. The 13 June 2010 event presented a shock speed of 664 - 719 km/s, consistent with <b>the</b> average speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV wave fronts <b>of</b> 609 km/s. <b>The</b> 6 June 2012 event was related to a shock of speed of 211 - 461 km/s, also consistent with <b>the</b> average speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV wave fronts of 418 km/s. For both events, <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV wave revealed to be compatible with <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio source, assuming a radial propagation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shock.
