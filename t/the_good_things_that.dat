500|$|Navy {{athletic}} director Chet Gladchuk stated that Maryland's snub {{was the basis}} for their rejection of Maryland offers to renew the series in 2010: [...] "The stage was set for everything we had talked about, and all <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> could have happened for fans—a big rematch, a bowl setting, a great city ... It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to do something else. That has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship." [...] Ralph Friedgen responded by saying [...] "He's gotta get over it," [...] and that the Navy rivalry never entered into the decision-making process.|$|E
500|$|Genesis of the Daleks also {{displays}} {{a battle between}} good and evil. Letts enjoyed {{the fact that the}} story did not have clear heroes and villains, but rather a conflict of principle. The discussion between the Doctor and Davros about the hypothetical viral weapon demonstrates this. Hinchcliffe described it as the [...] "hero meets antihero" [...] moment, with the two engaged in [...] "intellectual grappling". The episode also presents the [...] "moral dilemma" [...] of whether the Doctor should destroy the Daleks, resulting in the famous [...] "Have I the right?" [...] scene. The Doctor's comparison to knowingly killing a child who would {{grow up to be a}} dictator shows how the Doctor's ethics are influenced by his non-linear experience of time. (The Twelfth Doctor would again revisit this theme in the 2015 episodes [...] "The Magician's Apprentice" [...] and [...] "The Witch's Familiar".) He considers <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> may come out of the Daleks, such as that [...] "many future worlds would become allies". The Doctor's conclusion that he does not have the right is an example of utilitarian reasoning, and a [...] "duty-based ethical" [...] position. Sladen recalled that Baker took the scene very seriously, almost [...] "agonising" [...] over the dialogue.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Kendal used {{to stride}} {{away from the}} sight of her swollen eyes, and ask Albinia why she did not tell her <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could happen to her would be, that she should never see nor hear of the fellow again.|$|R

6000|$|Danny Meadow Mouse {{watched him}} go {{and shook his head}} in disapproval. [...] "Foolish, foolish, foolish!" [...] he said over and over to himself. [...] "Why can't Peter be content with <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he has?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Awfully well. He {{told them}} that all <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> had ever been done in Parliament had been carried by the Tories. He went back to Pitt's time, and had it all at his fingers' ends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] he answered. [...] "I'll {{confess that}} I'm not {{satisfied}} yet, but I {{try to make}} the most of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> come along--and I'm glad I got up early. It's a glorious morning!" ...|$|E
50|$|The village {{comes under}} Khurja-Dehat (Rural) police station which is {{situated}} just 2 km away toward South-West from village across GT Road. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> village has notices less crime.

5000|$|Gould said [...] "I was {{not happy}} with the final product. It got so savaged by the critics... I was accused of betraying my own work, which is stupid. So I was pretty devastated.

60|$|Away they {{sailed to}} the West Indies, and there Avary became {{impressed}} by the advantages offered by piracy, and by <b>the</b> amount of <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were {{to be gained by}} very little striving.|$|R
6000|$|... "B---- in the Paragon!" [...] Mrs Richards {{declared}} that Miss Mackenzie did not as yet know Littlebath. She bethought {{herself that she}} did know Arundel Street, and again thanked Fortune for all <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{had been given to}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you did; on the 31st. I {{keep the}} most {{accurate}} record of all such things, Mr. Finn. But let us hope {{that we may have}} better luck next year. In the meantime, we can only enjoy <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are going." ...|$|E

50|$|The team {{experienced}} a low in their performances when it won just {{one out of}} the final six matches, just enough to secure the third place. But <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> was <b>that</b> it earned them a ticket for the next UEFA Cup tournament and restored some pride in the team. Rivaldo had scored 21 goals that campaign while another new signing, Songo'o, won the Trofeo Zamora.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jown the {{slippery}} glasses," [...] said Grandfer Cantle. [...] "What's <b>the</b> <b>good</b> of a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> you can't put {{down in the}} ashes to warm, hey, neighbours; that's what I ask?" ...|$|R

60|$|The monkey {{had come}} down from the tree {{as soon as he saw}} Toby untying the bundle, and there was quite as much {{pleasure}} depicted on his face, when he saw <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were spread out before him, as there was on Toby's; and he showed his thankfulness at Mrs. Treat's foresight by suddenly snatching one of the doughnuts and running with it up the tree, where he knew Toby could not follow.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Garland also {{assisted}} at {{the invasion}} of worm-eaten cupboards, where layers of ancient smells lingered on in the stagnant air, and recalled to the reflective nose <b>the</b> many <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> had been kept there. The upper floors were scrubbed with such abundance of water that the old-established death-watches, wood-lice, and flour-worms were all drowned, the suds trickling down into the room below in so lively and novel a manner as to convey the romantic notion that the miller lived in a cave with dripping stalactites.|$|R
50|$|The {{city has}} only one public hospital, however, {{counting}} on several health posts, distributed among the neighborhoods. It has 23 units with coverage of the Unified Health System (SUS) that perform care from small to medium complexity. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city can be considered well served by clinics that perform the most diverse types of tests and specific treatments. In 2012, the municipality had a total of 122 health facilities, 2 of which were state, 34 were municipal and 77 were private.|$|R
6000|$|... "So be it," [...] {{said the}} king; {{and he and}} the {{councillor}} set off {{to see whether the}} beggar had done as he ought to do with <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> the king had given him. So they came to the towngate, and there, lo and behold! the first thing that they saw was the beggar with his wooden bowl in his hand asking those who passed by for a stray penny or two.|$|E
60|$|Anselme {{realized}} that he was between the sword and the wall. He was, however, a man of a deliberate habit that was begotten of inherent indolence and nurtured among <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> fell to his share as master of the Tressan household. Thoughtfully he caressed his tuft of red beard, puffed out his cheeks, and raised his eyes to the ceiling in appeal or denunciation to the heaven which he believed was somewhere beyond it.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{man that}} squints fearfully. They say he's {{looking out for}} a wife too, only she must not have a father living, as Mrs Stumfold has. It's {{astonishing}} how these parsons pick up all <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are going {{in the way of}} money." [...] Miss Mackenzie, as she heard this, could not but remember that she might be regarded as a good thing going in the way of money, and became painfully aware that her face betrayed her consciousness.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{remember}} a big South Sea islander saying that, in his view, the Hong Kong sevens were really the Olympic games of Rugby Union. Certainly, the Hong Kong event encapsulates all <b>the</b> really <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game {{has to offer}} - splendid organisation, wonderful sporting spirit, universal camaraderie, admirable field behaviour, the most enjoyable crowd participation, the chance for emergent rugby nations to lock horns with the mighty men of , , , , [...] and the Barbarians. There is, too, scintillating running and handling {{which is what the}} game is supposed to be all about." ...|$|R
5000|$|Xenophon, in his Oeconomicus, states: [...] "The Great King II...in all {{the districts}} he resides in and visits, takes care {{that there are}} paradeisos ("paradise", from Avestan pairidaēza) as they Persians call them, full of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> and {{beautiful}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> soil produce." ...|$|R
