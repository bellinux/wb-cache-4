50|$|The Gunn effect, and its {{relation}} to the Watkins-Ridley-Hilsum effect entered the monograph literature in the early 1970s, e.g. in books on <b>transferred</b> <b>electron</b> devices and, more recently on nonlinear wave methods for charge transport. Several other books that provided the same coverage were published in the intervening years, and can be found by searching library and bookseller catalogues on Gunn effect.|$|E

5000|$|A Gunn diode, {{also known}} as a <b>transferred</b> <b>electron</b> device (TED), is a form of diode, a two-terminal passive {{semiconductor}} electronic component, with negative resistance, used in high-frequency electronics. It is based on the [...] "Gunn effect" [...] discovered in 1962 by physicist J. B. Gunn. Its largest use is in electronic oscillators to generate microwaves, in applications such as radar speed guns, microwave relay data link transmitters, and automatic door openers.|$|E
5000|$|This salt is {{prepared}} by treating an aqueous solution of ruthenium trichloride with 2,2'-bipyridine. In this conversion, Ru(III) {{is reduced to}} Ru(II), and hypophosphorous acid is typically added as a reducing agent. [...] Ru(bpy)32+ is an octahedral coordination complex. The complex is chiral, with D3 symmetry. It has been resolved into its enantiomers, which are kinetically stable. In excited state the molecule loses symmetry and attains C2 symmetry, as the <b>transferred</b> <b>electron</b> doesn't distribute symmetrically to the 3 bipyridyl ligands in the lowest lying triplet excited state.|$|E
5000|$|Though in a {{semiconductor}} such as Si saturation {{velocity of}} a carrier is {{same as the}} peak velocity of the carrier, for some other materials with more complex energy band structures, this is not true. In GaAs or InP for example the carrier drift velocity reaches to a maximum {{as a function of}} field and then it begins to actually decrease as the electric field applied is increased further. Carriers which have gained enough energy are kicked up to a different conduction band which presents a lower drift velocity and eventually a lower saturation velocity in these materials. This results in an overall decrease of current for higher voltage until all electrons are in the [...] "slow" [...] band and this is the principle behind operation of a Gunn diode, which can display negative differential resistivity. Due to the transfer of electrons to a different conduction band involved, such devices, usually single terminal, are referred to as <b>Transferred</b> <b>electron</b> devices, or TEDs.|$|E

5000|$|Reductive {{dehalogenation}} is {{a convenient}} method for removing halogen atoms that are introduced into a molecule by a method such as halolactonization. However, the standard method for removing halogen atoms requires {{the use of}} stoichiometric organotin reagents, such as tributyltin hydride. While this reaction is very powerful and orthogonal to other functional groups commonly present in organic molecules, organotin reagents are highly toxic. The cleavage of activated and reductively labile functional groups including sulfoniums and halogens is the earliest application of photoredox catalysis to organic synthesis, but early attempts were hampered by the need for specific or uncommon substrates or by the preferential formation of dimeric coupling products. More general methods are known. One method employs Ru(bipy)32+ as the photocatalyst and a stoichiometric amine reductant to reduce [...] "activated" [...] carbon-halogen bonds, such as those with an adjacent carbonyl group or arene. These bonds are considered to be activated, because the radical they produce upon fragmentation is stabilized by conjugation with the carbonyl group or arene, respectively. The stoichiometric reductant present in this reaction transfers an electron to reduce the excited-state catalyst to the Ru(I) oxidation state. The reduced catalyst can then shuttle the <b>transferred</b> <b>electron</b> to the halogenated substrate, reducing the weak C-X bond and inducing fragmentation.|$|E
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} single electron transfer through two-terminal quantum ring capacitively coupled to charged dot placed in its center. For this purpose we solve time-dependent Schrodinger equation for fully correlated two-particle system constituted by the <b>transferred</b> <b>electron</b> {{and the second}} particle confined in the dot. Analysis of transmission probability dependence on magnetic field in Ahronov-Bohm effect indicates that the maxima of transmission probability may be enhanced as well as reduced for attractive or repulsive Coulomb interaction respectively. The existence of Coulomb correlation in the system may also lead to inelastic scattering of the <b>transferred</b> <b>electron.</b> In such case, transmission of electron thorugh the ring is not completely blocked for (n+ 1 / 2) magnetic flux quanta...|$|E

30|$|One of the {{promising}} physical mechanisms in semiconductors, which is capable in principle of generating the MW and possibly THz radiation, is a Gunn effect due to negative differential mobility (NDM) {{caused by the}} <b>transferred</b> <b>electron</b> effect in strong electric fields [1].

We also calculate wavepacket transmission in the non-steady-state regime, finding a featureless spectrum, while for the current we find two types of transmission: sequential and direct, where in the latter, the current transmission increases {{as a function of}} the energy of the <b>transferred</b> <b>electron,</b> a regime inaccessible by conventional scattering theory.
