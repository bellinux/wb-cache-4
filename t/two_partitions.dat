5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent {{on a piece of paper}} and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its <b>two</b> <b>partitions)</b> was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Using {{the tools}} of computability theory and reverse mathematics, we study the {{complexity}} of <b>two</b> <b>partition</b> theorems, the Canonical Ramsey Theorem of Erdös and Rado, and the Regressive Function Theorem of Kanamori and McAloon. Our main aim is to analyze {{the complexity of the}} solutions to computable instances of these problems in terms of the Turing degrees and the arithmetical hierarchy. We succeed in giving a sharp characterization for the Canonical Ramsey Theorem for exponent 2 and for the Regressive Function Theorem for all exponents. These results rely heavily on a new, purely inductive, proof of the Canonical Ramsey Theorem. This study also unearths some interesting relationships between these <b>two</b> <b>partition</b> theorems, Ramsey’s Theorem, and König’s Lemma. 1...|$|R
25|$|It {{is thought}} that these houses had no windows and only one doorway. The door was located {{at one end of}} the house. Internally, the house had one or <b>two</b> <b>partitions</b> {{creating}} up to three areas. Interpretations of the use of these areas vary. Working activities might be carried out in the better lit door end, the middle used for sleeping and eating and the end farthest from the door could have been used for grain storage. According to other view, the interior was divided in areas for sleeping, common life and a fenced enclosure at the back end for keeping animals.|$|E
25|$|Models {{that can}} take into account {{variability}} of {{the rate of the}} molecular clock between different evolutionary lineages in the phylogeny are called “relaxed” in opposition to “strict”. In such models the rate can be assumed to be correlated or not between ancestors and descendants and rate variation among lineages can be drawn from many distributions but usually exponential and lognormal distributions are applied. There is a special case, called “local molecular clock” when a phylogeny is divided into at least <b>two</b> <b>partitions</b> (sets of lineages) and in each strict molecular clock is applied but with different rate.|$|E
25|$|Let our graph have <b>two</b> <b>partitions</b> U, V. The {{key idea}} is to add two dummy {{vertices}} {{on each side of}} the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to make sure that when going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If we make sure of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.|$|E
40|$|Recently Witten conjectured the {{existence}} of a family of "extremal" conformal field theories (ECFTs) of central charge c= 24 k, which are supposed to be dual to three-dimensional pure quantum gravity in AdS 3. Assuming their existence, we determine explicitly the genus <b>two</b> <b>partition</b> functions of k= 2 and k= 3 ECFTs, using modular invariance and the behavior of the partition function in degenerating limits of the Riemann surface. The result passes highly nontrivial tests and in particular provides a piece of evidence for {{the existence}} of the k= 3 ECFT. We also argue that the genus <b>two</b> <b>partition</b> function of ECFTs with k< 11 are uniquely fixed (if they exist). Comment: 14 page...|$|R

Originally, all the doors and windows were in the roof, so to speak, but our landlord allowed us to make as many windows {{to the side of the}} boat as we pleased, provided we gave him the wood we cut out. It saved him trouble, he said, but I did not understand him at the time. Accordingly, the carpenter made several windows for us, and put in sashes, which opened on hinges like the hasp of a trunk. Our furniture did not amount to much, at first. The very thought of living in this independent, romantic way was so delightful, Euphemia said, that furniture seemed a mere secondary matter.|$|E
