During the climax of Tsubasa, Watanuki and Syaoran have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> to survive Fei-Wang's dying curse with Watanuki's price being able to stay in the shop. From this he becomes the new master of the shop and takes up Yūko's job of granting wishes to the shop's customers during the last volume from xxxHolic subtitled xxxHolic Rō. His personality changes as he adopts some of Yūko's quirks and habits. He works with help from Domeki who brings him materials from outside. Over the following years, Watanuki's powers become stronger since he retains his ability to see spirits. His lifespan also increases, though he has the appearance of a teenager. More than a hundred years after taking over the shop, Watanuki's powers grow strong enough to allow him to leave the shop, but he decides to remain there and continue to fulfill the promise he made to Yūko.|$|E
500|$|Michele and Duncan Barrett {{describe}} {{in their book}} Star Trek: The Human Frontier, that [...] "Tapestry" [...] has [...] "complex implications" [...] as it demonstrates who a person is by the experiences they have had throughout their {{life as well as}} who that person truly is. They also wrote that Picard was not required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> for his resurrection at the hands of Q due to [...] "popular narrative being what it is". In Atara Stein's The Byronic Hero in Film, Fiction, and Television, the author describes [...] "Tapestry" [...] as showing a change in Q from his usual satanic stance and instead taking on the role of Picard's guardian angel. Stein also references the alien's increasing influence on the personal lives of the Enterprise crew, a path which Q began in the episode [...] "Hide and Q".|$|E
500|$|The {{transport}} economics rationale for implementing congestion pricing on roads, described as [...] "one policy {{response to the}} problem of congestion", was summarized in testimony to the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee in 2003: [...] "congestion is considered to arise from the mispricing of a good; namely, highway capacity at a specific place and time. The quantity supplied (measured in lane-miles) is less than the quantity demanded at what is essentially a price of zero. If a good or service is provided free of charge, people tend to demand more of it—and use it more wastefully—than they would if they had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> that reflected its cost. Hence, congestion pricing is premised on a basic economic concept: charge a price in order to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evidenced by users' willingness to pay for the resource".|$|E
5000|$|Scarcity: If {{demand is}} high and supply is limited {{the value of a}} given {{commodity}} increases. The price often reflects the potential of the goods as a weapon; as it indicates the importance attached to it.

2500|$|On 21 September 2008, Olmert {{formally}} {{resigned in}} a letter submitted to president Shimon Peres, and the following day Peres formally asked Livni {{to form a new}} government. Livni faced tough negotiations with Kadima's coalition partners, particularly the Shas party, which had set conditions for joining a Livni government, including an increase in child allowances to Haredi communities, and a vow not to negotiate the status of Jerusalem during peace talks with the Palestinians. Livni was able to sign a coalition agreement with the Labor party, led by former prime minister Ehud Barak, but on October 26, informed the President that she was unable to form a government and suggested Israel go to elections. Livni cited her unwillingness to sell out her principles just to become prime minister, stating, [...] "I was willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> to form a government, but I was never willing to risk the political and economic future of Israel. If someone is willing to sell out his principles for the job, he is not worthy of it." [...] For its part, Likud, the main opposition party led by Benjamin Netanyahu, lobbied Shas and other parties essential to Livni's government to support early elections.|$|E

60|$|I had not {{the least}} belief, in the outset of this story, that the unknown was {{anything}} but a delusion of Mr. Dick's, {{and one of the}} line of that ill-fated Prince who occasioned him so much difficulty; but after some reflection I began to entertain the question whether an attempt, or threat of an attempt, might have been twice made to take poor Mr. Dick himself from under my aunt's protection, and whether my aunt, the strength of whose kind feeling towards him I knew from herself, might have been induced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> for his peace and quiet. As I was already much attached to Mr. Dick, and very solicitous for his welfare, my fears favoured this supposition; {{and for a long time}} his Wednesday hardly ever came round, without my entertaining a misgiving that he would not be on the coach-box as usual.

60|$|From all {{which it}} appears, that mercy by Christ, {{or from the}} benefit of {{redemption}} by the precious blood of Christ, I say, from the faith of that, flows that which is holiness indeed. And I believe that those very men that are pleased to taunt at this kind of inference, would condemn a man was he laid under these obligations concerning things of this life, and yet did carry it as one not touched thereby. We will make an instance: Suppose a Socinian should, through his contracting a great debt, be forced to rot in prison, unless redeemed by silver and gold: and suppose a man, unto whom this Socinian was an enemy, should lay down the whole debt to the creditor, that this Socinian might be at liberty, might trade, and live comfortably in this world; and if, after this, this Socinian should taunt at them that should tell him he is engaged to this redeemer, ought to love and respect this redeemer; what would they say but that this Socinian that was a debtor is an inconsiderate and stupefied rascal? Why, this is the case; Paul was a debtor to the law and justice of God; Jesus Christ his Son, that Paul might not perish for ever, paid for him a price of redemption, to wit, his most precious blood. But what! Shall Paul now, though redeemed from perpetual imprisonment in hell, be as one that never was beholden to Jesus Christ; or if others say he was, taunt at them for their so saying? No, he scorns it. Though the love of Christ, in dying <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> of redemption, will not engage a Socinian, yet it will engage a true Christian to think and believe {{that he ought to}} live to Jesus, that died for him and rose again.|$|E

40|$|Organically grown {{products}} have received increasing attention worldwide. This {{appears to be}} due to growing awareness of environmental problems and increased concerns about {{the health and safety of}} modern agricultural food production practices. Despite the apparent rise of both supply and demand for organic products in Thailand, the industry is still in its infancy and consumers’ purchasing behaviour towards organic products is not well researched. This paper investigates the factors affecting consumers’ willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> premium <b>price</b> for organic products. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data at five retail stores in the metropolitan area of Bangkok. Data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis and the double-bound contingent valuation method. Results show that respondents are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> premium <b>price</b> of 88 %, 51 % and 51 % for organic Chinese kale, organic jasmine rice and organic pork, respectively. Analysis indicates that respondents are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> premium <b>price</b> for organic products if they have experience in purchasing organic products, have good health, strong ethical and environmental concerns, perceive that organic products provide greater quality and health benefits, and if reside in the city. Respondents with children in the household, however, are less likely <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> premium <b>price</b> for organic products. Analysis also indicates that the price premium organic products require hinders consumers’ purchase of organic products. Therefore, efforts should be made by policymakers, together with marketers and producers, to lower the price of organic products to attract more consumers...|$|R
