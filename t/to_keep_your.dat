25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag and you have <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E

500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{its debut}} album, Bleed the Fifth in early 2007 with production duties handled by former Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader. The {{title of the}} album is a play on words, Cazares comments [...] "You have the right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> mouth shut, but on this record we believe we’re saying a lot". Cummings wrote {{the majority of the}} lyrics, which are about personal strifes and how people overcome them. Much of the lyrical content was influenced by the Book of Revelation, natural disasters, war, and terrorism. Cazares stated the album is a [...] "big fuck you" [...] to the people who want his projects to fail.|$|E
500|$|With the {{resumption}} of the war against France, Temeraire {{was attached to the}} Channel Fleet and blockaded ports in eastern France until 1805, when Harvey was sent to join Horatio Nelson's blockade off Cadiz. When the Battle of Trafalgar was joined on 21 October, Harvey's Temeraire was the second ship in Nelson's division and was a faster and more agile ship than HMS Victory, Nelson's flagship. As a result, Temeraire began to pull ahead of Victory as the division closed on the Franco-Spanish fleet and Harvey was consequently reprimanded by Nelson, who hailed Temeraire: [...] "I will thank you Captain Harvey, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> proper station which is astern of the Victory".|$|E

She {{stated that}} [...] "As always, the show is better written than most {{anything}} on TV, but for a 10th season premiere, it didn't blow {{me out of the}} water." [...] In addition, Phil Kloer of The Atlanta Journal gave the episode a C grade, calling it an [...] "off episode". He commented that it [...] "doesn't have the zing that most Simpsons episodes do." [...] Kloer did, however, enjoy Homer's inventions such as the hamburger earmuffs and the make-up gun, and Homer's line to Marge before he shoots her with it: [...] "Try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> nostrils closed." [...] Marge's response after being shot, [...] "Homer! You’ve got it set on whore!", was commended by The Gazette, DVD Verdict, and Ian Jane of DVD Talk, who called the scene the highlight of the episode.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Zappa {{was chosen}} {{to be one of}} four {{featured}} composers at the Frankfurt Festival in 1992 (the others were John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Alexander Knaifel). Zappa was approached by the German chamber ensemble Ensemble Modern which was interested in playing his music for the event. Although ill, he invited them to Los Angeles for rehearsals of new compositions and new arrangements of older material. Zappa also got along with the musicians, and the concerts in Germany and Austria were set up for later in the year. Zappa also performed in 1991 in Prague, claiming that [...] "was {{the first time that he}} had a reason to play his guitar in 3 years", and that that moment was just [...] "the beginning of a new country", and asked the public to [...] "try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> country unique, do not change it into something else".|$|E
500|$|Matt Collar of AllMusic awarded it {{a rating}} of {{three and a half}} stars out of five, characterising it as a [...] "pantomime that artists have been trying to pull off ever since Madonna sang about a sexual {{experience}} so revelatory it gave her back her virginity". He also noted that Kills' personality, although similar to that of Pink and Lady Gaga, was [...] "enough [...] <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> attention". Writing in Idolator, Sam Lansky highlighted Bhasker's production, which he credited with making the album cohesive. Lansky opined that Kills had evolved as a songwriter and given legitimacy and [...] "richness" [...] to Troubles songs. So So Gay Magazine praised Trouble as an evolution from her previous album Perfectionist, and stated that Kills [...] "remains largely unknown and underrated; astonishing considering the quality of her two albums. She’s definitely some sort of anti-princess of pop." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{third season}} was {{nominated}} for five Teen Choice Awards and won four of them, including [...] "Choice Drama/Action Adventure Show" [...] and [...] "Choice Actor: Drama/Action Adventure", which Adam Brody won {{for the third consecutive}} year. IGN faulted a season which, in their opinion, had [...] "far too much time and too many episodes spent with the less than beloved character Johnny". IGN also noted that [...] "Kirsten and Sandy both suffered from unsatisfying stories", and that the departure of character Caleb Nichol had been a mistake [...] "as he had been a great character to bounce off both of the elder Cohens". In September 2007, Schwartz admitted in an interview for New York that the show [...] "went down the wrong road" [...] with Johnny. The season did, however, receive some praise. The new character Taylor Townsend was stated as being [...] "played to perfection by Autumn Reeser" [...] and her character was described as [...] "one of the greatest elements of The O.C." [...] Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk described the storylines as [...] "very intelligent and also incorporate a great deal of humor <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> interest".|$|E
500|$|Routine decrees (ferman) or {{titles of}} {{privilege}} (berat) {{were written by}} a scribe, but those written to certain officials and those that were particularly important were preceded by the Sultan's handwritten note beside his seal (tughra). The tughra and the notation might be surrounded by a decorated frame. The note would emphasize a particular part of his edict, urging or ordering it to be followed without fault. These were called Hatt-ı Hümayunla Müveşşeh Ferman (ferman decorated with a hatt-ı hümayun) or Unvanına Hatt-ı Hümayun (hatt-ı hümayun to the title). The note might use a clichéd phrase like [...] "to be done as required" [...] (mûcebince amel oluna) or, [...] "my command is to carried out as required {{and no one is}} to interfere with its execution" [...] (emrim mûcebince amel oluna, kimseye müdahale etmeyeler). Some edicts to the title would start with a note from the Sultan praising the person(s) to whom the edict was addressed, in order to encourage or honor him. Rarely, there might be a threat such as [...] "if you want <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> head, carry out this order as required" [...] (Başın gerek ise mûcebiyle amel oluna).|$|E
500|$|Drummer Butch Vig {{stated that}} the album is a [...] "much simpler record than Version 2.0": [...] "All of the songs sort of came from us playing live downstairs [...] with guitar, bass and drums ... That was the only {{conscious}} decision we made – to make the songs simpler. Some of the songs are still layered in spots; compared to the last record, there're about half as many tracks. As far as sounds go, it's basically drums, bass, some heavy guitars and Shirley singing." [...] Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album. [...] "A lot of songs took shape {{in just a few}} hours as opposed to a few months with the last record.Some of the songs obviously took a long time, or we wouldn't have been in the studio for a full year. But a lot of them happened very quickly. 'Silence Is Golden' we recorded basically in three days and it was done. 'So Like a Rose,' for the most part, was recorded in three hours. I think we spent a lot of time just trying to resist adding stuff to [...] Because that was our tendency on the other two records.” On the lyrical content of the songs, Vig remarked that [...] " [...] aren't specifically responses to the industry, but they could be read that way. Shirley has said that, for example, 'Shut Your Mouth' is about all the bullshit that's out there, but it's also a sort of note to self <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> mouth shut, because she says she's the biggest, most opinionated loudmouth of anyone around. So they work on multiple levels." ...|$|E
