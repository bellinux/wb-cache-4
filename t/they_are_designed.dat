5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise missiles in that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition {{is intended to be}} expended in an attack and has a built-in warhead.|$|E

5|$|The {{designs for}} Pokémon are often highly {{analogous}} to real-life creatures, but also encompass inanimate objects. Director Junichi Masuda and graphic designer Takao Unno {{have stated that}} inspiration for Pokémon designs can come from anything. The variety of animals and culture across the world {{provide the basis for}} countless ideas to be incorporated into the franchise. The environment a Pokémon would live in is taken into account when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed.</b> The lei-like Comfey fits appropriately in the Hawaii-inspired Alola region of Sun and Moon. Masuda has stated that each element of a design has a functioning reason. In some cases, the design team creates a footprint that a Pokémon could make and designs a creature around that. Some designers look to game mechanics for inspiration, seeing where particular typing combinations could be interesting. Typing assignment varies during the design process, sometimes a Pokémon receives a type after it is created and other times <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> around a particular type.|$|E

50|$|Atomic {{demolition}} munitions (ADMs), colloquially {{known as}} nuclear land mines, are small nuclear explosive devices. ADMs were developed for both {{military and civilian}} purposes. As weapons, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to <b>be</b> exploded in the forward battle area, in order to block or channel enemy forces. Non-militarily, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> for demolition, mining or earthmoving. However, apart from testing, <b>they</b> have never <b>been</b> used for either purpose.|$|R
5|$|The BK Whopper Bar {{is limited}} service concept created by Burger King in 2009. Whopper Bars are smaller footprint, {{specialized}} stores with a menu {{limited to the}} company's Whopper, crispy chicken sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich sandwiches; drinks; and desserts. The menu features higher-end ingredients and variants not sold in the normal Burger King locations. The concept {{is similar to the}} McCafe concept from rival McDonald's, and like the McCafe locations <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to go into airports, casinos, and other areas with limited amounts of space.|$|E
5|$|The blades are transtibial prostheses, {{meaning they}} replace {{legs and feet}} that are amputated below the knee (BK). They were {{developed}} by medical engineer Van Phillips who incorporated Flex-Foot, Inc., in 1984, and in 2000 sold the company to Össur which now (in 2012) manufactures the blades. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to store kinetic energy like a spring, allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively.|$|E

The first to be announced was Lake Superior in 2007; it was officially established in 2015. Other areas under negotiation are the southern Strait of Georgia and Gwaii Haanas in British Columbia, and there are discussions to study the feasibility of an area on the southern coast of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E
