The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the impact of different furrow-ridge mulching techniques on fungal diversity in rhizosphere soil under continuous cropping system. The investigated treatments were: flat plot without mulch (CK); flat plot with mulch (T 1); on-ridge planting with full mulch (T 2); on-furrow planting with full mulch (T 3); on-ridge planting with half mulch (T 4); and on-furrow planting with half mulch (T 5). NGS (Illumina) methods and ITS 1 sequences were used in monitoring fungi diversity of the potato rhizosphere soil. The fungi diversity in the rhizosphere soil was ranked in the order T 5 > T 2 > T 4 > T 1 > CK at the early growth stage and T 2 > T 3 > T 1 > T 4 > CK at the late growth stage of potato. The fungal communities found in the rhizosphere soil were Ascomycota, Zygomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and other unidentified fungal communities. Among the fungal community in the rhizosphere soil, Ascomycota was found to be dominant fungi population, with the highest percentage (89 %) in the <b>T</b> 5 <b>soil</b> whereas the <b>T</b> 2 <b>soils</b> had the lowest percentage (67 %). The Fusarium abundance in fully-mulched treated soils was higher than in half-mulched treated soil. The dominant genus in the <b>T</b> 4 <b>soil</b> was Mortierella, whereas lower populations (1 – 2 %) of Scutellinia, Cryphonectria, Acremonium, and Alternaria were found in that treatment. Among the eumycetes, the dominant fungal class in all treated soils was the Sordariomycetes, which ranged from 57 to 85 % in T 2 and <b>T</b> 5 <b>soils,</b> respectively. The Fusarium percentages in half-mulched treated <b>soils</b> (<b>T</b> 4 and T 5) were 55 and 28 % lower than that of complete mulched treated <b>soils</b> (<b>T</b> 2 and T 3), respectively.

40|$|It is not... easy to {{see what}} the shock-the-conscience test adds, or should be allowed to add, to the {{deterrent}} function of exclusionary rules. Where no deterrence of unconstitutional police behavior is possible, a decision to exclude probative evidence with the result that a criminal goes free to prey upon the public should shock the judicial conscience even more than admitting the evidence. So spoke Judge Robert H. Bork, concurring in a ruling that the fourth amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to foreign searches conducted exclusively by foreign officials. A short time thereafter, when an interviewer read back the above statement and invited him to comment further on the subject, Judge Bork responded: [One of the reasons] sometimes given [in support of the exclusionary rule] is that courts shouldn 2 ̆ 7 <b>t</b> <b>soil</b> their hands by allowing in unconstitutionally acquired evidence. I have never been convinced by that argument because it seems the conscience of the court ought to be at least equally shaken by the idea of turning a criminal loose upon society. Judge Bork displays no affection for the exclusionary rule, but he may not be making an affirmative case against it. All he may be saying is that whatever good reasons may exist for excluding illegally seized evidence, the 2 ̆ 2 judges shouldn 2 ̆ 7 <b>t</b> <b>soil</b> their hands 2 ̆ 2 argument isn 2 ̆ 7 t one of them. On the other hand, Bork may be implying something more - or at least a reader may understandably infer something more: Where the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s conduct is more reprehensible than the police officer 2 ̆ 7 s (as, of course, it usually will be), the 2 ̆ 2 judges shouldn 2 ̆ 7 <b>t</b> <b>soil</b> their hands 2 ̆ 2 argument is a good reason for admitting illegally seized evidence.

To put it somewhat differently, if the admissibility of illegally seized evidence turns solely on how the ruling affects the judge 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 conscience, 2 ̆ 2 the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s motion to suppress should almost always fail.

We have developed a protocol based on substrate-induced respiration using the MicroResp TM technique combined with a selective inhibition (SI) procedure to characterize the fungal biomass and catabolic profiles for soil microbial and fungal communities: the FungiResp method. After comparisons with oxytetracycline, we chose bronopol as a bactericide to extend the FungiResp protocol. An optimal bronopol concentration of 78 ␮g g − 1 soil was selected for the four soils tested to minimize the risk of inhibiting non-target communities (fungi).

Due {{to the lack of}} carbon assimilation data at O- 3 monitoring stations (and vice-versa) this study makes a first attempt to combine high resolution MODIS Gross Primary Production (GPP) estimates and O- 3 measurement data. Partial Correlations, Anomalies Analysis and the Random Forests Analysis (RFA) were used to quantify the effects of tropospheric O- 3 concentration and its uptake on GPP and to evaluate the most important factors affecting inter-annual GPP changes. Our results showed, along a North-West/South-East European transect, a negative impact of O- 3 on GPP ranging from 0. 4 % to 30 %, although a key role of meteorological parameters respect to pollutant variables in affecting GPP was found. In particular, meteorological parameters, namely air temperature (<b>T),</b> <b>soil</b> water content (SWC) and relative humidity (RH) are the most important predictors at 81 % of test sites. Moreover, it is interesting to highlight a key role of SWC in the Mediterranean areas (Spanish, Italian and French test sites) confirming that, soil moisture and soil water availability affect vegetation growth and photosynthesis especially in arid or semi-arid ecosystems such as the Mediterranean climate regions.

40|$|Managed grasslands are {{important}} for stabilizing soil and reducing soil erosion on sloping lands. In order to obtain information for better grassland management and soil protection at small scales, managed grassland total net primary productivity (TNPP) data were collected and analyzed with a first order state-space approach and a classical linear regression approach. The objective {{was to determine the}} effects of soil properties and site elevation on managed grassland TNPP. Soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (BD), saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks), soil temperature (<b>T),</b> <b>soil</b> clay content (CC), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil NO(3) -N, soil NH(4) -N, soil Olsen phosphorus concentration (OP) and site elevation (SE) data were collected along a 300 -m transect in the China Loess Plateau. Soil properties and site elevation were evaluated in bi- and multivariate autoregressive state-space analysis to clarify the key factors affecting the spatial distribution of TNPP. Results show that most of the measured variables contributed to the variation of TNPP. CC and OP were especially helpful in describing the spatial pattern of TNPP. The state-space modeling results were compared with classical statistics methodologies, indicating that the state-space approach described the spatial pattern of TNPP much better than the equivalent classical regression methods. All of the TNPP variation was represented by state-space models that included soil NO(3) -N and OP or soil CC and OP. Only 76 % of the variance of the TNPP was represented by classical statistics analysis because the classical statistics did not include sampling position and assumed sample independence. State-space models are recommended for studying spatial relations between vegetation and soil variables in natural soil-plant systems on the China Loess Plateau. (c) 2010 Elsevier E. V.

40|$|Vegetation filters, {{a nature}} based {{wastewater}} regeneration technology, {{have been reported}} as a feasible solution for small municipalities and scattered populations with limited access to sewage networks. However even when such a treatment is properly planned, the leaching of contaminants through the unsaturated zone may occur. The amendment of soil with a readily-labile source of carbon is supposed to ameliorate the removal of contaminants by stimulating microbial activity and enhancing sorption processes. In this study, lab-scale leaching column experiments were carried out to explore if the addition of woodchips to the soil could be a feasible strategy to be integrated in a vegetation filter. Two different types of arrangement of soil and woodchips layers were tested. The soil was collected from an operating vegetation filter treating wastewater of an office building characterised by a high nutrient load. Daily pulse of synthetic wastewater were applied into the columns and effluent samples were collected and analyzed for major ions, total nitrogen (N T), total phosphorous (P T) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). By {{the end of the}} experiment, N T, NO 3 -N and P <b>T</b> <b>soil</b> contents were also measured. Results indicate that amendments with woodchips enhance the elimination of wastewater-originated contaminants. N T removal in the columns with woodchips reaches a value of 99. 4 %. The main processes responsible for this elimination are NH 4 -N sorption and nitrification/denitrification. This latter fostered by the reduced redox conditions due to the enhanced microbial activity. High removal of P T (99 %) is achieved independently of the woodchips presence due to retention and/or precipitation phenomena. The COD removal efficiency is not affected by the presence of the woodchips. The leaching of organic carbon occurs only during the experimental start-up period. </p...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Relationships between sagebrush-dominated plant {{communities}} and soil-site characteristics were examined on 372 relatively undisturbed rangeland {{sites of the}} Humboldt National Forest, in northeastern Nevada. Plant species production data were analyzed by TWINSPAN to develop a hierarchical, floristic-based community type (C. T.) classification. Seventeen C. T. s were identified in this analysis and named by their dominant shrub and grass species. Shrub species were more effective than grass species, which in turn were more effective than forb species in discriminating between C. T. s. Soil temperature and moisture data, collected between 1983 and 1986 on 35 rangeland sites, indicated that aridic soil moisture regimes dominated the study area. The average number of days when soil temperature and moisture were not limiting to plant growth ranged from 28 days on Artemisia arbuscula sites to 70 days on mixed mountain brush sites. Soil temperature and moisture parameters were effective in discriminating between most plant C. T. s, yet their effectiveness varied considerably among types. Soil {{physical and chemical properties}} were examined at each of the rangeland sites used in the TWINSPAN analysis. The C. T. s identified in that analysis followed an apparent gradient of increasing soil fertility. A. nova C. T. s commonly occupied the lowest fertility sites. Moderate soil fertility sites supported A. arbuscula, A. longiloba, and A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis C. T. s. Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana C. T. s occurred on sites with the highest soil fertility levels. Discriminant analysis indicated that 68 percent of the rangeland sites sampled could be correctly assigned to their appropriate C. T. based upon soil and site properties. The percent of sites correctly classified ranged from 25 percent within the A. tridentata ssp. tridentata/Festuca idahoensis C. T. to 100 percent in the A. longiloba/ F. idahoensis C. <b>T.</b> <b>Soil</b> and site factors most useful in discriminating between C. T. s were mollic epipedon thickness, elevation, subsoil clay content, total rock content, percent slope, and total soil depth. This method of relating individual soil and site factors to vegetation provides a useful approach for testing the validity of floristic based ecosystem classifications...|$|E

40|$|Tricholoma matsutake, {{the pine}} mushroom, is a {{valuable}} forest product with high economic value in Asia, and plays an important ecological role as an ectomycorrhizal fungus. Around the host tree, T. matsutake hyphae generate a distinctive soil aggregating environment called a fairy ring, where fruiting bodies form. Because T. matsutake hyphae dominate the soil near the fairy ring, this species {{has the potential to}} influence the microbial community. To explore the influence of T. matsutake on the microbial communities, we compared the microbial community and predicted bacterial function between two different soil types—T. matsutake dominant and T. matsutake minor. DNA sequence analyses showed that fungal and bacterial diversity were lower in the <b>T.</b> matsutake dominant <b>soil</b> compared to <b>T.</b> matsu- take minor soil. Some microbial taxa were significantly more common in the <b>T.</b> matsutake dominant <b>soil</b> across geographic locations, many of which were previously identified as mycophillic or mycorrhiza helper bacteria. Between the two soil types, the predicted bacte- rial functional profiles (using PICRUSt) had significantly distinct KEGG modules.
