50|$|From {{the end of}} the Middle Ages {{until the}} 20th century, Europe's farmers practised <b>three-field</b> <b>rotation,</b> {{dividing}} available lands into three parts. One section was planted in the autumn with rye or winter wheat, followed by spring oats or barley; the second section grew crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third field was left fallow. The three fields were rotated in this manner so that every three years, a field would rest and be fallow. Under the two-field system, if one has a total of 600 acre of fertile land, one would only plant 300 acres. Under the new <b>three-field</b> <b>rotation</b> system, one would plant (and therefore harvest) 400 acres. But the additional crops had a more significant effect than mere quantitative productivity. Since the spring crops were mostly legumes, they increased the overall nutrition of the people of Northern Europe.|$|E

After the Renaissance of the 12th century, medieval Europe saw a radical change {{in the rate of}} new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth. The period saw major technological advances, including the adoption of gunpowder, the invention of vertical windmills, spectacles, mechanical clocks, and greatly improved water mills, building techniques (Gothic architecture, medieval castles), and agriculture in general (<b>three-field</b> crop <b>rotation).</b>|$|R
50|$|Władysław's eldest son, Duke Bolesław I the Tall, {{had spent}} several years in German exile. When he assumed the rule of Lower Silesia, he invited Cistercian monks from Pforta Abbey on the Saale River (in present-day Thuringia) and settled them in Lubiąż as the first of their order in Silesia. The first monastery complex was under {{construction}} up to 1175, when Duke Bolesław I issued the official foundation charter at Grodziec Castle. Through drainage works the monks reclaimed land in the swampy environs of the monastery, implemented <b>three-field</b> crop <b>rotation</b> and laid out vineyards. Their efforts were successful and {{marked the beginning of}} the medieval German Ostsiedlung to Silesia.|$|R

Adjacent territories of both parts of Oznobishino were wastelands: slopings and semi-wastelands, made by the slash-and-burn agricultural system and assarts in the 14th and 15th centuries, and by the fallow agricultural system {{in the form of}} <b>three-field</b> crop <b>rotation</b> in the 18th century: fields was exhausted after 4-6 years of use and these lands left for haying or for forest natural regeneration. Five persons of a list of 39 co-owners of adjacent territories were owners of Oznobishino sel`tso. Obrok peasants of this little-inhabited village (23 households, 108 inhabitants, including about 60 children) were able to supply the needs of many (about 45) owners.|$|R
50|$|In the 10th Century, the Hof Wodensberg, {{a farm in}} Gudensberg, was run using <b>three-field</b> crop <b>rotation.</b> Gudensberg {{itself had}} its first mention in {{documents}} in 1121. The town's name is presumably derived from an older form, Wotansberg, after the god Wōdanaz, who was worshiped as the highest god by the Chatti in Old Germanic times. In the Middle Ages, a castle {{was built on the}} hill and was named the Obernburg. It was the seat of Hessian regional counts (Gaugrafen). From 1122 to 1247, Gudensberg belonged to the Landgraves of Thuringia, and the place experienced its heyday, with its first town wall built between 1170 and 1180, and its first mention as a town in 1254 with a town constitution {{at the turn of the}} 13th Century.|$|R
50|$|Mayor Alexander Pushkin (the third) {{struggled}} {{to improve the}} performance of peasant households; increase in average area of a family lot, he reasoned, would enable a switch from obsolete <b>three-field</b> crop <b>rotation</b> to intensive farming methods. He set up five model farms attended by qualified agronomists and provided subsidized loans to the peasants. In twenty years of his tenure, the uyezd opened twenty-five new elementary schools, two high schools for boys, and one high school for girls. Despite Pushkin's efforts, cultural split between landed peasants and urbanized classes widened {{to a point of}} armed conflict. During the 1905 Russian Revolution liberal-minded teachers and medics supported the political changes while the peasants distrusted their promises, fearing a return to dreaded serfdom system. On one occasion the peasants stormed and burnt down a school building housing a convention of zemstvo employees who barely escaped the mob.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted in the years 1998 - 2001. The aim of the {{research was}} to determine the health of the field pea cv. Kormoran grown in four various crop rotations and to determine the patogens causing the root-rot. On the pea plants the following diseases were found: root rot (complex of fungi), ascochyta blight (Ascochyta pisi, Phoma pinodella, Mycospaerella pinodes) and fusarium foot rot (Fusarium spp.). All the diseases occurred in the highest intensity on the pea cultivated in <b>three-field</b> crop <b>rotation</b> without manure. The weather conditions affected the intensity of the diseases. From the roots of seedlings with the symptoms of root rot 44, 7 % of fungi with pathogenic potential in relation to pea were obtained. The most commonly isolated were Fusarium oxysporum (26, 7 % of all isolates), Rhizoctonia solani (10, 7 %), F. solani (3, 3 %), F. avenaceum (2, 7 %) and F. equiseti (1, 3 %). From the infected root necks, 55, 3 % of potential pathogens of field pea were obtained. Among the isolates the most commonly found was F. oxysporum (31, 1 % of all isolates). Other fungi of the Fusarium genus constituted 15, 4 % of isolates, R. solani 7, 0 %, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum 1, 8 %...|$|R

This book {{revisited}} almost all the themes from [...] "Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages" [...] 22 years earlier, but included a controversial theory about the stirrup. White contended {{in the first section}} of the book that the stirrup made shock combat possible, and therefore had a crucial role in shaping the feudal system. He believed this was the motivation for Charles Martel to accelerate confiscation of church-held lands and distribute it to his knights, who would bear the cost of themselves with expensive horses in to support him in battle. In the second section of the book, White explained the shift in power from the Mediterranean to Northern Europe as a result of increased productivity due to technological changes that produced a [...] "heavy plow," [...] better harnesses for horses to pull the plow, and a <b>three-field</b> crop <b>rotation</b> scheme. In the third part of the book, he examined medieval machines that converted motion and energy. The most notable was the compound crank. The work elicited over 30 reviews, many of which were hostile. P. H. Sawyer and R. H. Hilton wrote the most scathing of the early reviews, beginning with: ...|$|R
50|$|Gries likely arose {{sometime}} around 1100. The name zuom ’griß (as {{it was originally}} recorded) meant in Middle High German “gravelly, sandy ground”; the Modern High German word Grieß - pronounced {{the same way as}} “Gries” - still means “grit”, and is cognate with that English word. The addition of zuom (Modern High German: zum; meaning: “at the”) may be taken to mean that the locality was an outlying rural area belonging to another municipality. These were split apart from each other, perhaps {{in the course of the}} introduction of <b>three-ﬁeld</b> crop <b>rotation.</b> As the nearest place that already existed at the time, it seems likely that zuom ’griß once belonged to Kübelberg. Thought to have arisen at the same time as Gries are Sand (zuom sand, “at the sand”, nowadays an outlying centre of Schönenberg-Kübelberg) and Miesau, even if different founding dates are given for each (these rest mainly on ﬁrst documentary mentions, though). In 1383, Gries had its ﬁrst documentary mention in the Breidenborn Cartulary. By the entry in this book, the municipalities of the Münchweiler Tal (an administrative entity belonging to Hornbach Monastery near Zweibrücken) swore an oath of loyalty to their new lady, Agnes von Neuenbaumberg. The village is, however, roughly 300 years older. Just when the village arose is, however, something that can hardly be determined today. It is only actually known that it existed in 1383.|$|R
50|$|The Knights {{took control}} of Samogitia and began {{rebuilding}} old and building new castles along the rivers. Königsburg {{was built on the}} Šušvė River near Josvainiai. Vytautas provided the manpower for construction, food, guns, and even garrison. The castle was manned by 40 Teutons and 400 Poles. The Samogitians unsuccessfully attacked the newly built castle in fall 1405. Other castles were built in Christmemel and rebuilt in Friedeburgh. Dobesinburg, completed in 1407 near the mouth of Dubysa, was to become the new capital of the region. The Knights attempted to implement their administrative system: they measured land, counted residents, appointed local officers, and sent their own colonists. They promoted the <b>three-field</b> crop <b>rotation,</b> which had potential of higher outputs but would eventually lead to higher taxes and serfdom. When Vytautas attempted to introduce similar reforms a decade later, he too faced resistance and revolts. Despite the reforms, there were no significant efforts to convert the pagan Samogitians into Christianity. Hundreds of Samogitians were taken as hostages into Prussia. Rebellious residents were punished and executed, while those who swore loyalty were awarded with expensive gifts. In a complaint submitted to the Council of Constance in 1417, the Samogitians listed many crimes and injustices perpetrated by the Knights. The Knights assisted Vytautas in his campaigns in Pskov, Veliky Novgorod, and Moscow. However, the friendly relationship between Vytautas and the Teutonic Knights was somewhat strained after election of Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen, who was less inclined to ally with Lithuania.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{traditional}} tillage cultivation (control treatment), no tillage (instead of tillage the soil was loosened with scruff), and direct sowing (with a special drill into unploughed soil) {{on the health}} of spring barley cultivar. Klimek were compared in <b>three-field</b> crop <b>rotation</b> (field bean, winter wheat, spring barley) in an experiment performed in the years 1997 - 1999 on the soil of a good wheat complex. The results of phytopathological observations carried out over the vegetation season are presented {{in the form of an}} injury index. The following diseases were recorded on spring barley: net blotch (Drechslera teres) - net type and spot type, powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis), leaf blotch (Rhynchosporium secalis), eyespot (Tapesia yallundae) and foot rot (fungal complex). Tillage system had no a significant influence on the occurrence of both types of net blotch. The intensity of powdery mildew and leaf blotch was the highest in the case of traditional tillage cultivation, and the lowest - in that of no tillage. Direct sowing was conductive to the development of eyespot, and no tillage - to foot rot. Fungi of the genus Fusarium, mainly F. culmorum, and the species Bipolaris sorokiniana, were isolated most frequently from infested stem bases. The weather conditions differed during spring barley grown in the three years analyzed. Mean air temperature in 1997 and 1998 was similar to the many-year average for the city of Olsztyn and its surroundings (13. 8 ° C). In the vegetation season 1999 mean air temperature reached 14. 6 ° C, and was considerably higher than the many-year average. Taking into account total precipitation and distribution in the three-year experimental cycle, 1997 and 1998 can be considered average, and 1999 - wet. The weather conditions had a significant effect on the intensity of all diseases observed on spring barley. The highest yield grain was obtained in the case of traditional tillage cultivation (on average 3. 06 t·ha - 1 for the three years analyzed), and the lowest - in that of direct sowing (2. 18 t·ha - 1). No tillage occupied a middle position (2. 55 t·ha - 1) ...|$|R
