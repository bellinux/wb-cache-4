5|$|Frontier Indiana was prime ground missionary for the Second Great Awakening, with {{a never-ending}} parade of camp {{meetings}} and revivals. Baptist church records show an intense interest in private moral behavior at the weekly meetings, including drinking and proper child-rearing practices. The most contentious issue was antimission controversy, in which <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> elements denounced missionary societies as unbiblical.|$|E
5|$|St Botolph's Aldersgate {{remains open}} as a {{functioning}} church. Unusually for an English church, {{because of its}} location in a now mainly commercial area with few local residents, services are held on Tuesdays instead of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> Sundays. On 4 January 1950, St Botolph's Aldersgate and the surviving ruins of Christ Church Greyfriars were both designated Grade I listed buildings.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> {{taxonomy}} of the family, particularly the split into four groups, {{has been challenged}} by recent research. A 1998 study by Gary Nunn and Scott Stanley showed that the fulmarine petrels were indeed a discrete group within the family, as were the gadfly petrels in the genus Pterodroma.|$|E

5|$|Christchurch {{holds an}} annual music festival {{on the first}} weekend in July. Originally a folk festival, the event has evolved to cater for {{a wider variety of}} tastes: clog and morris dancing groups and salsa and belly dancing {{exhibitions}} have featured. Rock bands and soul groups have been included alongside <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> types of music. The festival's format changes annually but usually takes place on and around the town quay where a large marquee contains the main stage. Local bars often host smaller bands and dancing and exhibitions take place throughout the town centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{latter part}} of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics. The first of these was Gothic romance writer Marilyn Ross's Barnabas Collins series (1966–71), loosely based on the {{contemporary}} American TV series Dark Shadows. It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic tragic heroes rather than as <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> embodiment of evil. This formula was followed in novelist Anne Rice's highly popular and influential Vampire Chronicles (1976–2003).|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the albatross {{group has been}} a source of much debate. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy places seabirds, birds of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged order, Ciconiiformes, whereas the ornithological organisations in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand retain <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> order Procellariiformes. The albatrosses can be separated from the other Procellariiformes both genetically and through morphological characteristics, size, their legs, and the arrangement of their nasal tubes (see below: Morphology and flight).|$|E

5|$|To assist his endeavour, Shackleton {{adopted a}} mixed {{transport}} strategy, involving {{the use of}} Manchurian ponies as pack animals, as well as <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> dog-sledges. A specially adapted motor car was also taken. Although the dogs and the car were used during the expedition {{for a number of}} purposes, the task of assisting the group that would undertake the march to the pole fell to the ponies. The size of Shackleton's four-man polar party was dictated by the number of surviving ponies; of the ten that were embarked in New Zealand, only four had survived the 1908 winter.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, design {{management}} {{was seen as}} limited to the management of design projects, but over time, it evolved to include other aspects of an organization at the functional and strategic level. A more recent debate concerns the integration of design thinking into strategic management as a cross-disciplinary and human-centered approach to management. This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an abductive mode of inference, compared to practices associated with <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> management paradigm.|$|E

There are presently three radio stations that specifically serve either the Shrewsbury area or encompass it as part of a Shropshire-wide broadcast. They include: Free Radio Shropshire & Black Country;, BBC Radio Shropshire, which is based in Shrewsbury; and, as of September 2006, The Severn, which broadcasts from the Shropshire Star building in Telford.|$|E

5|$|As {{one of the}} two {{principal}} common law courts along with the Common Pleas, the King's Bench's jurisdiction and caseload was significantly challenged by the rise of the Court of Chancery and equitable doctrines in the 15th and 16th centuries. To recover, the King's Bench undertook a scheme of revolutionary reform, creating less expensive, faster and more versatile types of pleading in the form of bills as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> writs. Although not immediately stemming the tide, in the long term it helped the King's Bench not only recover but increase its workload. While there was a steep decline in business from 1460 to 1540, as the new reforms began to take effect the King's Bench's business was significantly boosted; between 1560 and 1640, it rose tenfold.|$|E
5|$|As with X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter was {{initially}} {{developed for the}} CP System II arcade system board. The game debuted in Japanese and North American arcades in 1997. The game received a port to the Sega Saturn, exclusive to Japan, on October 22, 1998. The Sega Saturn port supported the 4MB RAM expansion peripheral, allowing the developers to create a conversion which retained the original frame rates and tag team system. The game was then ported to the PlayStation in February 1999. Due to the console's limited RAM capacity, the tag team format was switched to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> round format used in other fighting game series, such as Street Fighter. To compensate {{for the removal of}} tag team gameplay, several new game modes, such as Hero Battle and Cross Over, were implemented.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them {{on the basis of}} similarities. In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system. This system bases classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> hierarchy.|$|E

5|$|During World WarII, tourist travel fell sharply, {{staffing}} was cut, {{and many}} facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented Mission66, {{an effort to}} modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned {{to be completed by}} 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{name was}} English in origin, linking {{him to the}} Anglo-Saxon saint Edward the Confessor, and was chosen by his father instead of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> Norman and Castilian names {{selected}} for Edward's brothers: Edward had three elder brothers: John and Henry who had died before Edward was born, and Alphonso, who died in August 1284, leaving Edward as {{the heir to the}} throne. Although Edward was a relatively healthy child, there were enduring concerns throughout his early years that he too might die and leave his father without a male heir. After his birth, Edward was looked after by a wet-nurse called Mariota or Mary Maunsel for a few months until she fell ill, when Alice de Leygrave became his foster mother. He would have barely known his natural mother Eleanor, who was in Gascony with his father during his earliest years. An official household complete with staff was created for the new baby, under the direction of a clerk, Giles of Oudenarde.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IX was {{developed}} alongside Final Fantasy VIII, but {{took a different}} approach by returning to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> style of the early Final Fantasy games. Consequently, Final Fantasy IX was influenced significantly by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to other titles in the series. It was released to critical acclaim and holds the highest Metacritic score of all Final Fantasy installments. It is often cited by critics and fans {{as one of the}} best entries in the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling over five million copies worldwide by March 2003 and five and a half million copies by February 2016. In 2016 ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.|$|E

5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{producers}} and creators presented material in a narrative format instead of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits {{that had been}} conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research {{was part of the}} creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look, unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.|$|E
5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
