5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood.

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross <b>the</b> <b>placenta,</b> providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during the first few months of life.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the umbilical cord was intact and still attached to <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> inside the uterus.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the silky shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation exists between the tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.|$|E
5|$|Transmission occurs through {{inhalation}} {{of airborne}} variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person. It {{is transmitted from}} one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. The virus can cross <b>the</b> <b>placenta,</b> but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in <b>the</b> <b>placenta,</b> and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in thymus and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best defined it as important for immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by progesterone found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and progesterone in explants of late proliferative phase endometrium.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} fish are {{viviparous}}. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply {{with that of the}} embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E
5|$|Viviparous mammals {{are in the}} {{subclass}} Theria; {{those living}} today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located {{in the front of}} the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy. Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way. The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long gestation periods. They get their name from <b>the</b> <b>placenta,</b> which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake.|$|E

40|$|Ferritin was {{injected}} into the fetal or the maternal circulation of 27 - 29 -day-pregnant rabbits. After the occurrence of a quasi-steady state, <b>the</b> <b>placentas</b> were prepared for electron microscopy. Ferritin particles were counted in the electron micrographs in the fetal capillaries, in the maternal blood spaces, and in the two interstitial compartments of <b>the</b> three-layered <b>placenta.</b> Under <b>the</b> circumstances of the experiments (excessively elevated plasma ferritin concentrations), no evidence was found for nondiffusional transport of radiolabeled ferritin. Comparison of the standing concentration gradients in <b>the</b> <b>placentas,</b> recorded after maternal and after fetal injection, showed that the interstitial spaces "excluded" ferritin; the plasma-interstitial space ferritin partition coefficients were 10 in the basement membrane space and 3 {{in the space between}} the cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts. 55 % of the total concentration gradient across <b>the</b> rabbit <b>placenta</b> occurred across <b>the</b> fetal endothelium, about 45 % across the cytotrophoblast, and less than 5 % across the syncytiotrophoblast. These figures are believed to reflect the relative contributions of these three layers to the total diffusional resistance in <b>the</b> rabbit <b>placenta.</b> When compared to previous data on the relative contributions of these three layers for small ions and molecules, the present data lead to the conclusion that discrimination of molecular size {{is a function of the}} fetal capillary endothelium alone...|$|R

5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E

25|$|Although much {{research}} into mechanism of pre-eclampsia has taken place, its exact pathogenesis remains uncertain.

Abnormal development of <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> leads to poor placental perfusion. <b>The</b> <b>placenta</b> of women with pre-eclampsia is abnormal and characterized by poor trophoblastic invasion. It is thought that this results in oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the release of factors that promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and other possible reactions.|$|E

40|$|Background: One of the {{frequent}} questions in obstetric practice {{is to determine}} placental vascular changes that may account for abnormal Doppler flow velocity alterations in maternal uterine vessels from women and fetuses without pregnancy pathology. Methods: A retrospective morphometric study was realized using 27 placentas from patients submitted for Doppler flow velocity exam during pregnancy. <b>The</b> <b>placentas</b> were morphologically examined using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Measurements of villi were made {{with the use of}} a video camera coupled to a common light microscope and a computer with automatic image analyzing software. Results: Of <b>the</b> 27 <b>placentas,</b> 13 (48 %) were of patients showing unaltered Doppler and 14 (52 %) showing altered Doppler. The number of stem villi vessels was significantly larger in <b>the</b> <b>placentas</b> of patients with Doppler exam alterations (P = 0. 003). This group also presented greater stem villi vessel thickness, although without significant difference. The number of intermediary and terminal villi vessels was greater in <b>the</b> <b>placentas</b> of patients with altered Doppler exams (P < 0. 001), and a greater terminal villi area was observed in these cases (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: The morphological proof that uterine artery Doppler flow velocity exam alterations are associated with placental vascular alterations demonstrates the importance of this exam during prenatal care, even in the absence of maternal-fetal alterations.
