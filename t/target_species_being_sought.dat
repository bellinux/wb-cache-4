40|$|Drift fences with traps are {{commonly}} used for ecological research and survey. Field {{studies have examined the}} effectiveness of selected fence layouts, but comprehensive field testing is impractical. We applied a simulation approach to investigate how the interaction of fence layout and animal movement type influence fence encounter rates. A range of fence layouts, varying in spacing and configuration, were chosen based on common field practices and recommendations in the literature. Animal movement patterns ranged from meandering (Brownian) to highly directional over distances of 10 to 500 m. We found that fences in short, straight, widely spaced arrangements would be encountered more frequently by highly mobile animals than the same amount of fence in complex or continuous configurations. The dispersed arrangement was encountered just as often by animals with more limited movement patterns as were closer spaced fences. Consequently, for broad-scale surveys, as opposed to studies on individuals 2 ̆ 7 movements and microhabitat use, we recommend spacing trap/fence units in relation to the movement abilities of the most mobile <b>species</b> <b>being</b> <b>sought.</b> For studies that require intense point sampling, additional fencing should increase the total rate that animals encounter fences at a point but the increase will not be proportional to the additional fencing used.

40|$|Due to the {{considerable}} challenges for reliable and expedient detection of virulent vegetative bacterial, bacterial endospores and other hazardous biological agents, accidental exposure {{is a principal}} cause of fatality due to wound infection or slow diagnosis. Staining techniques, due to their simplicity, form a set of important tools for pathogen monitoring and control. The staining assays, such as immunoassays, however, provide only Boolean information: i. e., stain vs. does not stain. As a result, only the <b>species</b> <b>being</b> <b>sought</b> may {{have a chance to}} be identified, leaving key determining factors for the diagnosis quite susceptible to human error. Our principle motivation for this project is to expand the current analytical techniques beyond their Boolean nature, and to address the apparent need for simple, expedient and inexpensive assays. We describe the development of an assay system based on the dynamics of fluorophore uptake that will serve as a robust platform for detection of both vegetative and endospore bacterial contaminants. The kinetics of fluorescence staining depends on the coatings and protein content, which reflect the species phenotype. Hence, such kinetic measurements gain access to genetic information, in less than a minute, without conducting amplification procedures such as PCR. We have demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the kinetics of emission enhancement, caused by cell uptake of fluorophores, provides statistically significant discernibility between different and closely related vegetative bacteria and bacterial endospore species respectively. We observed that the time course of the fluorescence signal provides a unique species-specific signature that can prove indispensible for the identification of dangerous and life-threatening spores...|$|R

These vessels, though mostly based in Spain are registered in the UK, Germany and other countries outside the EU such as Panama. The fishery is conducted in depths between 200 and 1200 meters, with the main <b>target</b> <b>species</b> <b>being</b> monkfish (200 - 800 m) and deepwater sharks (800 - 1200 m).

Vessels currently participating in the fishery are reported to use up to 250 km of gear, and the nets are left fishing unattended and hauled every 3 - 10 days with trip lengths varying between 4 – 8 weeks. The amount of fishing gear used in the fisheries, the lengths of the fleets, {{and the fact that the}} nets are unattended much of the time, make it very likely that a large quantity of nets are lost, while there is also evidence of illegal dumping of sheet netting.

40|$|Abstract: Anthropogenic {{structures}} in rivers can impede fish passage. In Ireland, weirs were commonly installed on {{major and minor}} rivers to harness water power to operate machinery. Many such structures are now derelict. Many had fish passage facilities installed, the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> <b>being</b> Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and brown trout (Salmo trutta L.). A combination of Water Framework Directive and Habitats Directive provides a lens to critically examine anthropogenic barriers and their possible impacts on fish species of conservation significance, particularly in channels designated as Special Area of Conservation (SAC) for anadromous species. In Ireland, these species include sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus L.), Twaite shad (Alosa fallax Lacepede) and Atlantic salmon. Surveys have identified substantial clustering of sea lamprey nesting sites below the most downstream major weirs on the Irish SACs and limited upstream penetration, as recorded in catchment-wide larval sea lamprey distribution. Ireland has a conservation management objective of achieving unimpeded access to 75 % of the main stem channel length for spawning anadromous lamprey migration. The potential for achieving this target was examined in two SAC rivers – the Mulkear (Lower River Shannon SAC) and the Munster Blackwater SAC. Barrier passability or porosity was examined using the SNIFFER barrier tool and information {{on the status of}} sea lamprey was generated from spawning site surveys and from catchmentwide electric fishing surveys of larval lamprey. Implementation of barrier management strategies was associated with substantial increase in numbers and degree of dispersal of Petromyzon redds on the Mulkear. The two major Blackwater weirs are scheduled for modification and scope for enhanced dispersal of migrating adult sea lamprey is examined {{in the context of the}} design of proposed modification and of available sea lamprey larval records in the Blackwater catchment...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess allelopathic activity of diploid and mixoploid fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) aqueous extracts of dried shoots (10, 20, 30 and 40 g/l) against lettuce (Lactuca sativa), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and peganum (Peganum harmala). Results showed that fenugreek allelopathic potential was significantly enhanced by polyploidization. Mixoploid plant extracts have more significant effects (P inf 0. 05) on all <b>target</b> <b>species</b> than that of diploid plants at all tested concentration levels. At the high concentration of 40 g/l, mixoploid plant extract induced 9 % more inhibition on lettuce root growth, 21 % more on peganum, and 36 % more on alfalfa than that from diploid plant. Based on the whole-range inhibition index for growth, the allelopathic potential of mixoploid plants was enhanced by 24. 4 % on lettuce, 79. 7 % on peganum, and 37 % on alfalfa. There was a significant difference in sensitivity towards fenugreek allelopathy among the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> with lettuce <b>being</b> the most sensitive and alfalfa the least affected. Such differences were consistent for both mixoploid and diploid plants. Fenugreek may be favorably used in sustainable weed management.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, {{ecotourism}} to view {{and interact with}} marine megafauna has become increasingly popular (Higham and Lück 2008). Examples {{of this type of}} tourism include turtle and whale watching, snorkelling with seals and shark diving (Jacobson and Robles 1992; Anderson and Ahmed 1993; Orams 2002; Kirkwood et al. 2003; Dearden et al. 2008; Dicken and Hosking 2009). The occurrence of many aggregations of megafauna along the coasts of regional areas remote from centres of population means that such tourism also provides significant flow-on effects and diversification to local economies where few alternative sources of income exist (Milne 1990; Garrod and Wilson 2004). Importantly, the development of a well-managed ecotourism industry based on megafauna provides the opportunity for local people to utilise natural resources in a sustainable manner over the long-term (Mau 2008). The economic value of tourism based on marine megafauna is enormous. In 2008, a study of whale watching estimated that this form of tourism was available in 119 countries, involved approximately 13 million participants and generated an income to operators and supporting businesses (hotels, restaurants and souvenirs) of over US$ 2. 1 billion (O'Connor et al. 2009). This industry is estimated to have the potential to generate annual revenues of over US$ 2. 5 billion (Cisneros-Montemayor et al. 2010). The development of whale watching has been paralleled by growth in tourism based on other types of marine megafauna. In particular, tourism to observe sharks and rays has become increasingly common. At the forefront of this relatively new market are industries that focus on whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) with estimates calculated in 2004 suggesting that these generated more than US$ 47. 5 million worldwide, providing important revenues to developing countries such as Ecuador, Thailand and Mozambique (Graham 2004). Diving with other species of sharks has followed a similar trend of growing popularity. In 2005, it was estimated that approximately 500, 000 divers were engaged in shark-diving activities worldwide (Topelko and Dearden 2005). An increasing range of opportunities for this type of tourism are available, including cage diving, shark feeding and drift diving with reef and oceanic sharks. Shark-diving tourism can be found in more than 40 countries (Carwardine and Watterson 2002), with new destinations and <b>target</b> <b>species</b> <b>being</b> established rapidly, due to the increasing recognition of the economic potential of this activity (Dicken and Hosking 2009; De la Cruz Modino et al. 2010) ...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{conservation}} {{strategies to}} restore populations of threatened species has been signaled {{as an important}} task by the Convention on Biological Diversity 2011 – 2020 <b>targets.</b> <b>Species</b> are <b>being</b> threatened not only by habitat loss and fragmentation but increasingly by climate change. As resources for conservation are often limited, and restoration {{is among the most}} expensive conservation strategies, developing approaches that help in the prioritization of areas for restoration efforts is a critical task. In this study, we propose a spatial multicriteria decision analysis (SMCDA) framework for identifying potential areas for plant species restoration initiatives that can explicitly take into account future climatic change. As a way to show how the framework can be applied, we took advantage of freely available niche modeling software and geospatial information to identify regional-scale priority areas for restoration of two threatened endemic tree species (i. e. Bielschmiedia miersii and Pouteria splendens) of the “Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forest” Hotspot. The SMCDA framework allowed us not only to identify priority areas for species restoration but also to analyze how different environmental conditions and land-use types may affect the selection of areas for species restoration. Our analysis suggests that the inclusion of climate change is a key factor to assess the potential areas for species restoration because species may respond differentially to future climatic conditions. This framework is conceived {{to be used as a}} complementary approach to available landscape-scale spatial conservation planning tools. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A PCR-based {{technique}} {{based on}} the ITS 1 - 5. 8 s-ITS 2 domain of the rRNA gene for identifying five species associated with Mycosphaerella leaf disease (MLD) of eucalypts was developed. Primer pairs MC 2 F and MC 2 R; ML 1 F and ML 1 R; MM 1 F and MM 1 R; MN 1 F and MN 1 R; and MP 1 F and MP 1 R amplified a product for DNA extracted from their single <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> those <b>being</b> M. cryptica, M. lateralis, M. marksii, M. nubilosa and M. parva respectively. The possibility of false positive amplification by each primer pair was tested in reactions with DNA extracts from 16 other Mycosphaerella species associated with eucalypts and against non-infected Eucalyptus globulus leaves. Under the PCR conditions used, there were no false positive amplifications of the 16 non-target Mycosphaerella species, or from non-symptomatic E. globulus leaves for the primer pairs ML 1 F and ML 1 R; MM 1 F and MM 1 R; MN 1 F and MN 1 R; and MP 1 F and MP 1 R. The primer pair MC 2 F and MC 2 R amplified a 402 nt product from both the target M. cryptica and non-target M. nubilosa. However, these two species were differentiated by digesting the product with the restriction enzyme Sacc II {{which resulted in a}} single 402 nt product for M. cryptica, and two products of 78 and 324 nt for M. nubilosa.

The conventional method of DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> selection involves picking an static set of <b>target</b> <b>species</b> based on the expected major combustion processes; however, these static <b>target</b> <b>species</b> may not remain important throughout a combustion simulation. The RII method determines appropriate DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> solely from the local thermochemical state of the simulation, enabling DAC simulations to better respond to changing combustion conditions while ensuring that accuracy is maintained. Further, the RII method reduces the expertise required of users to select DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> sets. The RII method was tested on constant volume ignition delay studies as well as single-cell engine simulations under homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) conditions for n-heptane and isopentanol reaction mechanisms. It is illustrated that the RII is capable of accurate predictions of constant volume ignition delays {{over a wide range}} of starting conditions. Further, for a similar maximum error in ignition delay predictions, under certain autoignition conditions the RII method produced considerably smaller local skeletal mechanisms compared to those of conventional DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> selections; however, both methods generated similarly sized local skeletal mechanisms outside these regions.
