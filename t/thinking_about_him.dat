[...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way.

When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making {{a big deal out}} of nothing.

[...] He added, [...] "I have been so lucky. Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was pretty impressive.

This time, when asked, the main character states he is seeing [...] "a 24 year old in Germany," [...] which would seem to imply he has lied both times and therefore is actually single - too hurt to become close to anyone since. They have sex and before parting ways the man in red gives him his number.

Of course, no one “stole” Robertson; {{it is just that}} anyone was apt to be embarrassed by <b>thinking</b> closely <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> But in this last inconsistency of his we can see one of his virtues {{and one of the reasons}} younger scholars, rediscovering him, have found a wealth of suggestiveness in his work (at least this is my impression) that their elders did not. His reading of Augustine here displays a counterenergy, a willingness to be surprised by the past." ...|$|R
