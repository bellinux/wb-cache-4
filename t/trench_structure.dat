2500|$|The {{general area}} of the copper {{workshop}} was first discovered by Perino in the late 1950s and definitively located by modern excavations in the 2000s. Located just {{to the north of}} the mound, it consisted of a typical Mississippian wall <b>trench</b> <b>structure</b> measuring [...] along its north/south axis and [...] along its east/west axis. The structure had an internal surface area measuring roughly [...] and sunk [...] into the ground. The walls of the building had unusual gaps, now thought by archaeologists to be vents for air flow into the building or to let toxic gases from the heating of copper escape. A variety of raw copper nuggets, small pieces of worked copper, and stone tools for the working of copper were found in the structure, and it is now believed by researchers that the building was used for the processing of raw copper into finished products. The remains of three tree stumps were also found and are thought to have been used to hold anvil stones. Analysis of copper found during excavations showed that it had been annealed, a technique involving repeatedly heating and cooling the metal as it is worked, such as blacksmiths do with iron. Items produced at this workshop may have been similar to copper objects found at other Mississippian sites, such as long-nosed god maskettes, ceremonial earrings with a symbolic shape, thought to have been used in fictive kinship rituals. Many of the stylistically related Mississippian copper plates such as the Wulfing cache from southeastern Missouri, some of the Etowah plates from Georgia, and many of the Spiro plates from Oklahoma are associated with the Greater Braden Style and are thought to have been made in Cahokia in the 13th century.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} extract {{critical}} dimensions of a <b>trench</b> <b>structure</b> (depth, CD, and sidewall angle), the measured polarized reflectance data {{must have a}} sufficiently large wavelength range and analyzed with a physically valid model (for example: RCWA {{in combination with the}} Forouhi-Bloomer Dispersion relations for n and k). Studies have shown that the limited wavelength range of a standard reflectometer (375 - 750 nm) does not provide the sensitivity to accurately measure trench structures with small CD values (less than 200 nm). However, by using a reflectometer with the wavelength range extended from 190 - 1000 nm, it is possible to accurately measure these smaller structures.|$|E
40|$|Acidic {{texturing}} of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers {{often leads}} to rough surfaces with strong etch attacks (<b>trench</b> <b>structures),</b> especially at sites with crystal defects. The appearance of <b>trench</b> <b>structures</b> on the wafer surface has been cited in earlier publications and has been often recognised as being harmful to solar cell performance [Mathijssen et al., 2009]. In this work, an in-line measurement method for these structures is presented, using a line camera system with diffuse illumination. The presented method {{can be used for}} the in-line quality control of the acidic texturization. The number of <b>trench</b> <b>structures</b> is quantified in the images via a newly developed algorithm by an adaptive threshold method. With the help of AFM images the measurement method could be regarded in detail. It has been shown that the true area fraction of <b>trench</b> <b>structures</b> only lies between 0. 3 % and 1. 8 % instead of 212 %, which is estimated from measurements. As expected, the number of <b>trench</b> <b>structures</b> strongly depends on the texture strength and the number of crystal defects in as-cut material. Therefore, if the texturization method remains constant, it is possible to easily measure material quality by measuring the fraction of <b>trench</b> <b>structures</b> and the presented measurement method could be used as cheap alternative to photoluminescence measurements. The reliability of the algorithm is demonstrated by the correlation between material quality, texture strength and the resulting number of <b>trench</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Acidic {{texturing}} of multi crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers {{often leads}} to rough surfaces with areas of strong etch attacks which we call <b>trench</b> <b>structures.</b> Particularly at sites containing crystal defects such as grain boundaries and dislocations, <b>trench</b> <b>structures</b> are created. These <b>trench</b> <b>structures</b> have often been reported as detrimental to solar cell performance. In this paper, a detailed statistical analysis {{of the influence of}} <b>trench</b> <b>structures</b> on solar cell efficiency is carried out. It is shown that their influence on cell efficiency, as well as open circuit voltage, short circuit current and fill factor, is only very minor. The material quality determines the diffusion length of the minority carriers and predominantly impacts the solar cell efficiency. Moreover, it has been established that <b>trench</b> <b>structures</b> do not significantly influence surface roughness and do not lead to shunting losses. However, the statistical model indicates that materials with many crystal defects, and thus lower quality and a smoother (and hence more reflecting) texture lead to slightly higher efficiencies compared to solar cells with a rougher texture. The higher efficiency obtained with smoother textures for this kind of material might be caused by the absence of <b>trench</b> <b>structures.</b> Furthermore, it has been found in this work that for these acidic textures, surface roughness correlates to weighted reflection and hence only one of these parameters has to be determined to analyze an acidic texture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Silicon carbide (SiC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{attractive}} semiconductors for high voltage applications. The breakdown voltage of SiC-based devices highly depends on the variation of the fabrication process including doping of the epilayers and the etching steps. In this paper, we show a way to diminish this variability by employing novel <b>trench</b> <b>structures.</b> The influence of the process variations in terms of doping concentration and etching has been studied and compared with conventional devices. The breakdown voltage variation (∆VBR) of 450 V and 2100 V is obtained for the ± 20 % variation of doping concentration of the devices with and without the <b>trench</b> <b>structures,</b> respectively. For ± 20 % variation in etching steps, the maximum ∆VBR of 380 V is obtained for the device with <b>trench</b> <b>structures</b> in comparison to 1800 V for the conventional <b>structure</b> without <b>trench</b> <b>structures.</b> These results show that the breakdown voltage variation is significantly reduced by utilizing the proposed structure...|$|R

CDs signify widths of the trench {{at various levels}} inside the trench -top, middle, and bottom of trench.These key properties can be determined by measuring polarized reflectance Rs and Rp over as wide a wavelength range as possible, preferably covering ultra-violet through near infra-red wavelengths (190 nm - 1000 nm).Analysis of the measured Rs and Rp, based on the Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations (to characterize any films within the <b>trench</b> <b>structure),</b> combined with Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) (to determine the geometry), will provide trench depth, CDs and profiles.|$|E

Often a blanket area on the trench sample with the film of interest is present for the measurement. In this example, the reflectance spectrum of the poly-silicon was measured on a blanket area containing the poly-silicon, from which its n and k spectra were determined in accordance with the methodology described in this article that utilizes the Forouhi-Bloomer Dispersion Equations. Fixed tables of n and k values were used for the SiO2 and Si3N4 films.|$|E

Twelve burials were located what would have been just outside the built and re-built structures. It is unknown as to whether the buildings were burned intentionally {{as a part of a}} ritual or as a result of a battle with an outside group; however, after the last fire it was no longer used. A burial was also located in shallow grave in one of the small mounds at the edge of the village.

40|$|We {{proposed}} a new AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistor using a <b>trench</b> <b>structure</b> for high-voltage switching applications. The proposed <b>trench</b> <b>structure</b> {{was designed for}} the use at the gate edge, which improved the gate leakage current and breakdown voltage. We considered that {{the thickness of the}} AlGaN barrier was related to the polarization, surface-state density and leakage current. The surface states at the gate edge were controlled by etching the AlGaN barrier by 22 nm. The gate leakage current of the proposed device was 40 ?A/mm while that of a conventional device was 201 ?A/mm with a reverse gate-drain voltage of 100 V. The suppressed gate leakage current may have been caused by the decrease in the surface states at the gate edge. The breakdown voltage of the proposed device was 762 V while that of the conventional device without a <b>trench</b> <b>structure</b> was 120 V. The forward drain current and transconductance of the proposed device were decreased slightly because the channel resistance was increased in the trench region.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{sedimentary}} layers and non-flat bathymetry on teleseismic P waveforms from shallow subduction zone earthquakes are examined by calculating synthetic seismograms. The actual bathymetry and shallow sedimentary layers {{revealed by the}} seismic refraction studies are incorporated in 2 -D velocity models of the oceanic trench region. 2 -D finite-difference calculation is employed to get a complete response of the assumed non-flat model structures. The result of the modelling of WWSSN long-period seismograms shows that not only the non-flat bathymetry but also thick sedimentary layers are essential to model the synthetic seismograms. The lack of non-flat bathymetry or sedimentary structure in the structural model often results in unrealistic synthetics. In general, the paths going across the trench axis are most affected. This {{is caused by the}} steeply dipping ocean bottom and the thick sedimentary layers at the trench slope. Observed seismograms of the 1968 Kurile thrust event (mb 5. 5) and the 1967 Java normal event (mb 6. 0) show remarkable large-amplitude later arrivals despite their moderate magnitudes. A realistic model of the <b>trench</b> <b>structure,</b> however, reproduces remarkably well this character of later arrivals, which shows that it is essential to incorporate the structure. Our results also indicate that we need precise knowledge on the <b>trench</b> <b>structure</b> to model the structural effects in detail. On the GDSN long-period seismograms the effect of the sedimentary layers is negligible because the rather narrow-band response of the GDSN seismograph lies in a frequency range lower than the affected band.
