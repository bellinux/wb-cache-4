5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>operate,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{immediate aftermath of}} the plague it was at a much reduced level and many stalls were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF {{aircraft}} be grounded, and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti-regime tendencies. This was achieved by placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base. Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft, the U.S. deemed it too risky for American helicopters <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jungles against the communists.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{attack on}} Ilissos, U-862 {{continued}} east along the Australian coastline, becoming the only German submarine <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean during the Second World War. After entering the Pacific U-862 scored her first success on this patrol when she attacked the U.S.-registered liberty ship Robert J. Walker off the South Coast of New South Wales on 24 December 1944. The ship sank the following day. Following this attack, U-862 evaded an intensive search by Australian aircraft and warships and departed for New Zealand.|$|E

These include the sale of X-rated pornographic materials (1989) and prostitution in brothels (1992), although brothels are only permitted <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburbs of Hume, Mitchell and Fyshwick. The personal use of cannabis was decriminalised in 1992 and abortion was decriminalised in 2002. In 2006, the ACT Government attempted to introduce a law recognising civil unions, but it was overturned by the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Steam {{ships of}} the period, which burned coal to fire their boilers, were {{naturally}} tied to coaling stations in friendly ports. The German Navy lacked sufficient overseas bases for sustained operations, even for single ships operating as commerce raiders. The Navy experimented with {{a device to}} transfer coal from colliers to warships while underway in 1907, though the practice was not put into general use. Nevertheless, German capital ships had a cruising range of at least , more than enough <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The GHRS was a {{spectrograph}} designed <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ultraviolet. It {{was built}} by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve a spectral resolution of 90,000. Also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS, which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble. Rather than CCDs these three instruments used photon-counting digicons as their detectors. The FOC was constructed by ESA, while the University of California, San Diego, and Martin Marietta Corporation built the FOS.|$|E
5|$|The Patagonian {{tensions}} heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant {{ships which}} had been licensed <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty.|$|E

In 2010, Amazon.com ended its sub-lease with WRC.Com Tower LLC and began the move of its headquarters to a new campus in the city's South Lake Union neighborhood. Much of the building was left vacant without new tenants moving into the space. The location outside of downtown Seattle was a constraint for businesses.|$|E
5|$|As Allied {{intelligence}} {{regarding the}} Japanese was still uncertain, Ramsay, who officially assumed {{command of the}} forces on New Britain on 27 November, adopted a cautious approach. Jacquinot Bay was built up as a base of operations and the Australians began sending out patrols to fight for information and harass the Japanese, with limited advances taking place on both {{the northern and southern}} coasts of the island, pushing east towards the Japanese strong hold around the Gazelle Peninsula. The AIB also continued <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, passing information to the 5th Division. The Japanese lacked information on the movements of Allied forces in New Britain, and only learned of the change in command from Australian radio broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} this ship, Rivoli, was launched, the Royal Navy had {{achieved}} dominance over the French in the Adriatic Sea. Not only had the regional commander Bernard Dubourdieu been killed and his squadron destroyed at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811, but French efforts to supply their scattered garrisons were proving increasingly risky. This was demonstrated by {{the destruction of a}} well-armed convoy from Corfu to Trieste at the Action of 29 November 1811. Rivoli's launch was therefore seen by the French Navy as an opportunity to reverse these defeats, as the new ship of the line outgunned the British frigates that operated within the Adriatic and would be able <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic without the threat of attack by the frigate squadron based on Lissa.|$|E

5|$|Conflicting Argentine and Chilean {{claims to}} Patagonia, a {{geographic}} {{region in the}} southernmost portion of South America, {{went back to the}} 1840s. In 1872 and again in 1878, Chilean warships seized merchant ships which had been licensed <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disputed area by Argentina. An Argentine warship did the same to an American ship in 1877. These actions nearly led to war in November 1878, when Argentina dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. Chile responded with the same, and war was only avoided when the Fierro–Sarratea treaty was hastily signed. Both countries were distracted {{in the next few years}} by Argentina's internal military operations against the indigenous population and Chile's War of the Pacific (Guerra del Pacífico) against Bolivia and Peru, but by 1890 a full-fledged naval arms race was underway between the two.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Sachsen class {{began in}} 1872 and lasted until 1874. The ships were {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baltic Sea as a primary component of an integrated coastal defense system proposed by General Albrecht von Stosch, the Chief of the Admiralty. Stosch designated the ships Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes), denoting their intended use. In the event of war with a superior naval power and {{the imposition of a}} naval blockade, the Sachsen-class ships would sortie from fortified bases to attack the blockaders. They also had the task of breaking up landing attempts. The German railway network linked the bases so ground forces could be transferred to the sites of enemy landings.|$|E
5|$|Despite the British {{attack on}} Saint Paul, French frigates {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean, Hamelin personally leading a cruise in the Bay of Bengal during the autumn. His ships seized {{a number of}} small merchantmen and in the Action of 18 November 1809 he personally defeated and captured three large East Indiamen in convoy. Before his squadron and their prizes returned to Île de France in late December, they had also captured the British brig HMS Victor and the large Portuguese frigate Minerva. During the winter few ships were at sea, as the risk of being caught in a seasonal hurricane was considered too severe to operate between December and March. Rowley correspondingly withdrew most of his forces to the Cape of Good Hope, leaving a handful of smaller ships to watch the French islands. Hamelin too kept his forces in harbour at Île de France, replenishing his ships and recruiting sailors from the large pool of unemployed men in Port Napoleon.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} spring of 1809, {{following}} the end of the Indian Ocean hurricane season, Hamelin ordered his ships <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay of Bengal. One of these frigates was the 40-gun Caroline, which was built in Antwerp in 1806 and weighed 1,078 tons. Caroline was commanded by Jean-Baptiste-Henri Féretier, newly promoted following the sudden death of her previous captain. Féretier was the first of Hamelin's captains to find a British convoy, spotting three sails on the horizon on 31 May. These belonged to a Britain-bound convoy of East Indiamen, which had departed the Hooghly River on 2 May. Laden with over £500,000 worth of silk and other trade goods, these ships were an important asset to the HEIC and had originally been part of a larger convoy, guarded by the sloop HMS Victor and consisting of five Indiamen and several smaller vessels. On 24 May a storm divided the convoy; Victor, the small ships and two of the Indiamen Monarch and Earl Spencer were separated from the remainder, the Streatham, Europe and Lord Keith after Monarch sprang a leak.|$|E
5|$|Early on in {{the gold}} rush, the US Army sent a small {{detachment}} to Circle City, in case intervention was required in the Klondike, while the Canadian government considered excluding all American prospectors from the Yukon Territory. Neither eventuality took place and instead the US agreed to make Dyea a sub-port of entry for Canadians, allowing British ships to land Canadian passengers and goods freely there, while Canada agreed to permit American miners <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Klondike. Both decisions were unpopular among their domestic publics: American businessmen complained that their right to a monopoly on regional trade was being undermined, while the Canadian public demanded action against the American miners.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, the French Republic {{declared}} war on the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, drawing both into the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. Less than two years later, {{in the winter of}} 17941795, the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French Army, French cavalry charging the Dutch Navy across the ice that blocked its winter anchorages, capturing it intact. The French reorganised the country into a client state named the Batavian Republic, and ordered the Dutch Navy <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Sea against British maritime trade routes. The British government did not immediately declare war on the Batavian Republic, but did take steps to seize Dutch shipping in British ports and established a new fleet to combat Batavian operations in the North Sea. The North Sea Fleet, as it was known, was composed mainly of older and smaller vessels not considered suitable for service in the Channel Fleet, and command of this force was given to the 66year old Admiral Adam Duncan.|$|E
