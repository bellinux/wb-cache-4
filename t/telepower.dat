There is a growing awareness that this represents a significant cost to telcos and asset managers. This cost may be measured both in capital, deployment and operating costs as well as indirect future costs. The cost-effective management of real time monitoring and asset information is a universal problem impacting all telcos. The paper will outline the kinds of information flow in <b>telepower</b> energy systems and how an open standard could provide cost savings and encourage wider adoption. It discusses what should be standardized and {{the process by which}} this might be achieved. The paper discusses common open protocols and data standards (e. g. SNMP, XML) and their application to a <b>telepower</b> standard. An outline of current initiatives towards an open standard is presented. The paper presents a case for an open standard in the area of information (data) management, remote (protocol) monitoring and configuration of <b>telepower</b> systems. This paper has been prepared collaboratively between Frank Bodi of Silcar and Paul Davis of Rectifier Technologies Pacific, out of a common technical interest.

This {{chapter is}} a {{discussion}} about different conceptions of “territory”, from a geographer’s point of view. In France, the dominant conception identifies the territory as a continuous area appropriated by an agent, whose power is exercised through the control over one space such as a private piece of land or a particular political-administrative entity (from municipality to State). By contrast, a power that doesn’t correspond to a continuous area is deemed as “non-territorial”. This conventional distinction could be challenged by an alternative conception, opposing and combining zonal and reticular forms in the territorialization of power. While the former leads to the control over a continuous area in order to exercise power on that is inside and against that is outside, the latter connects the discontinuous network of places wherever the subjects or objects submitted to the same power are. These two processes coexist in the social production of space: for example, in contemporary conurbations, the inhabitants’ practices produce reticular or networked territories, while the citizens are governed through political-administrative zonal territories. This theoretical proposal {{is applied to the}} long-term analysis of liminal territories to explain their persistent marginalization. It goes from the early spatial dimensions of the medieval “ban”, to the fringes where “banished” and “bandits” where concentrated, and to the contemporary “banlieues” whose urbanity and proper territoriality is repeatedly denied...|$|E
