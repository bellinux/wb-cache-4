5|$|The DS {{version of}} the game, which was {{significantly}} different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying from start to finish. GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief. 1UP found <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons Game parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{popular culture}} writer Anna Leszkiewicz {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons still holds cultural relevance, contemporary appeal {{is only for}} the first ten seasons, with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is killed off, or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters. The series' ratings have also declined; while the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4 million viewing households per episode in the U.S., the twenty-first season {{had an average of}} 7.2 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|Rieber has {{suggested}} a {{package for the}} politicians, where he would create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the route length traveled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion—Trygve Bratteli commenting <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> financing was private, it {{would still have to}} use the same funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the Nordland Line.|$|E

5|$|Some historians {{state that}} the German troops did not expect the Soviet {{armoured}} counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued that the German commanders were aware of, or at least anticipated, the Soviet armour that was massing around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops {{could not have been}} genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops were indeed largely taken by surprise when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.|$|E
5|$|The Ethics Commission later granted his {{campaign}} a reprieve, allowing Wolf {{to make an}} appeal at their next scheduled meeting on September 19. At the meeting, the Commission ruled 4-1 to reverse its decision which disqualified him from public office, allowing him {{to remain in office}} and renew his candidacy Governor. On October 21, Wolf announced he was ending {{his campaign}} for governor, due to the fact <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> Ethics Commission voted to change its rules, the implementation would have likely taken several months. On June 17, 2014, Wolf endorsed Don Berwick as the Democratic nominee for governor.|$|E

5|$|Saint Catherine's Monastery still {{maintains}} {{the importance of}} a letter, handwritten in 1844 with an original signature of Tischendorf confirming that he borrowed those leaves. However, recently published documents, including a deed of gift dated 11 September 1868 and signed by Archbishop Kallistratos and the monks of the monastery, indicate that the manuscript was acquired entirely legitimately. This deed, which agrees with a report by Kurt Aland on the matter, has now been published. Unfortunately this development is not widely known in the English-speaking world, as only German- and Russian-language media reported on it in 2009. Doubts as to the legality of the gift arose because when Tischendorf originally removed the manuscript from Saint Catherine's Monastery in September 1859, the monastery was without an archbishop, so <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> intention to present the manuscript to the Tsar had been expressed, no legal gift could be made at the time. Resolution of the matter was delayed through the turbulent reign of Archbishop Cyril (consecrated 7 December 1859, deposed 24 August 1866), and the situation only formalised after the restoration of peace.|$|E
