5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific proper (east of 140°W), sixteen {{tropical}} storms and eight hurricanes formed.

5|$|<b>These</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> (by ancient standards) consistent, {{and this}} could be {{interpreted}} that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars some have accepted this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis.

5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that <b>these</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E
5|$|Gregoras {{reports that}} 6,400 cavalrymen and 8,000 infantrymen {{fell in the}} battle, the same number he gives for Walter's forces. According to Muntaner, 20,000 infantrymen were killed, and {{only two of the}} seven hundred knights survived the battle, Roger Deslaur and Boniface of Verona. Like the numbers for the overall number of troops {{involved}} in the battle, <b>these</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> unverifiable and probably exaggerated, but they are nevertheless indicative of the scale of the Athenian defeat. In addition, other senior members of the Frankish nobility are known to have survived: Nicholas Sanudo, later Duke of the Archipelago, managed to escape the battlefield, and a few others such as Antoine le Flamenc, who is known to have participated in and survived the battle, were probably captured and later ransomed. Walter's head was severed by the Catalans, and many years later was taken to Lecce in Italy, where his son buried him in the Church of Santa Croce.|$|E

5|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch {{has always}} been rare and very localized throughout its distribution, perhaps due to very specific ecological requirements, though this has been questioned as not {{in keeping with the}} diversity of habitats in which S. formosa has been observed. Although the species is less threatened at high elevations, its habitat has been reduced by deforestation, due to logging and forest clearance to make way for human habitation. In the center of Laos and northern Vietnam, Fokienia trees, which are a known beautiful nuthatch foraging source and nesting site, are harvested for their high commercial value. Research conducted in 2001 indicated a population comprising 2,500 to 10,000 adults, and between 3,500 and 15,000 total individuals; <b>these</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> in decline. The species has been classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Note that <b>these</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> for the {{terrestrial}} surface {{and not really}} a global average. Whether dimming (or brightening) occurred over the ocean has {{been a bit of}} an unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles (643.7km) from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but are not strictly confined to the land area, and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation. A 2009 review by Wild et al. found that widespread variation in regional and time effects. There was solar brightening beyond 2000 at numerous stations in Europe, the United States, and Korea. The brightening seen at sites in Antarctica during the 1990s, influenced by recovering from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, fades after 2000. The brightening tendency also seems to level off at sites in Japan. In China there is some indication for a renewed dimming, after the stabilization in the 1990s. A continuation of the long-lasting dimming is also noted at the sites in India. Overall, the available data suggest continuation of the brightening beyond the year 2000 at numerous locations, yet less pronounced and coherent than during the 1990s, with more regions with no clear changes or declines. Therefore, globally, greenhouse warming after 2000 may be less modulated by surface solar variations than in prior decades. The largest reductions are found in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. Visible light and infrared radiation seem to be most affected rather than the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} hoplites is {{accepted}} as reasonable (and possible); the Athenians alone had fielded 10,000 hoplites at the Battle of Marathon. Some historians {{have accepted the}} number of light troops and used them as a population census of Greece at the time. Certainly <b>these</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> theoretically possible. Athens, for instance, allegedly fielded a fleet of 180 triremes at Salamis, manned by approximately 36,000 rowers and fighters. Thus 69,500 light troops {{could easily have been}} sent to Plataea. Nevertheless, the number of light troops is often rejected as exaggerated, especially in view of the ratio of seven helots to one Spartiate. For instance, Lazenby accepts that hoplites from other Greek cities might have been accompanied by one lightly armoured retainer each, but rejects the number of seven helots per Spartiate. He further speculates that each Spartiate was accompanied by one armed helot, and that the remaining helots were employed in the logistical effort, transporting food for the army. Both Lazenby and Holland deem the lightly armed troops, whatever their number, as essentially irrelevant to the outcome of battle.|$|E
