50|$|During {{the colonial}} {{occupation}} of Ceylon {{and following the}} lifting of the ban on the purchase of land by Europeans in 1810 and the elimination of land <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>export</b> crops by the Governor of Ceylon, Edward Barnes in 1824, there was a period of experimentation (1823-1839) with a number of different cash crops, including sugar. There are a number of potential reasons, primarily social and environmental, why sugar production failed to become an established industry on the island. As although the southern coastal areas were most suited for sugarcane cultivation this land was being used extensively for rice cultivation and the Ceylonese owners were unwilling to sell their land. In the interior the soil was too wet and the lack of available transport was a problem. The only sugar plantations that survived from this period were in the south coast near Galle. In the early 1850s the country had just become self-reliant in respect to sugar production but by the 1860s the industry was virtually non-existent.|$|E

The vector autoregressive model results show exports fell dramatically with the imposition of the tax. This research showed that the imposition of an export tax has long-lasting, negative effects on competitiveness of the Indonesian palm oil industry. The variance decomposition reveals that more than 83 % {{of the variation in}} the forecast error of the net export shares is explained by its own shock, and 8. 6 % and 8. 4 % are explained by export tax and relative export prices, respectively. ...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{tax code}} {{contains}} two provisions that encourage exports {{by reducing the}} U. S. corporate income <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>export</b> profits. An applied general equilibrium model of the U. S. economy is used to estimate the trade and welfare consequences of eliminating both tax provisions. We find that the provisions ameliorate the trade-discouraging effects of U. S. tariffs, but they also adversely affect the U. S. terms of trade {{to such an extent}} that eliminating them is likely to improve U. S. domestic welfare. While it is possible to find a “equivalent” tariff rate that replicates the effects on trade flows of removing the tax provisions, the welfare effects of a tariff differ importantly because a tariff interacts differently than the tax provisions with other distortions in the model. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} conceptual issues {{dealing with}} the measurement of “sector tax burden”, specifically the methodological treatment of the Value Added Tax (VAT) and <b>Tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>Exports,</b> with particular reference to the Agricultural Sector. First, notions of tax impact (statutory or legal incidence), tax burden shifting and economic incidence of VAT applied to domestic goods are considered; second, the case of commercial (tradable) goods or commodities, which is the relevant case for Agricultural Sector. In this last case, <b>Tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>Exports</b> is also taken into account. Conclusions lead to recommend changes to the usual estimation of sector tax burden, which is considered wrong or at least incomplete in its treatment.

3000|$|The {{government}} intervenes in {{the economy}} by taxing trade. Without loss of generality, {{we assume that the}} government introduces an ad valorem <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> at rate τ. We confine our attention to <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> of the primary good. Since the equilibrium depends on relative prices, the effect of any <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> imports can be replicated by a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> (Lerner symmetry result). Because we are interested in Argentina, which is a country with comparative advantages in the primary sector, we will not fully develop the case in which the pattern of trade reverses. If the economy reverses its pattern of trade, we assume that <b>export</b> <b>taxes</b> (<b>on</b> the manufactured good) are zero. The economic agents take the export tax, τ, as given. Unless the country is in autarky, domestic prices are given by p_a^d = p_a([...] 1 - τ) and p_m^d = p_m, where the nominal exchange rate is normalized to 1. We assume that the government reinjects the tax proceeds into the economy via lump-sum transfers to agents.|$|R

40|$|Uganda {{has made}} {{significant}} progress in reducing policy-induced anti-export bias in its trade policy in the 1990 s. <b>Taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> have been abolished, and import protection has been reduced considerably. Such trade barriers are only a component of thee transaction costs associated with trade. Poor infrastructure, notably by increasing transport costs, and institutional inefficiencies can significantly increase trade costs. The effective protection of imports, and implicit <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports,</b> due to transport costs is calculated and compared to effective protection due to trade policy barriers for Uganda. The results reveal that transport costs are often very high, in many cases representing a greater cost (tax) to exporters than trade policy.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to quantify the}} effects of removing trade taxes and instituting some necessary fiscal reform on poverty and income distribution in Cote d'lvoire. It first analyses income distribution for various homogenous socioeconomic groups using an absolute poverty line based on the constant basic needs approach. Next it simulates and analyses in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model the impact on poverty, inequality and welfare of the elimination of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> agricultural <b>exports</b> and imports combined with {{a change in the}} domestic tax rate. The results show that poverty increases for all households, but depending on the simulations the situation is diversified among socioeconomic groups. Liberalizing trade by removing <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> leads to an increase in domestic prices of agricultural and industrial goods, resulting in an increase in the consumer price index and a decrease in households' disposable income and thus in their consumption. Public employees are identified as the most affected by poverty following trade tax reform.

50|$|The {{discussion}} of Pardo's proposals produced two options for increasing revenue.

An ad hoc senate committee advocated an export tax or, alternatively, a nationalization of the nitrate fields, which would stop competition between the two fertilizers and bring the nitrate profit directly into the government treasury.|$|R
