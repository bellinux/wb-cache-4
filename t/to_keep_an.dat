5|$|The {{architect}} Jean-Nicolas Huyot gave {{very precise}} instructions to this section. Of wide-ranging experience formed in Asia Minor and Egypt {{and under the}} influence of engineers, he asked them <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> authentic diary of their excavations where precision measurements read off watches and compasses should be written down, to draw a map of the region they travelled, and to describe the layout of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|Finding a phone, Flash calls Squeezit {{and again}} asks for his help. Finally, Squeezit agrees {{to go into}} the Sixth Dimension to help rescue Frenchy and René. There, he is {{captured}} by Satan, with whom he makes a deal to bring him the Princess in exchange for Satan's help freeing René and Frenchy. Squeezit accomplishes this task, but has failed to include himself in the deal to rescue his friends, and the devil has him decapitated. Queen Doris sends Bust Rod <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> eye on the king, and to ensure he doesn't find out where she's hidden Frenchy.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle evolved from the {{practice}} of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.|$|E

Later that year it started providing on-site daycare in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> employee who {{was planning on}} being a stay-at-home mom. By 1984, SAS had begun building a fitness center, medical center, on-site cafe and other facilities. It had also developed some of its other benefits programs. SAS became known as {{a good place to}} work and was frequently recognized by national magazines like BusinessWeek, Working Mother and Fortune for its work environment.|$|E
5|$|Shakuni schemes an evil plan to {{kill the}} Pandavas through trickery. He {{constructs}} a house made of wax in Varanasi. Pandavas are ordered to go on pilgrimage to Varanasi until the troubled affairs of the state are resolved. Krishna sees through the plan of the evil Shakuni. He warns Bheema <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> eye on miscreants trying to burn the house. He later orders Bheema to dig an underground tunnel from the wax house into a forest nearby, which Bheema does. On a midnight, as Krishna predicted, the house is burned by fire on the orders of Duryodhana.|$|E

Trunajaya was initially friendly towards the VOC, {{but he refused to}} meet Speelman on board a VOC ship. The VOC's impression of Trunajaya declined after he failed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> appointment on neutral waters, and after emissaries reported that he was a drunkard. By the end of April, Speelman had decided to attack Surabaya over negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Báthory {{was elected}} King of Poland on 15 December 1575. He adopted {{the title of}} Prince of Transylvania and made Christopher voivode on 14 January 1576. An Ottoman {{delegation}} confirmed Christopher's appointment at the Diet in Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania) in July. The sultan's charter (or ahidnâme) sent to Christopher emphasized that he should keep the peace along the frontiers. Stephen set up a separate chancellery in Kraków <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> eye on the administration of Transylvania. The {{head of the new}} chancellery, Márton Berzeviczy, and Christopher cooperated closely.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Sutcliffe's {{aneurysm}} is unknown, {{although it is}} believed to have been started by an earlier head injury, as he was either kicked in the head, or thrown, head first, against a brick wall during a fight outside Lathom Hall, after a performance in January 1961. According to former manager Allan Williams, Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe's aid, fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety. Sutcliffe sustained a fractured skull in the fight and Lennon's little finger was broken. Sutcliffe refused medical attention at the time and failed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> X-ray appointment at Sefton General Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The presidential {{inauguration of}} Alfonsín was {{attended}} by Isabel Perón. Despite internal recriminations for the defeat, the Peronist party agreed to support Alfonsín as president, to prevent a return of the military. By this time, the left-wing terrorism had been neutralized and {{was no longer a}} menace. There were still factions in the military ambitious <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> authoritarian government, and groups such as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo seeking reparations for the actions of the military during the Dirty War.|$|E

5|$|Their {{income was}} modest, with George's small per annum living; Cassandra brought the {{expectation}} of a small inheritance {{at the time of}} her mother's death to the marriage. They took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> infant at home for several months and then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> eye on her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E
5|$|As Tropical Depression Five-E {{approached}} Mexico, the country's government released {{tropical storm}} watches and warnings for {{certain parts of}} the coastline. When the tropical depression formed on July 5, the government issued a tropical storm warning from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Other interests in the Pacific Ocean were asked <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> eye on the developing depression. The morning of July 6, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. The earlier tropical storm warning remained in effect, for another six hours, when the warning was demoted into a tropical storm watch. On the afternoon of July 6, the government discontinued the tropical storm watch up to Acapulco. The remaining tropical storm watch was discontinued on July 7, after the tropical depression had made landfall and began to weaken. The government's weather center also released thirteen tropical cyclone bulletins and four warnings for personal caution.|$|E

5|$|As-Salih Ayyub {{returned}} to Damascus <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> eye on developments in northern Syria. Al-Ashraf Musa of Homs had ceded the important stronghold of Salamiyah to as-Salih Ayyub the previous winter, perhaps to underline their patron-client relationship. This troubled the Ayyubids of Aleppo who feared {{it would be}} used as a base for a military take-over of their city. An-Nasir Yusuf found this intolerable and decided to annex Homs in the winter of 1248. The city surrendered in August and an-Nasir Yusuf's terms forced al-Ashraf Musa to hand over Homs, but he was allowed to retain nearby Palmyra and Tell Bashir in the Syrian Desert. As-Salih Ayyub sent Fakhr ad-Din to recapture Homs, but Aleppo countered by sending an army to Kafr Tab, south of the city. An-Nasir Dawud left Karak for Aleppo to support an-Nasir Yusuf, but in his absence, his brothers al-Amjad Hasan and az-Zahir Shadhi detained his heir al-Mu'azzam Isa and then personally went to as-Salih Ayyub's camp at al-Mansourah in Egypt to offer him control of Karak in return for holdings in Egypt. As-Salih Ayyub agreed and sent the eunuch Badr al-Din Sawabi to act as his governor in Karak.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{withdrew the}} next day as well, {{carrying}} the wounded British sailors to Jamaica before putting into Port-au-Prince, to debark the many foreign refugees picked up at Cape Haiten. After consultations with the American Consul, Capt. Walker took De Soto back to Cap-Haïtien on 7 November. There, he negotiated with a British squadron under Captain Macguire in HMS Galatea {{in the hopes of}} averting a retaliatory bombardment of the town, particularly as the Americans feared such an act would provoke widespread unrest and attacks on foreigners throughout Haiti. These talks failed and on 9 November, the British squadron bombarded the town in conjunction with an attack by President Geffrard's forces. With the defensive works destroyed and the town falling to government forces, the rebel leaders took refuge on De Soto. Capt. Walker then carried them to Monte Christo in the Dominican Republic. De Soto returned to Cape Haiten <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> eye on events until 13 December when she sailed for home, arriving in Hampton Roads on 19 December.|$|E
5|$|From 1 to 31 May 1924, the Royal Air Force {{conducted}} {{a number of}} night flying experiments. Pilots were asked <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> extra lookout whilst the experiments were taking place. On 27 and 28 September, the elimination trials for the Light Aircraft Trials were held. Only eight aircraft passed through to the trials proper. Also in October, it was notified that changes were being made expanding weather information given at Lympne. Amongst the changes were that measurements used were to be changed from imperial to metric. The addition of weather information at Haren, Brussels and Ostend, both in Belgium was notified. In 1924, Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft were operating cross-channel services for Imperial Airways. Lympne was used by aircraft of Imperial Airways as a refuelling point. The first stop in France was St Inglevert. When an aircraft departed Lympne for St Inglevert, the destination airfield was advised, and if arrival was not notified within two hours, the Coastguard was informed. Communication was by Carmichael Microway UHF transmitters at each airfield. Short Brothers used Lympne for flight testing new aircraft during 1924.|$|E

5|$|In 1328, Andronikos III finally overthrew his {{grandfather}} and {{established himself as}} sole emperor. Syrgiannes was freed, {{and was able to}} restore himself to Andronikos's favour, to the extent that in late 1329 he was entrusted with the important governorship of Thessalonica, the Empire's second-largest city, and of western Macedonia and Albania. There, he was again suspected of plotting against Kantakouzenos, this time with the emperor's mother, Empress Maria. She lived in Thessalonica, and was supposed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> eye on Syrgiannes; instead, she became so infatuated with him that she had him adopted. Following the death of the Empress in late 1333, the plot was uncovered and Syrgiannes was arrested and brought to Constantinople to face charges of treason. Syrgiannes, however, managed to escape and flee to the court of the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Drenović {{was awarded}} the Order of Karađorđe's Star by King Peter, based on a {{recommendation}} by Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović. Following the Italian capitulation, Drenović agreed to all the actions of his Chetniks being performed in close cooperation with local German units, and was informed {{at the end of}} the year that Ustaše units would again be stationed in Serb-inhabited areas. In October 1943, a team from the 1st Battalion of the 4th Brandenburg Division under Oberleutnant Hermann Kirchner began working alongside Drenović's Chetniks in northwest Bosnia, operating forward reconnaissance groups and developing contact with anti-communist farmers <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> eye on Partisan troop movements. There were about 950 Chetniks serving under Drenović that year, positioned around Manjača and Glamoč. Drenović had about 400 Chetniks under his command by the following year. His was the only Chetnik band that the Ustaše trusted fully during the war. According to BN Televizija, Drenović is considered a Chetnik vojvoda.|$|E
5|$|Nauendorf {{continued}} his raids, the soldiers foraged {{for food and}} dug up the local potato crop, and Joseph and Frederick glared at one another by Königgrätz. Maria Theresa had sent Kaunitz on a secret mission to Berlin to offer a truce. In a second trip, she offered a settlement, and finally wrote to Catherine in Russia to ask for assistance. When Joseph discovered his mother's maneuvering behind his back, he furiously offered to resign. His mother enlisted the assistance she needed. Catherine offered to mediate the dispute; if her assistance was unacceptable, {{she was willing to}} send fifty thousand troops to augment the Prussian force, {{despite the fact that she}} disliked Frederick and her alliance with him was strictly defensive. Frederick withdrew portions of his force in mid-September. In October, Joseph withdrew most of his army to the Bohemian border and Frederick withdrew his remaining troops into Prussia. Two small forces of hussars and dragoons remained in Bohemia to provide a winter cordon; these forces allowed Joseph and Frederick <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> eye on each other while their diplomats negotiated at Teschen.|$|E
