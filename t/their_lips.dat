5|$|In 2003, Scottish {{scientists}} at the University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with pain in other animals. Bee venom and acetic acid injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do. Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns.|$|E
5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E
5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for {{an equal amount of}} time.|$|E
25|$|When boys {{begin to}} show facial hair growth, they too undergo a puberty ritual, {{which is usually}} timed to {{coincide}} with a birth or female puberty ceremony. <b>Their</b> lower <b>lip</b> is perforated with a sharpened bone, and then a wooden labret is introduced. This adornment is worn only by younger men, but all men retain the perforation in <b>their</b> <b>lip</b> for life. After the lip-piercing ceremony, young men are cut and tattooed {{in the same fashion}} described for young women. The man who perforates <b>their</b> <b>lip</b> becomes a ritual godfather. Newly initiated young men usually accompany the ritual godfather for some time, often leaving their own nuclear families behind.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{they were}} known for <b>their</b> <b>lip</b> plates, an unusual {{form of body}} {{modification}} which they practiced. After marriage, Suyá men used to have <b>their</b> lower <b>lip</b> pierced, and have a small wooden disk placed inside. The size of the disk would be gradually increased as time went on, permanently changing {{the size of the}} lip.|$|R

5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult to read <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> through new face masks that obscured their mouths. Modell tried to help by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment, but none of it worked. Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, who came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E
25|$|Dholes produce {{whistles}} {{resembling the}} calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, {{though it is}} thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries. In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark. Dholes have a complex body language. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes pucker <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When afraid, they pull <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears flat against the skull.|$|E
25|$|Additional tests {{conducted}} {{at both the}} University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute, in which bee venom and acetic acid was injected into the lips of rainbow trout, resulted in fish rubbing <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers believe {{was an effort to}} relieve themselves of pain.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{women of}} the Mwera culture were known for <b>their</b> <b>lip</b> piercing, in which the upper lip was pierced in girlhood and {{gradually}} enlarged over time to hold various sizes of solid plugs. In this way they shared similarities with the neighboring Makonde people.|$|R

25|$|Boa constrictors {{can sense}} heat via cells in <b>their</b> <b>lips,</b> though {{they lack the}} labial pits {{surrounding}} these receptors seen in {{many members of the}} Boidae family. Boa constrictors also have two lungs, a smaller (nonfunctional) left and an enlarged (functional) right lung to better fit their elongated shape, unlike many colubrid snakes, which have completely lost the left lung.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the player}} of a brass {{instrument}} has direct {{control of the}} prime vibrator (the lips), brass instruments exploit the player's ability to select the harmonic at which the instrument's column of air vibrates. By making the instrument about {{twice as long as}} the equivalent woodwind instrument and starting with the second harmonic, players can get a good range of notes simply by varying the tension of <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> (see embouchure).|$|E
25|$|Groping is {{when the}} mouth {{searches}} for the position needed to create a sound. When this trial and error process occurs, sounds may be held out longer, repeated or silently voiced. In some cases, an AOS sufferer {{may be able to}} produce certain sounds on their own, easily and unconsciously, but when prompted by another to produce the same sound the patient may grope with <b>their</b> <b>lips,</b> using volitional control (conscious awareness of the attempted speech movements), while struggling to produce the sound.|$|E

25|$|Cochino (pig) {{is named}} after a pig’s head which is {{decorated}} and carried {{as part of the}} event. The head is decorated with flowers and rolls of colored paper, paper birds, rag dolls, and candies. The mouth holds a roll with the name of the person who well receive the head. The head is carried on a large, decorated platter by women who dance and smack <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> to indicate how delicious the animal is. This dance is generally performed in the Yucatan region.|$|E
25|$|In Milgram's {{first set}} of {{experiment}}s, 65 percent (26 of 40) of experiment participants administered the experiment's final massive 450-volt shock, though many were very uncomfortable doing so; at some point, every participant paused and questioned the experiment; some said they would refund the money they were paid for participating in the experiment. Throughout the experiment, subjects displayed varying degrees of tension and stress. Subjects were sweating, trembling, stuttering, biting <b>their</b> <b>lips,</b> groaning, digging their fingernails into their skin, and some were even having nervous laughing fits or seizures.|$|E
25|$|The new series, Supercar, (1960–61) {{was created}} by Anderson and Reg Hill and marked several {{important}} advances for APF. Sylvia Anderson took on a larger role and became {{a partner in the}} company. The series was also the official debut of Supermarionation, the electronic system that made the marionettes more lifelike and convincing on screen. The system used the audio signal from pre-recorded tapes of the actors' voices to trigger solenoids installed in the heads of the puppets, making <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> move in synchronisation with the voices of the actors, and actresses.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong quickly {{adapted to}} the more tightly {{controlled}} style of Henderson, playing trumpet and even experimenting with the trombone. The other members quickly took up Armstrong's emotional, expressive pulse. Soon his act included singing and telling tales of New Orleans characters, especially preachers. The Henderson Orchestra was playing in prominent venues for white-only patrons, including the famed Roseland Ballroom, featuring the arrangements of Don Redman. Duke Ellington's orchestra would go to Roseland to catch Armstrong's performances and young horn men around town {{tried in vain to}} outplay him, splitting <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> in their attempts.|$|E
25|$|Blackface was an {{important}} performance tradition in the American theater for roughly 100 years beginning around 1830. It quickly became popular elsewhere, particularly so in Britain, where the tradition lasted longer than in the U.S., occurring on primetime TV, most famously in The Black and White Minstrel Show, which ended in 1978, and in Are You Being Served?s Christmas specials in 1976 and finally in 1981. In both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. Early white performers in blackface used burnt cork and later greasepaint or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate <b>their</b> <b>lips,</b> often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. Later, black artists also performed in blackface.|$|E
500|$|Sheep are {{exclusively}} herbivorous mammals. Most breeds {{prefer to}} graze on grass and other short roughage, avoiding the taller woody {{parts of plants}} that goats readily consume. Both sheep and goats use <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> and tongues to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition. Sheep, however, graze well in monoculture pastures where most goats fare poorly.|$|E

500|$|A music video, co-directed by Neil Pollock and Jonathan Bekemeier, {{to promote}} the single shows the band playing its {{instruments}} through a distorted fish-eye lens, the camera variously panning horizontally across the performance space and vertically over the individual band members. Keeping {{in the spirit of}} the mimed performance, Francis and bassist Kim Deal open and shut their mouths in time with their prerecorded vocals, yet make no attempt to articulate <b>their</b> <b>lips</b> in synch with the words that they are supposed to be singing. Instead, they simply keep their mouths wide open with blank expressions for the duration of each verse. Francis stated that [...] "Water on the brain" [...] was the theme of the clip.|$|E
