The unusual corrugated design became a characteristic sight of the Spanish landscape in the years following. The Z-702 was the <b>tractor</b> <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> version of the Z-207, while the corresponding motorcoach, model named Z-407, featuring the V-6 engine located in the rear never passed the prototype stage.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to obtain an insight into various secondary braking systems for goods vehicles. Practical tests were carried out with a tractor- semi-trailer combination. The performance of various split braking systems as well as spring brake actuators are shown. With {{nearly all of the}} secondary braking systems it is possible to obtain sufficient deceleration to meet legal requirements for the braking path. The critical point however is lateral stability. The report concludes with recommendations for legal requirements concerning lateral stability both on dry and on wet road surfaces. It is concluded that: lateral stability must be obtained on both a dry and a wet road surface; <b>tractors</b> <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> should have a split braking system; and service brakes for motor vehicles and trailers (semi-trailers) should have a certain braking capacity in case a failure occurs (emergency braking capacity). As a solution it is proposed that the emergency braking capacity of the service brake shall be at least 50 % of the normal required capacity...|$|R

50|$|Wreckers {{based on}} the M35 truck were {{designated}} as the M60 and M108. Two <b>tractor</b> variants <b>for</b> towing <b>semi-trailers</b> were developed, the M48 and M275. The M48 featured a full-length wheelbase (identical to the M35 cargo), while the M275 featured a shorter wheelbase for reduced weight and greater maneuverability. However, due to the smaller size and lower power of the 2½-ton trucks, most heavier loads were handled by their respective 5-ton counterparts. As a result, few were produced.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) methodology <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> design. At present, many Chinese semi-trailer enterprises have low design level and their products {{often have a}} relatively short life-span. To solve this problem, {{it is necessary to}} integrate intelligent design process into semi-trailer design. Then a rapid design system <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> based on KBE is put forward. Combining with the UG development tools (KF, UDF, Part Family and Reuse Library), CBR (Case-Based Reasoning), parametric modeling and knowledge integration techniques, the rapid design system <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> is realized. The system provides appropriate suggestions and supports to promote working efficiency. Besides, it also achieves knowledge reuse and accumulation, improves the design quality and significantly reduces the design cycle...|$|R

40|$|Special reportThis {{report is}} part of a series {{evaluating}} the data reported to the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Earlier studies showed that reporting to the MCMIS Crash File was incomplete. This report examines factors that are associated with reporting rates for the state of Georgia. MCMIS Crash File records were matched to the Georgia Crash file to determine {{the nature and extent of}} underreporting. Overall, it appears that Georgia is reporting 68. 1 percent of crash involvements that should be reported to the MCMIS Crash file. Due to instructions in the Georgia Instruction Guide for filling out accident reports, it appears that buses and some other qualifying vehicles such as government and rental vehicles are not being reported. Based on vehicle type, the reporting rate is 73. 6 percent for all trucks and 3. 1 percent for buses. The reporting rate <b>for</b> <b>tractor</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> is 87. 6 percent, but the estimated rate for single unit trucks is 55. 4 percent. It also appears that many vehicles classified as panel trucks are not being reported even though GVWR for most of these vehicles exceeds 10, 000 pounds. Missing data percentages in the MCMIS Crash File are low for certain variables, but are high for certain others as noted. No vehicles are recorded as hazmat placarded vehicles in the MCMIS Crash file, yet 46 vehicles are coded with hazmat release...|$|R
