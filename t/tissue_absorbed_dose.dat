MATROSHKA consists of a contained human phantom upper torso, allowing the accommodation of dedicated radiation measurement devices. MATROSHKA is currently installed outside to the Russian Segment “ZVEZDA” of the International Space Station. It is designed as a “longduration, non-maintainable, space-exposed payload”. The objective of the MATROSHKA experiment {{is to determine the}} empirical relations between measurable <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> and the <b>tissue</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> in a realistic human phantom exposed to the concrete radiation field to be monitored. The radiation field during EVA is that of the free space environment modified only by the space suit. Since EVAs are a substantial fraction of the work-schedule in the space station scenario, such measurements have highest priority, especially in view of long term spaceflight endeavours in the frame of space exploration. Once the ratios for the <b>tissue</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> and surface <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> are known for a given radiation field around the human body, these values may be used in future exposures to determine the required <b>tissue</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> from measurements of surface <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses.</b> In addition, the objectives are to enlarge the still modest quantity of empirical data of the composition of the radiation field in space. This includes: the mapping of the radiation environment in space and its variation with time and orbital parameters (such as solar cycle, solar flare event, inclination and altitude) and the study of the modification of the radiation dose in space by mass shielding (e. g. attenuation, build up and/or activation).

Similarly, it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish noise spikes from genuine 90 Y activity. However, such indeterminate activity foci are usually too mild to result in any clinically relevant toxicity even if genuine, and therefore do not impact post-radioembolization management.

To assess radiological risks to tissue near the bone-soft tissue interface, a computer transport model for nuclear fragments produced by high energy nucleons was used in this study to calculate integral linear energy transfer spectra and dose equivalents resulting from nuclear collisions of 1 -GeV protons transversing bone and red bone marrow. In terms of dose equivalent averaged over trabecular bone marrow, target fragments emitted from interactions in both tissues are predicted to be at least as important as the direct ionization of the primary protons-twice as important, if recently recommended radiation weighting factors and "worst-case" geometry are used.

The effects induced by y radiation depend on the <b>tissue</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> and cell repair capacity. Apoptosis is a mode of cell death that results in the deletion of cells in a normal tissue. It also occurs naturally in some neoplasias. The process is induced by radiation and chemotherapic agents. The morphological features are: condensation and fragmentation of the nuclear chromatin and cell fragmentation, producing the apoptotic bodies. The biochemical analysis shows the DNA fragmentation in a ladder pattern. It {{has been shown that}} genes are involved in the induction {{as well as in the}} inhibition of apoptosis. It has also been shown that calcium is involved in the process of apoptosis depending on cell type. The interest in apoptosis has expanded since its importance in oncology was recognized. Indeed, the early tumor response to radiation and the high radiosensitivity of bone marrow are related to apoptosis. The a-tocopherol (Vitamin E) has been widely used due to its characteristical protection against oxidative stress in various biological systems. Vitamin E is known as a sinergetic antioxidant and it is used to protect the organisms from the effects of physical and chemical agents. Vitamin E restricts the propagation of the chain reaction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces a natural protection on biological membranes against radiation injuries that can lead the cells to death by reproductive falency and apoptosis. This work examined the effects of gamma radiation in the bone marrow cells using the a-tocopherol as a radioprotector. Mice (C 57 BU 10) were subdivided into 4 groups: GC (Control), GI (Irradiated), GC- 11 (Control+VitE), and GI- 11 (irradiated+VitE).

Reducing unnecessary carcinogenic risks from this source requires the determination of organ and <b>tissue</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to estimate detrimental stochastic effects. In addition, effective dose {{can be used to}} assess comparative risk between exposure situations and facilitate dose reduction through optimisation. Children are at the highest risk from radiation induced carcinogenesis and therefore dosimetry for paediatric CT recipients is essential in addressing the ionising radiation health risks of CT scanning. However, there is no well-defined method in the clinical environment for routinely and reliably performing paediatric CT organ dosimetry and there are numerous methods utilised for estimating paediatric CT effective dose.

However, 99 mTc MAA is an imperfect surrogate for 90 Y resin microspheres. Due to biophysical and technical differences such as particle size, specific gravity, injected particle load, microembolization, and catheter placement, 99 mTc MAA can never exactly replicate the post-radioembolization biodistribution of 90 Y resin microspheres [12, 17].

Traditionally based on planar scintigraphy [13, 14], modern predictive dosimetry employs SPECT/CT to tomographically assess the biodistribution of 99 mTc MAA and to improve its quantitative accuracy [6]. So far, the accuracy of 99 mTc MAA SPECT/CT predictive dosimetry has only been indirectly validated by inference from follow-up response [6, 18, 19]. For technically successful cases without visually significant discordant biodistribution between 99 mTc MAA and 90 Y resin microspheres, a direct ‘Gy-to-Gy’ comparison of intended doses by 99 mTc MAA SPECT/CT predictive dosimetry versus post-radioembolization doses by microsphere biodistribution analysis has not yet been performed to date.|$|R

40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} primarily perturbs {{the basic}} molecular level proportional to dose, with potential damage propagation to higher levels: cells, tissues, organs, and whole body. There are {{three types of}} defenses against damage propagation. These operate deterministically and below a certain impact threshold there is no propagation. Physical-static defenses precede metabolic-dynamic defenses acting immediately: scavenging of toxins; - molecular repair, especially of DNA; - removal of damaged cells either by apoptosis, necrosis, phagocytosis, cell differentiation-senescence, or by immune responses, - followed by replacement of lost elements. Another metabolic-dynamic defense arises delayed by up-regulating immediately operating defense mechanisms. Some of these adaptive protections may last beyond a year and all create temporary protection against renewed potentially toxic impacts also from non-radiogenic endogenous sources. Adaptive protections have a maximum after single <b>tissue</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> around 100 to 200 mSv and disappear with higher doses. Low dose rates initiate maximum protection likely at lower cell doses delivered repetitively at certain time intervals.

All doses were normalized to the initial activity concentration of the infused therapy solution. Results: The urinary bladder, thyroid, and kidneys (1. 9, 1. 8, and 1. 7 mGy per MBq/L) received the 3 highest estimated <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses.</b> When the tissue- weighting factors were applied, the largest contributors to the effective dose were the lungs, stomach, and urinary bladder. Using 100 MBq/L, organ equivalent doses were less than 10 % of the estimated tolerance dose. Conclusion: Intraperitoneal At- 211 -MX 35 F(ab') 2 treatment is potentially a well-tolerated therapy for locally confined microscopic ovarian cancer. <b>Absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to normal organs are low, but because the effective dose potentially corresponds to a risk of treatment-induced carcinogenesis, optimization may still be valuable.

30|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that DNA damage response pathways and cell cycle progression are under circadian control [31 – 33]. Moreover, {{a significant difference in}} mRNA levels of DNA damage inducible genes in mouse blood and bone marrow was demonstrated between diurnal and nocturnal irradiation with 0.5  Gy X-ray in vivo [34]. In the present study, enriched biological processes did not show responses for DNA damage and repair for chromatin organization. A (very) low <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> level is not expected to result in up-regulation of the DNA damage recognition and repair machinery on the transcriptional level. While this was the case for the non-thyroid <b>tissues,</b> an <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of 5.9  Gy in thyroid tissue may result in transcriptional regulation of DNA damage and repair-related genes. However, no responses were detected in maintenance of DNA integrity in thyroid tissue. This may be explained, in part, by continuous low-dose-rate irradiation which may not suffice to induce an acute damage and repair response; in general, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of 5.9  Gy over 24  h constituted a (very) low-dose rate of a few mGy per minute, although {{it should be noted that}} the dose rate of 131 I in thyroid varies over time [20]. Another factor influencing detection of DNA damage and repair-related processes may be convolution of hit vs. non-hit cells (and multi-hit cells) in microarray data. Individual cells that were subjected to a sufficiently high damage burden may induce transcriptional regulation of respective genes, but the expression changes may be masked in the mixed (homogenized) cell population. Nevertheless, analysis of DNA damage and repair responses to ionizing radiation exposure, specifically in longitudinal studies, should consider differences in response with regard to time-of-irradiation and, if possible, account for circadian oscillation in the experimental design.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} radionuclides on non-human biota and the environment, {{it is essential to}} study the intake and metabolism of radio-isotopes in earthworms which are among the most important soil organisms, and Eisenia fetida, which were used in this study, are known to be sufficiently sensitive to chemicals and representative of common earthworms. In this study, we assessed the concentration ratios, uptake and retention, <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate, and distribution of radio-caesium in earthworms. The concentration ratios of (137) Cs (i. e., the concentrations of radio-caesium in earthworms relative to those in dry soil) were higher early in the culturing period and decreased gradually over the experimental period. (137) Cs taken up by E.  fetida was cleared rapidly after the worms were cultured in radio-caesium-free soil, suggesting that the metabolism of radio-caesium in earthworms is very rapid. Autoradiography demonstrated that the concentration of radio-caesium within the digestive tract was as high as that in the soil, while radio-caesium in the body tissue was lower than radio-caesium in the soil and was almost uniformly distributed among earthworm <b>tissues.</b> The highest <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate of total exposure to radio-caesium ((137) Cs + (134) Cs) was calculated to be 1. 9  ×  10 (3) (μGy/day) in the earthworms...|$|R
40|$|The radiohalogens 123 I, 124 I, 125 I, 131 I, and 211 At are {{routinely}} used or proposed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The different characteristics and application areas of these radioiodine isotopes, {{together with the}} possibility to bind them to the same carrier molecule, give many advantages, for example, by enabling relevant biodistribution and dosimetric studies important for dose-planning before radionuclide therapy. 211 At, with its relatively long half-life, stable daughter nuclide, and production and labelling possibilities is considered {{as one of the}} most attractive alpha particle emitters in radionuclide therapy. With growing use of radiohalogens in both preclinical and clinical studies there is a need for accurate species-specific dosimetric models both for tumours and normal tissues. The thyroid gland has shown a high uptake of radioiodide and free 211 At and is, therefore, considered as an organ at risk. It is thus critical to be able to accurately calculate the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> in the thyroid. Accurate dosimetry is also important for radiation protection purposes for personnel handling radiohalogens and for populations exposed to radioiodine, e. g., at a nuclear accident. The MIRD formalism is commonly used for calculating the mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> assuming a homogeneous distribution of the radionuclide within the thyroid gland. Several studies have shown heterogeneous distribution of radioiodine and 211 At within the thyroid gland. In this work, geometrical models were developed for different species: man, rat and mouse. Microdosimetric calculations for heterogeneous distributions of the different radiohalogens in these thyroid models were performed using MCNPX Monte Carlo code and recent nuclear decay data. The results showed large differences in mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> compared with MIRD formalism. The heterogeneity in <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> within the thyroid depends on the type and energy of the emitted particles. For example, 131 I emits high-energy beta particles with range up to 2 mm in <b>tissue,</b> where the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution within the thyroid is less dependent on the radionuclide distribution. On the other hand, for 211 At emitting alpha particles with short range in tissue (48 - 70 μm), and for 125 I emitting Auger electrons with very short range in tissue (from a fraction of a nm up to 20 μm), the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution will be more dependent on the radiohalogen distribution. The results also demonstrate the importance of using species-specific models for dosimetric calculations for thyroid and other heterogeneous tissues, enabling dosimetric translations between different species...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine whether electron-beam irradiation would affect shear values, yield, odor, and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values of chicken tissues. Broiler breasts (pectoralis superficialis) and whole thighs were irradiated with an electron-beam accelerator at levels to produce adsorbed doses of 100, 200, and 300 krads {{on the surface of}} the sample. The thigh samples were stored for 2, 4, and 8 days before testing for TBA values. The depth to which the radiation had penetrated the pectoralis superficialis muscle was also determined. Radiation penetrated 22 mm into slices of pectoralis superficialis muscle when 100 krad was absorbed by the surface of the <b>tissue.</b> The <b>dose</b> <b>absorbed</b> beneath the <b>tissue</b> surface to a depth of 10 mm was larger than the <b>dose</b> <b>absorbed</b> at the surface. The <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> decreased as the depth of penetration increased. For cooked breast tissue, the shear values and moisture content were not affected by the absorbed radiation. Cooking losses of aged breast tissue were not affected by irradiation, but cooking losses were reduced in breast tissue that had not been aged. Irradiating uncooked thigh and uncooked breast samples produced a characteristic odor that remained after the thighs were cooked but was not detectable after the breast samples were cooked. With two exceptions, no significantly different TBA values were found that could be attributed to irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Delivering {{maximum dose}} to tumor and minimum dose to normal tissues {{is the most}} {{important}} goal in radiotherapy. According to ICRU, the maximum acceptable uncertainty in the delivered dose compared to the prescribed dose should be lower than 5 %, and this is because of the relationship between <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> tumor control and normal <b>tissue</b> damage. <b>Absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> accuracy is investigated by an in vivo dosimetry method. In this paper, we compared <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> in the tumors of the breast and pelvic region against the calculated dose. The amount of deviations and the factors that cause this deviation in dose delivery to patients and some methods for decreasing them were evaluated. Materials and methods: The entrance and exit doses of 36 pelvic-region cancer patients and 38 breast cancer patients who were treated by cobalt- 60 teletherapy were measured using p-type diodes. It {{should be noted that the}} transmission method was used to assess the dose at isocenter. Two ionization chambers (0. 6 cc and 0. 3 cc) were used for calibration and determination of the correction coefficients in water and slab phantoms. Deviations between calculated and measured doses of entrance, exit and midline points were calculated and the results were shown using histograms. Results: The average and standard deviation for entrance, exit and midline points for pelvis cancer were assessed to be about 0. 10 %, - 1. 86 % and - 1. 35 % for mean deviation and 5. 03 %, 7. 32 % and 5. 86 % for standard deviation, respectively. The corresponding data for breast cancer were 0. 78 %, 5. 29 % and 3. 59 % for mean deviation and 5. 97 %, 10. 23 % and 9. 86 %, respectively. There was no significant difference between the calculated and measured doses (p > 0. 1), except exit dose in breast cancer (p < 0. 05). The temperature and angle of incidence correction factors were neglected due to their less than 1 % deviations. Discussion and Conclusions: Some error sources are patient setup error, patient motion and dose calculation algorithm error (due to ignoring inhomogeneity and patient curvature). As no significant deviations were found in midline dose, the method used has an acceptable accuracy. In vivo dosimetry can perform a basic role in the quality control of radiotherapy departments...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the field}} of the {{treatment}} of brain toumors by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, the dose amounts of the neutron components and gamma, and also treatment conditions for a brain tumor out of the head phantom center were simulated. The objectives {{of this study were}} to calculate the effective dose and the received dose in a head phantom and determine the duration of treatment, according to the extent permitted by the ICRP commission. Materials and Methods: In this research, a human head phantom in front of a neutron system (including 252 Cf source, moderator, refelector and neutron and photon filters) was simulated. A spherical-shaped tumor was considered outside of the phantom center. The head phantom consists of three parts of the skin, skull and brain. The simulation was done by the MCNPX 2. 6. 0 computational code. In this simulation, the tumor with a radius of 1. 5 cm at a depth of 2 cm inside the brain was considered. Results: Tumor treatment was investigated with different boron concentrations in the head phantom. The maximum dose is approximately 0. 055 Sv/hr, and is related to the conditions that Boron is not <b>absorbed</b> in healthy <b>tissue.</b> The <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> amount of the epithermal neutrons, under the conditions that Boron is not <b>absorbed</b> in healthy <b>tissue,</b> at the entrance of the skull and in brain tissue extremily drops, and gradually decreases. Conclusion: The calculations showed when a patient receives radiation about 5 minutes, the received dose equals approximately 4. 6 mSv. Under these treatment conditions, the whole body equivalent dose  does not exceed 5 mSv per year...|$|R
