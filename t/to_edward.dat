5|$|Even {{though as}} many as {{fourteen}} claimants put forward their claims to the title, the real contest was between John Balliol and Robert de Brus. The Scottish magnates made a request <b>to</b> <b>Edward</b> to conduct the proceedings and administer the outcome, but not to arbitrate in the dispute. The actual decision would be made by 104 auditors - 40 appointed by Balliol, 40 by Bruce and the remaining 24 selected by Edward I from {{senior members of the}} Scottish political community. At Birgham, with the prospect of a personal union between the two realms, the question of suzerainty had not been of great importance <b>to</b> <b>Edward.</b> Now he insisted that, if he were to settle the contest, he had to be fully recognised as Scotland's feudal overlord. The Scots were reluctant to make such a concession, and replied that since the country had no king, no one had the authority to make this decision. This problem was circumvented when the competitors agreed that the realm would be handed over <b>to</b> <b>Edward</b> until a rightful heir had been found. After a lengthy hearing, a decision was made in favour of John Balliol on 17November 1292.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy and {{his troops}} were again summoned into the King's service to retake Berwick in 1319, after Scottish forces {{had taken it}} a year earlier. The {{majority}} of the forces from Wales came from the southern Marcher Lords, but Goronwy, Gruffudd Llwyd and Hywel ap Gruffudd ap Geruath led those from {{the northern part of}} the country. Around the same time, as a yeoman of the king, Goronwy was made forester of Snowdon. He remained loyal <b>to</b> <b>Edward</b> II, but following the king's death, he resumed service <b>to</b> <b>Edward</b> III.|$|E
5|$|Jealous of Kim's {{attraction}} <b>to</b> <b>Edward,</b> Jim suggests Edward {{pick the}} lock on his parents' home to obtain a van for Jim and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that his period of isolation has left Edward without any sense of reality or common sense. Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he did it because she asked him <b>to.</b> <b>Edward</b> is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.|$|E

After the revolt failed, Tudur was among those lords from North Wales who pledged their loyalty <b>to</b> <b>Edward</b> in person in 1296, and again <b>to</b> <b>Edward</b> of Caernarfon when he was invested as Prince of Wales in 1301.|$|E

5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{succession}} <b>to</b> <b>Edward</b> led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy. The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{was less}} {{successful}} in Gascony, which was overrun by the French. With his resources depleting, Edward {{was forced to}} reconfirm the Charters, including Magna Carta, to obtain the necessary funds. In 1303 the French king restored Gascony <b>to</b> <b>Edward</b> by signing the Treaty of Paris. Meanwhile, William Wallace rose in Balliol's name and recovered most of Scotland.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{relations}} between Edward and Llywelyn rapidly collapsed, leading <b>to</b> <b>Edward</b> invading North Wales in 1276 {{in an attempt}} to break Llywelyn's hold on power. During the war Edward built several major castles in order to better control the region and act as bases for campaigning. Edward was successful, and the Treaty of Aberconwy in 1277 reaffirmed English dominance, dividing up most of Llwelyn's lands amongst his brothers and Edward.|$|E
