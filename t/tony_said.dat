Cohen said that Smith has [...] "matured as an artist since the first album" [...] {{and that he had}} [...] "no doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances". Smith's father, <b>Tony,</b> <b>said</b> that the bosses at universal were hoping for the album to be more commercially successful than Faryl, but noted that the market around Christmas time is tough, due to the high volume of releases. Brian Roberts, writing for the Daily Mirror, claimed that Wonderland was [...] "tipped to go head to head" [...] for the number one classical album position with releases from Il Divo and Rhydian Roberts.|$|E
2500|$|Go-Set was {{a weekly}} pop music {{newspaper}} started in February 1966 by Phillip Frazer, Tony Schauble and their Monash University mates. Meldrum started {{writing for the}} paper in July that year after befriending its editor, Frazer. Frazer said [...] "As I recall it, Ian was sweeping the floor... I said to , 'Who's this guy? Where'd he come from?' and <b>Tony</b> <b>said,</b> 'I dunno, he just came in and wanted to do something.'" [...] Meldrum's first story was on Burns, [...] "Ronnie Meets the Barrett Brothers". His first printed interview was with Johnny Young, a singer-songwriter from Perth. Soon Meldrum was writing a weekly gossip column and regular feature stories. He continued until the paper folded in August 1974. By social networking and building a list of industry contacts, Meldrum was able to cover many facets of the local scene; his gossip columns informed not only general readers but also other musicians and, according to Frazer, they were the major reason people continued reading Go-Set.|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn and Clark {{said they}} could {{continue}} to play together, but Clark signed with the Boston Red Sox {{as a free agent}} in the offseason. Gwynn felt appreciated after he was signed to a three-year contract extension for $12.25 million, including a $1 million signing bonus. McKeon praised Gwynn, saying, [...] "He's one of the most unselfish players I've ever managed. In '89, when he was going for a batting title, he was giving himself up to move runners along." [...] Dick Williams, who managed Gwynn from 1982 through 1985, said of Gwynn, [...] "I don't think I've ever had a player who worked harder, cared more and was more deserving of his awards." [...] Clark continued to criticize him, which Gwynn attributed to jealousy. Gwynn responded with his own criticism of Clark: [...] "Let's talk about him walking 104 times, being a No. 4 hitter. Let's talk about his not flying on team flights. Let's talk about him getting booted out of games on a called strike three." [...] In 1992, Gwynn sympathized with Clark, who filed for bankruptcy after bad loans by his agent. [...] "I really appreciated the things <b>Tony</b> <b>said</b> about my situation", Clark said.|$|E

60|$|<b>Tony</b> <b>said</b> nothing. He {{was staring}} across {{the rows of}} heads and {{watching}} the girl. She appeared older, bolder, and harder than Lucy Davidson had done, but the likeness was still unpleasantly suggestive. She danced well, {{but it was not}} the graceful posing or the swift folding and flowing of light draperies that held Tony’s attention. His eyes were fixed upon the smiling face, and he scarcely heard the thunder of applause or Mrs. Wayne’s voice in the silence that followed it.|$|E
6000|$|And {{now there}} was a {{beautiful}} race in between the two mares; and oh! how charmingly both were ridden! But though Miss Fidget was so favoured in weight, and had begun with the lead, her elder rival collared her, and beat her at the post by a head. [...] "And why shouldn't she win?" [...] as <b>Tony</b> <b>said</b> in triumph to his friends, [...] "for hadn't she the dhrop in her? wasn't she by Coriander, out of Pink, by Highflyer? Of course she'd win--hadn't he known it all the time?" ...|$|E
60|$|Occasionally Tony and Dinah met. Dan {{would come}} up {{late in the evening}} to the house, and a nod to Dinah would be {{sufficient}} to send her flying down the garden to a clump of shrubs, where he would be waiting for her. At these stolen meetings they were perfectly happy; for <b>Tony</b> <b>said</b> no word to her of the misery of his life--how he was always put to the hardest work and beaten on the smallest pretext, how in fact his life was made so unendurable that the idea of running away and taking to the swamps was constantly present to him.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{would be}} his run of course," [...] said Hampton, who was {{generally}} up to Tony's wiles, but who was now {{as much in the}} dark as others. Then four or five rode up to the huntsman and told him that the fox had been seen heading for the gorse. <b>Tony</b> <b>said</b> not a word but bit his lips and scratched his head and bethought himself what fools men might be even though they did ride well to hounds. One word of explanation would have settled it all, but he would not speak that word till he whispered it to Captain Glomax.|$|E
6000|$|... "So he was, sah, so he was," [...] <b>Tony</b> <b>said</b> thoughtfully. [...] "Yes, it {{does seem}} as if all dese tings came on kinder one after de oder, just out ob dat {{flogging}} he gabe me: {{and now he has}} got killed for just de same cause, for if he hadn't been obliged to turn Unionist he wouldn't have been in dat dar battery at de time you came dere. Yes, I sees dat is so, sah; and I'se glad now I didn't hab a chance ob shooting him down, for I should have done so for suah, ef I had." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Tony</b> <b>said</b> nothing. He {{could think}} of no excuse, but remembering what Violet had {{mentioned}} he shrank from the encounter. The good‐natured committee‐man’s meaning had been perfectly plain to him, and he knew that he could save the girl the unpleasantness of being met with chilly aloofness or undue familiarity. His disposition was also a kindly one, and the decision that she must be left to fight her own battles caused him a little flush of confusion. As it happened, she saw it, and a portentous sparkle showed in her dark eyes. Tony noticed this, and remembered that weak complaisance had once placed him under the thumb of keeper Davidson. He did not mean to repeat the blunder, and his fears made him slightly venomous.|$|E
