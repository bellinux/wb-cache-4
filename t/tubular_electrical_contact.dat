40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> {{are usually}} plated {{in order to}} prevent corrosion. Platings of {{detachable}} <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> experience wear because of the motion between contacts. Once the protecting platings have been worn out, <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> will fail rapidly due to corrosion or fretting corrosion. Therefore the wear resistance of the platings is a very important parameter for the long lifetime of <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts.</b> Many measures which improve the wear resistance can diminish the conductivity of the platings. Due to the fact that platings of <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> must have both a high wear resistance and a high electrical conductivity, the manufacturing of high performance platings of <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> poses a great challenge. Our study shows firstly the correlation between the wear resistance of platings and lifetime of <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> and then the measures, which improve the wear resistance without impairing the electrical performance of the contacts...|$|R

5000|$|Macroscopically {{smooth and}} clean {{surfaces}} are microscopically rough and, in air, contaminated with oxides, adsorbed water vapor, and atmospheric contaminants. When two metal <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts</b> touch, the actual metal-to-metal contact area is {{small compared to}} the total contact-to-contact area physically touching. In <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> theory, the relatively small area where electrical current flows between two contacts is called the a-spot where [...] "a" [...] stands for asperity. If the small a-spot is treated as a circular area and the resistivity of the metal is homogeneous, then the current and voltage in the metal conductor has spherical symmetry and a simple calculation can relate {{the size of the}} a-spot to the resistance of the <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> interface. If there is metal-to-metal <b>contact</b> between <b>electrical</b> <b>contacts,</b> then the <b>electrical</b> <b>contact</b> resistance (as opposed to the bulk resistance of the contact metal) is mostly due to constriction of the current through a very small area, the a-spot.

When the size of contacting asperities becomes larger than the mean free path of electrons, Holm-type contacts become the dominant transport mechanism, resulting in a relative low contact resistance.|$|R
