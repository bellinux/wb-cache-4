5|$|Like other jays, {{this species}} is likely {{extremely}} intelligent. Similar species {{are known to}} use ants to keep their feathers clean, store seeds and nuts for later consumption, and use their <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> hold food. However, due to its secretive nature, these characteristics {{have not yet been}} observed in the species.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E

5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American {{goldfinch}} {{uses its}} feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems of high-heeled shoe design involves a properly constructed toe-box. Improper construction here can cause the most damage to one's foot. Toe-boxes that are too narrow force the <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> be crammed too close together. Ensuring that room exists for the <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> assume a normal separation so that high-heel wear remains an option rather than a debilitating practice is an important issue in improving the wearability of high-heeled fashion shoes.|$|E

25|$|Leprosy {{is mostly}} a granulomatous disease of the {{peripheral}} nerves and mucosa of the upper respiratory tract; skin lesions (light or dark patches) are the primary external sign. If untreated, leprosy can progress and cause permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes. Secondary infections, in turn, can result in tissue loss, causing fingers and <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> become shortened and deformed, as cartilage is absorbed into the body.|$|E
25|$|Sensory neurons {{can have}} axons that {{run from the}} <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> the {{posterior}} column of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults. Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along {{the entire length of}} their necks. Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon, an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5–1 millimeters thick, several centimeters long).|$|E
25|$|The leg {{arrangement}} of passerine birds contains a special adaptation for perching. A tendon {{in the rear}} of the leg running from the underside of the <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> the muscle behind the tibiotarsus will automatically be pulled and tighten when the leg bends, causing the foot to curl and become stiff when the bird lands on a branch. This enables passerines to sleep while perching without falling off. This is especially useful for passerine birds that develop nocturnal lifestyles.|$|E

25|$|The {{birth of}} the modern pointe shoe is often {{attributed}} to the early 20th-century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, {{who was one of}} the most famous and influential dancers of her time. Pavlova had particularly high, arched insteps, which left her vulnerable to injury when dancing en pointe. She also had slender, tapered feet, which resulted in excessive pressure on her big <b>toes.</b> <b>To</b> compensate for this, she inserted toughened leather soles into her shoes for extra support and flattened and hardened the toe area to form a box.|$|E
25|$|Abu Dhabi {{worked in}} the pearl {{business}} and traded with others. According to a source about pearling, the Persian Gulf was the best location for pearls. Pearl divers dove for one to one-and-a-half minutes, and would have dived up to thirty times per day. There were no air tanks and any other sort of mechanical device was forbidden. The divers had a leather nose clip and leather coverings on their fingers and big <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> protect them while they searched for oysters. The divers were not paid for a day’s work but received {{a portion of the}} season’s earnings.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{technique}} {{is also evident}} from a dancer's body alignment, by visualizing a straight line that extends {{from the center of}} the hip through the toes. When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and big toe joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and the joints of the second toe or middle toe or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> achieve proper alignment.|$|E

25|$|Since October 2012, the Mara-Meru Cheetah Project (http://marameru.org/en/) {{is working}} in the Mara {{monitoring}} cheetah population, estimating population status and dynamics, and evaluating the predator impact and human activity on cheetah behavior and survival. The head of the Project, Dr. Elena Chelysheva, was working in 2001-2002 as Assistant Researcher at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) Maasai-Mara Cheetah Conservation Project. At that time, she developed original method of cheetah identification based on visual analysis of the unique spot patterns on front limbs (from <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> shoulder) and hind limbs (from <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> the hip), and spots and rings on the tail (Cat News #41, 2004 http://www.catsg.org/cheetah/01_information/1_3_periodical-reports/cat-news/cat-news.htm). Collected over the years, photographic data allows the Project team tracing kinship between generations and building Mara Cheetah Pedigree. The data collected helps to reveal parental relationship between individuals, survival rate of cubs, cheetah lifespan and personal reproductive history. This work has {{never been done before}} and the team is sharing results with the Mara stakeholders and respondents. The ongoing research is a follow-up study, which will compare results with the previous one in terms of cheetah population status and effect of human activity on cheetah behavior and surviving. The project {{is working in}} affiliation with Kenya Wildlife Service, Narok and Transmara County Councils and with assistance of Coordinator of Maasai-Mara Cultural Village Tour Association (MMCVTA). The team is cooperating with Mara Hyena Project and working with managers and driver-guides from over 30 different Mara camps and lodges. Rangers and driver/guides are trained cheetah identification techniques and provided with Catalogues of the Mara cheetahs.|$|E
25|$|Women {{began to}} dance ballet in 1681, {{twenty years after}} King Louis XIV of France ordered the {{founding}} of the Académie Royale de Danse. At that time, the standard women's ballet shoe had heels. Mid-18th century dancer Marie Camargo of the Paris Opéra Ballet was the first to wear a non-heeled shoe, enabling her to perform leaps that would have been difficult, if not impossible, in the more conventional shoes of the age. After the French Revolution, heels were completely eliminated from standard ballet shoes. These flat-bottomed predecessors of the modern pointe shoe were secured to the feet by ribbons and incorporated pleats under the <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> enable dancers to leap, execute turns, and fully extend their feet.|$|E
25|$|If the {{infection}} in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; although, this {{was seen as a}} benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.|$|E
