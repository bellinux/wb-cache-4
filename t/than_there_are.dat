Kurt admits that he contemplated cheating, but decided against doing so. Nevertheless, Kurt is disqualified and Brittany wins the election. Kurt tells Finn and Rachel that he is still under suspicion, and after he leaves, Rachel admits to Finn {{that she was the}} one who stuffed the ballot box because she wanted to help Kurt.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significantly}} fewer bughouse openings <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> chess openings. Many chess openings create weaknesses {{which can be}} easily exploited in bughouse. It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns. Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available {{after the first few}} moves and it is important to develop at this stage as there is often not enough time to do so later. Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> in the wild.|$|E

40|$|This {{collection}} of poems deals largely {{with the body}} moving through everyday spaces, in cities and in nature. ??????[I]t is not easy/ to see the ordinary,??? says one poem. Various states of consciousness are explored; limbo, hell, purgatory, heaven, etc [...] . To my mind, the first stanza of the third section in Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself' {{is perhaps the most}} useful annotation any "serious artist" could use to preface his or her work. I quote it here: "I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end/ But I do not talk of the beginning or the end. / <b>There</b> <b>was</b> never any more inception <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> now,/ Nor any more youth or age <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> now,/ And will never be any more perfection <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> now,/ Nor any more heaven or hell <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> now. " The poems before you work without striving for such an end, to continue the process of becoming more awake to the present. It is a place where we all live...|$|R
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of biological entity in aquatic environments– there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within {{a short amount of}} time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, {{in the case of the}} T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes than female ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming {{that there are more}} opportunities for men to win at the highest level <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E

25|$|Based {{on a study}} {{released}} by Dallas Women's Foundation, sex trafficking of young girls {{is not an isolated}} phenomenon, but a widespread criminal activity in Texas. The research found that 740 girls under age 18 were documented being marketed for sex during a 30-day period in Texas, of whom 712 of these girls were being marketed through Internet classified web sites and 28 were being marketed through escort services. More information concluded from the research is that there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> women killed in domestic violence with former or current husbands, intimate partners or boyfriends in Texas over an entire year. There are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> females of all ages who died from complication due to AIDS in one year in Texas. And finally, there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> teen girls who died by suicide, homicide, and accidents in the state in one year.|$|E

25|$|Characters U+0800 through U+FFFF use three bytes in UTF-8, {{but only}} two in UTF-16.

This is possible when data mainly consist of pure prose, but is lessened by {{the degree to which the}} context uses ASCII whitespace, digits, and punctuation.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of Cantor's result {{will depend upon}} one's view of mathematics. To constructivists, the argument shows {{no more than that}} there is no bijection between the natural numbers and T. It does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the latter are subcountable. In the context of classical mathematics, this is impossible, and the diagonal argument establishes that, although both sets are infinite, there are actually more infinite sequences of ones and zeros <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> natural numbers.|$|E

A few reserves exist within cities, such as the Opawikoscikan Reserve in Prince Albert, Wendake in Quebec City or Stony Plain 135 in the Edmonton Capital Region. There are more reserves in Canada <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> First Nations, as First Nations were ceded multiple reserves by treaty.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, Amrum {{still had}} a {{considerably}} lower population than today. Church records from 1821 to 1833 show an average population of 587, a census in 1860 noted 642 inhabitants, and in 1871, the population had dropped to 571. Among other factors, the decrease owed {{to the fact that}} large parts of Amrum's population had emigrated — mainly to the United States. Today, more people with ancestors from Amrum live in the United States <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> on Amrum proper, and the connections between Amrum and the U.S. are still being cultivated.|$|E
25|$|When declaring a function, a {{programmer}} can specify {{for one or}} more parameters a default value. Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, {{in which case the}} default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters {{at the end of the}} parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.|$|E

Some high profile programs were among those twenty-four teams, with Penn State and Miami being two of them.
