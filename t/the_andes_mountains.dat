40|$|Plants {{belonging}} to Arcytophyllum genus are widespread in Central and South America mainly in Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia [1]. Aerial parts infusion and/or decoction {{are used in}} traditional medicine {{for the treatment of}} colic and indigestion [2]. Only one study was previously reported in the literature, showing the presence of flavonoids and triterpenoids from Arcytophyllum genus [3]. A. thymifolium (Ruiz & PAV) Standl (Rubiaceae) is a shrub growing in Ecuador in <b>the</b> typical <b>Ande</b> <b>mountain</b> ecosystem [1]. In the present study, a phytochemical investigation of A. thymifolium aerial parts was performed for the first time. The dried and powdered plant material was sequentially extracted with n-hexane, CHCl 3, CHCl 3 -MeOH (9 : 1) and MeOH. The CHCl 3 extract was first subjected to a flash chromatography through Biotage Isolera™, and fractions obtained were successively eluted on RP-HPLC and HPCPC. The MeOH extract was partitioned between n-BuOH and H 2 O and the n-BuOH fraction was preliminary chromatographed on Sephadex LH- 20 column, subsequently, fractions obtained were submitted to RP-HPLC. Twenty-three compounds (8 coumarins, 4 flavonoids, 9 iridoids, 2 caffeic acid derivatives), including five new secondary metabolites, were finally isolated and identified by NMR and MS analyses. The hypoglycaemic properties of known and new compounds were also evaluated measuring extracts and pure compounds α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory effects, by using acarbose as positive control [4]. The iridoid asperulosidic acid showed the higher activity as α-amylase inhibitor, having an IC 50 of 70 μM, moderately higher than acarbose (IC 50 26. 3 µM), while the new flavanone 7 -O-(3 -metylbut- 2 -enyl) oxy eriodictyol resulted to be the most active as α-glucosidase inhibitor with an IC 50 of 30 μM, sensibly lower than acarbose (IC 50 402. 7 µM). A molecular docking study is in progress to gain information on β-glucosidase- 7 -O-(3 -metylbut- 2 -enyl) oxy eriodictyol interaction...|$|R

S.fatalis also entered western South America in the late Pleistocene, and the two species were therefore divided by <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> <b>mountains.</b> The American interchange resulted in a mix of native and invasive species sharing the prairies and woodlands in South America; North American herbivores included proboscideans, horses, camelids and deer, South American herbivores included toxodonts, litopterns, ground sloths, and glyptodonts. Native metatherian predators (including the saber-toothed thylacosmilids) had gone extinct by the Pliocene, and were replaced by North American carnivores such as canids, bears, and large cats.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> <b>Mountains</b> highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant (Anairetes parulus) is {{a species}} of bird in the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae. This species is found in western South America; its range {{stretches}} from southern Colombia south along <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> <b>mountains</b> to Tierra del Fuego. It prefers to live in upper montane forests and shrublands; however, it is a habitat generalist {{and can be found}} across a wide range of ecosystems. The tufted tit-tyrant has three subspecies, including the nominate subspecies Anairetes parulus parulus, A. p. aequatorialis, and A. p. patagonicus, and is very closely related to the Juan Fernández tit-tyrant. It is very small with a distinctive and conspicuous crest. The bird's head is black overall with white supraloral and postocular stripes. Its dull grayish-brown back contrasts with its white throat and breast that are covered with black streaks and pale, unmarked yellow underbelly. There are few noticeable differences in plumage between the subspecies. It is a vocal flycatcher with a broad repertoire of songs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Averaged n-Dependence Estimators (AnDE) is {{a family}} of {{learning}} algorithms that range from low variance coupled with high bias through to high variance coupled with low bias. The asymptotic error of the lowest bias variant is the Bayes optimal. <b>The</b> <b>AnDE</b> family of algorithms have a training time that is linear {{with respect to the}} training examples, learn in a single pass through the data, support incremental learning, handle missing values directly and are robust in the face of noise. These characteristics make the algorithms particularly well suited to learning from large data. However, for higher orders of n they are very computationally demanding. This paper presents data structures and algorithms developed to reduce both memory and time for training and classification. These enhancements have enabled the evaluation and comparison of A 3 DE’s effectiveness. The results provide further support for the hypothesis that as the number of training examples increases, decreasing error will be attained by members of <b>the</b> <b>AnDE</b> family with increasing levels of n...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We review {{available}} data {{on drug use}} {{with respect to the}} spread of HIV/AIDS in South America and the Caribbean.

The Caribbean and <b>the</b> <b>Ande</b> an regions are thus far spared from extensive diffusion of injecting drugs and its consequences. However, the se regions are now experiencing a significant transition, in terms of an increasing role of crack cocaine in the Caribbean HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the recent introduction of he roin and initiation of drug injection in <b>the</b> <b>Ande</b> an region.

40|$|The Atmospheric Neutral Density Experiment (ANDE) Risk Reduction {{flight is}} a mission {{proposed}} by the Naval Research Laboratory to monitor the thermospheric neutral density {{at an altitude of}} 400 km. The primary mission objective is to test the deployment mechanism from the Shuttle for <b>the</b> <b>ANDE</b> flight in late 2005. Scientific objectives of <b>the</b> <b>ANDE</b> risk reduction flight include; monitor total neutral density along the orbit for improved orbit determination of resident space objects, monitor the spin rate and orientation of the spacecraft, provide a test object for polarimetry studies using the HI-CLASS system. The mission consists of two spherical spacecraft fitted with retro-reflectors for satellite laser ranging (SLR). Each spacecraft contains a small light-weight payload designed to determine the spin rate and orientation of the spacecraft from on-orbit measurements and from ground based observations. A unique design requirement of one satellite is to telemeter the data to the ground without external protrusions from the spherical spacecraft (i. e. an antenna). This satellite will carry a communications system developed by the USNA that uses two aluminum hemispheres as the ends of a dipole antenna, at amateur radio frequencies [...] This system will act as a backup communications platform in <b>the</b> full <b>ANDE</b> mission, planned for 2005.
