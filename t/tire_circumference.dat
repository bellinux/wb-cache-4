5000|$|Most odometers work by {{counting}} wheel rotations {{and assume that}} the distance traveled {{is the number of}} wheel rotations times the <b>tire</b> <b>circumference,</b> which is a standard tire diameter times pi (3.1416). If nonstandard or severely worn or underinflated tires are used then this will cause some error in the odometer. The formula is (actual distance traveled) = ( [...] (final odometer reading) - (initial odometer reading) [...] ) * (actual tire diameter) / (standard tire diameter). It is common for odometers to be off by several percent. [...] Odometer errors are typically proportional to speedometer errors.|$|E

The sensor is mounted on the bike at a fixed location, pulsing when the spoke-mounted magnet passes by. In this way, it is {{analogous}} to an electronic car speedometer using pulses from an ABS sensor, but with a much cruder time/distance resolution - typically one pulse/display update per revolution, or as seldom as once every 2-3 seconds at low speed with a 26-inch (2.07m circumference, without tire) wheel. However, this is rarely a critical problem, and the system provides frequent updates at higher road speeds where the information is of more importance. The low pulse frequency also has little impact on measurement accuracy, as these digital devices can be programmed by wheel size, or additionally by wheel or <b>tire</b> <b>circumference</b> {{in order to make}} distance measurements more accurate and precise than a typical motor vehicle gauge. However these devices carry some minor disadvantage in requiring power from batteries that must be replaced every so often in the receiver (AND sensor, for wireless models), and, in wired models, the signal being carried by a thin cable that is much less robust than that used for brakes, gears, or cabled speedometers.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{simplified}} {{model of a}} rotating tire is developed and free vibrations of the tire are analysed on an example case. The tire belt is modelled as a rotating cylindrical shell. The shell ends {{are assumed to be}} with free boundary conditions. A flexible foundation is considered under the belt surface in order {{to take into account the}} stiffness of the air inside the tire as well as the tire sidewall. Moreover, the tire inflation pressure is accounted for. This is necessary since it generates an important tangential pre-stress in the tire belt. Finally, the effects of rotation onto the resonance frequencies and the mode shapes of the tire are considered. This is done by introducing Coriolis and centrifugal terms into the equations of motion plus the tangential centrifugal pre-stress. The boundary conditions of the elastically supported shell are satisfied exactly and the corresponding mode shapes and the resonance frequencies are calculated for an example case. Unlike the shells with simply supported ends, the shells with free ends have the functional form of the mode shapes changing with frequency. In particular, the dependence of a mode shape on the axial coordinate exhibits strong generic variation with frequency. Consequently, different combinations of transcendental functions (hyperbolic and circular) occur at different frequency ranges. The Coriolis accelerations and the centrifugal tension are shown to play an important role in how the resonance frequencies of the tire veer with rotation speed. In fact, the modes rotating backward and forward along the <b>tire</b> <b>circumference</b> tend to slow down or speed up with the increase in rotation speed. Thus they no longer superimpose into standing waves. In contrast, they keep propagating as travelling modes. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|These {{characteristics}} are also affected by tire stagger (<b>tires</b> of different <b>circumference</b> at different {{positions on the}} car, the right rear having the most influence in left turns) and rubber compounds used in tire construction. These settings are determined by NASCAR and Goodyear engineers {{and may not be}} adjusted by individual teams.|$|R
40|$|Michelin {{develops}} and manufactures tires. To {{check their}} tire, different tires tests are used. During the testing process of agricultural tires, some endurance tests are performed on a circular test track where a convoy, {{made of a}} truck pulling two single-axle trailers without suspension system, is driven at a constant speed. Depending on the tested tires, {{it has been observed}} that the convoy may become severely instable. This instability is a large problem for the test team since the tires undertake too much overload which makes test results unexploitable. This is time consuming and expensive for the company. The aim of this thesis is two-folded. The first aim is to identify the phenomenon causing the instability from experimental data and also the parameters which influence the phenomenon. The second aim is to model the phenomenon from technical data in order to predict instability behaviors in advance. Models have been developed and the behavior have been analyzed and compared with experiments. The main result of this work is that the instable behavior is due to the excitation of natural modes of the convoy by the tires frequencies. Natural modes are identified as the natural bouncing mode of the trailers. The bouncing natural mode of a trailer depends on tires stiffnesses and the load on the trailer. Tires excitation frequencies are related to the test speed, the trailer track width and the rolling <b>circumference</b> of the <b>tires.</b> To get a good prediction tires stiffness and <b>tires</b> rolling <b>circumference</b> under operation require to be better characterized. Thanks to this work the test teams {{have a better understanding of}} the phenomenon and a tool which can be used to give a rough indication about problematic configurations. This tool cannot totally predict instable behaviors with the technical data at our disposal since some more parameters, which are not quantified for now, might influence the phenomenon. Nevertheless, these parameters have been highlighted by this study and if explored by the test team, a working predicting tool could be achieved...|$|R
