5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E

However, in June 2015, and despite the Interpol notice, Modi took a picture with ex-Interpol Chief Ronald Noble and uploaded it to his Instagram account while attending the El Clasico match in Barcelona. In the post, he referred to Noble as his “brother”. The incident caused significant media backlash within India as many began <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> about the connection between men with criminal reputations like Modi and international law enforcement. Yet Noble, {{who served as the}} head of Interpol from 2000 to 2014, denied any knowledge of Modi's criminal activities despite evidence that Modi was on an Interpol watch list for some time.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Adams {{decided not}} to seek reelection, but rather to {{challenge}} the popular incumbent U.S. Senator John G. Townsend, Jr. for his U.S. Senate seat. A thoughtful moderate Republican, Townsend had supported much of the New Deal legislation, and had demonstrated considerable effectiveness through {{his involvement in the}} establishment of such things as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. By contrast, Adams had a low profile in the House of Representatives and Townsend was able <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> about Adams' effectiveness for Delaware. Once again bucking national trends, Delaware had its own local Republican landslide in 1934, led by Townsend. Adams came home and moved to Georgetown, Delaware where he continued the practice of law.

To some extent, it was not wrong, since the activists were mainly fighting for the preservation of a public place and against the methods and urban planning policies of its government, perceived to favour business interests over the public interest.

The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: [...] "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain... This is a response to {{the world in which we}} live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." [...] Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the {{narrative}} was to depict war in a manner unlike it is portrayed in media such as TV and books. Another goal was to use the scenarios presented to cause players <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> about their thoughts of killing people in a video game {{as a form of}} entertainment. To achieve this, the team made the hints at the game's loading screen increasingly aggressive, while the game's overall narrative was designed with the aim of being [...] "physically opposing", so that players could project themselves into the protagonist's position, especially when making choices that involve the killing of innocents. They hoped that players would be able to feel angry at the developers who [...] "forced" [...] players into killing civilians in the game. The team had a lot of debates regarding the imagery used in depicting violence towards civilians, as many considered it excessive and unnecessary. However, 2K approved their vision even when the team thought they had pushed the narrative to extremes.|$|E
500|$|The {{morning after}} the broadcast, several tabloid {{newspapers}} attacked the documentary, accusing it of sensationalism and [...] "trial by television". In the following days, they mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary's main witnesses, accusing her of being a former prostitute and of being anti-British; Proetta later successfully sued several newspapers for libel. Other newspapers accused [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses' statements and criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast. The eyewitnesses interviewed for [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] gave evidence at the inquest into the shootings; most repeated the statements they had given the programme, but one witness—who had told the programme {{he had seen a}} soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire at the man while he was on the ground—retracted his previous statement. As a result of the retraction, Thames commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of [...] "Death on the Rock"—the first time an inquiry had been commissioned into the making of an individual documentary. The Windlesham–Rampton report found that the programme's tendency was to present evidence that the IRA members had been unlawfully killed, but that it sought <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> rather than to reach a conclusion. The authors made several criticisms of the documentary, but overall found it a [...] "trenchant" [...] work of journalism, made in [...] "good faith and without ulterior motives". Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished {{as a result of the}} Broadcasting Act 1990—decisions which several involved parties believed were influenced by the government's anger at [...] "Death on the Rock".|$|E

[...] John Sloan Dickey, later president of the college, joined the fraternity in 1928 and was elected house president only two weeks later, while still a pledge. [...] Nine brothers of Theta Chi died in a tragic accident on the morning of February 25, 1934, when the metal chimney of the building's old coal furnace blew out in the night and the residence filled with poisonous carbon monoxide gas. [...] Alpha Theta {{was one of the first}} collegiate fraternities in the United States to break from its national organization over civil rights issues. [...] In 1951, while Dickey served as president of the college, the student body passed a resolution calling on all fraternities to eliminate racial discrimination from their constitutions. [...] The Theta Chi national organization's constitution contained a clause limiting membership in fraternity to [...] "Caucasians" [...] only. [...] On April 24, 1952, the members of the Dartmouth chapter voted unanimously to stop recognizing the racial clause in Theta Chi's constitution. [...] Upon learning that the Dartmouth delegation to Theta Chi's national convention later that year planned <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> about the clause, the Alpha Theta chapter was derecognized by the national organization on July 25, 1952. [...] The house reincorporated as a local fraternity and adopted the name Alpha Theta. [...] Alpha Theta was also one of the first all-male fraternities to admit female members. [...] In 1972, Dartmouth admitted the first class of female students and officially became a coeducational institution. [...] Alpha Theta also voted to become coeducational. [...] After a few years, most of the women in the fraternity had become inactive and the house voted to become single-sex male-only again on November 10, 1976. [...] The house returned to a coeducational membership policy in 1980.|$|E

However, while episode 1 received similar viewership to that of the preceding episode of EastEnders, the episode of EastEnders that preceded episode 2 of Redwater was watched by 5.1million viewers on the night of broadcast, meaning that many EastEnders viewers did not stay tuned to BBC One to watch its spin-off.

All that was required was one win in the final five games of the season, which included three games against the Royals, whom the Tigers had manhandled much of the season. Unfortunately, the Tigers lost all five games and the division title went to the Minnesota Twins.

2500|$|One {{extraordinary}} fact emerged. There {{had been}} an official report on Kew, which had not previously been seen in public, which Ayrton had caused this to be written by Richard Owen.

Nonetheless, the report was amongst the papers laid before Parliament, and it contained an attack on both the Hookers, and suggested (amongst much else) that they had mismanaged the care of their trees, and that their systematic approach to botany was nothing more than [...] "attaching barbarous binomials to foreign weeds". The discovery of this report no doubt helped to sway opinion in favour of Hooker and Kew (there was debate in the press as well as Parliament). Hooker replied to the Owen report in a point by point factual manner, and his reply placed with the other papers on the case. When Ayrton was questioned about it in the debate led by Lubbock, he replied that [...] "Hooker was too low an official <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> of matter with a Minister of the Crown".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} , {{to date the}} only {{full-length}} book about Colegio, author Carlos Maldonado writes that Colegio was {{often referred to as}} [...] "the longest running death in history", and that study of Colegio Cesar Chavez will [...] "help promoters of new ethnic institutions <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>questions</b> of feasibility, anticipate problems, and provide direction in the establishment of new and more sophisticated institutions." [...] Maldonado claims that Colegio's staff was small and relatively inexperienced and therefore unprepared for the challenges of starting a new college. Eventually the staff succumbed to infighting. Maldonado also claims that it was difficult to foster an on-campus sense of community among staff and students because Colegio was a college-without-walls program. The author notes that Colegio was founded during a time of downturn in activism in the Chicano Movement. Colegio was founded during a period of growing political conservatism marked by less federal support for cultural programs. Colegio was founded in a small rural town whose population largely disliked Colegio's predecessor of Mount Angel College and therefore saw Colegio as an extension of Mount Angel College. The surrounding community was relatively prejudiced against Mexican Americans. Lastly, Colegio was named in honor of a man many local farm owners found controversial.|$|E
