5|$|West Gates engines {{were shut}} down while American backed out of <b>the</b> <b>tangle.</b> West Gate quickly began to settle and the order to abandon ship was issued. The chief {{engineer}} and his assistant, Spencer and Hillery, remained belowdecks long enough to extinguish the boilers and open safety valves to prevent {{the explosion of the}} boilers. They finished the task just before the aft bulkhead gave way to the inrushing seawater. Both arrived on deck in time to board lifeboat number 2, which had been held as long as possible for men in the after part of the ship.|$|E
5|$|American, {{which was}} lightly {{damaged by the}} collision, {{reversed}} her engine {{to back out of}} <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> while West Gates engine was shut down. After American was completely backed out, West Gate began rapidly settling and was ordered abandoned. A total of seven men from West Gate died in the accident—two when their lifeboat capsized, and a further five that probably died in the initial impact. West Gates commanding officer, Lt. Cdr. R. B. Vandervoort, and six men he had personally escorted to a life raft were picked up by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water. The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships does not report any casualties on American from the collision.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Johnson {{was ordered}} to move his men from their {{position}} {{at the center of}} the lines to a new position farther to the left, just six days before a massive Union attack took place. When he was given this order, no defensive fortifications existed at the location, and a frantic effort began to construct earthworks in anticipation of a coming assault. The men built a formidable parapet surrounding their camp on three sides, with an exterior trench running alongside it, to create a fortification known as a lunette. The ground dropped off steeply all around the wall, giving the fort a natural advantage. The timber was cut outside the wall, and <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> of tree branches and brush covering the ground made the uphill approach very slow, difficult, and dangerous. Throughout the siege, work continued on the fortifications, mostly at night. Improvements were made, and damage caused by the continuous Union artillery bombardment was repaired.|$|E

40|$|We study {{particle}} clustering in {{a temperature}} stratified turbulence with small finite correlation time. It is {{shown that the}} temperature stratified turbulence strongly increases the degree of compressibility of particle velocity field. This results in the strong decrease of the threshold for the excitation of <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability even for small particles. <b>The</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability in the temperature stratified turbulence is essentially different from the inertial clustering instability that occurs in non-stratified isotropic and homogeneous turbulence. While the inertial clustering instability {{is caused by the}} centrifugal effect of the turbulent eddies, the mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability is related to the temperature fluctuations generated by <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> of <b>the</b> mean temperature gradient by the velocity fluctuations. Temperature fluctuations produce pressure fluctuations and cause particle clustering in regions with increased pressure fluctuations. It is shown that the growth rate of <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability is much larger than that of the inertial clustering instability. It is found that depending on the parameters of the turbulence and the mean temperature gradient there is a preferential particle size at which the particle clustering due to <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability is more effective. The particle number density inside the cluster after the saturation of this instability can be in several orders of magnitude larger than the mean particle number density. It is also demonstrated that the evaporation of droplets drastically change <b>the</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability, e. g., it increases the instability threshold in the droplet radius. <b>The</b> <b>tangling</b> clustering instability is of a great importance, e. g., in atmospheric turbulence with temperature inversions.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tangle</b> net, or tooth net, {{originated}} in British Columbia, Canada, as a gear specifically developed for selective fisheries. Tangle nets have smaller mesh sizes than standard gillnets. They {{are designed to}} catch fish by their nose or jaw, enabling bycatch to be resuscitated and released unharmed. Tangle nets as adapted to the mark-selective fishery for spring Chinook salmon on the lower Columbia River have a standard mesh size of 4-1/4inches (10.8cm.). Short net lengths and soak times are used {{in an effort to}} land fish in good condition. Tangle nets are typically used in situations where the release of certain (usually wild) fish unharmed is desirable. In a typical situation calling for the use of a tangle net, for instance, all fish retaining their adipose fins (usually wild) must be returned to the water. Tangle nets are used in conjunction with a live recovery box, which acts as a resuscitation chamber for unmarked fish that appear lethargic or stressed before their release into the water.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{relatively}} large size of web, they are often infested with kleptoparasitic split-faced silver spiders (Argyrodes fissifrons). While able to build webs of their own, dewdrop spiders (genus Argyrodes) prefer to live and even reproduce in the webs of other spiders, stealing prey in the process. They can be permanently associated with one web or move around between several other tent webs in the immediate vicinity. The size of the web is directly proportional {{to the number of}} A. fissifrons inhabiting them. The relationships can sometimes be commensal or even mutual, as A. fissifrons eat prey entangled in the webs that are too small for the larger double-tailed tent spiders. However, they often help themselves to food stores or even food {{in the process of being}} consumed by the hosts as well. Larger individuals are more audacious, but they usually stay on <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> webs and out of the way of their hosts. Double-tailed tent spiders seem to tolerate their presence though they sometimes have to shove them away when they catch larger prey.|$|E
25|$|The {{high winds}} {{and the lack}} of {{observation}} in the preceding days due to rain, reduced the accuracy of the British artillery and the presence of German aircraft, which correspondingly increased the accuracy of German defensive barrages, contributed to the failure of the infantry to reach their objectives, except at Le Sars and beyond Gueudecourt. The 47th Division attack on the Butte de Warlencourt succeeded on the right flank but failed to capture the butte, which was on the left flank. The 23rd Division had captured all its objectives and credited the artillery support for the success of the attacks, along with the efforts of the troops on the lines of communication, who from 2 to 8 October endured constant shelling. Telephone lines were frequently cut by the German artillery-fire but the brigade headquarters were rarely {{out of touch with the}} battalions for many minutes. Runners from battalion headquarters to the front, crossed ground under severe bombardment yet rarely delivered messages late. The initiative of the battalion commanders and the co-ordination of units, so that the 13th DLI immediately reinforced the Green Howards and the discretion of the 12th DLI in waiting at <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> were commended.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{selective}} properties of gillnet fishing, alternative methods of harvest {{are currently being}} studied. Recent WDF reports suggest that purse seine is the most productive method with having highest catch per unit effort (CPUE), but has little information {{on the effectiveness of}} selectively harvesting hatchery-reared salmon. More conclusive research has been conducted jointly between the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and Bonneville Power Administration on a 10-year study on selective harvest methods of hatchery origin salmon in the Upper Columbia River by purse seine and tangle net. Their 2009 and 2010 findings show that purse seines have a higher percentage of survivability and higher CPUE than does tangle nets. A Colville Tribe biologist reports that during these two years the tribe harvested 3,163 hatchery Chinook while releasing 2,346 wild Chinook with only 1.4% direct or immediate mortality using purse seines, whereas <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> net was far less productive but had an approximate 12.5% mortality. Researchers commented that the use of recovery boxes and shortened periods between checking the nets would have likely decreased mortality rates. While there is data that shows success of selective methods of harvest at protecting wild and ESA listed salmon, there still must be social acceptance of new methods of fishing.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 October, German {{aircraft}} appeared over British artillery positions from Guedecourt to Flers {{and directed}} artillery fire onto the British batteries; the fighter pilots of IV Brigade {{found that the}} German aircraft had {{gone by the time}} that they arrived.

2500|$|McNamara's {{institution}} of systems analysis {{as a basis}} for making key decisions on force requirements, weapon systems, and other matters occasioned much debate. Two of its main practitioners during the McNamara era, Alain C. Enthoven and K. Wayne Smith, described the concept as follows: [...] "First, the word 'systems' indicates that every decision should be considered in as broad a context as necessary... The word 'analysis' emphasizes the need to reduce a complex problem to its component parts for better understanding. Systems analysis takes a complex problem and sorts out <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> of significant factors so that each can be studied by the method most appropriate to it." [...] Enthoven and Smith said they used mainly civilians as systems analysts because they could apply independent points of view to force planning. McNamara's tendency to take military advice into less account than had previous secretaries and to override military opinions contributed to his unpopularity with service leaders. It was also generally thought that Systems Analysis, rather than being objective, was tailored by the civilians to support decisions that McNamara had already made.|$|E
