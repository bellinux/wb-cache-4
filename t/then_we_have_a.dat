[...] initiative, {{in which a}} {{different}} image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being [...] "The Art of Evolution". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, [...] "maybe we'll show [...] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. And <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> conversation with them about how we'd like to portray that, and then we try to lean into the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's {{one of the things}} [...] really look forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation." [...] The art once again appeared as variant covers to select titles published by Marvel Comics in June 2015.|$|E
