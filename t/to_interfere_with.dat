5|$|After {{a period}} of peace, Tantallon again saw {{military}} action during the Bishops' Wars in 1639. The Douglas family had remained Catholic after the Scottish Reformation, incurring {{the wrath of the}} Presbyterian Covenanters, who opposed Charles I's attempts <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the Scottish Church. In 1639, the Covenanters captured Tantallon while William, newly created Marquess of Douglas, was in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} combined-force operation, the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) would {{contribute}} Ju 88As, Stukas, Messerschmitts, three light AA battalions, and three heavy AA battalions.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1835, Texians had {{expelled}} all Mexican {{troops from}} Texas. Believing the war ended, many Texians resigned from the army and returned home. In January, the provisional government essentially collapsed; {{despite a lack of}} authority for any branch of government <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> other branches, the legislature impeached Governor Henry Smith, who in turn disbanded the legislature. No one in Texas was entirely sure who was in charge.|$|E

50|$|These {{compounds}} are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and can {{be further}} classified as thiopeptides. The overall structure of the cyclothiazomycins comprises a macrocyclic bicyclic peptide containing several thiazoles and thiazolines. The cyclothiazomycins are reported to have multiple inhibitory effects ranging from decreasing blood pressure <b>to</b> <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> RNA transcription; they also exhibit some antibiotic activity.|$|R

5|$|Emperor Xingzong died in 1055. His eldest son, Yel√º Hongji (who {{would later}} be known by the name Emperor Daozong of Liao), assumed the throne having already gained {{experience}} in governing while his father was alive. Unlike his father, Emperor Daozong did not face a succession crisis. While both Ji Dian and Zhong Yuan remained alive, and both had the political influence <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the succession process, neither did.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of the House of Habsburg, Maria Theresa was a Roman Catholic, and a devout one. She {{believed}} that religious unity was necessary for a peaceful public life and explicitly rejected the idea of religious toleration. However, she never allowed the Church <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> what she considered to be prerogatives of a monarch and kept Rome at arm's length. She controlled the selection of archbishops, bishops and abbots.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> tank production goals, {{the bombing}} forced a steep {{drop in the}} production of spare parts, which as a percentage of tank production dropped from 25-30 percent in 1943 to 8 percent in late 1944. This compounded the problems with reliability and the numbers of operational Panthers, as tanks in the field had to be cannibalized for parts.|$|R
50|$|Sims {{pleaded guilty}} <b>to</b> <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> a witness and {{received}} a seven-month sentence, plus six months' home confinement. Sims had also been ordered on October 25, 2011, by then-Mississippi State Auditor Stacey Pickering, to repay $31,530 for using city employees and equipment {{to work on the}} Correctional Facility and the privately owned Transitional Center. He was released from custody on January 9, 2013.|$|R
5|$|Mine owners {{still holding}} out for the 10-hour day soon {{attempted}} to re-open their mines. On March 14, they obtained a court injunction ordering the miners not <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the operation of their mines, and hired strikebreakers. The WFM initially attempted to persuade these men to join the union and strike, but when they were unsuccessful, the union resorted to threats and violence. These tactics succeeded in driving non-union miners out of the district.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} is {{the production}} of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments. For example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure makes them also reflect blue, turquoise, and green light, and they are often iridescent.|$|E
5|$|The {{freedom of}} the Ionian Greeks had been a {{rallying}} cry {{since the beginning of}} the 5th century, but after the Corinthian War, the mainland states made no further attempts <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> Persia's control of the region. After over a century of disruption and struggle, Persia at last ruled Ionia without disruption or intervention for over 50 years, until the time of Alexander the Great.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ashfall {{is likely}} to have major effects on these systems. Ash will clog intake structures, cause {{abrasion}} damage to pumps and block pipes, settling ponds and open filters.

It is essential to monitor chlorine residuals in the distribution system.|$|E
5|$|A {{campaign}} {{to send an}} American side to the 1920 games in Antwerp started in California after a Berkeley rugby union touring party returned from British Columbia undefeated in 1920. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) granted permission for entry. A pool of players from Stanford, Berkeley, and Santa Clara made up the squad. 1908 champion Danny Carroll, a player-coach at Stanford at the time, was the team's most prominent member. When the U.S. arrived in Antwerp, the Czechoslovakian and Romanian teams had withdrawn, leaving only France and the United States. The English RFU {{had decided not to}} enter a team, so as not <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the start of the English domestic season.|$|E

5|$|A {{small group}} of {{toddlers}} show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E
5|$|After the conflict, the Pakistani {{government}} {{decided on a}} policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare {{an account of the}} circumstances surrounding the atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E
