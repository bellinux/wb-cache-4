2500|$|There {{were three}} depositional stages for the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin which were {{dependent}} on plate tectonics of the era. Present-day North America was identified <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> the Proterozoic super-continent, Rodinia. This continent broke apart about 700 {{million years ago}} and formed other continents, {{one of which was}} Laurentia or the North American Craton. Laurentia drifted south of the equatorial zone. As this new smaller continent was smaller than Rodinia, it had some surface area under water level, including area designated as the Phanerozoic basin. [...] Cambrian 544-505 Ma to Mississippian 362-320 Ma period laid down base clastics, then platform carbonates and evaporites. These deposits form the origins of potash evaporites for the potash industry. [...] Laurentia began to rise {{at the close of the}} Cambrian Period. Huge flooding occurred during the Middle Ordovician period 505-441 Ma. Laurentia had shifted again, and the region of Saskatchewan was now north of the equator and some raising exposing the land again. Re-flooding in the Late Ordovician age with warm water increased calcium carbonate sedimentation, and marine life. The Williston basin was formed creating a lowered land area during this period filling with the Winnipeg Sea. The Williston basin was mainly south of Saskatchewan but extended north into the Saskatchewan plains area.|$|E

60|$|Before {{the round}} eyes of M. Bredin {{he began to}} produce from his pockets and <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> the table bank-notes and sovereigns. The cloth was covered with them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Those who dare <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> hands <b>upon</b> {{the person}} of the living Baaltis will not shrink from seeking her in the company of her dead sisters." ...|$|R
60|$|Then others saw me, {{and there}} was a concerted rush <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> hands <b>upon</b> me, for these were all members of the palace guard--men {{familiar}} with my face.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the man, mejuffrouw," [...] began Stoutenburg after awhile, [...] "who on New Year's day at Haarlem dared <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> hands <b>upon</b> your person. Do you {{recognize}} him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That you cannot do, sir," [...] she rejoined, [...] "but {{you would}} greatly ease the load of sorrow {{which you have}} helped <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> me, if you gave me the {{assurance}} which I ask." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Things cannot run {{on in this}} way. It is not a thing <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> me to go {{on working}} in your cause with her when you will not stir a step in your own behalf.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The image {{called up}} by these last words gave a new {{direction}} to poor Adam's maddened feelings. He was silent, looking {{at the corner of}} the room as if he saw something there. Then he burst out again, in a tone of appealing anguish, [...] "I can't bear it...O God, it's too hard <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> me--it's too hard to think she's wicked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{outside for}} one moment," [...] he begged. [...] "I {{hate to see}} you in the place where that beast tried <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> hands <b>upon</b> you. Here is your necklace." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{fetching}} {{out three}} sacks of wheat, he handed them over. Jo was proceeding <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> these <b>upon</b> {{the backs of}} the animals; but this was too thin for even Hans.|$|R
60|$|And so saying, he humorously {{commanded}} his attendants <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> hands <b>upon</b> the bedeviled philosopher, {{and place}} a bandage upon his mouth, that he might no more disseminate his devilish doctrine.|$|R
60|$|It {{was hard}} to say what had affronted her most, the {{proceeding}} itself, the neglect, or the commands which Aunt Geoffrey had presumed <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> her, and away she went to her mamma, a great deal too much displeased, and too distrustful to pay the smallest attention to any precautions which her aunt might have tried to impress upon her.|$|E
6000|$|... "No?" [...] replied Hector, {{for such}} is the Saxon {{equivalent}} for Eachin, [...] "what! never {{when he took the}} part of the Gow Chrom (the bandy legged smith) against Eachin MacIan? Say nothing to excuse it, and believe it will be your own fault if I ever again allude to it. But you had some command <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> me; speak, and you shall be obeyed." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{intent upon}} her task was Christie, that she forgot herself till the {{discomfort}} of her position reminded {{her that she}} had a body. Fearing to wake the poor girl in her arms, she tried to lean against the basin, but could not reach a cushion <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> the cold stone ledge. An unseen hand supplied the want, and, looking round, she saw two young men standing behind her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am no {{subject of}} yours, proud Abbot!" [...] he cried at last. [...] "My house {{has ever been}} vavasor to the King. I deny the power {{of you and your}} court <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> {{sentence}} <b>upon</b> me. Punish these your own monks, who whimper at your frown, but do not dare <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> your hand <b>upon</b> him who fears you not, for he is a free man, and the peer of any save only the King himself." ...|$|R
60|$|He started. Walker was {{standing}} in the doorway and instinctively he turned round <b>to</b> hide what <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> his desk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Archer," [...] quoth Hordle John, [...] "you {{have lied}} {{more than once}} and more than twice; for which, and also because I see much in you to dislike, I am sorely tempted <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> you <b>upon</b> your back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{so far as}} I {{can help}} him, he shall succeed," [...] was all Rowland could say. He turned to Miss Garland, to bid her good night, and she rose and put out her hand. She was very straightforward, {{but he could see}} that if she was too modest to be bold, she was much too simple to be shy. [...] "Have you no charge <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> me?" [...] he asked--to ask her something.|$|E
60|$|That {{action was}} the {{severing}} of {{his hold on}} realities. They fell away from him in final separation. Vaguely, dreamily he seemed to behold his soul. Night merged into gray day; and night came again, weird and dark. Then {{up out of the}} vast void of the desert, from the silence and illimitableness, trooped his phantoms of peace. Majestically they formed around him, marshalling and mustering in ceremonious state, and moved <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> him their passionless serenity.|$|E
60|$|Every one {{was eager}} to give something, even Silas, who sent home for a stuffed wild-cat killed in his youth. It was rather moth-eaten and shabby, but on a high bracket and best side {{foremost}} the effect was fine, for the yellow glass eyes glared, and the mouth snarled so naturally, that Teddy shook in his little shoes at sight of it, when he came bringing his most cherished treasure, one cocoon, <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> the shrine of science.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wisely spoken, Mlle. Crystal," [...] rejoined de Marmont. [...] "Have I {{not said}} that I have two dozen {{soldiers}} with me--all {{trained to do}} their duty? Why should M. le Comte allow them <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> hands <b>upon</b> you and on Mme. la Duchesse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Listen,' said Bradley, {{in a low}} voice, bending forward <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> {{his hand}} <b>upon</b> the Lock-keeper's shoulder. 'These are my holidays.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may call}} the devil for aught I care, you little fool," [...] he {{answered}} her, very pleasantly. [...] "Do you think Duplay will be mad enough <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> hands <b>upon</b> a Deputy of the Convention in {{the discharge of}} {{the affairs of the}} Nation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Prosp. Dull thing! I say so.--He, [...] That Caliban, and she, that Sycorax, [...] Whom I now keep in service. Thou best know'st [...] What torment I {{did find}} thee in; thy groans [...] Did make wolves howl, and {{penetrate}} the breasts [...] Of ever-angry bears; {{it was a}} torment [...] <b>To</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> the damned, which Sycorax [...] Could ne'er again undo: It was my art, [...] When I arrived and heard thee, that made the pine [...] To gape, and let thee out.|$|E
6000|$|... but in {{here and}} there a faded leaf (for in Europe death is not glorified to the foliage as in our own land), in the purple of the {{ripening}} grapes, and in the tawny grass of the pastures, there was autumn enough to touch our spirits, and while it hardly affected the tone of the landscape, <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> us the gentle and pensive spell of its presence. Of all the days in the year I would have chosen this to go pilgrim to the house of Petrarch.|$|E
60|$|I {{passed the}} night in {{alternate}} lamentation and research, equally fruitless, the mystery was impenetrable to conjecture, the pain invincible to balm. But never once throughout that dreadful night did my firm spirit relinquish its high design against Elizabeth Mary, and daybreak found me more resolute than before to harvest the fruits of my marriage. My great loss seemed but to bring me into nearer spiritual relations with my dead ancestors, and <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> me {{a new and more}} inevitable obedience to the suasion that spoke in every globule of my blood.|$|E
6000|$|... (1.). The {{grace that}} is {{offered in the}} general tenders of the gospel, calleth for faith <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> hold <b>upon,</b> and accept thereof; but the special grace of election, worketh that faith which doth lay hold thereof (Acts 16:31, 13:48; Phil 1:29; 2 Thess 1:11).|$|R
5000|$|... "The chief made camp in {{the three}} crowns of the Mountain...upon which {{he and his men}} turned its passes and jungles into a {{formidable}} fortress. From its shadows they marched out <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> waste <b>upon</b> Castillian defenses and encampments. Those were the dark days of the uprising." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sleep--I {{and they}} keep guard all night, [...] Not doubt, not decease shall dare <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> finger <b>upon</b> you, [...] I have embraced you, and {{henceforth}} possess you to myself, [...] And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} I was {{extremely}} obliged {{to him for}} so far interesting himself in my affairs, but that I had been so far his debtor before that I knew not how anything could increase the debt; for I owed my life to him already, and I could not be in debt for anything more valuable than that. He answered in the most obliging manner possible, that he would {{put it in my}} power to pay that debt, and all the obligations besides that ever he had, or should be able <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> me.|$|E
60|$|The {{child who}} had been her little friend came there, {{almost as soon as}} it was day, with an {{offering}} of dried flowers which he begged them <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> her breast. It was he who had come to the window overnight and spoken to the sexton, and they saw in the snow traces of small feet, where he had been lingering near the room in which she lay, before he went to bed. He had a fancy, it seemed, that they had left her there alone; and could not bear the thought.|$|E
60|$|The Viscount sought {{no further}} {{solution}} {{of the reason why}} the Skimmer had left him so hurriedly. Fumbling a moment in a pocket, he drew forth a hand filled with broad pieces of gold. These he appeared about <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>upon</b> the table; but, as it were by forgetfulness, he kept the member closed, and bidding the grocer adieu, he left the house, with as firm a resolution as was ever made by any man, conscious of having done both a weak and a wicked action, of never again putting himself in familial contact with so truckling a miscreant.|$|E
60|$|As {{everyone}} {{was out of}} the way but herself, Jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But where should she go? And burning <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> herself <b>upon</b> the shrine of sisterly devotion, she sat down to settle that point.|$|R
60|$|Kwaque {{tried to}} be friendly. He uttered a clucking noise in {{advertisement}} of his friendliness, and Michael snarled at this black who had dared <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> hands <b>upon</b> him--a contamination, according to Michael's training--and who now dared to address him who associated only with white gods.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they did}} escape, then are we bound in duty <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> hands <b>upon</b> them and deliver them again to their lord; {{for it is}} not seemly {{that one of his}} quality should suffer a so insolent and high-handed outrage from persons of their base degree." ...|$|R
