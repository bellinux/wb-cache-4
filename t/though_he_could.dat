5|$|In 2013 Beth Israel hired Gabriel Greenberg {{to succeed}} Topolosky as rabbi, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not join the synagogue until the {{following}} year. A native of New England, he, like Topolosky, received his rabbinic ordination at Yeshivat Chovevei Torah. , Greenberg was Beth Israel's rabbi.|$|E
5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It {{would be foolish to}} claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{said that}} he understands Mandarin, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> use some help {{speaking}} it; he can also read and write a little. He took a few Mandarin classes while attending Harvard to try to improve. After joining the Knicks in 2012, Lin slept on a couch in his brother's one-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City. The night before his breakout game, he slept on the couch of teammate Landry Fields. He relocated to a luxury condo in White Plains, New York, after his Knicks contract became guaranteed.|$|E
60|$|Charlie Tagg felt as <b>though</b> <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> ha' called 'im a lot o' {{worse things}} than that, {{but he took}} up 'is hat and Mrs. Cook and Emma got their bonnets on and they went round.|$|R
60|$|They {{was all so}} {{surprised}} at fust that they couldn't speak, but old Cook smiled at 'im and put the winder up agin. And Charlie Tagg sat there arf mad with temper, locking as <b>though</b> <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> eat Jack Bates without any salt, as the saying is.|$|R
60|$|Stanley nodded. In truth, he {{had noticed}} something, <b>though</b> what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not have said.|$|R
5|$|It is Christmas, and Christine {{is having}} dinner with Marion, Ernie, Fung, Bobby and Adam. Christine unwraps her present to find an album of photos from her life. She says that she feels as if her life is {{flashing}} before her eyes, and then realises what is happening. Christine sits {{in a car wreck}} as emergency services attempt to free her. On the front seat & window screen, there are broken eggs from a shopping bag and the Stranger is explaining to the police that he stepped into the road causing the crash, and, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> free Jack he could not reach Christine. At the dinner table, Jack enters dressed as a Nativity angel. Marion says it is time for Christine to move on. Christine says a final goodbye.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the years, he {{received}} the Victory Medal, the Occupational Medal from the Mississippi Army National Guard, an honourable discharge (which he had not received upon leaving the army) and the French Légion d'honneur. In 1999, when he was 105 years old, the Mississippi Legislature adopted a resolution recognizing him as an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. At the time, {{he was known as}} the oldest living World War I veteran, as Emiliano Mercado del Toro had not yet been discovered. He was interviewed by Treehouse Productions in 2006 as part of their Living History Project, a radio tribute to the last surviving World War I veterans that was hosted by Walter Cronkite. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not speak coherently, his son Haywood Hardy, himself 80 years old at the time, recalled some of the stories that his father had told him.|$|E
5|$|After his forced retirement, Peng lived alone, under {{constant}} surveillance from the Central Guard Unit of the PLA, {{accompanied by a}} secretary and a bodyguard. His wife remained in Beijing; and, due to her work as the Party secretary of Beijing Normal University, was only able to visit infrequently. Peng's guards prevented curious local farmers from visiting Peng, until Peng threatened to complain to Mao. Peng's niece, Peng Meikui, visited frequently, and the two became close. Peng {{spent most of his}} free time renovating his home, gardening, and studying Marxist theory, agriculture, and economics. Peng was not completely purged: even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not participate in government meetings or decision-making bodies, he still received and read all documents distributed {{to the members of the}} Politburo and State Council, which he was technically still a member of. In 1960 Peng attended the funeral of Lin Boqu.|$|E
50|$|Innokentii Volodin, a diplomat, makes a {{telephone}} call he feels obliged by conscience to make, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> knows <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be arrested. His call is taped and the NKVD seek to identify who has made the call.|$|R

60|$|Anatole! The name buzzed through Caron's brain. To whom did it belong? He knew {{of someone}} who bore it. Yet {{question}} himself <b>though</b> <b>he</b> might, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> at the moment find no answer. And then the courier created a diversion by addressing him.|$|R
5|$|He {{introduced}} massages {{and changed}} the canteen and team kit for the 1979–80 campaign. With no money available for transfers {{he was forced to}} turn to the youth team for new players, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Luís Alves {{moved with}} his parents from his grandparents' farm to Rio de Janeiro and was {{enrolled}} at the Seminário São Joaquim (Saint Joachim School), which became PedroII School in 1837. On 4 May 1818, he was admitted into the Royal Military Academy. The entire course (which ran from the first to seventh year) was mandatory for artillerymen and engineers but infantrymen were only required to take first- and fifth-year classes. Luís Alves took the first- and fifth-year classes in 1818 and 1819, respectively. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have skipped the other years, he chose to take second-year classes in 1820 and third-year classes in 1821. The subjects he studied in the Royal Military Academy ranged from arithmetic, algebra and geometry to tactics, strategy, camping, fortification in campaign and terrain reconnaissance. He was promoted to alferes (equivalent to a modern-day second lieutenant) on 12 October 1818, and to lieutenant (modern-day first lieutenant) on 4 November 1820.|$|E
5|$|Toledo's team, under {{financial}} {{pressure at}} season's end, worked to relieve themselves of their expensive contracts. Not yet fully {{recovered from a}} rib injury sustained in July, Walker was released by the Blue Stockings on September 22, 1884. During the offseason, Walker took a position as a mail clerk, but returned to baseball in 1885, playing in the Western League for 18 games. For {{the second half of}} 1885, he joined the baseball club in Waterbury for 10 games. When the season ended, Walker reunited with Weldy in Cleveland to assume the proprietorship of the LeGrande House, an opera theater and hotel. According to Zang, Walker could afford the business venture after commanding a $2,000 contract as a major leaguer. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer negotiate such a salary, his skills were still highly attractive to teams: Walker returned to Waterbury in 1886 when the team joined the more competitive Eastern League.|$|E
60|$|Faint as was her whisper, {{it reached}} the ears of Alonzo, who, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> still <b>could</b> not speak for laughing, shook his head.|$|R
60|$|Some of the {{servants}} likewise used me saucily, and had much ado {{to keep their}} hands off me; the master indeed was civiller to me than they, {{but he would not}} yet let me go, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> owned <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not say I was in his shop before.|$|R
60|$|Then Jonas asked Rollo {{what made}} him think of a beetle and wedge; and Rollo told him of the {{conversation}} he had held with the farmer's boy. Then Jonas talked a long time about it, giving him particular advice and direction about the plan, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not himself go and help him then, for <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not leave his harnesses.|$|R
25|$|Pu is {{believed}} to have completed the majority of the tales sometime in 1679, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have added entries as late as 1707.|$|E
25|$|Praefectus castrorum, Camp Prefect: The Camp Prefect {{was third}} {{in command of}} the legion. Generally he was a long serving veteran from a lower social status than the tribunii whom he outranked, and who {{previously}} had served as primus pilus and finished his 25 years with the legions. He was used as a senior officer in charge of training a legion, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also command a cohort of auxiliaires.|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson {{was shot}} in the right hand during the first world war, and almost had to have it amputated. This left him with little {{strength}} in the hand, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hold a bat with it. He was also left unable to do much fielding on his right side. Despite these handicaps, he continued to play cricket, playing 74 more first-class matches, and he was never considered a liability in the field.|$|E

5000|$|Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford in 1580 even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> also <b>could</b> ill afford it. The {{land was}} {{possibly}} held by his ancestors at some point. He {{sold it to}} William Cornwallis (c. 1545 - 1611) in 1588.|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, after spells with Birchfield Trinity and Birmingham Excelsior, he re-joined Aston Villa. His favoured {{position}} was at inside right but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play on either wing. Contemporary reports {{described him as}} [...] "sturdy, <b>though</b> small, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> dribble through opponents with astonishing ease and grace." ...|$|R
25|$|In Douglas Niles' 2007 book MacArthur's War: A Novel of the Invasion of Japan (written with Michael Dobson), {{which focuses}} on General Douglas MacArthur and an {{alternate}} history of the Pacific War (following a considerably different outcome of the Battle of Midway), Yamamoto is portrayed sympathetically, {{with much of the}} action in the Japanese government seen through his eyes, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not change the major decisions of Japan in World War II.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} Test at Headingley, Broad {{took his place}} in an England first-innings collapse, {{clipping}} Stuart Clark to square leg for 3 as Australia's seam attack bowled England out for 102. As Australia scored 445, Broad took six wickets for 91 in Australia's only innings, at that time his best first-class innings return, {{and in the second}} innings contributed a rapid 61 from 48 balls, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not avert an innings defeat.|$|E
25|$|He {{played against}} New Zealand in a T20I at Chennai where he scored 34 off 26 balls (1 four, 2 sixes) as his side lost by only 1 run. He started his World Twenty20 {{campaign}} with a 3/24 against Afghanistan. He took 1/16 against Australia, 2/16 against Pakistan and a 2/23 against South Africa. He {{ended up being}} the highest wicket taker for India in the tournament <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not match up to the expectations with his bat.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The temper of a Megaera,' said Merton, {{admitting to}} himself that the word was not, <b>though</b> mythological, what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> wish.|$|R
60|$|Bartley did {{not deny}} the justness of her {{opinions}} concerning himself, or the reasonableness of the general expectation, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> probably <b>could</b> not see the relation of these cold abstractions to the pleasure of sitting there with a pretty girl in that way. But he said nothing.|$|R
60|$|Why did {{he still}} follow the sea? Because {{he did not}} know what else to do. When he was younger, he used to love it, but now he hated it. Yet there was not a prettier life in the world if you got to be captain. He used to hope for that once, but not now; <b>though</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{navigate}} a ship. Only let him get his family together again, and he would-- yes, he would--try to do something ashore.|$|R
25|$|Whistler had a {{distinctive}} appearance, short and slight, {{with piercing eyes}} and a curling mustache, often sporting a monocle and the flashy attire of a dandy. He affected a posture of self-confidence and eccentricity. He often was arrogant and selfish toward friends and patrons. A constant self-promoter and egoist, he relished shocking friends and enemies. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be droll and flippant about social and political matters, he always was serious about art and often invited public controversy and debate to argue for his strongly held theories.|$|E
25|$|As {{he had no}} army to maintain, and as he {{suppressed}} the small naval force kept up by the Medici, the whole of his revenue was left free {{for the improvement of}} his state. Leopold was never popular with his Italian subjects. His disposition was cold and retiring. His habits were simple to the verge of sordidness, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> display splendour on occasion, and he could not help offending those of his subjects who had profited by the abuses of the Medicean régime.|$|E
25|$|After a short stay in Cincinnati {{to work as}} {{a naturalist}} and {{taxidermist}} at a museum, Audubon traveled south on the Mississippi with his gun, paintbox, and assistant Joseph Mason, who stayed with him from October 1820 to August 1822 and painted the plant life backgrounds of many of Audubon's bird studies. He was committed to find and paint all the birds of North America for eventual publication. His goal was to surpass the earlier ornithological work of poet-naturalist Alexander Wilson. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not afford to buy Wilson's work, Audubon used it to guide him when he had access to a copy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Though</b> <b>he</b> {{was welcomed}} in Montreal {{and made it}} his home, things were not perfect. <b>Though</b> {{university}} educated, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only find work as a doorman. He became a Canadian citizen in 1953. He was noted for his generous community charity work.|$|R

60|$|I {{could imagine}} the foam about {{the corners of his}} mouth, the {{swelling}} veins in his brow, and the mad bulging of his hideous eyes, for terror spoke in his words, and the Governor of Cesena, overbearing bully <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was, <b>could</b> on occasion, too, become a coward.|$|R
