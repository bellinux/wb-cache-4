2500|$|<b>The</b> Fairey <b>Battle</b> <b>was</b> a British {{single-engine}} light bomber {{designed and}} manufactured by the Fairey Aviation Company.

5|$|Politically, however, <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} a failure for France.

5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was challenged}} by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort {{had no intention}} to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes <b>was</b> written while <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> still ongoing, not after <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort {{in a situation where}} concessions were necessary, in order to bring hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> over and government in Montfort's hands, he had no longer any interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists, and that was why hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who maintains that the document was in fact signed after <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> concluded.|$|R
