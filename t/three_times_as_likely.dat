40|$|Abstract Background Household food {{insecurity}} and under-nutrition remain critically important {{in developing countries}} struggling {{to emerge from the}} scourge of poverty, where historically, improvements in economic conditions have benefited only certain privileged groups, causing growing inequality in health and healthcare among the population. Methods Utilizing information from 5, 977 children aged 0 - 59 months included in the 2004 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, this study examined the relationship between household wealth inequality and chronic childhood under-nutrition. A child is defined as being chronically undernourished or whose growth rate is adversely stunted, if his or her z-score of height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the median of international reference. Household wealth status is measured by an established index based on household ownership of durable assets. This study utilized multivariate logistic regressions to estimate the effect of household wealth status on adverse childhood growth rate. Results The results indicate that children in the poorest 20 % of households are more than <b>three</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to suffer from adverse growth rate stunting as children from the wealthiest 20 % of households (OR= 3. 6; 95 % CI: 3. 0, 4. 3). The effect of household wealth status remain significantly large when the analysis was adjusted for a child's multiple birth status, age, gender, antenatal care, delivery assistance, birth order, and duration that the child was breastfed; mother's age at childbirth, nutritional status, education; household access to safe drinking water, arsenic in drinking water, access to a hygienic toilet facility, cooking fuel cleanliness, residence, and geographic location (OR= 2. 4; 95 % CI: 1. 8, 3. 2). Conclusion This study concludes that household wealth inequality is strongly associated with childhood adverse growth rate stunting. Reducing poverty and making services more available and accessible to the poor are essential to improving overall childhood health and nutritional status in Bangladesh. </p...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to assess}} the {{geographical}} variation in low back pain and associated disability in Britain. DESIGN [...] This was a cross sectional survey with information collected by postal questionnaire. SETTING [...] General practices in seven British towns and one rural district. SUBJECTS [...] 1172 men and 1495 women aged 20 - 59 years were selected from the age-sex registers of 136 general practitioners in the study areas. MAIN RESULTS [...] The overall lifetime and one year period prevalences of low back pain were 58. 3 % and 36. 1 %. Rates in men and women were similar. Symptoms were more common in men with manual occupations than in those with non-manual jobs, but in women there was no clear trend in relation to social class. Geographical differences in prevalence were small, but the threshold for consulting general practitioners about symptoms varied markedly from place to place. After allowance for age, sex, social class, and severity of symptoms, subjects in the northern towns of Arbroath and Peterlee who had suffered from low back pain in the past year were <b>three</b> to four <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to have consulted their doctor about the problem as those living in the southern towns of St Austell and Dorking. Consultation rates in the Midlands were intermediate. CONCLUSIONS [...] Geographical variation in rates of general practice consultation for low back pain in Britain is due largely to differences in patient behaviour once symptoms have developed. The distribution of important causes of low back back pain across the country is probably fairly uniform...|$|R
40|$|Cigarette butts are {{consistently}} the most collected items in litter clean-up efforts, {{which are a}} costly burden to local economies. In addition, tobacco waste may be detrimental to our natural environment. The tobacco industry has conducted or funded numerous studies on smokers’ littering knowledge and behavior, however, non-industry sponsored research is rare. We sought to examine whether demographics and smokers’ knowledge and beliefs toward cigarette waste as litter predicts littering behavior. Smokers aged 18 and older (n = 1, 000) were interviewed about their knowledge and beliefs towards cigarette waste as litter. Respondents {{were members of the}} Research Now panel, an online panel of over three million respondents in the United States. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to determine factors significantly predictive of ever having littered cigarette butts or having littered cigarette butts within the past month (p-value < 0. 05). The majority (74. 1 %) of smokers reported having littered cigarette butts at least once in their life, by disposing of them on the ground or throwing them out of a car window. Over half (55. 7 %) reported disposing of cigarette butts on the ground, in a sewer/gutter, or down a drain in the past month. Those who did not consider cigarette butts to be litter were over <b>three</b> and half <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to report having ever littered cigarette butts (OR = 3. 68, 95 %CI = 2. 04, 6. 66) and four <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to have littered cigarette butts in the past month (OR = 4. 00, 95 %CI = 2. 53, 6. 32).

40|$|Wastewater {{irrigation}} {{is associated}} with several benefits but {{can also lead to}} significant health risks. The health risk for contracting infections from Soil Transmitted Helminths (STHs) among farmers has mainly been assessed indirectly through measured quantities in the wastewater or on the crops alone and only on a limited scale through epidemiological assessments. In this study we broadened the concept of infection risks in the exposure assessments by measurements of the concentration of STHs both in wastewater used for irrigation and the soil, as well as the actual load of STHs ova in the stool of farmers and their family members (165 and 127 in the wet and dry seasons respectively) and a control group of non-farmers (100 and 52 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively). Odds ratios were calculated for exposure and non-exposure to wastewater irrigation. The results obtained indicate positive correlation between STH concentrations in irrigation water/soil and STHs ova as measured in the stool of the exposed farmer population. The correlations are based on reinfection during a 3 months period after prior confirmed deworming. Farmers and family members exposed to irrigation water were <b>three</b> <b>times</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> compared to the control group of non-farmers to be infected with Ascaris (OR = 3. 9, 95 % CI, 1. 15 - 13. 86) and hookworm (OR = 3. 07, 95 % CI, 0. 87 - 10. 82). This study therefore contributes to the evidence-based conclusion that wastewater irrigation contributes to a higher incidence of STHs infection for farmers exposed annually, with higher odds of infection in the wet season...|$|R

Advisors: Aaron Doering and Charles Miller. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 163 pages, appendices A-B. Learners inevitably enter adult technical training classrooms [...] indeed, in all classrooms [...] with {{different levels of}} expertise on the subject matter. When the diversity of expertise is wide and the course makes use of small group problem solving, instructors have a choice about how to group learners: they may distribute learners with greater expertise among the groups so they can provide tutoring to their less experienced classmates, or instructors may choose to segregate learners to keep those with greater expertise from dominating problem solving. The literature base on ability grouping in small groups, the bulk {{of which has been}} conducted on K- 12 learners, provides no one-size-fits-all solution, and no systematic research has been conducted on post-college adult learners in technical training situations nor on learners grouped together to solve relatively ill-structured problems. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to study the relationship between experience grouping and learning gains in small groups of adults learning to solve technical, relatively ill-structured problems. Forty-six newly hired auditors beginning their careers by taking a mandatory course centered around relatively ill-structured problem solving were assigned to stratified random groups by experience level so that some groups featured similar levels of experience and other groups featured a relatively wide range of experience. No significant differences in learning gains or satisfaction were detected between heterogeneous and homogeneous groups. Analysis of qualitative data, however, indicated that small groups exhibited significantly different behaviors depending on whether they were asked to solve relatively well-structured or ill-structured problems. When groups were asked to solve relatively ill-structured problems, learners were <b>three</b> to five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to exhibit behaviors associated with learning in problem-solving groups. Further, analysis of the qualitative data suggests, by trending toward significance, that during relatively ill-structured problem solving there is a strong parabolic relationship between the spread of experience in the small groups and the percentage of positive collaborative problem-solving strategies: as experience spread rose, groups either sought a larger or smaller percentage of explanations, a finding that reinforces other findings in the literature indicating that the relationship between high variability of expertise in small groups and achievement is complex...|$|R

5000|$|Family {{preservation}} advocates {{strive to}} protect children while empowering their families and communities. They believe that in most cases, children can best be protected by supporting their parents. The NCCPR remarks that poverty stricken families {{will not be able}} to receive the help they need under time limited assistance to care for their children, but once children are removed from the home, the foster care system may receive subsidies for an unlimited amount of time. Pelton (1993) finds that problems associated with poverty are being seen as child abuse and neglect. This leads to a situation of blaming the parent, which in turn hinders the promotion of necessary help. Criticism of IFPS based on both child safety and spending are both discredited by Pelton. As the poor lose their assistance, and in turn their children, the foster care system will become overloaded. This reduces the resources per child by case workers to place them or safe homes to care for them. As the budget goes increasingly towards investigating claims and placement, little money will be left over for any relevant services to help keep children in homes.In effect, more children will enter and increase the already overwhelmed system. If foster homes become scarce, necessitating a greater use of group homes, children will be exposed to much higher rates of danger. The NCCPR reports ten times the rate of physical abuse and 28 times the rate of sexual abuse in group homes than in the general population. These are significantly higher than the rates for foster care which are <b>three</b> <b>times</b> and twice <b>as</b> <b>likely,</b> respectively. Thieman and Dail (1997) found that low income and welfare recipients are not more likely to have a child removed from their home. This would suggest that low-economic resource families seemed to benefit from family preservation services as much as those with higher economic resources. This would discredit the idea that poverty alone endangers children. If poverty alone does not endanger children, than giving the same resources a child would receive in foster care to the family would seem the better outcome. This would first eliminate the unnecessary drain on the foster care system. Those that need to be removed for safety reasons would have greater resources, giving them a better chance to find a home and be monitored closely. Second, a child who does not enter the foster system is not affected by the possibility of the dangers existing in foster-care. And since only children considered safe are allowed to remain in the home, the proportion of endangered children will be decreased. Third, foster-care is the more expensive of the two options. The NCCPR estimates that IFPS actually produces on average $2.54 of benefits per dollar. Also child well-being is higher when children are kept in the home. The NCCPR found that pregnancy, juvenile arrests and youth unemployment were lower, even when they did not receive IFPS, but only the lesser conventional help offered by child welfare agencies. So it would be cheaper, safer, more efficient on our foster-care system and better on the well-being of children if they remain in their natural home. This is a very strong argument for family preservation advocates.|$|R
