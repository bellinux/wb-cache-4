5|$|As a {{relatively}} rural environment {{in an increasingly}} urbanised area, Kersal Moor was also used for more peaceful pursuits. During the 18th and 19th centuries it was much frequented by amateur naturalists and botanists. One of the botanists was Richard Buxton {{who went on to}} write A Botanical Guide to Manchester. In 1829 an amateur insect collector named Robert Cribb collected a series of about fifty small yellow and brown moths from a rotting alder on the moor. These {{turned out to be a}} previously unknown species of moth, but they were mistakenly attributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Cribb's, the collector R. Wood, who had asked an expert to identify them. The moths were classified as Pancalia woodiella (today Euclemensia woodiella) in Wood's honour.|$|E
5|$|Prior to forming Taxiride, Tim Watson, Tim Wild, Jason Singh, and Dan Hall {{had each}} played in cover bands across Melbourne. Watson and Wild began writing {{together}} in 1997 in Camberwell, Melbourne, and soon recruited Singh {{as an additional}} vocalist. The trio invited Hall, whom Wild first encountered busking, to join the group, and he accepted. The band named themselves Taxiride because they had given some of their early work <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> theirs, a taxi driver, who had tested these songs on passengers. The group produced a demo at Melbourne's Secret Sound Studios, {{and used it to}} land a contract with Warner in Australia. Meanwhile, a friend of the group passed their work onto a Sire Records executive in the U.S., who signed them despite the group being unknown.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} foundation {{ancestors of}} the Colorado Ranger were two stallions brought to the United States and given to US president Ulysses S. Grant by the Turkish Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1878. The first horse was a gray Barb named Linden Tree, foaled in 1874. The second was a desertbred Arabian, also gray, named Leopard, foaled in 1873. The two stallions reached Virginia in 1879, after their voyage from Turkey. Upon reaching Virginia, they spent 14 years in the breeding herds of Randolph Huntington, a noted breeder of trotting and roadster horses. In 1896, Randolph leased Leopard and Linden Tree <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Grant's, named General Colby, who used to stallions to breed a number of mares on his ranch in Nebraska. These breedings were successful at producing high-quality ranch horses, {{and a few years}} later several ranches in Colorado collaborated to buy a group of horses, including one stallion, from the Colby Ranch. All of the mares were sired by one of the two imported sires, and the stallion, a few-spot leopard Appaloosa, was a grandson of Leopard on both sides of his pedigree. The influence of Linden Tree and Leopard on American horse breeding was such that they are now listed in the studbooks for the Arabian Horse Association and the Jockey Club (which registers Thoroughbreds), both major breed associations in the United States.|$|E

25|$|In June 1846, Bagley {{gave up her}} {{position}} as editor of The Voice of Industry. Subsequent editors considered her writing too radical and undignified, and Bagley looked for another job; in February 1846, only two years after Samuel Morse's first successful demonstration of the electric telegraph, the New York and Boston Magnetic Telegraph Company opened an office in Lowell, and Bagley was hired as telegrapher. Early in 1847, Bagley was contracted to run the magnetic telegraph office in Springfield, Massachusetts. She was unhappy to discover she earned only three-quarters {{as much as the}} man she replaced, writing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> her growing commitment to human equality and the rights of women.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} {{there were a number}} of other {{practicing}} lawyers in that area, including one John McKinley. His name preceded him, and he was admitted to the Alabama bar association. McKinley, along with several other prominent members of society, successfully campaigned for Birney to become the Solicitor of Alabama's Fifth District in 1823. By the end of the year he decided to close his plantation, and sold the slaves at the plantation <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> his that was known for his good temperament and kind treatment of slaves. Following the sale of the plantation and slaves, he achieved financial stability, bought a generous plot of land and constructed a large brick house in Huntsville. As was true upon his first return to Danville years back, he once again became a member of the social elite in this new town. In addition to his duties as a public prosecutor, his private law office proved quite lucrative.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's mother, born Anne-Charlotte-Laure Sallambier, {{came from}} a family of haberdashers in Paris. Her family's wealth was a {{considerable}} factor in the match: she was eighteen {{at the time of the}} wedding, and François Balzac fifty. As the author and literary critic Sir Victor Pritchett explained, [...] "She was certainly drily aware that she had been given to an old husband as a reward for his professional services <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> her family and that the capital was on her side.

500|$|Ravel's {{mother died}} in January 1917, and he fell into a [...] "horrible despair", {{compounding}} the distress he felt at the suffering endured {{by the people of}} his country during the war. He composed few works in the war years. The Piano Trio was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is Le tombeau de Couperin, composed between 1914 and 1917. The suite celebrates the tradition of François Couperin, the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Ravel's who died in the war.|$|E
500|$|In July 1915, Michael caught {{diphtheria}} but recovered. The war {{was going}} badly for Russia {{and the following}} month Nicholas appointed himself Supreme Commander of the Russian forces. The move was not welcomed. Nicholas's bad decisions included instructing Michael to authorise a payment <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Rasputin, an army engineer called Bratolyubov, {{who claimed to have}} invented a devastating flame-thrower. The claim was bogus and Bratolyubov was arrested for fraud, but Rasputin intervened and he was released. Michael appeared gullible and naïve; a friend of Natalia's said he [...] "trusted everybody...

Knowing that Presley had been looking for help within the music industry, Strong had her play tapes for Jackson, who was impressed with Presley's voice. The pair talked {{for the remainder of the}} night, until it was time for Jackson to leave. At this point, according to Strong, the entertainer gave Presley, who was still married at the time, a penetrating look and said in a conspiratorial voice, [...] "You and me, we could get into a lot of trouble.

He sheltered in a house belonging <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Trương Như Tảng. The ruling junta appealed to Thảo in newspaper advertisements and broadcasts to follow orders to report, but he ignored them.

500|$|In May 1994, Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley, the {{daughter}} of Elvis and Priscilla Presley. They had met in 1975, when a seven-year-old Presley attended one of Jackson's family engagements at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, and reconnected through a mutual friend. According <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Presley's, [...] "their adult friendship began in November 1992 in L.A." [...] They stayed in contact every day over the telephone. As the child molestation accusations became public, Jackson became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and addiction to drugs. Presley said: [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it." [...] She eventually persuaded him to settle the civil case out of court and go into rehabilitation to recover.|$|E
500|$|In August, Johnson {{was denied}} a {{position}} as master of the Appleby Grammar School because a master's degree from Oxford or Cambridge was required. To ensure {{that he would not}} suffer rejection again, Pope asked John Gower, a man with influence in the Appleby community, to have a degree awarded to Johnson. Gower attempted to have a degree awarded to Johnson from Oxford, but he was told that it was [...] "too much to be asked." [...] Gower then wrote <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Jonathan Swift to persuade him to use his influence at the University of Dublin to have a masters awarded to Johnson, which could then be used to justify a masters awarded to Johnson from Oxford. However, Swift refused to act on Johnson's behalf. Regardless of Swift's motivation in not acting on Johnson's behalf, or how Johnson reacted to Swift's actions, it is known that Johnson then after refused to appreciate Swift as a poet, writer, or a satirist, with one exception: Swift's Tale of a Tub, of which Johnson doubted Swift's authorship.|$|E

500|$|Later that year, {{the private}} Yahoo! Mail account of Sarah Palin, Republican vice presidential {{candidate}} in the 2008 United States presidential election, was hacked by a 4chan user. This followed criticism of Palin and other politicians supposedly using private email accounts for governmental work. The hacker posted the account's password on /b/, and screenshots from within the account to Wikileaks. A /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an email <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread. However, he forgot to blank out the password in the screenshot. A multitude of /b/ users attempted to log in with the new password, and the account was automatically locked out by Yahoo!. The incident was criticized by some /b/ users, in that most reports on the hack focused on 4chan, rather than Palin's violation of campaign law. One user commented, [...] "seriously, /b/. We could have changed history and failed, epically." [...] The FBI and Secret Service began investigating the incident shortly after its occurrence. On September 20 it was revealed they were questioning David Kernell, the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell.|$|E
500|$|McLaren's {{domination}} continued throughout , and the Prost-Senna {{struggle for}} supremacy {{put them on}} a collision course. Mutual admiration turned to all-out hatred, with the Frenchman accusing his Brazilian teammate of [...] "dangerous driving" [...] and of receiving more than a fair share of attention from both McLaren and Honda. For his part, Senna accused Prost of being in the pocket of FISA's French president Jean-Marie Balestre. The animosity between the two drivers came to a head at Round 2 in San Marino. The drivers made an agreement between them that whoever won the start would not be challenged by the other going into the first turn (in this case, the Tosa bend on the Imola circuit). Prost kept to the agreement after Senna won the first start. Prost however won the restart (caused by Gerhard Berger's fiery crash in his Ferrari), but was passed by Senna under brakes for Tosa. Prost went <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> his, a French journalist, and told him about the broken agreement between him and Senna. Against Prost's wishes, the journalist went public with the story. During testing at Pembrey in Wales, Senna denied in public any such agreement had ever existed between himself and Prost, but the Frenchman's claim was backed up by Marlboro's John Hogan who had been present when the agreement was made.|$|E
500|$|Hearing of her deeds, the {{commander-in-chief}} of Chile's military, General Manuel Baquedano, summoned Morales {{to meet him}} and officially authorised her to wear the uniform of a cantinière (as she had done so without authorisation before) and gave her the rank and pay of a sergeant (sargento segundo, lit. [...] "second sergeant"). She later moved to the 4th Division, in which she served during the Tacna and Arica Campaign. At the Battle of Tacna on 26 May 1880, she continued to provide water to the exhausted men at the front lines after she received a slight wound herself. She {{was one of the}} first soldiers to enter the city of Tacna that evening, and soldiers of the Carabineros de Yungay cavalry regiment recalled her riding into the town on a horse, raising her rifle as they passed by and crying [...] "Viva Chile!". After the battle, she was stricken for some time with an illness she picked up from prisoners of war she had cared for, and she wrote a letter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> hers in Antofagasta, assuming she was on her deathbed. Nonetheless, later writers said she was present at the Battle of Arica two weeks later and ordered the mass killing of captured Peruvians, an account also inscribed on a Peruvian memorial to the dead. During January 1881, she fought at the Battle of Chorillos and Battle of Miraflores and was among the Chileans who entered Lima after the city was captured.|$|E
