5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Lithuania {{asked the}} Allied Supreme Council to intervene, and it proposed two demarcation lines to prevent open hostilities, drawn in June and July 1919 (the second one {{was known as}} the Foch Line). However, Poland ignored both lines and advanced deeper into the Lithuanian-controlled territory. Faced with pressure from the Entente, Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski, who was significantly involved in planning of the coup, did not want open Polish–Lithuanian hostilities, which could led to much bloodshed and even greater tensions between Poland and Lithuania. Instead, since he <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> enough Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to stage a coup d'etat, he decided to plan one to topple the Lithuanian government.|$|E
5|$|Habitat loss has {{occurred}} through commercial harvesting of the sago, or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds. The rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of bark and hunt it with dogs. The only described nest {{was in an}} area well-used by local villagers, and the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been <b>thought.</b> <b>There</b> <b>were</b> also several sightings in northeast Halmahera in 2008 and 2011, extending {{the area in which}} this bird has been seen in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{director}} Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui {{for the role}} of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised {{that for the first time}} he would not have to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.|$|E

5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Previously, palaeontologists had <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{multiple}} {{exchanges of}} tyrannosauroids between Asia and North America, with various forms moving between the continents via {{what is now}} Alaska and the Bering Strait into northern Russia. New studies have disrupted that hypothesis. It has been recently suggested {{that almost all of}} the Asian tyrannosauroids were part of one evolutionary lineage. It is now thought that there were separate evolutionary radiations in North America of northern and southern tyrannosaurids, with Lythronax being placed as part of the southern group. Research on UMNH VP 16690 supports that theory.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, the Germans {{attacked}} the main defense {{line of the}} Grebbe Line. Sometimes using Dutch POWs as a shield (a grave violation {{of the laws of}} war), {{by the end of the}} day they had captured this line as well. The Dutch tried to organize a counter-attack during the night, as they <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only some hundred German troops opposing them (the real number was probably somewhere around two thousand), but these met with little success. In places, they were even fired upon by other Dutch troops who had not been notified of the counterattack.|$|E

25|$|Laurents {{was horrified}} {{when he saw}} the first rough cut of the film. He <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a few good scenes, and some good moments in bad scenes, but overall {{he thought it was a}} badly photographed jumbled mess lacking coherence. Both stars {{appeared}} to be playing themselves more often than their characters, and Streisand often used a grand accent that Laurents felt hurt her performance. Pollack admitted the film was not good, accepted full responsibility for its problems, and apologized for his behavior. The following day he retreated to the editing room to improve it as much as possible. Laurents felt the changes made it better but never as good as it could have been.|$|E
500|$|... "Do You..." [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club said the song [...] "spins the ostensibly sleazy pickup line 'Do you like drugs?' into an irresistibly sweet proposal, imagining lovely, perfectly wasted afternoons {{spent in a}} content daze." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly called it a [...] "fabulous song" [...] and felt that [...] "Miguel's smooth, subtle swagger is so appealing that a line like 'I wanna do you like drugs tonight' comes off as audacious instead of offensive." [...] Rob Tannenbaum of Rolling Stone quipped, [...] "Just when you <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no new ways to say 'I love you'".|$|E
500|$|As a pianist, Bizet had showed {{considerable}} skill {{from his}} earliest years. A contemporary asserted {{that he could}} have assured a future on the concert platform, but chose to conceal his talent [...] "as though it were a vice". In May 1861 Bizet gave a rare demonstration of his virtuoso skills when, at a dinner party at which Liszt was present, he astonished everyone by playing on sight, flawlessly, one of the maestro's most difficult pieces. Liszt commented: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only two men able to surmount the difficulties... there are three, and... the youngest is perhaps the boldest and most brilliant." ...|$|E

I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's going to look like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny because I <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the troops}} of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) began to {{concentrate}} in preparation for their attacks, they left their camps standing to deceive German and Ottoman aerial reconnaissances. The EEF assumed their opponents <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> still six infantry divisions in the Gaza area {{and one in the}} eastern sector towards Beersheba. However, according to Falls, [...] "here is evidence that the [...] were fairly accurately informed of the British dispositions." [...] On 28 October, they knew the camps at Khan Yunis and Rafa [...] were empty and accurately placed three infantry divisions east of the Wadi Ghuzzee with a fourth, the 10th (Irish) Division approaching the wadi. They estimated more cavalry at Asluj and Khalasa than was actually there.|$|E

Entwistle had become {{fed up with}} recording, later saying [...] "we had to keep going back and rejuvenating the numbers... it just started to drive us mad." [...] The final recording session took place on 7 March, {{the same day that}} [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] was released as a single. The group started tour rehearsals and promotional activities for the single and Lambert went on holiday in Cairo. The mixing was left to Lyon-Shaw and assistant engineer Ted Sharp, who did not think IBC was well suited for the task. The album overshot its April deadline, as stereo mastering continued into the end of the month.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Jammer's Reviews, Jamahl Epsicokhan {{said there}} was a great deal of plot to cover in the episode and that the strands {{successfully}} came together. He singled out Avery Brooks for praise, but <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a number of stand-out performances by the cast. Epsicokhan gave the episode a score of 3.5/4 and thought that it demonstrated the direction that the series intended to go in. [...] In his review of the episode for Tor.com, Keith DeCandido praised the performance of Fletcher and called her [...] "deliciously evil". He thought that Anglim gave one of his better performances as Vedek Bareil and that the speech by Brooks to Fletcher at the end of the episode was particularly well done.|$|E
500|$|Alan Pergament, {{writing for}} The Buffalo News, awarded the episode 3 {{and a half}} stars out of five and said the episode [...] "offers a delicious take on the {{surprise}} theatrical movie hit from England." [...] Pergament <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> too many penis jokes, especially for the show's time slot, but called the dance scenes [...] "hysterically funny." [...] The Spokesman-Review's John Martin stated that while he usually condemned the [...] "cheap, tawdry use of nudity" [...] to boost ratings, it was different with Carey and he thought the take on The Full Monty was [...] "riotous" [...] and [...] "wild". Martin finished by saying [...] "Carey may be the only comic in prime time who could pull this off, so to speak. You gotta love the big guy." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Canning of IGN {{did not think}} there was anything [...] "terrible" [...] about the episode, {{but he did not}} think there was anything to get excited about, either. Canning <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a number of throwaway jokes in the episode that he felt worked well, [...] "but the episode as a whole failed to grab me. As stated, {{there are a number of}} episodes that already fit this mold, and most of those are far superior." [...] Daniel Aughey of TV Guide thought the episode provided a [...] "healthy balance" [...] of humor, story and heart. [...] "Exactly what makes a great Simpsons episode!" [...] Aughey would have liked to see Homer's storyline explored as an A story in its own episode rather than cut short as a C story.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} viewed {{positively}} by CJ Stewart at The Celebrity Cafe, who stated [...] "Overall, {{this was an}} exciting return to the familiar story structure that Fringe started out with, and yet it also moved along this season’s main story arch, with the writers doing {{an excellent job of}} that with plenty of references to the series’ mythos for fans to pick out. It’s always exciting when a serial drama like this throws us longtime viewers a few bones, isn’t it?" [...] The Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> too many [...] "Really"? moments, such as Olivia recalling the height notches in Jacksonville when playing a game of Clue. Hanson also believed the episode seemed too long, especially when compared to the [...] "best episode ever," [...] ("Peter"), which aired the previous week.|$|E
500|$|The team {{chose to}} centre {{the game on}} firefighters as they felt that fire was the most {{appropriate}} way to create fear and tension. In a retrospective interview, Ohshima said {{that many of the}} things done by firefighters—along with rescuing people—were [...] "the very essence of a Sonic Team game", and that they recognised that a firefighter was a hero with whom people could identify. The team wanted to make a game with a rescue theme as Naka <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> few games based on that concept. According to Takeo Miyoshi, [...] "Our first inspiration came from the explosion and building destruction scenes of Hollywood movies. We just wanted to describe the heroism of lifesaving in that loud, explosive type of setting." [...] The developers wanted to design a future that was [...] "clean and beautiful", with sustainable energy, but where disasters still could occur, and only heroes could protect people from them. The designers envisioned that a futuristic firefighter would be acrobatic and dexterous to reach places where people were trapped.|$|E
500|$|Television critics {{tended to}} view [...] "Cocktails" [...] positively. Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO Networks praised the episode's writing and directing, {{explaining}} that [...] " [...] {{of the credit}} goes to Paul Lieberstein for his ruthlessly funny writing, but ol' J.J. really knows how to run with the material and make awkward situations just that much more painful with his direction, {{one of the best}} episodes of the series." [...] Buddy TV writer Oscar Dahl noted that [...] "besides a couple of crafty camera moves, his work was mostly invisible, which is exactly what you want from a director on The Office." [...] IGN's Brian Zoromski appreciated the spotlight on female characters Jan, Pam, and Karen, and <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> [...] "quite a few great little moments this episode," [...] including [...] "a great Creed moment as he revealed he runs a fake ID company out of his car." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West enjoyed Karen conning Jim at the party, called Rashida Jones' performance [...] "brilliantly played"; West also liked Pam's newfound confidence, but believed she was [...] "dumb" [...] for telling Roy of her kiss with Jim.|$|E
