40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the quality of}} evidence {{for the use of}} erythromycin in preventing secondary transmission of pertussis <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> of primary cases. A literature search was undertaken and identified papers were reviewed critically. Thirteen original papers and 1 manuscript met the inclusion criteria for review (3 randomized controlled trials, 4 analytical studies and 7 descriptive studies). Evidence from both experimental and analytical studies showed little effect of the use of erythromycin in preventing secondary transmission. Its effect is at best modest when compared with the protection conferred by use of good quality whole cell vaccine. Three studies reported adverse events with erythromycin prophylaxis; these were mainly nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In countries where effective pertussis vaccines are in use, erythromycin use should be confined <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> of cases, particularly unimmunized children or partially immunized infants who would be most susceptible to the complications of pertussis, or adults who come into close contact with vulnerable children...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the importance of}} the intestinal parasites including Cryptosporidium in children of day–care centres as a cause of enteric infections and risk of spread <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> of infected children. Methods: Stool samples were collected from 43 children attending the day-care centres, 10 personnel of the centres and 55 household contacts of the children. Direct smear method and then formalin-ether sedimentation method were carried out for all stool samples to detect intestinal parasites. Fecal smears were prepared from the sediment and stained by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for the recovery of red-pink oocysts of Cryptosporidium. Results: Thirty-one (72 %) children were found to be infected for intestinal parasites compared to 1 (10 %) positive personnel and 19 (34. 5 %) positive household contacts of the children. Cryprosporidium oocysts were found to be excreted in 4 (9 %) children compared to 4 (7. 2 %) household contacts. No single positive case was recovered among the examined personnel of the day-care centres. Conclusion: The present report provided useful information on the seasonal occurrence, patterns of transmission and risk of spread <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> of infected children. The roles of children and staff in the transmission of parasitic diseases would {{contribute to the development of}} effective prevention and control measures in child care centres...|$|E
