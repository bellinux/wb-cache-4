[...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ...

2500|$|As he {{appeared}} to be an ardent Nazi, Sorge was welcome at the German Embassy. One Japanese journalist who knew Sorge described him [...] in 1935 as [...] "a typical, swashbuckling, arrogant Nazi...quick-tempered, hard-drinking". As the Japan correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung, Sorge developed a network of sources about Japanese politics, and soon German diplomats, including the ambassador Herbert von Dirksen came to depend upon Sorge as a source of intelligence about the fractious and secretive world of Japanese politics. The Japanese values of honne and tatame (the former literally means [...] "true sound", roughly [...] "as things are" [...] while the latter literally means [...] "façade" [...] or roughly [...] "as things appear"), namely the tendency of Japanese people to hide their real feelings and profess to believe in <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not, made deciphering Japan's politics especially difficult. That Sorge was fluent in Japanese further enhanced his status as a Japanologist. Sorge was very interested in Asian history and culture, especially those of China and Japan, and when sober tried {{to learn as much as}} he could. During this time, Sorge befriended General Eugen Ott, the German military attache to Japan while seducing his wife Helma. As military attache, Ott sent reports back to Berlin containing his assessments of the Imperial Japanese Army, which Frau Ott copied and passed on to Sorge, who in his turn passed them on to Moscow (through it should be noted Frau Ott believed Sorge was merely working for the Nazi Party). As the Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, German influence on the Japanese Army was strong, and Ott had good contacts with Japanese officers.|$|E

Furthermore, if learners stop to clarify <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not understand, they may have more time to process the input they receive.
