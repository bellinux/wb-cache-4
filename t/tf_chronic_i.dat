40|$|Withdrawal {{from chronic}} benzodiazepines is {{associated}} with increased anxiety and seizure susceptibility. Neuroadaptive changes in neural activity occur in limbo-cortical structures although changes {{at the level of}} the GABAA receptor do not provide an adequate explanation for these functional changes. We have employed two diazepam treatment regimes known to produce differing effects on withdrawal aversion in the rat and examined whether withdrawal-induced anxiety was accompanied by changes in AMPA receptor characteristics. Rats were given 28 days treatment with diazepam by the intraperitoneal (i. p.) route (5 mg/kg) and the subcutaneous (s. c.) route (15 mg/kg). Withdrawal anxiety in the elevated plus maze was evident in the group withdrawn from chronic s. c. diazepam (relatively more stable plasma levels) but not from the <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> p. group (fluctuating daily plasma levels). In the brains of these rats, withdrawal anxiety was accompanied by increased [3 H]Ro 48 8587 binding in the hippocampus and thalamus, and decreased GluR 1 and GluR 2 subunit mRNA expression in the amygdala (GluR 1 and GluR 2) and cortex (GluR 1). The pattern of changes was different in the <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> p. group where in contrast to the chronic s. c. group, there was reduced [3 H]Ro 48 8587 binding in the hippocampus and no alterations in GluR 1 and GluR 2 subunit expression in the amygdala. While both groups showed reduced GluR 1 mRNA subunit expression in the cortex overall, only the agranular insular cortex exhibited marked reductions following <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> p. diazepam. Striatal GluR 2 mRNA expression was increased in the i. p. group but not the s. c. group. Taken together, these data are consistent with differential neuroadaptive processes in AMPA receptor plasticity being important in withdrawal from chronic benzodiazepines. Moreover, these processes may differ both at a regional and receptor function level according to the behavioral manifestations of withdrawal...|$|R

40|$|<b>Chronic</b> <b>i.</b> v. {{administration}} of a competitive antagonist of arginine-vasopressin (AVP), d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) -VAVP, in Sprague-Dawley rats induced only a transient diabetes insipidus (DI) -like state. Water excretion and intake were markedly increased {{on the first}} day of administration but subsequently reverted to normal. A similar response to the antagonist was observed upon continuous i. v. infusion in Brattleboro rats, homozygous for hereditary hypothalamic DI, which had been substituted with exogenous AVP. This excludes the possibility that increased secretion of endogenous AVP had overcome the blocking effect of the competitive antagonist in Sprague-Dawley rats. However, when AVP was withdrawn from chronically AVP-treated DI rats, water intake increased to values higher than those observed after the antagonist. Subsequently, water intake also decreased but remained elevated compared to that of AVP-substituted rats receiving the antagonist. This suggests that the antagonist might have AVP-like agonistic properties that limit its efficacy and allow compensatory mechanisms to restore normal water balance despite continuous blockade of AVP receptors. The agonistic properties of d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) VAVP were verified upon <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> v. administration in nonpretreated DI rats. Thus, the normalization of water balance in Sprague-Dawley rats chronically receiving d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) VAVP is probably due to the activation of compensatory mechanisms and to the agonistic effects of d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) VAVP...|$|R

40|$|The brain {{hypothalamus}} contains certain secreted {{molecules that}} are important in regulating feeding behaviour. Here we show that nesfatin, corresponding to NEFA/nucleobindin 2 (NUCB 2), a secreted protein of unknown function, is expressed in the appetite-control hypothalamic nuclei in rats. Intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) injection of NUCB 2 reduces feeding. Rat cerebrospinal fluid contains nesfatin- 1, an amino-terminal fragment derived from NUCB 2, and its expression is decreased in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus under starved conditions. I. c. v. injection of nesfatin- 1 decreases food intake in a dose-dependent manner, whereas injection of an antibody neutralizing nesfatin- 1 stimulates appetite. In contrast, i. c. v. injection of other possible fragments processed from NUCB 2 does not promote satiety, and conversion of NUCB 2 to nesfatin- 1 is necessary to induce feeding suppression. <b>Chronic</b> <b>i.</b> c. v. injection of nesfatin- 1 reduces body weight, whereas rats gain body weight after <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> c. v. injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotide against the gene encoding NUCB 2. Nesfatin- 1 -induced anorexia occurs in Zucker rats with a leptin receptor mutation, and an anti-nesfatin- 1 antibody does not block leptin-induced anorexia. In contrast, central injection of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone elevates NUCB 2 gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus, and satiety by nesfatin- 1 is abolished by an antagonist of the melanocortin- 3 / 4 receptor.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and related intracellular second messengers, {{in the development of}} morphine tolerance and dependence. The mGluRs are divided into three groups: group I mGluRs are positively coupled to phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis, while group II and III mGluRs are negatively coupled to cyclic adensoine- 3 $ sp prime$, 5 $ sp prime$-monophosphate (cAMP) production. Opioid receptors are also coupled to these same systems, and have been shown to elicit changes in these messenger systems during chronic treatment. We showed that <b>chronic</b> intracerebroventricular (<b>i.</b> c. v.) administration of selective group II and III mGluR antagonists concurrently with subcutaneous (s. c.) morphine significantly reduced the severity of precipitated withdrawal symptoms. Conversely, acute i. c. v. injection of a selective group II mGluR antagonist just prior to the precipitation of withdrawal significantly exacerbated the severity of abstinence symptoms. In addition, acute i. c. v. injection of a selective group II mGluR agonist just prior to the precipitation of withdrawal significantly reduced abstinence symptoms. From these results we hypothesized that chronic opioid treatment may induce a desensitization of group II mGluRs. We also demonstrated that <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> c. v. infusion of a selective group I mGluR antagonist concurrently with s. c. morphine significantly attenuated the precipitated withdrawal syndrome. In addition, we showed that <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> c. v. antagonism of $ delta$-opioid receptors with a highly selective antagonist also decreased the development of morphine dependence, as well as tolerance. Since both group I mGluRs and $ delta$-opioid receptors are positively coupled to PI hydrolysis, further evidence for a role of products of PI hydrolysis in the development of morphine dependence was obtained when we showed that selective chronic inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activation, as well as selective chronic inhibition of intracellular Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$ release, concurrently with morphine treatment significantly reduced the severity of abstinence symptoms. Thus, compensatory changes usually elicited by chronic opioid treatment may be counteracted by antagonizing receptors positively coupled to PI hydrolysis, as well as by inhibiting products of PI hydrolysis. In the General Discussion, we propose a model based on the possible interaction of mGluRs and opioid receptors, via related intracellular second messengers, to explain the development of morphine dependence...|$|R

This study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} intrathecal (i. t.) infusion of a metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR 1) antisense oligonucleotide, concomitant with chronic morphine treatment, on the development of tolerance to morphine's antinociceptive effects. All rats received chronic (6 day) s. c. administration of morphine to induce opioid tolerance. Additionally, rats were treated with either mGluR 1 antisense (AS), missense (MIS) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) by i. t. infusion via chronically implanted i. t. catheters connected to osmotic mini-pumps. The effects of acute i. t. or s. c. morphine on tail-flick latencies were assessed prior to and following chronic s. c. morphine treatment for all <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> t. infusion groups. mGluR 1 protein level in the spinal cord was determined by Western blot analysis for all treatments, assessing the efficiency of knock-down with AS treatment. Acute i. t. morphine dose-dependently produced antinociception in the tail-flick test in naïve rats. Systemic morphine-treated rats administered i. t.

The spinal mGluR 1 protein level was dramatically decreased after mGluR 1 AS infusion when compared to control animals (naïve and ACSF-treated animals).

Infusions were {{preceded by a}} 5 -day control period and followed by a 5 -day recovery period. Water intake, urine output, water "balance" (water intake minus urine output), urinary sodium and potassium excretions were determined daily. Arterial pressure, heart rate, plasma electrolytes (sodium and potassium), plasma volume, and extracellular fluid vol-ume were determined at 5 -day intervals. <b>Chronic</b> <b>i.</b> v. t. infusion of AH resulted in reversible, dose-dependent in-creases in arterial pressure, water intake, and urinary sodium excretion, and decreases in plasma sodium, plasma potassium, and water balance. Infusions of normal saline i. v. t. (n = 5) did not significantly alter {{any of the above}} values. Intravenous infusion of the same doses of AH raised arterial pressure to a similar degree as that from i. v. t. administration, but did not significantly affect any of the other measured variables. In an addi-tional group of 10 rabbits, AH was infused at 3 Mg/nr '•*•* • for 5 days, and the acute cardiovascular actions of i. v. t. saralasin (10 fig), i. v. saralasin (4 Mg/kg/min), and "total " autonomic blockade were compared to the effects of these treatments in five saline-infused rabbits. No significant differences in responses of the two groups were found.

Also, PRL-R AS treatment impaired maternal behaviour (P< 0. 05), whereas physiological parameters of lactation (weight gain of the litter, number of milk ejection reflexes during a 20 -min suckling period) were not affected. PRL-R AS treatment further evoked an increase (P< 0. 05) in the stress-induced adrenocorticotropin release, demonstrating an inhibitory role of PRL on HPA axis responses in lactation. Inhibition of stress responses of the oxytocin system by brain PRL was evidenced by higher stress-induced (P< 0. 05) plasma oxytocin concentration in PRL-R AS-treated lactating rats and, in contrast, decreased stress-induced oxytocin release (P< 0. 01) in <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> c. v. ovine PRL-treated (1 mug/ 0. 5 muL/h) virgin rats. Finally, an increased expression of the hypothalamic PRL gene was seen by RT-PCR in pregnancy and lactation, suggesting an activated state of the brain PRL system during the peripartum period. In summary, activation of the brain PRL system in the peripartum period significantly contributes to emotional and neuroendocrine adaptations, including downregulation of the responsiveness of the HPA axis and oxytocin systems to stressors seen at this ti...|$|R
40|$|Hair {{cortisol}} concentrations (HCC) {{are receiving}} increased attention as a novel biomarker of psychophysiological responses to <b>chronic</b> stress. <b>I</b> examined {{the validity of}} HCC as a marker of psychosocial stress in mother-daughter dyads characterized by high (n = 30) or low (n = 30) maternal <b>chronic</b> stress. Additionally, <b>I</b> examined whether early care and daughters’ symptoms moderated similarity of HCC levels within dyads. Finally, <b>I</b> examined <b>chronic</b> stress and early caregiving as potential mediators of children’s cortisol stability. High-stress mothers had significantly lower HCC compared to low-stress mothers. Further, HCC in daughters {{were significantly associated with}} previously assessed salivary cortisol reactivity. Mother-daughter HCC associations were significantly moderated by negative parenting styles and children’s internalizing symptoms. Results did not support the mediating roles of either chronic stress or caregiving in the stability of children’s cortisol. Findings overall indicate that HCC may be a useful marker of cortisol responses to chronic stress...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{symptoms}} of diabetes is the progressive development of neuropathies. One mechanism to replace neurons in the CNS is through the activation of stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells. We have tested {{the effects of the}} novel GLP- 1 mimetics exenatide (exendin- 4; Byetta) and liraglutide (NN 2211; Victoza), which are already on the market as treatments for type 2 diabetes, on the proliferation rate of progenitor cells and differentiation into neurons in the dentate gyrus of brains of mouse models of diabetes. GLP- 1 analogues were injected subcutaneously for 4, 6, or 10 weeks once daily in three mouse models of diabetes: ob/ob mice, db/db mice, or high-fat-diet-fed mice. Twenty-four hours before perfusion, animals were injected with 5 '-bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to mark dividing progenitor cells. By using immunohistochemistry and stereological methods, the number of progenitor cells or doublecortin-positive young neurons in the dentate gyrus was estimated. We found that, in all three mouse models, progenitor cell division was enhanced compared with nondiabetic controls after <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> p. injection of either liraglutide or exendin- 4 by 100 - 150 % (...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The adult brain {{undergoes}} activity-dependent plastic modifications during pathological processes, {{that are}} reminiscent of those observed during development. For example, seizures induce neuronal loss, neurogenesis, axonal and dentritic sprouting, gliosis and circuit remodelling. Neurotrophic factors, and Fibroblast Growth Factor- 2 (FGF- 2) in particular, are well-known mediators {{in each of the}} above cellular events. Aim of this mini-review is to summarize and discuss the data supporting the idea that FGF- 2 may be involved in seizure generation and in their sequelae. Methods. Epilepsy models: kainate and kindling. FGF- 2 knock mice; FGF- 2 overexpressing mice. Results. 1) Seizures increase FGF- 2 mRNA and protein levels in specific brain areas and up-regulate the expression of its receptor FGFR- 1. 2) Acute intra-hippocampal injection of FGF- 2 cause seizures, while <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> c. v. infusion of low dose FGF- 2 does not affect kainate seizures but promote behavioural recovery and reduces hippocampal damage. 3) Kainate seizures severity is not altered in FGF- 2 knock-out mice, but is increased in FGF- 2 over-expressing mice. Conclusions. FGF- 2 is implicated in seizure susceptibility and in seizure-induced plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Previous European surveys {{showed the}} support of {{healthcare}} professionals for treatment withdrawal [i. e., artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) in chronic vegetative state (VS) patients]. The recent definition of minimally conscious state (MCS), and possibly research advances (e. g., functional neuroimaging), may have lead to uncertainty regarding potential residual perception and may have influenced opinions of healthcare professionals. The aim {{of the study was}} to update the end-of-life attitudes towards VS and to determine the end-of-life attitudes towards MCS. A 16 -item questionnaire related to consciousness, pain and end-of-life issues in <b>chronic</b> (<b>i.</b> e., [1 year) VS and MCS and locked-in syndrome was distributed among attendants of medical and scientific conferences around Europe (n = 59). During a lecture, the items were explained orally to the attendants who needed to provide written yes/no responses. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses identified differences and associations for age, European region, religiosity, profession, and gender. We here report data on items concerning end-of-life issues on chronic VS and MCS. Responses were collected from 2, 475 participants. For chronic VS ([1 year), 66 % of healthcare professionals agreed to withdraw treatment and 82 % wished not to be kept aliv...|$|R
40|$|Ghrelin {{increases}} {{food intake}} and decreases energy expenditure, {{promoting a positive}} energy balance. We observed a single case of serious hypothermia during sustained ghrelin treatment in a male subject, suggesting that ghrelin {{may play a role}} in the regulation of body temperature. We therefore investigated the effect of ghrelin treatment on body temperature in rodents and humans under controlled conditions. Intriguingly, we could demonstrate ghrelin binding in axon terminals of the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus located in the vicinity of cold-sensitive neurons. This localization of ghrelin receptors provides a potential anatomical basis for the regulation of body temperature by ghrelin. However, our follow-up studies also indicated that neither a <b>chronic</b> <b>i.</b> c. v. application of ghrelin in rats, nor a single s. c. injection under cold exposure in mice resulted in a relevant decrease in body core temperature. In addition, a four-hour intravenous ghrelin infusion did not decrease body surface temperature in healthy humans. We concluded that while there is a theoretical molecular basis for ghrelin to modify body temperature in mammals, its magnitude is irrelevant under physiologic circumstances. Hypothermia is not likely to represent a serious risk associated with this agent and pathway...|$|R
