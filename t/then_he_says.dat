He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E

2500|$|McLure {{says that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the play by a vision that came to him of a poster advertising a boxing match between Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid. Before he began to write, {{he went to the}} printer that created boxing posters in San Francisco, and had the poster of his vision printed up. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> [...] "I put the poster up on fences, windows, and in liquor stores where boxing posters would be, and put one up behind my head in the room I worked in at the time, which overlooked the bridge and the ocean.

They began enacting the play and I began typing it up. They'd say a few pages, I just typed it. I thought it was a nature poem about mammal sexuality and mammal love. It could have been a tantric ritual." ...|$|E
