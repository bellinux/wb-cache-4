40|$|At {{the tail}} of its {{velocity}} distribution, cold dark matter (DM) can annihilate at finite temperature to states heavier than itself. We explore the possibility that DM freezeout is dictated by these "forbidden annihilations" at the electroweak scale. Demanding that annihilation products be Standard Model particles, we find that for the forbidden mechanism to primarily set the DM relic abundance, DM must couple predominantly, if not solely, to top quarks. This can be arranged by invoking a non-trivial flavor structure such as Minimal Flavor Violation. We avail two avenues to achieve the correct <b>thermal</b> <b>cross-section,</b> requiring a mediator exchanged in the $s$- or $t$-channel. These simplified models submit easily to direct detection and collider searches, and necessarily hide from indirect detection signals. Viable supersymmetric spectra involving the forbidden mechanism may be found if combined with co-annihilation. Comment: 16 pages, 05 figure...|$|E
40|$|We derive {{constraints}} on parameters of generic dark matter candidates by comparing the-oretical predictions with the gamma-ray emission observed by the Fermi-LAT {{from the region}} around the Galactic Center. Our analysis is conservative since it simply requires that the ex-pected dark matter signal does not exceed the observed emission. The constraints obtained in the likely case that the collapse of baryons to the Galactic Center is accompanied by the con-traction of the dark matter are strong. In particular, we find that for bb ̄ and τ+τ − or W+W− dark matter annihilation channels, the upper limits on the annihilation cross section imply that the thermal cross section is excluded for a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) mass smaller than about 700 and 500 GeV, respectively.

Eight new heat flow determinations (offshore) are used, in conjunction with existing heat flow data and a theoretical surface heat flow value at the deformation front, to establish a complete surface heat flow profile across the CSZ in northern Oregon (45 °N). A heat flow profile north of the Mendocino Triple Junction (MTJ) in northern California (40 °N), utilizing existing heat flow data and a theoretical deformation front heat flow value, was also constructed to investigate the thermal effects of subduction of the even younger Gorda plate and to compare the seismicity in the MTJ area with our thermal model for the CSZ. <b>Thermal</b> <b>cross-sections</b> were constructed using the following methodology. Heat generation was removed from a “low ” and “high ” surface heat flow profile to obtain a basal (i. e., along the décollement) heat flow boundary condition.

Three main parameters of the Fertile-Free Fuel (FFF) lattices were evaluated: Moderator Temperature Coefficient (MTC), Fuel Temperature Coefficient due to Doppler Effect (DC), and soluble Boron reactivity worth (BW). One of the major design challenges associated with utilization of FFF is deterioration of the temperature coefficients and control materials reactivity worth caused by high <b>thermal</b> <b>cross-section</b> of Pu and consequent hardening of the neutron spectrum.

Consequently, DM evaporation is less important in WDs and DM with masses M_χ≳ 100 and annihilation cross-sections orders of magnitude below the canonical <b>thermal</b> <b>cross-section</b> (≳ 10 ^- 46 ^ 3 /s) can significantly alter WD cooling in particular astrophysical environments.

This study presents newly corrected temperature data and improved temperature maps in order to (i) validate or to invalidate the thermal anomalies previously identified and (ii) relate deep temperatures with major geological structures of the area. Although thermal gradient varies from place to place, it averages 31. 3 °C/km in the Provence basin (from 30. 6 to 32. 5 °C/km in average for France according to the chosen database), but some places show gradients reaching 36 °C/km. To characterize thermal anomalous areas, a three-dimensional model of the temperatures was built between the surface and 6 km depth, allowing us to elaborate <b>thermal</b> maps and <b>cross-sections.</b> The identified <b>thermal</b> anomalies {{are different from those}} obtained by former works.

PoS ICRC 2015 (2015) International audienceThe Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) {{will have}} a unique chance of discovery for a large range of masses in Weakly Interacting Massive Particles models of dark matter. The principal target for dark matter searches with CTA is {{the centre of the}} Galactic Halo. The best strategy is to perform CTA observations within a few degrees of the Galactic Centre, with the Galactic Centre itself and the most intense diffuse emission regions removed from the analysis. Assuming a cuspy dark matter density profile for the Milky Way, 500 hours of observations in this region provide sensitivities to and below the <b>thermal</b> <b>cross-section</b> of dark matter annihilations, for masses between a few hundred GeV and a few tens of TeV; therefore CTA {{will have a}} significant chance of discovery in some models.

40|$|Galaxy {{clusters}} {{are promising}} targets for indirect dark matter searches. Gamma-ray signatures from the decay or annihilation {{of dark matter}} particles inside these clusters could be observable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Based on three years of Fermi LAT gamma-ray data, we analyze the flux coming from eight nearby clusters individually {{as well as in}} a combined likelihood analysis. Concentrating mostly on signals from dark matter decay, we take into account uncertainties of the cluster masses as determined by X-ray observations and model the cluster emission as extended sources. Searching for different hadronic and leptonic decay and annihilation spectra, we do not find significant emission from any of the considered clusters and present limits on the dark matter lifetime and annihilation cross-section. We compare our lifetime limits derived from cluster observations with the limits that can be obtained from the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGBG), and find that in case of hadronic decay the cluster limits become competitive at dark matter masses below a few hundred GeV. In case of leptonic decay, however, galaxy cluster limits are stronger than the limits from the EGBG over the full considered mass range. Finally, we show that in presence of dark matter substructures down to 10 ^- 6 solar masses the limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section could improve by a factor of a few hundred, possibly going down to the <b>thermal</b> <b>cross-section</b> of 3 10 ^- 26 cm^ 3 s^- 1 for dark matter masses < 150 GeV and annihilation into bb̅.

40|$|Cold {{dark matter}} models predict the {{existence}} {{of a large number of}} substructures within dark matter haloes. If the cold dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles, their annihilation within these substructures could lead to diffuse GeV emission that would dominate the annihilation signal of the host halo. In this work we search for GeV emission from three nearby galaxy clusters: Coma, Virgo and Fornax. We first remove known extragalactic and galactic diffuse gamma-ray backgrounds and point sources from the Fermi 2 -yr catalogue and find a significant residual diffuse emission in all three clusters. We then investigate whether this emission is due to (i) unresolved point sources, (ii) dark matter annihilation or (iii) cosmic rays (CR). Using 45 months of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) data we detect several new point sources (not present in the Fermi 2 -yr point source catalogue) which contaminate the signal previously analysed by Han et al. Including these and accounting for the effects of undetected point sources, we find no significant detection of extended emission from the three clusters studied. Instead, we determine upper limits on emission due to dark matter annihilation and CR. For Fornax and Virgo, the limits on CR emission are consistent with theoretical models, but for Coma the upper limit is a factor of 2 below the theoretical expectation. Allowing for systematic uncertainties associated with the treatment of CR, the upper limits on the cross-section for dark matter annihilation from our clusters are more stringent than those from analyses of dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way. Adopting a boost factor of ∼ 103 from subhaloes on cluster luminosity as suggested by recent theoretical models, we rule out the <b>thermal</b> <b>cross-section</b> for supersymmetric dark matter particles for masses as large as 100 GeV (depending on the annihilation channel) ...|$|E

Neutron images of acid-etched porous patterns show that the degree of branching, and the tortuosity of the etched patterns depend on competing effects of acid flow rate, dissolution rate and precipitation rate of the reaction products. The fine structure of etched pathways show that they can propagate against the direction of flow, a phenomenon not previously observed. In a second study, realtime neutron transmission imaging was used to visualize miscible tracer dispersion. It was shown how quantitative information such as the in-situ spatial distributions of the tracer concentrations can be obtained with this technique...|$|R
40|$|I {{summarize}} the {{recent advances in}} determining the effects of self-annihilating WIMP dark matter on the modification of the recombination history, at times earlier than the formation of astrophysical objects. Depending on mass and self-annihilation cross section, WIMP DM can reproduce sizable amounts of the total free electron abundance at z > 6; as known, this affects the CMB temperature and polarization correlation spectra, {{and can be used}} to place stringent bounds in the particle mass vs cross-section plane. WMAP 5 data already strongly disfavor the region capable to explain the recent cosmic positron and electrons anomalies in terms of DM annihilation, whereas in principle the Planck mission has the potential to see a signal produced by a candidate laying in that region, or from WIMPs with <b>thermal</b> annihilation <b>cross-sections</b> = 3 e- 26 cm 3 /s and masses below 50 GeV.
