25|$|Census {{data from}} the early years shows how Ozone Park was a sparsely {{populated}} neighborhood {{because of the lack}} of transportation. By 1915, the Fulton Street Line opened, connecting Ozone Park with the rest of New York City, thus starting the enormous influx by the Italians. Ozone Park then formed many smaller sub-neighborhoods with specific identities. The Tudor Village section, which is still known by this name, was located on the south bordered by Pitkin Avenue and North Conduit Avenue and from east to west Cross Bay Boulevard and North Conduit Avenue. Centreville, which also still uses this name, is bordered by Aqueduct on the east, Cross Bay Boulevard on the west, North Conduit Avenue on the south, and Rockaway Boulevard on the north. Liberty Heights, which is only known by <b>the</b> <b>old-timers,</b> is a triangular area bordered by Liberty Avenue on the south, diagonal-running 101st Avenue (Jerome Avenue) from the southwest to the northeast, and Woodhaven Boulevard to the east. Balsam Village, which is also known by <b>the</b> <b>old-timers,</b> was named after Balsam Farms, which sold off parcels of land for development, and is bordered by Liberty Avenue on the north, 84th Street on the west, and Cross Bay Boulevard on the east.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{all of the}} rivalries of the NCAA {{originated}} from the basketball court, since basketball is the sport most covered by the media, especially on television. Most of the rivalries started due to the schools' compositions, because four of <b>the</b> <b>old-timer</b> six were schools exclusively for males from affluent families. These rivalries have declined in recent years with the withdrawal of two of <b>the</b> <b>old-timer</b> six, Ateneo and La Salle.|$|R

[...] "The new-comers {{get in on}} the rich creeks, and <b>the</b> <b>old-timers,</b> who dared and {{suffered}} and made this country, get nothing. Old-timers made this discovery on Squaw Creek--how it leaked out is the mystery--and they sent word up to all <b>the</b> <b>old-timers</b> on Sea Lion. But it's ten miles farther than Dawson, and when they arrive they'll find the creek staked to the skyline by the Dawson chechakos. It isn't right, it isn't fair, such perversity of luck." ...|$|E
6000|$|She nodded, and {{continued}} earnestly: [...] "Remember, I shall never forgive {{myself for the}} trick I played on the Squaw Creek stampede unless you win this Mono claim. And if any man can win this race against <b>the</b> <b>old-timers,</b> it's you." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old-Timer</b> (Bill Thompson) – a hard-of-hearing {{senior citizen}} with {{a penchant for}} {{distorting}} jokes, prefacing each one by saying, [...] "That ain't the way I heer'd it!" [...] For no apparent reason, he refers to Fibber as [...] "Johnny" [...] and Molly as [...] "Daughter". A recurring joke is that he refuses to tell his real name. In the 1940 episode [...] "Mailing Christmas Packages", he is referred to by another character as [...] "Roy", while in one episode (01/29/1946 and reiterated in the episode a week later) he claims his name is [...] "Rupert Blasingame". In the 3/25/41 episode, [...] "Fibber Changes His Name", he appears as Mr. Fumble, a lawyer. Also, in the 3/14/39 episode, Fibber calls him Mr. Sims, but he's having trouble with his memory in this episode, so this may be just an error in remembering, as he also calls Mr. Wilcox [...] "Harpo" [...] for perhaps the first time instead of Harlow, due to poor memory tricks. <b>The</b> <b>Old-Timer's</b> girlfriend is named Bessie, and she usually refers to him as [...] "O.T."

50|$|Tenderfoot Burton and {{his wife}} join forces with an old {{prospector}} {{to search for the}} rich gold strike of which <b>the</b> <b>old-timer</b> claims to know.

60|$|So quickly, so deftly and methodically, {{did they}} go about making a {{temporary}} camp, that Joy, watching with jealous eyes, admitted to herself that <b>the</b> <b>old-timers</b> could not do it better.

50|$|To sell American Flyer {{electric}} {{trains and}} other A.C. Gilbert products, the live series appeared {{for the eight}} weeks leading to Christmas 1948 and again in 1949.

60|$|The partners, true to <b>the</b> <b>old-timer</b> custom, had {{intended}} to stake down- stream from the strike, but when they saw claim 81 BELOW blazed on a tree,--which meant fully eight miles below Discovery,--they changed their minds.

60|$|And all {{the time}} the Northland was {{preparing}} to play its own huge joke.

After all the risk and toil and faithful endeavour, it was destined that few of the heroes should be in at the finish when Too Much Gold turned its yellow-treasure to the stars.|$|E
60|$|There {{was little}} {{likelihood}} of her identity being discovered, for Cal Galbraith {{and the rest}} of <b>the</b> <b>Old-Timers</b> were like lost children among the many strangers who had rushed into the land. Besides, the frost of the North has a bitter tongue, and the tender women of the South, to shield their cheeks from its biting caresses, were prone to the use of canvas masks. With faces obscured and bodies lost in squirrel-skin parkas, a mother and daughter, meeting on trail, would pass as strangers.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of the few}} known {{persons to}} have entered the Source was an amalgam of Zeus, Odin, Ares, Jove, and Highfather. Six others are known also to have passed the Source Wall: Superman in DC Line One Million, set several hundred centuries in the future, is implied to have passed through the Source Wall and studied under the Source itself, gaining many abilities, Barry Allen (in Super-Team Family #15), the Spectre (both Jim Corrigan and Hal Jordan), Metron working with Swamp Thing (in Swamp Thing #62), and Lucifer Morningstar. Highfather and Darkseid {{together}} have managed to destroy the Source Wall before. The Flash went into the Source for a cure for Orion of the New Gods, but did not remember anything from his time within. The original Spectre, Jim Corrigan, once passed {{through a crack in}} the wall and entered the Source during the [...] "Genesis" [...] crossover in Spectre (vol. 3) #58 while searching for God, who was missing from Heaven. During his time within the Source, he was given a brief glimpse {{of what it was like}} to be [...] "God" [...] before being forcefully shunted from the Source to continue his quest elsewhere with the vague instructions, [...] "First to Earth, then within." [...] And during the short time that Hal Jordan spent as the Spectre, he also passed beyond the Source Wall and had a conversation with <b>the</b> <b>Old-Timer,</b> formerly one of the Guardians of the Universe, and saw a giant Green Lantern battery. While talking with <b>the</b> <b>Old-Timer,</b> he asked him, [...] "Is this the Source?" [...] <b>The</b> <b>Old-Timer</b> replied, [...] "It is your understanding of it." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Old-Timer</b> then brought Jordan into the battery and explained to him that without any positive or negative charge, there would be no energy or life. After leaving the Source, Jordan felt as though a part of himself was still in the Source. When Lucifer went past the Source Wall, he saw what looked like a huge yellowish man made of rock. Lucifer then stood on its shoulder while looking for Michael in the DC Universe. Whether or not this is what the Source really looks like or is how Lucifer views the Source is left unknown. It seems that humans and other beings, such as angels, when they pass the Source Wall view the Source differently.|$|R

[...] "I don't know any reason why you two shouldn't have those guns until I come back; they'll keep better if they're used and rubbed out once in a while, and there's a box of shells in the wagon.

6000|$|But the Northland {{was not yet}} {{done with}} its joke. When fall came on and the heroes {{returned}} to Forty Mile and to Circle City, they listened calmly to the up-river tales of Siwash discoveries and loafers' prospects, and shook their heads. They judged by the calibre of the men interested, and branded it a bunco game. But glowing reports continued to trickle down the Yukon, {{and a few of}} <b>the</b> <b>old-timers</b> went up to see. They looked over the ground--the unlikeliest place for gold in all their experience--and they went down the river again, [...] "leaving it to the Swedes." ...|$|E
60|$|Returning {{that night}} to his camp {{at the mouth of}} Klondike, he found in it Kama, the Indian he had left at Dyea. Kama was {{travelling}} by canoe, bringing in the last mail of the year. In his possession was some two hundred dollars in gold-dust, which Daylight immediately borrowed. In return, he arranged to stake a claim for him, which he was to record when he passed through Forty Mile.
