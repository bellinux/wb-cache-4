5|$|The elite, hand-selected {{audience}} members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond {{the pleasures of}} beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concertos audience would sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women's music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit under a tree to listen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladies,</b> and follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners.|$|E

Sources disagree as to whether the duchess moved into the dance and drew the King aside to speak to him, or whether the King moved away toward the audience.

Wry reference {{is made to}} Deed and Jo's relationship, with Lawson writing that Deed [...] "is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC". Writing on the programme's accessibility to an audience, Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian calls it [...] "talkative in the way television plays used to be when they had something to say. But it is notable that, in a profession famous for obfuscation, Deed uses only the most pellucid English".

500|$|Some Poor Law Unions {{opted to}} send {{destitute}} {{children to the}} British colonies, in particular to Canada and Australia, where it was hoped {{the fruits of their}} labour would contribute to the defence of the empire and enable the colonies to buy more British exports.

500|$|These composers wrote music either {{inspired}} by the concerto delle donne or specifically for them. Such works are characterized by a high tessitura, a virtuosic and [...] style, and a wide range. Lodovico Agostini's third book of madrigals was perhaps the first publication fully dedicated to the new singing style. Agostini dedicated songs to Guarini, Peverara, and Luzzaschi. Gesualdo wrote music for the group in 1594 while visiting Ferrara to marry the Duke's niece Leonora d'Este. De Wert's Seventh Book of Madrigals à 5 and Marenzio's First Book à 6 were the first true musical monuments to the new concerto delle donne. Monteverdi's Canzonette a tre voci was probably influenced by the [...] "Ladies of Ferrara". Although the only works clearly intended for or {{inspired by}} the concerto delle donne were works for multiple high voices executing written-out diminutions, in practice concerts with the concerto delle donne included the older style of solo ornamented madrigals with instrumental accompaniment. Peverara was singularly lauded for her skill in this genre. Works written for the concerto delle donne were not limited to music: Torquato Tasso and G.B. Guarini wrote poems dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> in the concerto, {{some of which were}} later set by composers. Tasso wrote over seventy-five poems to Peverara alone.|$|E
500|$|Lambert {{shared his}} {{interests}} {{and knowledge of}} sports, dogs and animal husbandry with London's middle and upper classes, and it soon became highly fashionable to visit him, or become his friend. Many called repeatedly; one banker made 20visits, paying the admission fee on each occasion. During this period of English history no real stigma was attached to obesity, and Lambert was generally considered a wonder to be marvelled at, rather than a freak to be gawped or sneered at. His business venture was immediately successful, drawing around 400paying visitors per day. His home was described as having {{the air of a}} fashionable resort, rather than that of an exhibition, and he was pleased to find that his customers generally treated him with courtesy, and not simply as a spectacle. He insisted on maintaining amongst his visitors an atmosphere of civility and all men entering his rooms were obliged to remove their hats. One visitor refused to remove his [...] "even if the King were present" [...] but Lambert replied that [...] "Then by G——, Sir, you must instantly quit this room, as I do not consider it a mark of respect due to myself, but <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladies</b> and gentlemen who honor me with their company." ...|$|E
