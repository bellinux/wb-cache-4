40|$|The Cooperative {{continues}} to actively address a {{diverse array of}} {{issues related to the}} effective use of wood utility poles. The trials {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} MITC-Fume are now in their seventh year and continue to show that methylisothiocyanate (MITC) levels in MITC-Fume treatments remain higher than comparable metham sodium treatments. The levels of chemical are, however, declining, suggesting that this treatment may need replenishment in 3 to 5 years. Trials with the solid wood fumigant Basamid continue to show that MITC release can be enhanced by addition of small amounts of copper. Field trials suggest that these additives become less important with time. As a result, unamended Basamid may be suitable for treatment where the risk of immediate decay is not high, but the utility wishes to protect against future attack. Field trials with various water-diffusible internal treatments continue to show that these treatments move more slowly through Douglas-fir heartwood than do fumigants. Boron levels in pole sections treated with fused borate rods remain at levels that will protect against fungal attack 6 years after treatment. Similar trials with a boron/ fluoride rod indicate that neither fluoride or boron levels in the poles are adequate for wood protection 2 years after treatment. While the dosages tested were relatively low, the volumes of chemical were similar to the liquid volumes normally applied during internal remedial treatment. We will sample these poles next year to ensure that our measurements accurately reflect the chemical levels present. Trials to evaluate the effects of glycol on boron movement from fused borate rods suggest that glycol enhanced boron diffusion to only a slight extent. This effect was most pronounced at lower moisture contents. This trial was established to identify methods for improving boron movement in drier wood. In addition, moisture measurements in these poles suggest the internal wood moisture content varies widely both seasonally and positionally. While elevated moisture levels can negatively affect the movement of gaseous fumigants, excess moisture is critical for diffusion of boron or fluoride and its absence around the treatment site can markedly reduce the efficacy of rod treatments. These poles will continue to be monitored to assess both boron movement and seasonal changes in moisture content. Trials to identify safe, effective and easily used systems for protecting wood exposed during field fabrication are continuing. Boron and fluoride continue to provide excellent protection to field drilled bolt holes. These treatments are safe and easy to apply, and have provided protection in our field test for 14 years. Trials of similar formulations on simulated decking are also reported to provide additional information on the ability of boron and fluoride to protect exposed Douglas-fir heartwood. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of <b>through</b> <b>boring</b> as a method for enhancing the treatment of Douglas-fir poles are continuing. This past year, we evaluated preservative distribution around through bored holes as a means of developing optimum <b>through</b> <b>boring</b> patterns that maximized treatment while minimizing potential strength effects. These trials suggest the diamond shaped <b>through</b> <b>boring</b> zone of effect is relatively narrow. This information will be used in the coming year to construct optimum patterns for poles of various classes. The goal of this project is to develop a standard <b>through</b> <b>boring</b> pattern that would permit automation of the process. This would create the potential for cost savings on new poles. Trials to evaluate the durability of western redcedar are nearly complete. These trials were initiated because of concerns that second growth western redcedar might be less durable than poles cut from older trees. As expected, cedar varied widely in its resistance to fungal attack. This resistance, however, was not related to tree age, suggesting that there might not be a difference between so-called "old-growth" and "second growth" material. These data will be more thoroughly analyzed once the final set of trials are completed. In addition, we are evaluating more rapid methods for assessing cedar durability by measuring tropolone content. Tropolones are an important component of the extractives that make cedar heartwood so durable. Field trials of various externally applied supplemental groundline treatments are continuing at sites in Oregon, California, and New York. Trials in Corvallis, Oregon, have shown that various copper naphthenate, fluoride or boron based systems are at least as effective as the pentachlorophenol (penta) based systems that were formerly used for this purpose. Penta concentrations in one system have now declined below a protective level, while the copper based systems continue to remain at a protective level. Field trials in California are following similar trends and indicate that the alternative systems will provide comparable performance. Fungus cellar trials of copper naphthenate treated western redcedar stakes continue to show that this chemical provides excellent protection to cedar sapwood. Weathered wood that was treated with copper naphthenate {{continues to}} perform more poorly than freshly sawn wood treated to similar retention levels. Variations in permeability likely account for these differences. A new Wood Pole Maintenance Manual has been completed and is now ready for distribution.

40|$|The {{concept of}} imperium {{is central to}} Spinoza's {{political}} philosophy. Imperium denotes authority to rule, or sovereignty. By extension, it also denotes the political order structured by that sovereignty, or in other words, the state. Spinoza argues that reason recommends {{that we live in}} a state, and indeed, humans are hardly ever outside a state. But what is the source and scope of the sovereignty under which we live? In some sense, it is linked to popular power, but how precisely, and how is this popular grounding to be reconciled with the absolutist elements in Spinoza's texts? Against prominent liberal and radical democratic interpretations, I argue that Spinoza's insistence on linking imperium to the power of the people amounts to a normative attitude towards politics in which the formal features of a political system are less significant than the concrete everyday functioning of that system. Furthermore, I argue that its good functioning is importantly a product of an institutional order which does not simply defer to human individuality or to the primordial multitude, but instead, actively shapes them. While it may be worthwhile railing against monarchy and aristocracy and demanding liberal or radical democracy, the prior and more important challenge is to increase the robustness and resilience of the multitude within whatever form of state presents itself, <b>through</b> <b>boring,</b> meticulous, and incremental institutional design.

40|$|Previously {{established}} {{field trials}} of MTTC-Fume continue {{to show that}} this chemical remains in Douglas-fir and southern pine poles at fungitoxic levels 5 years after treatment. In general, increasing dosages resulted in higher chemical levels in the poles. All of the MITC-Fume treatments resulted in higher residual M 1 TC levels than comparable metham sodium treatments. Field trials with solid basaniid with and without copper sulfate continue to show the promise of this chemical. Basamid treated poles continue to contain MITC at levels which exceed those for comparable metham sodium treatments. These results, which are currently being confirmed in poles in service, indicate that this formulation can deliver fiingitoxic MITC levels to wood in service, without the risk of spills associated with metham sodium. We have completed trials with gelled and pelletized metham sodium formulations. Both of these formulations offered improved safety during application. Initial laboratory trials also suggested that the gelled formulation was more effective than comparable liquid metham sodium. Field trials, however, indicate that the formulations provided protection comparable to the liquid formulation in poles over the test period. The gelled formulation still offers the advantage of reduced risks of spills during application. Trials are also continuing with various solid, water diffusible treatments for arresting internal decay. Trials of fused borate rods continue to show that these treatments require more moisture for effective movement in Douglas-fir poles. Field trials have also been established with borate rods with glycol as an additive to determine if glycols can accelerate diffusion in drier wood. The poles in these trials have also been sensored to monitor internal moisture changes over {{time in order to}} better correlate boron diffusion with wood moisture content. Trials underway with a boronlfluoride rod indicate that the boron is diffusing well from these rods, while the fluoride is moving somewhat slower. Neither chemical has approached a fiungal threshold one year after treatment, but the combination of chemicals may lead to more effective fungal control. Trials with pelletized metham sodium/basamid mixtures suggests that using ratios of these two chemicals can produce an initial rapid burst ofMITC release followed by a slower MITC release with time. This combination allows for rapid control of existing fungal infestations followed by long term protection against reinvasion. These laboratory trials will be further confirmed with field trials. The trials to evaluate the effects of voids on fumigant movement initially suggested that voids have little influence on subsequent fumigant levels {{on either side of the}} void. Sampling 8 years after treatment, however, indicates that chioropicrin levels were generally higher in poles without voids. We plan further trials of actual field poles containing voids to confirm these effects. Trials to identify treatments for protecting the sapwood of western redcedar poles as well as wood exposed in field drilled bolt holes are continuing. Trials in western redcedar sapwood have identified a number of chemicals which can be remedially applied to protect this wood against fungal attack. At present, however, commercial pole spraying has largely ceased making further field trials difficult. Field trials to identify treatments for protecting untreated wood exposed during drilling for various pole attachments continue to show that diffusible boron and fluoride compounds provide excellent long term protection against flingal attack. The protective effects of one diffusible treatment, Boracol, however, has begun to decline. Further sampling will be undertaken to identify the long term effectiveness of the remaining treatments. Trials to identify enhanced patterns for <b>through</b> <b>boring</b> of Douglas-fir poles are complete. The results indicate that patterns as widely spaced as 400 mm apart longitudinally still produce a nearly completely treated pole i n the through bored zone. Pentachlorophenol levels in the through bored zone were generally above the threshold for ftrngal growth. Prior sampling of Douglas-fir poles in service suggest that even poles with small skips in the through bored zone contained no evidence of internal decay. These results suggest that the <b>through</b> <b>boring</b> pattern can be extended without adversely risking pole service life. A reduced <b>through</b> <b>boring</b> pattern would decrease treatment costs while minimizing impacts on pole strength. Trials to evaluate the application of boron to freshly peeled Douglas-fir poles as a means of preventing fungal colonization using a thermal process suggest that thermal treatment failed to produce a boron loading sufilcient to permit subsequent diffusion across the pole section after a 3 month diffusion period. Evaluations of various external groundline preservative formulations continue to indicate that replacement formulations based upon copper naphthenate, boron or fluoride perform comparably to earlier formulations employing pentachlorophenol and creosote. Pentachlorophenol levels in some treatments have fallen below the threshold for fungal growth, while those in all of the replacement treatments remain above a U protective level. These results suggest that the newer groundline preservative systems should provide a reasonable level of protection against external decay. Laboratory trials to better understand the levels of combinations of chemicals required for protection in the groundline zone are continuing. Fungal cellar evaluations of copper naphthenate treated western redcedar continue to show excellent performance at levels specified in the American Wood Preservers' Association Standards. Performance is generally better for wood which was freshly sawn prior to treatment, while wood cuts from weathered poles in service has provided slightly lower levels of protection. The weather wood apparently has higher permeability, making it more likely to lose chemical in soil contact. Further evaluations are planned...|$|E
40|$|The Syrphidae {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} representative families in the sub-order of Diptera Brachycera, the fauna of Siberia numbering about 600 - 700 species (the whole of the U. S. S.

Moreover the larvae of many species are predators of aphids and often reduce their numbers considerably, which has a noticeable useful effect. Only a small number of species are plant pests: especially bulb plants (onion, tulip, hyacinth, etc.) are damaged <b>through</b> <b>boring</b> in the bulbs. The usefulness of the Syrphidae as a whole, however, greatly exceeds the nocivity of these few harmful species.

For a long time the identification of Syrphidae had to be effected by means of obsolete keys by A. A. Stackelberg (1930) and P. Sack (1932 - 1935). For the identification of the Syrphidae of the Far East Shiraki’s book (1930) was used. In 1970 at last appeared “Keys for the identification of insects of the European part of the U. S. S.

He published many papers on the systematics of numerous genera of the Palaearctic region (Sphegina, Neoascia, Orthoneura, Eumerus, Mallota, Brachypalpus, Xylota, etc.), in which some 200 new species were described.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 The goal of {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} a through-boring pattern that will provide adequate preservative penetration while minimizing the reduction in overall pole bending strength. Hole spacing was developed using longitudinal and transverse chemical penetration data from previous studies. Finite element analysis was used as a preliminary assessment tool to examine the effects of hole size, hole spacing, and loading direction on the peak stresses in a through-bored pole section. The <b>through</b> <b>boring</b> pattern was a replicated staggered pattern with 5 -in. longitudinal spacing and 1 - 1 / 2 in. transverse spacing, and 2 -in minimum clear edge distance. The holes were parallel to each other and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pole. The hole pattern and was applied to the poles in a zone 36 in. to + 24 in. from the groundline. Through-bored poles were tested in a modified 4 -point bending test to assess the effect of hole size on the bending strength of the lower half of the pole. The experimental design was a completely randomized design with 140 poles assigned to five treatment groups of four different hole sizes (1 / 4 -in., 1 / 2 -in., 3 / 4 -in, and 1 -in.) and a control group. Douglas-fir poles, green and untreated, were the experimental units for the study. The class 4, 40 -ft poles were cross-cut into two parts: the top 20 -ft section was set aside for another study while the butt ends with the through-bore treatments were tested. The pole was oriented for testing so that the load was applied perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the drilled holes. The poles were ramp-loaded until failure in a modified 4 -point bending test method to simulate the stresses on a utility pole embedded in soil. This setup facilitated an examination of the critical, through-boring effects on the pole and included stresses below the groundline. Average mean bending strengths of the five different groups showed a highly linear trend with small decreases in mean bending strength with hole size increases. The 1 / 4 -in, and 1 / 2 -in, hole groups had bending strengths not significantly different than those of the control group at the 5 -percent significance level. This suggests that the smaller holes did not significantly affect the overall bending strength of the poles. However, the presence and size of holes did affect the variation in bending strengths among hole-size treatments. The control group, whose strength was largely dependent on knots and other strength reducing defects, had a coefficient of variation of 18 percent while the four hole treatment groups had coefficients of variation between 11 percent and 13 percent. The lower variability of the hole treatment groups may have a positive influence on bending strength design values if pole design values were based on the 5 -percent parametric tolerance limit (PTL). When the PTL of the treatments with holes are compared to the control group, all treatment groups but that with the largest holes had higher PTL values than the controls. This could result in potentially higher design values even though the trend of lower mean strengths existed for poles with larger holes. In general, the results showed that through-boring using holes less than or equal to 1 / 2 -in, does not negatively affect pole bending strength when used in the specified pattern...|$|E
40|$|Toushe Living Basin at Yuchih Township in Nantou County {{is famous}} for its peat soil basin (soil is soft and loose). The area of the {{watershed}} at the upstream of Toushe Bridge covers approximately 495 hectares. We can enters the Toushe Village from the northwest by driving on the 21 st Provincial expressway. The expressway is then connected to a one-way road 62 st Provincial expressway. It goes along a seemingly ellipse road and exit to 21 st Provincial expressway from the south of Toushe Bridge. Alongside the road there are one and two-story houses and the slope of the ground on the upper side of the way is rather steep. The Shueiwei Creek, one branche,of the Shueili Creek is the mainstream in the watershed and its drainage channels flows through it. The rest of branches congregate the drainage of every farm and flow into drainage channels. The circularity ratio of the watershed is high as 0. 61. Moreover, the area is silted by ancient lakes,the layers contain peat beds and lots of organic clay, so its drainage capability is quite poor. Because the compound cross-sectional channel used for temporary drainage at the exit of the watershed is short, and the effectiveness of channel bottleneck will form back water. Therefore, the flood always occurs when typhoons bring heavy rainfall. The flood area covers over 60 hectares. The objective of this research is to probe into the overall plans of drainage system by hydrologic model analysis in order to put forward ways to effectively ameliorate the problems of inundation. <b>Through</b> <b>boring</b> survey and the utilization of the one-dimensional model of HEC-RAS developed by Hydrologic Engineering Center, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, the flux capability of current drainage channels were calculated. The two-dimensional values of FLO- 2 D was then employed to simulate the inundation mode and cross-referenced the data of inundation brought by Typhoon Mindulle on July the 2 nd in 2004 and heavy rain caused by Typhoon Sinlaku in 2007. The results showed that there are four effective methods to solve the problems of inundation. Firstly, Shueiwei drainage widen the 2 m complicated cross-sectional channel to 15 m. Secondly, Shueiwei drainage- 1 widen the 2 m complicated of cross-section channel to 15 m. Shueiwei drainage - 4 and Shueiwei drainage - 5 deepen the 1 m in depth of cross-section channel to 2. 5 m. Thirdly, drainage widen the 8 m of cross-section channel to 15 m. Fourthly, flooding area will reduce 76. 25 %(45. 75 hectares) after drainage improvement. The research suggest the lowest area in the basin as a detention pond and drive wooden piles around it. At the same time, use the special quality of the peat soil basin to widely plant the special indigenous plants such as dawn redwood in order to cultivate a special ecology and coservation area, to ensure the sustainable use of water resources, to enhance local sightseeing value, and, in turn, to give a brand-new appearance of the countryside of this area. 南投縣魚池鄉頭社盆地之土質為遠古湖泊淤積而成之泥炭土，因其土層鬆軟而以活盆地著稱，盆地出口之頭社橋，其上游集水區面積約 495 公頃，進入本試區可自台 21 甲線由集水區之西北方進入頭社村後即連接單車道之投 62 線，繞一近似橢圓形後即可由頭社橋南邊銜接台 21 線而出，投 62 線之上邊坡多為 1 ～ 2 層樓之聚落分佈，坡度較陡。集水區之主流為水里溪之支流水尾溪排水幹渠，其餘各支流則匯集各農地之 5 條排水入於幹渠。因集水區之圓比值高達 0. 61 ，且其土層均由泥炭層及大量有機質的黏土組成，排水能力甚差，每逢颱風豪雨時由集水區流出之洪流在排入集流點頭社橋下之複式斷面渠道時，因通水斷面縮減而形成排水瓶頸所產生之迴水常造成多達約 60 公頃之淹水災情。因早期盆地種植水稻影響較少，近 10 年因稻作收益降低改種絲瓜、敏豆、茄子、蕃茄等旱作為主，甚不耐淹浸，常造成盆地內農作物重大損失。本研究旨在以水文模式分析探討其排水系統並做整體規劃，以提出有效改善淹水問題之方法。 本研究透過地質鑽探和測量調查並運用美國陸軍工兵團水文工程中心所發展之HEC-RAS(一維模式) 演算現況排水路各重現期距之通水能力，再以FLO- 2 D(二維數值淹水模式) 進行淹水模擬，利用 2004 年敏督利颱風豪雨所造成嚴重之七二水災與 2008 年辛樂克颱風豪大雨的資料進行驗證後，結果提出可有效改善淹水問題之四種對策：(一) 排水出口改善：以加強即時排水為目標，可將原來 0. 90 %之縱向渠道坡度改為 1. 51 %，並將原寬 2 m圳渠之橫斷面拓寬為 15 m。(二) 坡地排水改善：分別將水尾溪排水幹線之 1 由原為 4 m之渠道挖寬為 15 m、水尾溪排水幹線之 4 和之 5 由原為 1 m之渠道挖深為 2. 5 m以截排西南方和東北方之坡地逕流，讓逕流安全地排至水尾溪排水幹線。 (三) 排水路改善：針對未達 10 年重現期距之洪峰流量且 25 年不溢堤保護標準之渠道斷面，由原來之 8 m拓寬至 15 m。(四) 上述三項改善方案完成後，淹水情形可減少 76. 25 %(45. 75 ha) ，但仍有 25. 75 %(14. 25 ha) 之面積會淹到水，故建議將該區域朝多目標利用之濕地發展，除了可利用活盆地泥炭土之特殊地質，以營造特殊生態保育景觀、確保水資源之永續利用及提昇當地之觀光收入之外，更可展現另一種全新的鄉村風貌。目 錄 摘 要	IV Abstract	VI 目錄	VIIII 圖目錄	VIIIX 表目錄	X 一、前言	 1 - 1 1 - 1 研究緣起	 1 - 1 1 - 2 研究目的	 1 - 1 1 - 3 本文組織	 1 - 2 二、文獻回顧	 2 - 1 2 - 1 淹水模式應用之相關研究	 2 - 1 2 - 2 綜合治水對策	 2 - 3 三、研究材料與方法	 3 - 1 3 - 1 研究流程	 3 - 1 3 - 2 研究材料	 3 - 2 3 - 3 研究方法	 3 - 3 3 - 4 研究試區基本資料	 3 - 7 四、結果與討論	 4 - 1 4 - 1 水文分析	 4 - 1 4 - 2 水理分析成果	 4 - 21 4 - 3 淹水模擬驗證	 4 - 25 4 - 4 淹水特性分析	 4 - 33 4 - 5 綜合治水對策探討	 4 - 37 4 - 6 改善效益分析	 4 - 44 五、結論與建議	 5 - 1 參考文獻	 5 -...|$|E
