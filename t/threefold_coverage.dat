40|$|A single-base pair {{resolution}} silkworm {{genetic variation}} map was constructed from 40 domesticated and wild silkworms, each sequenced to approximately <b>threefold</b> <b>coverage,</b> representing 99. 88 % of the genome. We identified ∼ 16 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms, many indels, and structural variations. We {{find that the}} domesticated silkworms are clearly genetically differentiated from the wild ones, but they have maintained large levels of genetic variability, suggesting a short domestication event involving {{a large number of}} individuals. We also identified signals of selection at 354 candidate genes that may have been important during domestication, some of which have enriched expression in the silk gland, midgut, and testis. These data add {{to our understanding of the}} domestication processes and may have applications in devising pest control strategies and advancing the use of silkworms as efficient bioreactors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNeural {{plate and}} sensory placodes share the {{expression}} of N-cadherin and Group B 1 Sox genes, represented by Sox 2. A 219 -kb region of the chicken genome centered by the N-cadherin gene was scanned for neural and placodal enhancers. Random subfragments of 4. 5 kb average length were prepared and inserted into tkEGFP reporter vector to construct a library with <b>threefold</b> <b>coverage</b> of the region. Each clone was then transfected into N-cadherin-positive (lens, retina and forebrain) or -negative embryonic cells, or electroporated into early chicken embryos to examine enhancer activity. Enhancers 1 – 4 active in the CNS/placode derivatives and non-specific Enhancer 5 were identified by transfection, while electroporation of early embryos confirmed enhancers 2 – 4 as having activity in the early CNS and/or sensory placodes but with unique spatiotemporal specificities. Enhancers 2 – 4 are dependent on SOX-binding sites, and misexpression of Group B 1 Sox genes in the head ectoderm caused ectopic development of placodes expressing N-cadherin, indicating the involvement of Group B 1 Sox functions in N-cadherin regulation. Enhancers 1, 2 and 4 correspond to sequence blocks conserved between the chicken and mammalian genomes, but enhancers 3 and 5 are unique to the chicken...|$|E
40|$|In 1995, The Institute for Genomic Research {{completed}} the genomic sequence of a rough derivative of Haemophilus influenzae serotype d, strain KW 20. This sequence, though extremely useful {{in understanding the}} basic biology of H. influenzae, has yet to provide significant insight into our understanding of disease caused by nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHI), because serotype d strains are not generally pathogens. In contrast, NTHI strains are frequently mucosal pathogens and are the primary pathogens of chronic otitis media {{as well as a}} significant cause of acute otitis media in children. Thus, it is of great importance to further understand their biology. We used a DNA-based microarray approach to identify genes present in a clinical isolate of NTHI that were absent from strain Rd. We also sequenced the genome of a second NTHI isolate from a child with chronic otitis media to <b>threefold</b> <b>coverage</b> and then used an array of bioinformatics tools to identify genes present in this NTHI strain but absent from strain Rd. These methods were complementary in approach and results. We identified, in both strains, homologues of H. influenzae lav, an autotransported protein of unknown function; tnaA, which encodes tryptophanase; as well as a homologue of Pasteurella multocida tsaA, which encodes an alkyl peroxidase that {{may play a role in}} protection against reactive oxygen species. We also identified a number of putative restriction-modification systems, bacteriophage genes and transposon-relate...|$|E
40|$|The jawless fish occupy an {{important}} phylogenetic position {{for understanding the}} evolution of body plans, the origin of adaptive immunity and genome evolution in chordates. We describe here {{the construction of a}} large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from the inshore hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri. The BAC library contains 93, 978 clones with an average insert size of 100 kb and is estimated to represent <b>threefold</b> genome-equivalent <b>coverage.</b> The library was organized in three-dimensional pools to facilitate screening by PCR. We have screened this library by PCR and isolated several BAC clones; the average number of positive clones was compatible with the estimated genome coverage of the library. This BAC library, constructed for the first time from the jawless fish, should serve as a useful resource for the scientific community...|$|R

Several substrate Bragg reflections were employed to locate the adsorbate using a triangulation method. Hollow-type sites are preferred at coverages close to saturation, although adsorbate-adsorbate interactions {{play an important role}} in some cases, and give rise to a coverage-dependent adsorption site change. In particular, in the cases of Si(111) and Si(211) the adsorption site changes with <b>coverage</b> (<b>threefold</b> hollow at saturation and on top at low coverages) ...|$|R

MSCs were added to our previously described composite EC islets as a potential means to improve their capacity for islet angiogenesis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Human islets were coated with primary human bone marrow–derived MSCs and dermal microvascular ECs. The capacity of ECs, with or without MSCs, to adhere to and grow into human islets was analyzed. The survival and functionality of these composite islets were evaluated in a dynamic perifusion assay, and their capacity for angiogenesis in vitro was assessed in a three-dimensional fibrin gel assay.

40|$|The MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) {{instrument}} on the Terra satellite {{has been}} retrieving cloud motion vectors (CMVs) globally and almost continuously since early in 2000. In February 2012 the new MISR Level 2 Cloud product was publicly released, providing cloud motion vectors at 17. 6 km resolution with improved accuracy and roughly <b>threefold</b> increased <b>coverage</b> {{relative to the}} 70. 4 km resolution vectors of the current MISR Level 2 Stereo product (which remains available). MISR retrieves both horizontal cloud motion and height from the apparent displacement due to parallax and movement of cloud features across three visible channel (670 nm) camera views over a span of 200 seconds. The retrieval has comparable accuracy to operational atmospheric motion vectors from other current sensors, but holds the additional advantage of global coverage and finer precision height retrieval that is insensitive to radiometric calibration. The MISR mission {{is expected to continue}} operation for many more years, possibly until 2019, and Level 2 Cloud has the possibility of being produced with a sensing-to-availability lag of 5 hours. This report compares MISR CMV with collocated motion vectors from arctic rawinsonde sites, and from the GOES and MODISTerra instruments. CMV at heights below 3 km exhibit the smallest differences, as small as 3. 3 m/s for MISR and GOES. Clouds above 3 km exhibit larger differences, as large as 8. 9 m/s for MISR and MODIS. Typical differences are on the order of 6 m/s...|$|R
40|$|White clover is an {{allotetraploid}} legume with a genome size of ca 960 Mb and {{is widely}} used in Irish grasslands to improve the nutritional value of the forage by increasing the relative amounts of nitrogen present. White clover {{is closely related to}} Medicago truncatula, the diploid (genome size of ca 500 Mb) model legume chosen to study the symbiotic genetic programmes of plants and facilitate the genetics and breeding of important legume crops. This thesis describes the construction of a genetic map of a white clover mapping population composed of 94 F 1 progeny bred in the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (UK) from parents S 1 S 4 and R 3 R 4. The genetic map was constructed using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers and white clover microsatellite markers from previously published white clover maps. The thesis also details a glasshouse and field based phenotypic analysis carried out on morphological traits which allowed quantitative trait loci (QTL) to be detected on the genetic linkage map of white clover. Due to the high correlation between the traits measured, both conservation of QTLs across environments and co-localisation of QTLs for related traits were observed in this study. A BAC library of one of the family parents, R 3 R 4, was constructed using pIndigo BAC- 5, consisting of over 37, 000 clones with an average insert size of 85 Kb, representing a <b>threefold</b> genome <b>coverage.</b> A preliminary sequence analysis was carried out where 700 BAC clones were sequenced on both ends. Results showed that over 50 % of the BAC-ends had a correspondence with the Medicago genome sequence; however only 16 of the BAC-end sequence pairs had homology within a span of 20 to 200 Kb in M. truncatula. The level of synteny between white clover and M. truncatula was assessed by comparative structural genomics, where five BAC clones of the white clover library were sequenced to sixfold coverage and their sequences were compared to the corresponding M. truncatula sequences.

MSCs were added to our previously described composite EC islets as a potential means to improve their capacity for islet angiogenesis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Human islets were coated with primary human bone marrow-derived MSCs and dermal microvascular ECs. The capacity of ECs, with or without MSCs, to adhere to and grow into human islets was analyzed. The survival and functionality of these composite islets were evaluated in a dynamic perifusion assay, and their capacity for angiogenesis in vitro was assessed in a three-dimensional fibrin gel assay. RESULTS: ECs proliferated after culture in MSC-conditioned medium, and MSCs improved the EC <b>coverage</b> <b>threefold</b> compared with EC islets alone. Islet survival in vitro and the functionality of the composite islets after culture were equal to those of control islets. The EC-MSC islets showed a twofold increase in total sprout formation compared with EC islets, and vascular sprouts emanating from the EC-MSC-islet surface showed migration of ECs into the islets and also into the surrounding matrix, either alone or in concert with MSCs. CONCLUSIONS: EC proliferation, sprout formation, and ingrowth of ECs into the islets were enhanced by MSCs. The use of composite EC-MSC islets may have beneficial effects on revascularization and immune regulation. The technique presented allows for pretreatment of donor islets with recipient-derived ECs and MSCs as a means of improving islet engraftment. ...|$|R
40|$|Multi-unit {{recording}} from {{neuronal networks}} cultured on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) {{is a widely}} used approach to achieve basic understanding of network properties, {{as well as the}} realization of cell-based biosensors. However, network formation is random under primary culture conditions, and the cellular arrangement often performs an insufficient fit to the electrode positions. This results in the successful recording of {{only a small fraction of}} cells. One possible approach to overcome this limitation is to raise the number of cells on the MEA, thereby accepting an increased complexity of the network. In this study, we followed an alternative strategy to increase the portion of neurons located at the electrodes by designing a network in confined geometries. Guided settlement and outgrowth of neurons is accomplished by taking control over the adhesive properties of the MEA surface. Using microcontact printing a triangular two-dimensional pattern of the adhesion promoter poly-D-lysine was applied to the MEA offering a meshwork that at the same time provides adhesion points for cell bodies matching the electrode positions and gives frequent branching points for dendrites and axons. Low density neocortical networks cultivated under this condition displayed similar properties to random networks with respect to the cellular morphology but had a <b>threefold</b> higher electrode <b>coverage.</b> Electrical activity was dominated by periodic burst firing that could pharmacologically be modulated. Geometry of the network and electrical properties of the patterned cultures were reproducible and displayed long-term stability making the combination of surface structuring and multi-site recording a promising tool for biosensor applications...|$|R
