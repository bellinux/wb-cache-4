40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the structure of}} a standard auto lease contract, and identifies <b>the</b> call <b>option</b> within <b>the</b> lease contract.

I note why the true value of <b>the</b> <b>option</b> should be between the European and American call values. Finding <b>the</b> <b>option</b> value assists in the lease or buy decision.

30|$|It can {{be proved}} <b>the</b> <b>option</b> value under {{competition}} in (30) {{is lower than}} that without competition (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>option</b> value of waiting for a monopoly as in Dixit and Pindyck 1994). That is, competition abrades <b>the</b> <b>option</b> value. <b>The</b> real <b>options</b> literature has explored <b>the</b> <b>option</b> value of waiting for a firm when payoffs are stochastic and investment irreparable. It has been illustrated in these studies that firms will typically delay investing until well after {{the point at which}} supposed discounted benefits identical beginning costs. In so doing, they use <b>the</b> <b>option</b> value of waiting. Although, <b>the</b> <b>option</b> value of waiting may have been overestimated when the risk of competitive abrasion or prevention is excluded (Smit and Trigeorgis 2006; Aleksandrov et al. 2013; Levaggi et al. 2012; Podoynitsyna et al. 2013). Certainly, <b>the</b> <b>option</b> value without competition is only an upper limit of <b>the</b> <b>option</b> value with competition. So, including competition is important to get a practical option valuation.|$|R
5|$|Ark Royal {{had entered}} refit to {{accommodate}} the Phantom in 1967; this involved a major reconstruction, including several elements to allow the ship to operate the aircraft – the flight deck was increased in area and fully angled to 8½°, the arresting gear was replaced with a new water-spray system {{to accommodate the}} Phantom's higher weight and landing speed, and bridle catchers and water-cooled JBDs were fitted to the catapults. Once this work was complete, Eagle was scheduled to undergo a similar modernization. In 1969, the planned refit of Eagle was cancelled, and <b>the</b> <b>options</b> for seven additional FG.1s was not taken up.

In September 2014, Transport for London ran a consultation on the Bakerloo extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction with options via Lewisham and Camberwell or Old Kent Road, taking over Network Rail's Hayes line. The cost of the extension is estimated at around £2–3 billion with construction expected to take place between the mid-2020s and early 2030s. A February 2017 consultation indicates that the line could extend to Lewisham via Old Kent Road with future extension options later on.|$|E
