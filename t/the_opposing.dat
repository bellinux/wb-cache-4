5|$|The fair catch kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair catch or {{has been awarded}} a fair catch (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick catch interference), their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> team's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after the kick. If the attempt fails, <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick. <b>The</b> <b>opposing</b> team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E

40|$|NO {{production}} is simulated and analyzed in three lean H 2 /air premixed flames: the classic one-dimensional (1 D) flame, <b>the</b> <b>opposed</b> jet flame, and the tubular flame. The 1 D flame is simulated with the PREMIX code {{followed by the}} SENKIN code to determine the NO production for a long residence time. <b>The</b> <b>opposed</b> jet flame and the tubular flame are simulated with the OPPDIF and TUBEDIF codes, respectively. The major factors influencing NO production are flame temperature, radical concentration, and post-flame residence time. For the 1 D flame, almost 100 % of NO is produced in the post-flame region and the reactant residence time in this region is the only factor determining NO concentration. For <b>the</b> <b>opposed</b> jet flame, flame stretch influences all three factors and the competition among them controls the NO concentration response to stretch rate. For the tubular flame, flame curvature influences flame temperature and post-flame residence time, and it makes the NO concentration response {{different from that of}} <b>the</b> <b>opposed</b> jet flame. ?

If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.|$|E

Four different look-up tables have been generated with the combinations of two different scalar dissipation rate calculation methods and two different mass diffusion models of <b>the</b> <b>opposed</b> jet flame. Simulation of a turbulent non-premixed H 2 jet flame is used to discriminate the accuracy of different implementation methods by comparison with experimental data.

However, the choice of mass diffusion model has significant influence on the simulation result and excluding the Lewis number effect should be enforced for <b>the</b> <b>opposed</b> jet flame simulation...|$|R
