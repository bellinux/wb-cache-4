25|$|In September 2011, the Israeli {{government}} {{approved a}} five-year economic development plan called the Prawer Plan. One of its implications is a relocation of some 30.000-40.000 Negev Bedouin from areas not {{recognized by the}} government to government-approved townships. This will require Bedouins to leave ancestral villages, cemeteries and communal life as <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|One of the Flight 305 {{flight attendants}} {{reportedly}} [...] "did {{not find any}} similarities" [...] between photos of Rackstraw from the 1970s and her recollection of Cooper's appearance. Rackstraw's attorney called the renewed allegations [...] "the stupidest thing I've ever heard", and Rackstraw himself told People.com, [...] "It's a lot of , and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is." [...] The FBI declined further comment. Rackstraw stated in a 2017 phone interview that {{he lost his job}} over the 2016 investigations.|$|E
500|$|Fields {{had come}} [...] "up from the cutting room floor" [...] {{and out of}} the customary, near-anonymity of film editors. Regarding this change in her career path, Fields told Peary in 1980 that [...] "All these young filmmakers are possessive. They feel I belong to them, and they feel a certain resentment - that I went to the other side. In calmer moments, of course, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> isn't true, that I can do more for them now." [...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün. They're {{executives}} who actually made records. In the movie business, as an executive who's worked with film, you have only Verna. She saves Universal a fortune...every day." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1984, {{director}} Rob Reiner, producer Andy Scheinman {{and writer}} Nora Ephron met over {{lunch at the}} Russian Tea Room in New York City to develop a project. Reiner pitched {{an idea for a}} film that Ephron rejected. The second meeting transformed into a long discussion about Reiner and Scheinman's lives as single men. Reiner remembers, [...] "I {{was in the middle of}} my single life. I'd been divorced for a while. I'd been out a number of times, all these disastrous, confusing relationships one after another". The next time they all met, Reiner said that he had always wanted to do a film about two people who become friends and do not have sex because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> will ruin their relationship but have sex anyway. Ephron liked the idea, and Reiner acquired a deal at a studio.|$|E
500|$|The acting of {{the main}} cast was conflictingly received. Lloyd Miller of the St. Petersburg Times said the {{characters}} [...] "return to their original roles with a vigor and wit unseen in earlier episodes of the film series". Rob Salem of The Toronto Star quipped that though the actors looked silly on occasion, this was a benefit; [...] "as their capacity for action has diminished, their comedic talents have blossomed [...] they have all become masters of self-deprecating self-parody." [...] The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert called the actors' performances [...] "photocopies" [...] of previous films: [...] "Shatner and Nimoy are respectable, but lack energy. There's {{nowhere else to go}} with their roles, and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> DeForest Kelley is oddly out of it." [...] Plummer and Warner's portrayals of their Klingon characters were well-received; Maslin commented that [...] "whenever a skilled actor [...] manages to emerge from behind all this [...] with his personality intact, it's a notable accomplishment." [...] The other supporting characters received similar praise; H.J. Kirchhoff, writing for The Globe and Mail, said that the guest stars joined the [...] "family fun" [...] of the film as [...] "zesty, exotic and colorful good guys and bad guys". A Cinefantastique retrospective review considered the film to have the finest guest stars ever assembled for a Star Trek film.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} What Engineers Know and How <b>They</b> <b>Know</b> <b>It,</b> Walter Vincenti asserts that {{engineering}} research has a character {{different from that}} of scientific research. [...] First, it often deals with areas in which the basic physics or chemistry are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.|$|E

2500|$|Selene {{wonders if}} there is a way that mortals show loyalty to a Queen. They explain that it is done with [...] "a very long and tender kiss ... preferably, just below the nose."

2500|$|And boy do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> Drake, {{resisting}} {{the urge to}} put his Maths skills to the test this time out, boasts about getting pissed and laid in the Dominican. Minaj, meanwhile, likens herself to a [...] "heavyweight champ", David of Goliath-slaying fame and, rather less obviously, [...] "the umpire", which for British listeners of a certain ilk can't help but invite comparisons to the legendary Dickie Bird MBE. Not that you'd try to tell her to her face." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leslie J. Hoppe, {{writing in}} 1987, submits that Dever's {{definition}} of temporal scope of Levantine archaeology excludes the Early Arab period (640-1099), the Crusader period (1099–1291), the Mamluk period (1250–1517) and the Ottoman period (1517-1918). However, Dever's {{definition of the}} temporal scope of the field in What Did the Biblical Writers Know, and When Did <b>They</b> <b>Know</b> <b>It?</b> (2001), indicates that Hoppe's critique is no longer valid. There, Dever writes that the time-frame of Levantine archaeology, [...] "extends far beyond the 'biblical period,' embracing everything from the Lower Paleolithic to the Ottoman period." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It's {{definitely}} the best rap record I've ever heard," [...] remarked Sinéad O'Connor. [...] "Of course, I {{can see why}} people might be offended by the lyrics. But {{as a human being}} and not as a public figure, I'm not offended at all. I realise from reading interviews with people like Ice Cube, when they explain that they're not talking about women in general but about particular women <b>they</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> makes a lot of sense. I think the sound of the record is brilliant. I really like hardcore hip-hop and reggae stuff, so it's right up my flight of stairs." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 January 1992 Haughey {{retired as}} leader of Fianna Fáil at a {{parliamentary}} party meeting. He remained as Taoiseach until 11 February when he was succeeded by the sacked Finance Minister, Albert Reynolds. In his final address to the Dáil he quoted Othello, saying inter alia [...] "I have done the state some service, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> no more of that." [...] Haughey {{then returned to the}} backbenches before retiring from politics at the 1992 general election. His son, Seán Haughey, was elected at that election in his father's old constituency. Sean Haughey was appointed as a Junior Minister in the Department of Education and Science in December 2006.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of making the film was to convey the smells {{and the world of}} scents that Grenouille experiences. Tykwer said that to him Perfume [...] "was much more a film about the importance of smell in our life than a film that tries to be smelly." [...] The filmmakers strived to convey smell visually without the use of colors or special effects, Griebe says [...] "people see the fish market full of raw, bloody fish, and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> stinks; they see a field of lavender and know it smells wonderful. We show Grenouille taking in smells by cupping his nose, and by doing close shots of his nose, and that's it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding his {{religious}} beliefs, Carolla has stated, [...] "I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don't {{think there is}} no God; I know there's no God. I know there's no God the same way I know many other laws in our universe. I know there's no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} tour to Zimbabwe, after two close draws, Lloyd {{generated}} controversy with his post-match statements.

One more ball and we'd have walked it. We murdered them and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> To work so hard and get so close, there is no praise too high. We have had some stick off your lads. We flipping hammered them." [...] The comments were not appreciated by Zimbabwe fans, with one banner in the crowd reading [...] "Wanted. David Lloyd. For Murder of Zim Cricket Team.
