5|$|Four {{days later}} on 21 August at 08:30, Orizaba, {{traveling}} with Siboney, spotted a submarine {{in the act}} of submerging. Orizaba attempted <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> the sub and dropped depth charges, but there was no indication that the attack was successful.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} Re d'Italia and {{transfer}} to Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, though he failed <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians then turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrian ships concentrated their fire on Re d'Italia, paying particular attention to her stern. In their attempts <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> her, one of the Austrian ships destroyed Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her unmaneuverable.|$|E

40|$|A {{nutritional}} {{strategy for}} increasing ovulation rate in Merino ewes mated in late spring-early summer was evaluated on two commercial farms. The strategy used the 'ram effect' to induce oestrus in seasonally anoestrus ewes and supplementary feeding of lupin grain six {{days prior to}} oestrus to increase ovulation rate. Ewes that had been isolated from rams for 6 weeks were exposed <b>to</b> vasectomised <b>rams</b> for 2 weeks and then mated <b>to</b> fertile <b>rams</b> for 6 weeks. Feeding 500 g lupins/head/day for 14 days commencing 12 days after the introduction of vasectomised rams, {{increased the number of}} ovulations from 126 to 146 per 100 ewes exposed <b>to</b> <b>rams</b> (P < 0. 05). This increase was reflected in an improvement in fecundity (lambs born per ewe lambing; P < 0. 05) but not fertility (ewes lambing per ewe mated <b>to</b> <b>rams).</b> Net reproductive performance (the product of fertility, fecundity and lamb survival) was increased by 11 lambs weaned per 100 ewes exposed <b>to</b> <b>rams</b> due <b>to</b> lupin supplementation at mating.

5|$|Charles Algernon Fryatt (2 December 1872 â€“ 27 July 1916) was a British mariner who was {{executed}} by the Germans for attempting <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> a U-boat in 1915. When his ship, the , was captured off the Netherlands in 1916, he was court-martialled {{and sentenced to death}} although he was a civilian non-combatant.

She too took on a heavy list and then capsized before sinking at 07:55. Several Dutch ships began rescuing survivors at 08:30 and were joined by British fishing trawlers before Tyrwhitt and his ships arrived at 10:45. The combined total from all three ships was 837 men rescued and 62 officers and 1,397 enlisted men lost. Of these, Hogue lost a total of 48 men.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{the then}} {{prominent}} actor Manoj Bajpayee suggested his name <b>to</b> <b>Ram</b> Gopal Varma {{to write a}} film.

40|$|Exposure of anoestrous ewes <b>to</b> <b>rams</b> induces {{oestrous cycles}} (the 'ram effect'). This {{response}} is poor in young-sexually naive females, possibly {{because they lack}} sexual experience and are sensitive to stress. Firstly, we assessed the conditions required for the acquisition of sexual experience. We exposed naive females at 5 or 9 months of age <b>to</b> <b>rams</b> and subsequently assessed their response at I year of age, <b>to</b> the <b>ram</b> effect. Unexpectedly, 2 weeks pre-exposure at 5 months and under some conditions at 9 months, inhibited the ram effect at I year of age, suggesting that early contact with rams was stressful and had long-term negative effects on reproduction. Consequently, we assessed the combined effect of stress and sexual experience on responses <b>to</b> the <b>ram</b> effect. At 9 months of age, we pre-exposed naive females using sexually active <b>rams</b> <b>to</b> achieve 'positive' (voluntary contact) or 'negative' (forced contact) experiences, and assessed responses <b>to</b> the <b>ram</b> effect at a year of age. In parallel, we subjected naive females to stressful conditions {{at the time of}} the male effect. During pre-exposure, females with 'negative' contact exhibited more vigilance and stress cues and had higher levels of cortisol than 'positive' contact ewes. Regardless of pre-exposure or stress, the response <b>to</b> the <b>ram</b> effect at a year of age was inhibited. These experiments confirm that contact with sexual partners can be stressful to young ewes and highlight the need to consider their emotional state when conditioning them to the presence of rams and when managing breeding programs.

5|$|The {{story of}} Deng's order <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> the Yoshino and his {{subsequent}} refusal {{to leave his}} ship as it sank has resulted in him being placed in popular culture as a national hero, particularly following {{the formation of the}} People's Republic of China. Deng, and the events on the Zhuyuan are repeated in school textbooks in China, where they praise his actions while also criticising Li Hongzhang. The People's Liberation Army Navy training ship Shichang, was named after Deng.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Zhiyuan has {{received}} many mentions and appearances in historical reinactments, {{such as the}} 1962 Changchun Film Studio movie Naval Battle of 1894 which concentrated on Deng's actions in the Battle of the Yalu River. This particular film ends in a sequence wherein Zhiyuan attempts <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> the Yoshino, before cutting to waves hitting rocks on a shoreline with Deng's face superimposed. Deng and the Zhiyuan appeared in the 2003 Chinese television series Towards the Republic, {{in which he was}} described as a strict but honourable captain whose ship's company respects him and his authority.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, {{disagreements}} over guano and nitrate-rich lands led Chile {{to start the}} War of the Pacific with Bolivia and Peru. The ex-Peruvian turret ship HuÃ¡scar, captured by the Chileans at the Battle of Angamos, attacked the Peruvians at Arica on 27 February 1880, fighting an inconclusive duel with Manco CÃ¡pac. The Peruvian failed in her attempt <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> the Chilean ironclad, although the Huascars captain {{was killed in the}} engagement. The Chilean fleet continued to blockade Arica as the army closed in on the city from the rear. Manco CÃ¡pac hit the schooner Covadondga on blockade duty on 6 June, but the monitor was scuttled to prevent her capture when the city fell the following day.|$|E

5|$|She {{was part}} of a {{flotilla}} which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Zhiyuans sole action was at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894 during the First Sino-Japanese War. During the battle, she came under heavy fire from the Japanese forces. Having been holed, Deng ordered for the ship <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> an opposing vessel. She was destroyed as she closed, either by a hit on one of her torpedo tubes, or from a Japanese torpedo. This attack, and the subsequent story of her captain and his dog have become embedded in popular culture in the People's Republic of China. A replica of the Zhiyuan was constructed in 2014 at the Port of Dandong, while the wreck was discovered in 2013 after a 16-year search.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} his {{flagship}} and transfer to Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change.

More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, in an attempt to split the Italian line and initiate a melee. He failed <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> any Italian vessels on the first pass, so he turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire.

50|$|Furthermore, a ship {{designed}} <b>to</b> have a <b>ramming</b> capability typically had a tumblehome hull design {{which would}} allow the <b>ram</b> <b>to</b> strike below the waterline. This design of hull is inherently slower {{than almost any other}} hull design, giving an additional disadvantage <b>to</b> ships employing <b>rams.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their weakest {{point was}} the hull. Not {{only was the}} hull easily penetrated, but once breached, {{there was no way}} to isolate the damage, such as by {{watertight}} compartments.

5|$|To the {{surprise}} of Lacrosse and his officers, Indefatigable did not retreat from the ship of the line, nor did she pass the ship of the line at long-range to leeward as expected. Instead, at 17:30, Pellew closed with the stern of Droits de l'Homme and opened a raking fire. Lacrosse turned to meet the threat and opened fire with the guns on the upper deck accompanied by a heavy volley of musket fire from the soldiers on board. Pellew then attempted to pull ahead of Droits de l'Homme and rake her bow, to which Lacrosse responded by attempting <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> Indefatigable. Neither manoeuvre was successful, as Droits de l'Homme raked the British ship but caused little damage as most of her shot scattered into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the next}} match, Diesel threw Razor Ramon out of the ring, {{allowing}} Michaels to remove the turnbuckle padding. Payton argued with Michaels about his interference, drawing the referee's attention. Michaels {{seized the opportunity to}} attack Ramon behind the referee's back. Diesel used two big boots and a series of submission holds to maintain the advantage. When he tried to throw Ramon into the unprotected turnbuckle, Payton pointed out the missing padding to the referee, who stood in the way to prevent the move. Soon after, Diesel tried <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> Ramon into the turnbuckle, but Ramon escaped and pushed Diesel into the turnbuckle. Ramon kept his momentum by performing a bulldog, a scoop slam, and a superplex. When Michaels tried to get involved again, Payton chased him around the outside of the ring. While the referee was distracted, Michaels entered the ring and tried to perform a superkick while Diesel held Ramon. Ramon moved, causing Michaels to kick Diesel instead. Ramon pinned Diesel to win the match and regain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable and Droits de l'Homme manoeuvred {{around one}} another, exchanging fire when {{possible}} until 18:45, when Amazon arrived. During this exchange, one of Droits de l'Hommes cannon burst, causing heavy casualties on her packed deck. Approaching the larger French ship with all sail spread, Reynolds closed to within pistol shot before raking Droits de l'Homme. Lacrosse {{responded to this}} new threat by manoeuvring to bring both British ships to face the westward side of his ship, avoiding becoming trapped in a crossfire. The battle continued until 19:30, when both Amazon and Indefatigable pulled away from their opponent to make hasty repairs. By 20:30, the frigates {{had returned to the}} much slower French ship and began weaving in front of Droits de l'Hommes bow, repeatedly raking her. Lacrosse's increasingly desperate attempts <b>to</b> <b>ram</b> the British ships were all unsuccessful and what little cannon fire he did manage to deploy was ineffectual, as the rolling of the ship of the line prevented reliable aiming.|$|E
