This paper mainly concentrated on controlling the air pollution from vehicles by using semi-conductor gas sensor for detecting the emission level from vehicles. If the vehicle do not get service regularly, then pollution level higher than standard emission level. In this paper, smoke sensor {{has been used to}} detect carbon monoxide from vehicles. Smoke sensor senses the pollution level from vehicles. If pollution level is recorded beyond the standard values from government, then microcontroller alerts the buzzer and displays pollution level on LCD. Microcontroller also sends pollution level <b>to</b> service <b>centre</b> through <b>text</b> message by GSM module. At the same time, activate the timer that indicates vehicle will be stopped after some time. During this time, GPS finds the location of vehicle in terms of latitude and longitude values and displays on LCD. GSM send GPS values <b>to</b> service <b>centre</b> through <b>text</b> message. When timer expires, vehicle will be stopped due to the fuel supply to engine get stop by relay circuit is controlled by microcontroller. Based on GPS values, service centre can trace and service the vehicle. The proposed system must be registered with service <b>centre</b> by sending <b>text</b> message. This paper will benefit to the society and help in controlling the air pollution...|$|R
40|$|Debates around postcolonial theory often {{arise from}} misunderstandings owing to {{translation}} from one disciplinary context to another. This article acknowledges real material limits <b>to</b> <b>text</b> <b>centred</b> theory and critiques the uninspected use of hybridity as a concept/textual practice of subversion. The term has {{a range of}} meanings and does different work in different situations. Using examples from modern writing in the Pacific region, a situated dynamic of juxtaposed elements defined as 2 ̆ 7 syneretic counterpoint 2 ̆ 7 is argued for. This conflietual mix resists both hybrid amalgamation and irony, permitting an assertion of indigenous difference that simultaneously allows for modern globalised complexity...|$|R

The first part - theoretical - focuses on the anatomical and physiological information relating on the motor control, spasticity and vascular brain event. Control of movements is divided into subsections according {{to the level of the}} nervous system, from the lowest level - the spinal cord to the highest - cortex. Chapter VBE is divided by the emergence of haemorrhagic VBE and ischemic. The chapter is presented spasticity pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and its treatment. Therapy of spasticity is most devoted to theoretical work. The second part - practical - it provides examples of patients after VBE (stroke), in which one of the complications of spasticity.
