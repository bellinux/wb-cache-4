I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
5|$|Titanfall {{received}} generally favorable reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the game's pilot–Titan balance, its Smart Pistol, fast-paced player mobility, and accessibility for players of all skill sets. Reviewers {{complained that the}} AI grunts were too unintelligent, that private match and community support features were lacking, and that the game had shipped with too few multiplayer modes. Multiple reviewers cited the Titan's feeling of grandiosity in the player experience—specifically, the thrill of watching a summoned Titan fall from the sky, but also the feeling of entering the Titan exoskeleton and of scaling a Titan to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E

25|$|Either {{of these}} forms is only {{forbidden}} if {{done in a}} permanent fashion, though not necessarily with permanent intent. For example, closing and locking a door is permitted, regardless of how long one intends to keep the door closed.

25|$|During the 1964 UK general {{election}} campaign, an Irish republican candidate displayed an Irish tricolour {{from the window}} of his office in a republican area of Belfast. Paisley threatened that if the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did not remove the tricolour he would lead a march to the office and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> himself. The Flags and Emblems Act banned the public display of any symbol, {{with the exception of the}} Union Flag, that could cause a breach of the peace. In response, armed officers arrived at the building, smashed their way inside and seized the flag. This led to severe rioting between republicans and the RUC. Thirty people, including at least 18 officers, had to be hospitalized. The 1969 Northern Ireland riots, Divis Street were the worst in Belfast since the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|When the U.S. Civil War commenced, a {{training}} camp {{was established in}} West Chester, and the Union army recruited heavily in the region. Named Camp Wayne in 1861 after Revolutionary War general Anthony Wayne, it was situated {{at the corner of}} Church Street and Rosedale Avenue. Critics complained about the poor location as a strategic point, but supporters praised its flat terrain and open space. In any case the Ninth Regiment, with three Chester County companies, arrived at the camp on May 4, 1861, although some men were forced to temporarily lodge at the court house. The 97th regiment was formed by local businessman Henry Guss and trained at the camp, and 143 of its 950 men were from West Chester. The Village Record reported on January 18, 1862, that threats of arson at Camp Wayne forced its commanders to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> A second camp, named Camp Elder, was formed it West Chester in 1863 as a recruiting point for black soldiers. However, it became a parole camp after the Battle of Gettysburg, and 2,000 men were sent there to work on farms for three months.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{protests from}} crewmen, {{who wanted the}} remains hosed over the deck, Callaghan insisted that the young Japanese airman had done his job {{to the best of}} his ability, with honor, and {{deserved}} a military funeral. Stephen Cromwell, a corpsman at the time, later recalled, [...] "I was able to recover his body and I called up to the bridge to ask if I should throw it overboard ... Captain Callaghan said, ‘No, when we secure, <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> to the sick bay, and we'll have a burial for him tomorrow.’" [...] Ivan Dexter, another crew member, gave his account of events to Herb Fahr, recalling that {{the top half of the}} Japanese pilot's body was scattered over the deck, while the bottom half fell with the rest of the plane into the sea. What remained of the body was brought to sick bay for examination, and various Missouri crew took souvenirs from the clothing, including the helmet, scarf, and jacket. Following examination, the remains were placed in a canvas bag with dummy shell casings to weigh it down.|$|E

Before the show, Madonna {{expressed concern about the}} physical and time constraints of the event. [...] "I have eight minutes to set up my stage, 12 minutes to put on the greatest show on Earth, and I have seven minutes to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> So, that football field is clean for {{the second half of the}} game", she said. [...] "How do you do that? This is a Midwesterner girls dream to be performing at the Super Bowl half-time show. In over 25 years of performing that I've done, I have never worked so hard or been so scrupulous or detail-orientated or freaked out."

500|$|Yankovic {{noted that}} his usual method of {{generating}} parody ideas is to scan Billboard charts, radio play and online buzz {{in order to}} create a master list of candidates. From that point, he works out possible puns on the song titles, the potential for humor and general direction for his versions. Fans speculated ahead of the album's release that Yankovic would parody [...] "Let It Go" [...] from the Disney film Frozen, due to the song's popularity. He later explained that he considered making a Frozen parody titled [...] "Make It So" [...] about , but decided not to after discovering such a parody already existed. Yankovic observed that the existing spoof [...] "had gotten enough attention online to make the Disney legal department ask them to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down!</b> I couldn't think of an idea that I liked as much as 'Make It So', so... I gave up!". There were several other songs he intended to parody, but felt he was unable to develop a clever enough idea for, and instead used them in the medley [...] "Now That's What I Call Polka". More specifically, Yankovic expressed that while Daft Punk's [...] "Get Lucky" [...] is an [...] "iconic song", it was too repetitive for him to incorporate new lyrics into effectively.|$|E
500|$|The battle {{commenced}} in {{the early}} morning with several assaults on the Confederate left flank by the I Corps and the XII Corps. [...] After these failed, the II Corps, including the Irish Brigade, was called upon to assault a position near the Confederate center known as the [...] "Sunken Road" [...] or [...] "Bloody Lane." [...] The trench-like road afforded the Confederates a strong defensive position. [...] Just after 9a.m., Maj. Gen. Israel B. Richardson's division, with the Irish Brigade in the lead, moved toward the Sunken Road. [...] Meagher envisioned the delivery of a few volleys from the brigade followed by an impetuous charge. [...] As the Irish Brigade advanced up the crest toward the Sunken Road, it took heavy fire from the Confederates. [...] The progress of the brigade was slowed by a sturdy split rail fence. [...] When Meagher asked for volunteers to run forward and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> Corporal Samuel C. Wright of the 29th sprang forward with several others. [...] Wright recalled that many were shot down before they reached the fence and, as [...] "one would grasp a rail, it would be sent flying out of his hands by rifle shots." [...] The dash back to the lines was just as dangerous. [...] Cpl. Wright was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery at Antietam. [...] He would, over the course of successive battles, be wounded five times and reported dead twice. [...] Despite his travails, he survived the war.|$|E

2500|$|At Marquette University, {{philosophy}} department chairman James South ordered {{graduate student}} Stuart Ditsler to remove an unattributed Dave Barry {{quote from the}} door to the office that Ditsler shared with three other teaching assistants, calling the quote patently offensive. (The quote was: [...] "As Americans we must always remember that we all have a common enemy, an enemy that is dangerous, powerful, and relentless. I refer, of course, to the federal government.") South claimed that the University's free-speech zone rules required Ditsler to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> University spokeswoman Brigid O'Brien Miller stated that it was [...] "a workplace issue, not one of academic freedom." [...] Ultimately, the quote was allowed to remain, albeit with attribution.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a strict}} {{set of rules}} to be {{followed}} for the carriage of the Tabernacle {{laid out in the}} Hebrew Bible.

Whenever the Tabernacle is moved, the Levites will <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and set it up again. [...] Anyone else who goes too near the Tabernacle will be executed.'" [...] (Numbers 1:48-51 NLT). As well, individuals with the Tzaraat skin affliction were not permitted entry to the tabernacle.|$|E

2500|$|Another popular, but apocryphal, legend {{carried by}} the American press {{concerned}} the supposed flying of the German flag over the Hotel d'Angleterre (then being used as the Germany military headquarters in Copenhagen).

The sentry replies that this will not be done. The king then says if the flag is not taken down, he will send a Danish soldier to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> The sentry responds, [...] "The soldier will be shot." [...] The king replies [...] "the Danish soldier will be me." [...] According to the story, the flag was taken down.

[...] "My {{commander}} thinks it was done to insult him, and if you don't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> he will send a force to do it." [...] Captain Rogers then exclaimed to the engineer, [...] "Get the hot-water engine ready."
