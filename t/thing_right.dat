500|$|Nelson and his {{partners}} settled on the beach by the Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the late 1920s. Bessie DuBois, wife of John DuBois, recalled seeing {{him for the first}} time in 1927 or 1928. The DuBoises owned a restaurant that Nelson would frequent, and Bessie made note of his eccentric eating habits: [...] "He would order a pie—not a piece of pie, mind you, but a pie—and he'd eat the whole <b>thing</b> <b>right</b> in front of me." [...] He ate ice cream by the half-gallon, and there were stories that he once ate 18 eggs for breakfast.|$|E
500|$|In 1945 {{he became}} vicar of St. James' Church in Birkdale. Morris had long {{felt that the}} Anglican church was not publicising its message {{effectively}} enough; four years earlier he had written an unpublished article, intended for the Yarmouth Mercury and entitled Christian Hypocrisy, in which he questioned the difference that the Christian church had made to society in general. [...] Morris also felt that the church was completely {{out of touch with}} the people whom it was supposed to represent. [...] He gradually expanded the parish magazine—printed on four pages of cheap paper— into The Anvil, a widely circulated Christian magazine based on Lilliput. Morris managed to employ several notable contributors on Anvil, such as C. S. Lewis, and Harold Macmillan. [...] In 1948 he employed young artist Frank Hampson, a war veteran who had enrolled at the Southport School of Arts and Crafts, where he was described by his tutor as an [...] "outstanding draughtsman 'prepared to go to endless trouble to get a <b>thing</b> <b>right.</b> [...] He worked as the illustrator on Anvil, and later became the full-time artist for Interim, a Christian publicity society formed during a conference of diocesan editors, with ambitions to produce a strip cartoon magazine aimed at children.|$|E

500|$|On December 12, 2006, the Texas Rangers signed Lofton to {{a one-year}} contract. By signing with the Rangers, Lofton tied Todd Zeile for most teams played {{for by a}} {{position}} player. In 84 games with the Rangers, he hit [...]303 with 16 doubles. On July 27, 2007, Lofton was traded by the Rangers to the Indians in exchange for minor league catcher Max Ramírez. [...] "That's my biggest <b>thing</b> <b>right</b> now. I'm {{trying to get a}} World Series ring", Lofton said on joining the Indians {{for the third time in}} his career. The Jacobs Field crowd greeted Lofton with a standing ovation during his first at bat for this tour of duty with the Indians. Lofton noted, [...] "I missed being in Cleveland... I enjoy Cleveland. It's the city that got me going." [...] In Game One of the 2007 ALDS against the Yankees, he went 3-for-4 with four RBIs and one stolen base, which tied him with Rickey Henderson for the MLB's all-time postseason stolen bases record (33). In Game Two, he went 2-for-3 with two walks and scored the winning run in the 11th inning. Then, in Game Three of the 2007 ALCS, the 40-year-old Lofton hit a two-run home run against the Boston Red Sox' Daisuke Matsuzaka, becoming the seventh-oldest player to hit a post-season home run. Lofton earned his 34th career postseason stolen base in Game Four of the 2007 ALCS, setting a new MLB record for playoff steals. The Indians, who at one point had a 31 game lead over the Red Sox, eventually lost the series. Lofton became a free agent at the end of the season but did not sign a contract with a major league team. He expressed interest in playing before the 2009 season. From 2002 to 2007, Lofton played for eight teams and made it to the postseason with four of them. Joe Torre said, after Lofton had been to the playoffs in 11 of the past 13 seasons and played for 11 clubs in his career, [...] "He bounced around a lot of clubs for a reason: They felt he could help them. He did a hell of a job." [...] As Rollie Fingers wrote, [...] "On one hand, Lofton could be seen as a catalyst who magically sparked his teams into playoff contention, but others could say that it was simply a case of top playoff contenders repeatedly seeing him as the final piece of their puzzle." ...|$|E

40|$|It is a platitude among {{decision}} theorists that agents {{should choose}} their actions {{so as to}} maximize expected value. But exactly how to define expected value is contentious. Evidential decision theory (henceforth EDT), causal decision theory (henceforth CDT), and a theory proposed by Ralph Wedgwood that I will call benchmark theory (BT) all advise agents to maximize different types of expected value. Consequently, their verdicts sometimes conflict. In certain famous cases of conflict-medical Newcomb problems-CDT and BT seem to get <b>things</b> <b>right,</b> while EDT seems to get things wrong. In other cases of conflict, including some recent examples suggested by Egan 2007, EDT and BT seem to get <b>things</b> <b>right,</b> while CDT seems to get things wrong.
