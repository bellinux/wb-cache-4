40|$|Block {{copolymers}} {{that combine}} a side-group liquid crystalline polymer (SGLCP) block and a pH-responsivehydrophilic block, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), are shown to confer pH-dependent anchoring {{of the director}} orientation at the aqueous/LC interface. The SGLCP block, poly(4 -cyanobiphenyl- 4 -oxyundecylacrylate), was chosen based {{on its ability to}} influence the director field of <b>the</b> 5 <b>CB</b> (4 -cyano- 4 '-pentylbiphenyl). At low pH the PAA block collapses and the inherent, planar alignment tendency of 5 CB at a water interface prevails. As pH increases, the polyelectrolyte block becomes increasingly charged and expands, producing a change to homeotropic anchoring. The change in anchoring occurs as quickly as the buffer can be changed (within 2 s) and is reversible, with a response that is repeatable over as many cycles as were tested (approximately 20 cycles). The polymer-mediated anchoring persists for 6 days, indicating that the SGLCP block secures the self-assembled layer on <b>the</b> 5 <b>CB,</b> <b>even</b> under conditions that cause repulsive interactions among the PAA blocks. Thus, SGLCP blocks can translate conformational changes of a responsive hydrophilic block into rapid, reversible changes in the director fiel...|$|R
30|$|However, in 3  mm of deflection, {{which was}} the highest tested, <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> showed higher forces than the SLB. This {{occurred}} because the SLB does not press the smaller diameter wires inside the slot walls. However, in <b>CB,</b> <b>even</b> these wires are pressed by the elastomeric or metal ties, promoting greater deflection of the wire, which in turn results in higher levels of force. Previous studies that also compared the forces in different ligation systems corroborate {{with the fact that}} the SLB release smaller forces than CB, when smaller diameters are tested [29, 37].|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} has the objective to investigate immunohistochemical expression of CB 1 receptor and its probable changes in Gastroenteropancreatic system (GEP) of obese and lean Zucker rats {{and understand the}} endocannabinoid pathophysiological implications in the obesity. Male obese (fa/fa) and lean Zucker rats 6 weeks old were obtained from Harlan Italy Srl; the rats were sacrificed at 8, 12 and 16 weeks old. Normal rats also were sacrificed. Specimens of stomach, jejunum-ileum and pancreas were fixed in Bouin’s mixture and embedded in paraffin; obtained sections were processed with anti-CB 1 (Biosource Europe SA) by Streptavidin-Biotin-Complex Method. The findings show that CB 1 receptor is expressed not only in enteric neurons as documented by earlier studies up to now but more widely and with stronger intensity in obese animals compared with their lean counterparts by several structures of gastrointestinal tract (epithelium, glands, endocrine cells and immune cells of villi stroma). In obese Zucker rats pancreas unlike the normal rats where <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 1 receptor is essentially expressed by A-cells, <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 1 immunoreactivity <b>even</b> extends with higher intensity to B-cells. It is concluded that GEP System represents a new and wide peripheral target of EC action that have a direct autocrine, endocrine-paracrine and neurocrine control on many functions of GEP. In addition in GEP of obese Zucker rats in comparison with lean ones, <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 1 receptor is overexpressed and consequently the peripheral endocannabinoid system is upregulated and negatively modulated by leptin. It may contribute to increase hyperphagia, body weight and hyperglycaemia...|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} part of his tenure {{anchoring}} <b>the</b> <b>CBS</b> <b>Evening</b> <b>News,</b> Cronkite competed against NBC's anchor team of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, who anchored the Huntley-Brinkley Report. For much of the 1960s, the Huntley-Brinkley Report had more viewers than Cronkite's broadcast. A key moment for Cronkite came during his coverage of John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. Another factor in Cronkite and CBS' ascendancy {{to the top of the}} ratings was that, as the decade progressed, RCA made a corporate decision not to fund NBC News at the levels that CBS provided for its news broadcasts. Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in coverage. This reputation meshed well with Cronkite's wire service experience, and in 1967 <b>the</b> <b>CBS</b> <b>Evening</b> <b>News</b> began to surpass The Huntley-Brinkley Report in viewership during the summer months.|$|E
