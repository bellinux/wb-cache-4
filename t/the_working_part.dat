60|$|All this is {{familiar}} enough. The {{record of the}} age of machinery is known to all. But the strange mystery, the secret that lies concealed within its organization, is realized by but few. It offers, to those who see it aright, the most perplexing industrial paradox ever presented in the history of mankind. With all our wealth, we are still poor. After {{a century and a half}} of labor-saving machinery, we work about as hard as ever. With a power over nature multiplied a hundred fold, nature still conquers us. And more than this. There are many senses in which the machine age seems to leave the great bulk of civilized humanity, <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>part</b> of it, worse off instead of better. The nature of our work has changed. No man now makes anything. He makes only a part of something, feeding and tending a machine that moves with relentless monotony in the routine of which both the machine and its tender are only a fractional part.|$|E

6000|$|We are, indeed, fully {{prepared}} {{to believe that}} the bearing of children may, and ought, to become as free from danger and long disability to the civilised woman as it is to the savage; nor is it improbable that, as society advances towards its right organisation, motherhood will occupy a less space of woman's life than it has hitherto done. But still, unless the human species is {{to come to an end}} altogether--a consummation which can hardly be desired by even the most ardent advocate of [...] "women's rights"--somebody must be good enough to take the trouble and responsibility of annually adding to the world exactly as many people as die out of it.

Failing any thorough-going reform of this kind, we see nothing for it but the old division of humanity into men potentially, or actually, fathers, and women potentially, if not actually, mothers. And we fear that so long as this potential motherhood is her lot, woman will be found to be fearfully weighted in the race of life.|$|E

"It {{was a great}} while, Sir, {{before we}} could persuade the two Englishmen from pursuing, and {{undoubtedly}} killing them with their fire-arms; but we promised them 'justice should be done them, and, in the mean time, they should reside {{with us in our}} habitation.' In about five days after, these three vagrants, almost starved with hunger, drew near our grove, and perceiving me, the governor, & two others walking {{by the side of the}} creek, they very submissively desired to be received into the family again. We told them of 'their great incivility to us, and of their unnatural barbarity to their countrymen; but yet we would see what the rest agreed to, and in half an hour's time would bring them word.' After some debate, we called them in, where their two countrymen laid a heavy charge against them, for not only ruining, but designing to murder them, which they could not deny. But here I was forced to interpose as a mediator, by obliging the two Englishmen not to hurt them, being naked & unarmed, and that the other three should make them restitution, by building their two huts, and fencing their ground in the same manner as it was before. Well, being in a miserable condition, they submitted to this at present, and lived some time regularly enough, except as to <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>part,</b> which they did not care for, but the Spaniards would have dispensed with that, had they continued easy and quiet. Their arms being given them again, they scarce had them a week when they became as troublesome as ever; but an accident happening soon after, obliged us to lay aside private resentments, and look to our common preservation.|$|E

For this reason, <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> are usually protected with materials resistant to wear (hardfaced/thermal sprayed coatings). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the tribological performance of four different types of coatings as candidates for wear protection of <b>the</b> millâ€™s <b>working</b> <b>parts.</b> <b>The</b> coatings were produced by using the filler materials with the following nominal chemical composition: NiFeBSi-WC, NiCrBSiC, FeCrCTiSi, and FeCrNiCSiBMn, and by using the plasma arc welding and flame and electric arc spraying processes. The results showed that Ni-based coatings exhibited higher wear resistance than Fe-based coatings. The highest wear resistance showed coating produced by using the NiFeBSi-WC filler material and plasma transferred arc welding deposition process. The hardness was not the only characteristic that affected the wear resistance. In this context, the wear rate of NiFeBSi-WC coating was not in correlation with its hardness, in contrast to other coatings. The different wear performance of NiFeBSi-WC coating was attributed to the different type and morphological features of the reinforcing particles (WC) ...|$|R
