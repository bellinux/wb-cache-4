40|$|This {{exploratory}} study provides {{a review of}} the neglected area of entrepreneurial founder team turnover. A novel distinction is made between entrepreneurial founder <b>team</b> <b>member</b> entry and <b>team</b> <b>member</b> exit. Ninety owner-managed ventures were monitored between 1990 and 2000. Presented hypotheses relating to a team's human capital were explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables associated with entry were found not to be the same as those associated with exit. The size of the founding team was significantly negatively associated with subsequent <b>team</b> <b>member</b> entry. The link between team turnover and entrepreneurial team heterogeneity was mixed. Functional heterogeneity was weakly significantly positively associated with <b>team</b> <b>member</b> entry. Heterogeneity of prior entrepreneurial experience was significantly positively associated with <b>team</b> <b>member</b> exit. In addition, family firms were significantly negatively associated with <b>team</b> <b>member</b> exit. The average age of the team was not significantly associated with <b>team</b> <b>member</b> entry or exit. Additional insights in future research may be gathered if a broader definition of team turnover (i. e., considering <b>team</b> <b>member</b> entry and exit) is considered. Practitioner awareness of the different factors associated with <b>team</b> <b>member</b> entry and exit may encourage them to provide assistance, which facilitates the team building process over time in developing firms. Promising areas for additional research are highlighted...|$|R

5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual <b>team</b> <b>members.</b> Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other <b>team</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E
