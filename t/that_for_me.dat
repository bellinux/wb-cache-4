When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed by the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and in war, and Matisse concealed and insisted {{at the same time}} on that Cézanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played and tormented all these things.|$|E

The film {{marked the}} start of a fruitful partnership between the two. Cardinale stated that her films with Bolognini were among the most joyful of her career, considering him to be [...] "a great director, a man of rare professional capability, great taste and culture.

500|$|The {{question}} is: for {{the seven}} million people who watched it, did it feel authentic, did it {{create a sense of}} period? ...We were creating a realistic world within a world– a world of damsels and heroes and a huge amount of excitement. <b>That,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> is the priority. Did it create that world? It absolutely did. That's not to say that we don't work increasingly hard to get everything right. But it's hard to get all the details right when it's a 21st century drama, never mind anything earlier.|$|E

I make films for the audience. The audience, for which I have made the film, really loved it and the audiences outside India have also loved it.

500|$|Influenced by the 1985 {{documentary}} film Shoah, Spielberg {{decided not to}} plan the film with storyboards, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days. Spielberg felt that this gave the film [...] "a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject." [...] He filmed without using Steadicams, elevated shots, or zoom lenses, [...] "everything <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> might be considered a safety net." [...] This matured Spielberg, who felt {{that in the past}} he had always been paying tribute to directors such as Cecil B. DeMille or David Lean.|$|E

At the school, she was known for her speed and sprinting ability. Morgan played for Olympic Development Program (ODP) regional and state teams as well. She later credited the program {{as an integral part}} of her development as a soccer player: [...] "... programs like ODP helped me especially because I did come into the club scene late and it was important for me to play as much as possible, play with the best players and learn from the best coaches. <b>That,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> was crucial to my development." ...|$|E

In 2008, she opened the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod and {{performed}} concerts in China, America and Australia featuring songs from her 40-year career. To further celebrate 40 years since her first performance on a West End Stage, in October 2008 Paige released a picture-based autobiography titled Memories. The book took around eight months to compile; [...] "Since Evita I suppose, I had kept a yearbook.

500|$|Jenna Fischer {{found her}} character's {{break-up}} scene with Roy [...] "really dark," [...] {{as she is}} friends with David Denman outside of the show. She explained, [...] "To see him turn like <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{it was even more}} shocking because I know him as a big teddy bear. He played it so well and I think that cliffhanger of 'I’m gonna kill Jim Halpert' {{is one of the best}} last lines of our episodes ever." [...] "Cocktails" [...] included recurring guest star Michael Patrick McGill as Kenny Anderson, who called working on The Office [...] "a blast." [...] Other guest stars included Dan Cole as Dan Gore, Owen Daniels as the Wallaces' son, and Jean Villepique as Rachel Wallace.|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} part of <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> is that audiences seem very unwilling {{to believe the}} stuff that Teddy [...] says {{at the end and}} yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E

500|$|Agnew's first {{marriage}} was to Beverley in 1983; it {{ended in divorce}} in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played {{in the collapse of}} the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away {{for months at a time}} each and every winter?... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour... my children continue to ask me why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer." [...] Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E
500|$|... "Sing" [...] features" [...] primary vocals by Lennox and American singer Madonna; {{the latter}} sings solo {{on the second}} verse. Apart from them, the line-up {{consists}} of: Anastacia, Isobel Campbell, Dido, Céline Dion, Melissa Etheridge, Fergie, Beth Gibbons, Faith Hill, Angélique Kidjo, Beverley Knight, Gladys Knight, k.d. lang, Sarah McLachlan, Beth Orton, Pink, Bonnie Raitt, Shakira, Shingai Shoniwa, Joss Stone, Sugababes, KT Tunstall and, Martha Wainwright. Since accommodating all the singers would have posed a scheduling challenge, Lennox asked them to contribute vocals on the chorus of the song. When she received the recorded vocals from Madonna, Lennox found that Madonna had not only sung during the chorus, but also contributed by singing the second verse. She [...] "was really touched – for Madonna is very rigorous in what she gets involved in and {{for her to do}} <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I was thrilled to bits". Lennox also admitted that featuring Madonna would bring a bigger audience for the song, thereby helping the cause. The refrain consists of an [...] "empowering message" [...] with the group of singers belting the line [...] "Sing my sister Sing! / Let your voice be heard" [...] while interpolating [...] "Jikelele" [...] in between. According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "Sing" [...] consists of a piano played in the background reminiscent of Marvin Gaye's 1968 single, [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine".|$|E
