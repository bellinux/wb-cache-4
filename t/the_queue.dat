5|$|Diagon Alley's {{flagship}} {{attraction is}} Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, 3-D motion-based steel roller coaster dark ride based around Gringotts Bank, the wizarding bank in Diagon Alley.

5|$|Dueling Dragons {{was one of}} Islands of Adventure {{original}} attractions, {{opening with}} the theme park on May 28, 1999, in The Lost Continent area of the park.

The ride was themed to two dueling dragons. <b>The</b> <b>queue</b> was decorated to be a ruined castle that the two dragons destroyed, once the riders got to the station.

50|$|Each of <b>the</b> {{instruction}} <b>queues</b> {{can accept}} {{up to four}} instructions from the decoder, avoiding any bottlenecks. <b>The</b> instruction <b>queues</b> issue their instructions to their execution units dynamically depending {{on the availability of}} operands and resources.

40|$|We {{consider}} a s-server system with two FCFS <b>queues,</b> where <b>the</b> arrival rates at <b>the</b> <b>queues</b> and <b>the</b> service rate {{may depend on}} the number n of customers being in service or in <b>the</b> first <b>queue,</b> but <b>the</b> service rate {{is assumed to be}} constant for n ? s.

5|$|Not {{long after}} the changes to the ride in 1990, the special effects began to {{deteriorate}} {{due to a lack}} of upkeep. By the time the ride closed, many of the effects were no longer active or had been covered up. Blacklight reactant paint lined the walls, mostly in the form of handprints or outlines of scenes. These gave a 3-D appearance when the rider wore special glasses purchased at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>queue.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> dual <b>queue</b> {{consists}} of two <b>queues,</b> called <b>the</b> primary <b>queue</b> and <b>the</b> secondary <b>queue.</b> There is a single server in <b>the</b> primary <b>queue</b> but <b>the</b> secondary <b>queue</b> has no service facility and only serves as a holding <b>queue</b> for <b>the</b> overloaded primary <b>queue.</b> <b>The</b> dual <b>queue</b> has <b>the</b> additional feature of a priority scheme to help reduce congestion. Two classes of customers, class 1 and 2, arrive to <b>the</b> dual <b>queue</b> as two independent Poisson processes and the single server in <b>the</b> primary <b>queue</b> dispenses an exponentially distributed service time at the rate which {{is dependent on the}} customer&# 039;s class. The service discipline is preemptive priority with priority given to class 1 over class 2 customers. In this paper, we use matrix-analytic method to construct the infinitesimal generator of the system and also to provide a detailed analysis of the expected waiting time of each class of customers in both queues...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, <b>the</b> use of <b>queueing</b> {{theory for}} {{modeling}} uninterrupted traffic flows is evaluated.

5|$|The ride {{itself is}} {{four and a}} half minutes long but {{original}} footage for the ride can be seen in <b>the</b> <b>queue,</b> and there is also a pre-show video. In the ride, patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. Sideshow Bob, however, is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. At least 24 regular characters from the series make an appearance, all voiced by their original actors. Along with the attraction is a gift shop modeled after the Kwik-E-Mart, which opened in late 2007.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ride}} was renovated in 1990, a new space theme was given. The {{story of the}} ride was the {{passengers}} had been to deliver cargo from a suborbital factory to a station in Alaska. Large screen projections, simulated lasers, mist, and recordings {{were added to the}} ride. In <b>the</b> <b>queue,</b> guests would go through three rooms including Rocket Recovery, Mission Control and Repair Bay. The original entrance to the ride was located next to Troika. During HalloWeekends, the park would change the entrance of Disaster Transport to under the lift hill, leaving the one next to Troika to be used for the Halloween Haunt. For the 2009 season, the entrance was permanently changed to under the lift hill. When the entrance was changed, the Rocket Recovery and Mission Control rooms were closed, leaving the Repair Bay the only room guests walked through.|$|E
5|$|The four-minute ride uses 85-foot IMAX Dome {{screens and}} Sony Projectors. There are 24 ride cars, each seating eight people, and {{approximately}} 2000 people can ride it per hour. The projection system uses four overlapping Sony SXRD 4K resolution projectors on each dome, using custom-made semi-circular fisheye lenses to project undistorted images {{at a rate}} of 60 frames per second (in comparison, most feature films project at 24 frames per second). The video is projected onto two dome screens which are made of 416 panels (each 4feet by two feet) and are approximately 80feet tall and 85feet wide. The animation in the ride uses computer generated 3D animation rendered by Blur Studio and Reel FX, rather than the traditional 2-D animation seen on The Simpsons and <b>the</b> <b>queue</b> and pre-show of the ride. The animation reference was provided by Film Roman, the animation studio that animates the series. Each car contains 12 speakers and a Dolby 6.1 surround sound, while the domes contain an additional 90 speakers.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} two coupled queues with {{a generalized}} processor sharing service discipline. <b>The</b> second <b>queue</b> {{has a much}} smaller Poisson arrival rate than <b>the</b> first <b>queue,</b> while <b>the</b> customer service times are of comparable magnitude. The processor sharing server devotes most of its resources to <b>the</b> first <b>queue,</b> except when it is empty. The fraction of resources devoted to <b>the</b> second <b>queue</b> is small, of the same order as {{the ratio of the}} arrival rates. We assume that <b>the</b> primary <b>queue</b> is heavily loaded and that <b>the</b> secondary <b>queue</b> is critically loaded. If we let the small arrival rate to <b>the</b> secondary <b>queue</b> be O(ε), where 0 ≤ε≪ 1, then in this asymptotic limit the number of customers in <b>the</b> first <b>queue</b> will be large, of order O(ε- 1), while that in <b>the</b> second <b>queue</b> will be somewhat smaller, of order O(ε- 1 / 2). We obtain a two-dimensional diffusion approximation for this model and explicitly solve for the joint steady state probability distribution of the numbers of customers in <b>the</b> two <b>queues.</b> This work complements that in (Morrison, 2010), which <b>the</b> second <b>queue</b> was assumed to be heavily or lightly loaded, leading to mean queue lengths that were O(ε- 1) or O(1), respectively...|$|R
