In some instances of very low-value transactions, use of <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> will significantly reduce the profit margin or cause the merchant to lose money on the transaction. Merchants with very low average transaction prices or very high average transaction prices are more averse to accepting <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> In some cases merchants may charge users a [...] "credit card supplement" [...] (or surcharge), either a fixed amount or a percentage, for payment <b>by</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card.</b> This practice was prohibited <b>by</b> most <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> contracts in the United States until 2013, when a major settlement between merchants and <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> companies allowed merchants to levy surcharges. Most retailers have not started using <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> surcharges, however, for fear of losing customers. Surcharging is actually illegal in 10 states.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recent rapid {{development}} in mobile communication enables people being with cellular phone wherever they go. It is practical {{to enhance the}} functionality of cellular phone, and one is to boost consumerfriendly mobile <b>transactions</b> <b>by</b> replacing traditional <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> payment system. However, previous researches focus on the improvement of smartcard technology [1]. That means the handset must be upgraded and that will hinder the take-up of mobile commerce [2 - 5]. In this paper, we propose an on-line payment scheme that people can securely complete their <b>transactions</b> <b>by</b> their current cellular phones with no need to upgrade their handsets. Our scheme uses SIM card, User ID and Password to solve the insecure flaws of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> such as signature forgery, stealing behavior of untrustworthy merchants. Furthermore, the secure information of people such as <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> number, cellular phone number never travels across the network...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} merchants permit {{customers}} using a debit card to withdraw cash {{as part of}} the EFTPOS transaction. In Australia, this facility (known as debit card cashback in many other countries) is known as [...] "cash out". For the merchant, cash out is a way of reducing their net cash takings, saving on banking of cash. There is no additional cost to the merchant in providing cash out because banks charge a merchant a debit card transaction fee per EFTPOS transaction, and not on the transaction value. Cash out is a facility provided by the merchant, and not the bank, so the merchant can limit or vary how much cash can be withdrawn at a time, or suspend the facility at any time. When available, cash out is convenient for the customer, who can bypass having to visit a bank branch or ATM. Cash out is also cheaper for the customer, since only one bank transaction is involved. For people in some remote areas, cash out may be {{the only way they can}} withdraw cash from their personal accounts. However, most merchants who provide the facility set a relatively low limit on cash out, generally $50, and some also charge for the service. Some merchants in Australia only allow cash out with the purchase of goods; other merchants allow cash out whether or not customers buy any goods. Cash out is not available in association with <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> sales because on <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions the merchant is charged a percentage commission based on the transaction value, and also because cash withdrawals are treated differently from purchase <b>transactions</b> <b>by</b> the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> company. (However, though inconsistent with a merchant's agreement with each <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> company, the merchant may treat a cash withdrawal as part of an ordinary <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> sale.) ...|$|R
