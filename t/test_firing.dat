5|$|GoldenEye 007 closely {{follows the}} plot of the movie, though with some minor alterations. The game starts in Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union in 1986, where MI6 has {{uncovered}} a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan are sent to infiltrate the facility and plant explosive charges. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an aeroplane. Five years later in 1991, Bond is sent to investigate a satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia, where programmers Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work. Two years after the Severnaya mission, in 1993, Bond investigates an unscheduled <b>test</b> <b>firing</b> of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Russian troops. Ourumov manages to escape during the encounter.|$|E
40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{study was}} conducted {{to determine the effects of}} deposition from static rocket <b>test</b> <b>fires</b> on corn and alfalfa. Seeds were germinated in a wide concentration range of depositional material, called <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil (TFS). Additionally, the impact of chloride and aluminum, two major components of <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil, on germination was also evaluated. Furthermore, plants were grown in packed columns and exposed to <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil, either in the root zone or on foliage. Tissue was weighed and analyzed to compare biomass production and plant composition. Corn and alfalfa exposed to <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil in the root zone produced less biomass than controls, but foliar treatment had no effect on biomass production. No kernels were produced by corn exposed to <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil in the root zone. Leaves of plants exposed to <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil in the root zone accumulated more metals and nutrients than controls, whereas plant tissue treated with <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil on the leaves contained only elevated levels of aluminum, although levels were still within reasonable concentrations for plants. Germination of seeds was not affected below 1 % <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil in soil; however higher concentrations of <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil decreased percent germination. Addition of chloride to soil also inhibits germination, but addition of aluminum has no effect on germination percentage. Corn germination was restored in <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil leached with 200 mm artificial rainwater. The results of this research contribute information regarding the potential impact of <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil from static <b>test</b> <b>fires</b> on crop production. Test fire soil inhibits germination and growth if deposited in the root zone, and even foliar application alters tissue composition. However, plant composition is not altered significantly in terms of feed criteria, and germination can be restored by irrigating the TFS. The effects of <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil are attributed to high levels of chloride that induce salt stress. Crop damage may be avoided by conducting static <b>test</b> <b>fires</b> after crops are harvested or providing extra irrigation to soil impacted with the TFS...|$|R

5|$|The RAF {{activated}} 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 {{to operate}} the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that {{the government did not}} have to purchase the land. Each missile was supplied with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variant of the Mark 28 with a thinner and lighter casing. While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each one had a USAF authorisation officer. The missiles used a dual key system, one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for <b>test</b> <b>firing,</b> for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After a debate over costs and benefits, the Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The missiles were returned to the United States.|$|E

25|$|Development of the Ares I {{propulsion}} elements {{continued to}} make strong progress. On September 10, 2009, the first Ares I development motor (DM-1) was successfully tested in a full-scale, full-duration <b>test</b> <b>firing.</b> This test was followed by two more development motor tests, DM-2 on August 31, 2010 and DM-3 on September 8, 2011. For DM-2 the motor was cooled to a core temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius), and for DM-3 it was heated to above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius). In addition to other objectives, these two tests validated Ares motor performance at extreme temperatures.

25|$|The first <b>test</b> <b>firing</b> of the Brazo missile was {{conducted}} in April 1974, with the missile, launched from a USAF F-4D Phantom II, successfully shooting down a BQM-34 Firebee drone; four follow-up tests over the following year continued the missile's successful record, {{with none of the}} test shots failing despite difficult test conditions. However, despite the Brazo's success, the follow-on ERASE (Electro-magnetic RAdiation Source Elimination) project was cancelled, and no air-to-air antiradiation missiles would enter service in the West.|$|E

Once there, however, Admiral Goncalves of the Brazilian navy seized the ship. At the Arsenal at Bahia, an apparently incompetent alternative crew grounded the Destroyer on a rock in the basin. The vessel was holed and subsequently abandoned.|$|E
25|$|From Warramunga onwards, the frigates were {{launched}} {{with the ability}} to carry and fire the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) as a replacement for the Sea Sparrow missile; these were quad-packed into the Mark 41 launcher for a payload of 32 missiles. Warramunga was the first ship in the world fitted with the ESSM, and the first <b>test</b> <b>firing</b> was conducted aboard on 21 January 2003.

After a trip, later that month, to Portland, Maine, she reported to the North Atlantic Squadron for operations, training manoeuvres and fleet exercises. Maine spent her active career with the North Atlantic Squadron, operating from Norfolk, Virginia along the East Coast of the United States and the Caribbean. On 10 April 1897, Captain Charles Dwight Sigsbee relieved Captain Crowninshield as commander of Maine.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2011, The Jerusalem Post {{reported}} that the US Army had expressed interest in acquiring the system, to be deployed outside forward bases in Iraq and Afghanistan that could potentially be targeted by artillery rockets. The US military had discovered 107mm rockets in Iraq in the past. On 1 December 2011, The Jerusalem Post {{reported that}} the US Army would decide in January 2012 whether it would purchase the system. Yossi Druker, head of Rafael's Air-to-Air Directorate, said that the initial deal is valued at $100million, but could reach several hundred million dollars {{over a number of}} years.

25|$|In 1929 {{design work}} {{began in the}} Soviet Union for a new 130mm 45 caliber {{submarine}} deck gun that {{would have the same}} external ballistics as the older 130 mm/55 B7 Pattern 1913 gun. It was intended for the gun to use a wedge lock and fixed ammunition, but the plans were changed already before the prototype was ordered. Blueprints and a prototype was ordered from Bolshevik Plant no. 232 in 1930. The design bureau director was N.N.Magdasijev and project leader G.N.Rafalovits. Others involved in the design were S.A.Morozov, S.A.Zalazaev, B.A.Lever, V.M.Rosenberg and V.I.Kudrjashov. The gun design was changed from submarine to destroyer weapon using separate instead of fixed ammunition and in 1932 new specifications included a change from 45 to 50 calibers and a screw breech block instead of wedge block. During <b>test</b> <b>firing</b> in 1934—35 several shortcomings were found in the gun design, particularly with the breech and loading mechanism. Because the Leningrad class destroyers that were supposed to use the guns were already under construction the 130mm B-13 gun was accepted for mass production in 1935 and the first twelve guns were finished during the same year.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} reduced scale emulations of {{standard}} fires in a 2 m 3 enclosure {{have been developed}} for studies at laboratory scale enabling useful comparison and correlation with full scale EN 54 / 7 and UL 268 <b>test</b> <b>fires.</b> This makes study of standard <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> conditions and products substantially more accessible. The reduced scale <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> emulations have smoke obscuration characteristics matched to the fire standards and show acceptable matching of experimental CO levels Sensor, fire detector, and analytical studies have been carried out on <b>test</b> <b>fires</b> in the 2 m 3 enclosure and in a full scale test room. Protocols were developed for capture of gas and vapours from fires on absorbent media and their subsequently desorption and analysis by GC/MS techniques. A data set of GC chromatograms has been generated for full and reduced scale <b>test</b> <b>fires</b> and for a number of non standard fire or false alarm related process including overheating of cooking oils and toasting bread. Analysis of mass spectrometry ion fragmentation spectra has been carried out and a wide range of products identified. Products occurring for a range of different fires include propene, benzene, and some polyaromatics. The value of the scaled <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> emulations has been demonstrated by monitoring response of a range of sensors, detectors and instruments including electrochemical gas sensor, experimental and conventional light scattering smoke detectors, and ion mobility measurement equipment (FAIMS). The study has provided information on fire characteristics and products to inform future research and development on fire detection technologies.
