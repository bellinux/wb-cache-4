The deal for the briefcase fell through, but {{the man who had}} promised Dworkin the money gave her the airline ticket anyway, and she returned to the United States in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

Kika finds Wellington and Dayse together, attacks them, and then leaves for good. Wellington goes to the Texas Hotel to seek solace. Dunga wants to take Wellington up to his room, but Wellington is {{put off by the}} funeral of the recently deceased owner of the hotel. Meanwhile, Isaac is thrown out of the bar after trying to forcibly grab Lígia. He is then seen driving his car and when he meets Kika, he takes her to his apartment and they have sex. As the film concludes, Lígia is shown again complaining about her routine. This is followed by a montage of everyday city life, ending with Kika deciding to dye her hair the same shade that made Isaac so attracted to Lígia.|$|E

500|$|Shostakovich's musical {{response}} to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece, [...] "To the victims of fascism and war", ostensibly {{in memory of the}} Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram: Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman [...] "I started <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself." [...] Several of Shostakovich's colleagues, including Natalya Vovsi-Mikhoels and the cellist Valentin Berlinsky, were also aware of the Eighth Quartet's biographical intent.|$|E
500|$|According to Posner, [...] "Cardozo's 'bottom line' is {{that there}} is no {{liability}} to an unforeseeable plaintiff". Don Herzog, in his 2017 book, deemed the Palsgraf principle to mean that [...] "if anyone was wronged here, it was the man with the parcel. The guards' wronging him happened to harm Mrs. Palsgraf. But that doesn't mean they wronged Mrs. Palsgraf. And if they didn't wrong her, she can't conceivably prevail in a tort action. Cardozo is not <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he were on the jury, he wouldn't find the railroad liable. He is saying it was a legal error to let the jury finding stand." [...] This is because [...] "the crucial fact for Cardozo is that the parcel of explosives was unmarked. So reasonably careful conductors worry only that if they make it fall, it will break... They have no reason to worry about the welfare of Mrs. Palsgraf." ...|$|E
500|$|Sora {{was planned}} as an {{artificial}} intelligence from the start, but because Uchikoshi thought robots seemed cliche, and holograms {{could not move}} around to different places, {{he came up with}} the idea of her being an image shot onto people's eyes with a laser; <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a layman like himself could come up with the idea of such technology, an expert in the field could have been working on developing it already, so he researched it and found out about retinal scanning display technology, and made use of it in the game's story. The full names of both the original You and her clone were taken from a name dictionary, and were initially challenged by KID's marketing team, who thought they sounded [...] "lame"; they relented after Nakazawa explained that the names had a meaning and could not be changed. Because Uchikoshi liked the film Interview with the Vampire, he conceived Tsugumi as being a vampire; the staff did not like this idea, so it was scrapped, but the concept of her being immortal was kept, which led to the introduction of the Curé Virus in the story, as Uchikoshi considered the spreading of vampirism similar to a virus. Another remnant of the vampire concept was kept in Sara, who has infrared vision and can see in the dark. Sara was noted by Uchikoshi as being the otherwise single [...] "normal" [...] person in the cast, offsetting the balance; because of this, she was made into the Kid's twin sister.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{leaders of}} Solidarity, {{gathered}} in the meeting of National Coordinating Commission (Krajowa Komisja Porozumiewawcza), ordered all regional offices of the organization to stay alert and be prepared for a national strike. In Bydgoszcz, a two-hour warning strike took place (March 21), and in a special communique, Solidarity announced that the Bydgoszcz events was a provocation, aimed at the government of Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski. The government responded by sending to Bydgoszcz a special commission, headed by General Jozef Zyto, Deputy Prosecutor-General, whose task was to clear up the situation and find out who was guilty of the beating of the Solidarity activists. However, its members {{were not interested in}} fulfilling their task and their inactivity was criticized by Solidarity. Opposition activists were personally insulted by the Bydgoszcz events, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the beatings could happen to Jan Rulewski, they could happen to any of them. A statement of the Polish United Workers' Party did not improve the situation, as it characterized the Bydgoszcz events as a [...] "flagrant violation of law, which created new tensions".|$|E
2500|$|In the 2013 election, not {{a single}} player {{involved}} with doping was voted into the Hall of Fame. With great players making their first appearance on the ballot such as Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa, there was great debate {{on the use of}} steroids surrounding the legitimacy of their performance toward election. With the topic of steroid use coming into the picture during these player's careers and the Mitchell report released in 2007 investigating past steroid and human growth hormone use, the perception of these accomplishments has been debated as [...] "controversial to the game of baseball and America's view on the sport". The 2013 ballot included Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens who both were involved with the use of steroids during their career but had hall-of-fame-caliber careers. Fans of the sport continue to debate whether or not these two players should be elected, with some <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they were to be, it might {{send a message to the}} world of baseball that it is acceptable to use steroids. Despite this, others believe their accomplishments in the sport outweigh their negative associations with doping. In the 2017 election, Bonds and Clemens ballots had over 53% of the vote, compared to a little over 36% in 2013.|$|E

50|$|One {{approach}} to parody religion aims to highlight deficiencies in particular pro-religious arguments — the <b>thinking</b> being <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a given argument {{can also be}} used to support a clear parody, then the original argument is clearly flawed.

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), chapter [...] Judah left his {{brothers}} {{to live near}} an Adullamite named Hirah. Judah married {{the daughter of a}} Canaanite named Shua and had three sons named Er, Onan, and Shelah. Judah arranged for Er to marry a woman named Tamar, but Er was wicked and God killed him. Judah directed Onan to perform a brother's duty and have children with Tamar in Er's name. But Onan knew that the children would not be counted as his, so he spilled his seed, and God killed him as well. Then Judah told Tamar to remain a widow in his house until Shelah could grown up, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Tamar wed Shelah, he might also die. Later, when Judah's wife died, he went with his friend Hirah to his sheep-shearers at Timnah. When Tamar learned that Judah had gone to Timnah, she took off her widow's garments and put on a veil and sat on the road to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah had grown up and Judah had not given her to be his wife. Judah took her for a harlot, offered her a young goat for her services, and gave her his signet and staff as a pledge for payment, and they cohabited and she conceived. Judah sent Hirah to deliver the young goat and collect his pledge, but he asked about and did not find her. When Hirah reported to Judah that the men of the place said that there had been no harlot there, Judah put the matter to rest {{so as not to be}} put to shame. About three months later, Judah heard that Tamar had played the harlot and become pregnant, and he ordered her to be brought forth and burned. When they seized her, she sent Judah the pledge to identify, saying that she was pregnant by the man whose things they were. Judah acknowledged them and said that she was more righteous than he, inasmuch as he had failed to give her to Shelah. When Tamar delivered, one twin – whom she would name Zerah – put out a hand and the midwife bound it with a scarlet thread, but then he drew it back and his brother – whom she would name Perez – came out. The fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and a closed portion ( [...] , setumah) end here with the end of chapter ...|$|E
