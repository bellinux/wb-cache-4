25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast <b>to</b> <b>preheat</b> the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time <b>to</b> <b>preheat</b> the filaments.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} technological innovation in mid 19th century pig iron production was {{the adoption of}} hot blast, which was developed and patented in Scotland in 1828. Hot blast is a method of using heat from the blast furnace exhaust gas <b>to</b> <b>preheat</b> combustion air, saving {{a considerable amount of}} fuel. It allowed much higher furnace temperatures and increased the capacity of furnaces.|$|E

25|$|The {{substrate}} {{on which}} the film deposition takes place is ultrasonically cleaned and fastened to the substrate holder. The substrate holder {{is attached to the}} manipulator shaft. The manipulator shaft moves translationally to adjust the distance between the ingot source and the substrate. The shaft also rotates the substrate at a particular speed so that the film is uniformly deposited on the substrate. A negative bias DC voltage of 200–400 V {{can be applied to the}} substrate. Often, focused high-energy electrons from one of the electron guns or infrared light from heater lamps is used <b>to</b> <b>preheat</b> the substrate. Heating of the substrate allows increased adatom–substrate and adatom–film diffusion by giving the adatoms sufficient energy to overcome kinetic barriers. If a rough film, such as metallic nanorods, is desired substrate cooling with water or liquid nitrogen may be employed to reduce diffusion lifetime, positively bolstering surface kinetic barriers. To further enhance film roughness, the substrate may be mounted at a steep angle with respect to the flux to achieve geometric shadowing, where incoming line of sight flux lands onto only higher parts of the developing film. This method is known as glancing-angle deposition (GLAD) or oblique-angle deposition (OAD).|$|E
500|$|Hot Blast was {{the single}} most {{important}} advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace {{and was one of the}} most important technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution. [...] Hot blast was patented by James Beaumont Neilson at Wilsontown Ironworks in Scotland in 1828.

2500|$|Thermodynamic {{benefits}} are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated. [...] Major factors limiting the load output of a {{combined cycle power plant}} are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine {{and the heat}} recovery steam generator waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm-up times for the balance of plant and the main piping system. Those limitations also influence the fast start-up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times. And waiting gas turbines consume gas. The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if we have heat storage, allows us <b>to</b> <b>preheat</b> the steam to the required conditions. That is, the plant is started faster and we consume less gas before achieving operating conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Hot blast, {{patented}} by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, {{was the most}} important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron. [...] By using waste exhaust heat <b>to</b> <b>preheat</b> combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coal or two-thirds using coke; however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved. [...] Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity. [...] Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron. [...] This meant that lower quality coal or anthracite could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive; however, {{by the end of the}} 19th century transportation costs fell considerably.|$|E
2500|$|More {{recently}} introduced electronic starters {{use a different}} method <b>to</b> <b>preheat</b> the cathodes. They may be designed to be plug-in interchangeable with glow starters for use in standard fittings. They commonly use a purpose-designed semiconductor switch and [...] "soft start" [...] the lamp by preheating the cathodes before applying a controlled starting pulse which strikes the lamp first time without flickering; this dislodges a minimal amount of material from the cathodes during starting, giving longer lamp life than possible with the uncontrolled impulses to which the lamp is subjected in a switchstart. This is claimed to prolong lamp life {{by a factor of}} typically 3 to 4 times for a lamp frequently switched on as in domestic use, and to reduce the blackening of the ends of the lamp typical of fluorescent tubes. The circuit is typically complex, but the complexity is built into the IC. Electronic starters may be optimized for fast starting (typical start time of 0.3 seconds), or for most reliable starting even at low temperatures and with low supply voltages, with a startup time of 2–4 seconds. The faster-start units may produce audible noise during start-up.|$|E

The {{reason is that the}} price compensates the costs for earlier heating at any time slot. For this purpose, the price can be formulated as an exponentially increasing function (12) using the temperature change rate τ of the considered DEWH as a parameter called τ ^p = (τ ^p_ 1, [...]..., τ ^p_n). Such a price determined with τ ^p_i = τ for all i using (12) leads to a constant effective price determined with (13) of peff,i=prefenΔt/τ.
