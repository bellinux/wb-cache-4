40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} ignition characteristics with air-throttling in an ethylene-fueled scramjet under flight Ma 6. 5 conditions was conducted. The dynamic process of air-throttling ignition was explored systematically. The influences of <b>throttling</b> parameters, i. e., <b>throttling</b> mass rate and duration, were investigated. When the <b>throttling</b> mass rate was 45 % of the inflow mass rate, ambient ethylene could be ignited reliably. The delay time from ignition to <b>throttling</b> was about 45 – 55  ms. There was a threshold of <b>throttling</b> duration under a certain <b>throttling</b> mass rate. It was shorter than 100  ms when the <b>throttling</b> mass rate was 45 %. While a 45 % <b>throttling</b> mass rate {{would make the}} shock train propagate upstream to the isolator entry in about 10 – 15  ms, four lower <b>throttling</b> mass rates were tested, including 30 %, 25 %, 20 %, and 10 %. All of these <b>throttling</b> mass rates could ignite ethylene. However, combustion performances varied with them. A higher <b>throttling</b> mass rate made more ethylene combust and produced higher wall pressure. Through these experiments, {{some aspects of the}} relationships between ignition, flame stabilization, combustion efficiency, and air-throttling parameters were brought to light. These results could also be a benchmark for CFD validation...|$|R

5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for <b>throttle</b> settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For <b>throttle</b> settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to <b>throttle</b> the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to <b>throttle</b> the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E
40|$|Key words: <b>throttling</b> pipelines; {{cavitation}} erosion; simulation Abstract. There often exists cavitation erosion, large {{energy loss}} and big noise in <b>throttling</b> pipelines. In this study, the three-dimensional (3 D) {{model of the}} secondary <b>throttling</b> pipeline was constructed according to the actual structure and parameters. Adopting the finite element method (FEM) for flow field calculation, the secondary and ordinary <b>throttling</b> pipelines have been calculated respectively under different working conditions, and the distribution maps of velocity and pressure fields in the pipelines have been constructed. The analyzed results demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} calculating model. It has also been shown that the cavitation erosion resistance of the secondary <b>throttling</b> pipeline is better than that of the ordinary <b>throttling</b> pipeline. Cavitations first appear at the entrance of <b>throttling</b> pipelines, and as the pressure difference between the two ends increases, the cavitations appears inwards. This result is significant for choosing and designing the <b>throttling</b> pipelines...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} air <b>throttling</b> on flame {{stabilization}} of an ethylene fueled scramjet combustor was investigated by numerical simulation and experiments in this paper. The results were obtained under the inflow condition with Mach number of 2. 0, total temperature of 900 [*]K, total pressure of 0. 8 [*]MPa, and total equivalence ratio of 0. 5. The shock train generated by air <b>throttling</b> {{had a big}} effect on the flow structure of the scramjet combustor. Compared with the combustor without air <b>throttling,</b> the flow field with air <b>throttling</b> had a lower velocity and higher pressure, temperature, and vortices intensity. Air <b>throttling</b> was {{an effective way to}} achieve flame stabilization; the combustion in the combustor without air <b>throttling</b> was nearly blowout. In the experiment, the combustion was nearly blowout with air <b>throttling</b> location of 745 [*]mm, and the fuel/air mixture in the combustor with air <b>throttling</b> location of 875 [*]mm was burned intensively. It was important to choose the location and time sequence of air <b>throttling</b> for fuel ignition and flame stabilization.

5|$|MacLachlan {{reported}} to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge {{and two days}} later attended No. 2 Central Medical Board on 13 August. He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August. He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF. At Queen Mary's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm. MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm {{that would allow him}} to fly a Hurricane. They designed a limb that allowed him to operate the <b>throttle</b> while taking the control column and firing button with his right hand. They spent hours studying the cockpit layout. The medical staff produced an arm with four spring-loaded pins, like fingers, which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit. They secured his left arm to the levers of the <b>throttle</b> quadrant: <b>throttle,</b> propeller pitch control, supercharger and mixture control. The landing gear controls were located on the right side. The artificial arm had to interact with the control column while the gear was being retracted or lowered. His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible, though not without incident. On 7 September 1941 he force-landed in darkness during a searchlight co-operation exercise. On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low-cloud. Nevertheless, he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{comprehensive}} systems study to examine and evaluate <b>throttling</b> capabilities of liquid rocket engines. The focus {{of this study is}} on engine components, and how the interactions of these components are considered for <b>throttling</b> applications. First, an assessment of space mission requirements is performed to determine what applications require engine <b>throttling.</b> A background on liquid rocket engine <b>throttling</b> is provided, along with the basic equations that are used to predict performance. Three engines are discussed that have successfully demonstrated <b>throttling.</b> Next, the engine system is broken down into components to discuss special considerations that need to be made for engine <b>throttling.</b> This study focuses on liquid rocket engines that have demonstrated operational capability on American space launch vehicles, starting with the Apollo vehicle engines and ending with current technology demonstrations. Both deep <b>throttling</b> and shallow <b>throttling</b> engines are discussed. Boost and sustainer engines have demonstrated <b>throttling</b> from 17 % to 100 % thrust, while upper stage and lunar lander engines have demonstrated <b>throttling</b> in excess of 10 % to 100 % thrust. The key difficulty in <b>throttling</b> liquid rocket engines is maintaining an adequate pressure drop across the injector, which is necessary to provide propellant atomization and mixing. For the combustion chamber, cooling can be an issue at low thrust levels. For turbomachinery, the primary considerations are to avoid cavitation, stall, surge, and to consider bearing leakage flows, rotordynamics, and structural dynamics. For valves, it is necessary to design valves and actuators that can achieve accurate flow control at all thrust levels. It is also important to assess the amount of nozzle flow separation that can be tolerated at low thrust levels for ground testing...|$|R

50|$|In practice, {{the degree}} to which rockets can be <b>throttled</b> varies greatly, but most rockets can be <b>throttled</b> by a factor of 2 without great difficulty; the typical {{limitation}} is combustion stability, as for example, injectors need a minimum pressure to avoid triggering damaging oscillations (chugging or combustion instabilities); but injectors can be optimised and tested for wider ranges.For example, some more recent liquid-propellant engine designs that have been optimised for greater <b>throttling</b> capability can be <b>throttled</b> to as low as 18-20 percent of rated thrust.Solid rockets can be <b>throttled</b> by using shaped grains that will vary their surface area {{over the course of the}} burn.|$|R

As Records {{took hold of}} his control column, Haynes focused on the tail engine, whose instruments indicated it was malfunctioning; he found its <b>throttle</b> and fuel supply controls jammed.

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the <b>throttle</b> lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the <b>throttle</b> lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
