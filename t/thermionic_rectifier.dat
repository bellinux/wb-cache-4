40|$|Narrow nuclear resonances, {{initially}} used {{to calibrate}} {{the energy of}} the Birmingham Radiation Centre 3 MV Dynamitron, have proved useful in discovering and identifying accelerator fault conditions. Short-term energy stability (over e few minutes) of a few tens of eV is common. However, variations of many kV occur for several days before the failure of a <b>thermionic</b> <b>rectifier.</b> The beam energy ripple, as reflected in the full width at half maximum of narrow (p,Î³) resonances, has also been analysed to indicate the frequency causing the bulk of the ripple, thus often leading to the identification and correction of faults. Typical faults usually produce increased ripple at either the 50 Hz or 128 kHz oscillator frequency...|$|E
25|$|In a mercury-arc valve, an arc forms {{between a}} {{refractory}} conductive anode and {{a pool of}} liquid mercury acting as cathode. Such units were made with ratings up to hundreds of kilowatts, and were important {{in the development of}} HVDC power transmission. Some types of smaller <b>thermionic</b> <b>rectifiers</b> had mercury vapor fill to reduce their forward voltage drop and to increase current rating over thermionic hard-vacuum devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{capabilities}} and economy of power electronics system {{are determined by}} the active devices that are available. Their characteristics and limitations are a key element in the design of power electronics systems. Formerly, the mercury arc valve, the high-vacuum and gas-filled diode <b>thermionic</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> and triggered devices such as the thyratron and ignitron were widely used in power electronics. As the ratings of solid-state devices improved in both voltage and current-handling capacity, vacuum devices have been nearly entirely replaced by solid-state devices.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Thermionic</b> diode <b>rectifiers</b> {{were widely}} used in power {{supplies}} in vacuum tube consumer electronic products, such as phonographs, radios, and televisions, for example the All American Five radio receiver, to provide the high DC plate voltage needed by other vacuum tubes. [...] "Full-wave" [...] versions with two separate plates were popular because they could be used with a center-tapped transformer to make a full-wave rectifier. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers were made for very high voltages, such as the {{high voltage power supply}} for the cathode ray tube of television receivers, and the kenotron used for power supply in X-ray equipment. [...] However, compared to modern semiconductor diodes, vacuum tube rectifiers have high internal resistance due to space charge and therefore high voltage drops, causing high power dissipation and low efficiency. [...] They are rarely able to handle currents exceeding 250mA owing to the limits of plate power dissipation, and cannot be used for low voltage applications, [...] such as battery chargers. Another limitation of the vacuum tube rectifier is that the heater power supply often requires special arrangements to insulate it from the high voltages of the rectifier circuit.|$|R
