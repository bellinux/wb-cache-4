5|$|Islam has {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of aniconism, and it is considered highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with {{a sense that the}} cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish imams visited the Middle East in late 2005 to raise awareness of the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the Jyllands-Posten, and other information some of which was found to be falsified.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, Soviet troops {{occupied}} the easternmost part of Denmark, and the Soviet Union wrote to <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> accusing Olga and a Danish Catholic bishop of conspiracy against the Soviet government. The surviving Romanovs in Denmark grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt, and Olga decided to move her family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada.|$|E
5|$|Air Greenland A/S, {{also known}} as Greenlandair, is the flag carrier airline of Greenland, jointly owned by the SAS Group (37.5%), the Greenlandic Government and <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>Government.</b> It {{operates}} a fleet of 32 aircraft, including 1 airliner used for transatlantic and charter flights, 9 fixed-wing aircraft primarily serving the domestic network, and 22 helicopters feeding passengers from the smaller communities into the domestic airport network.

5|$|Between 1994 and 2009 a {{complete}} {{new edition of}} Nielsen's works, the Carl Nielsen Edition, was commissioned by <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>Government</b> (at a cost of over 40 million kroner). For many of the works, including the operas Maskarade and Saul and David, and the complete Aladdin music, this was their first printed publication, copies of manuscripts having previously been used in performances. The scores are now all available for download free of charge at the website of the Danish Royal Library (which also owns most of Nielsen's music manuscripts).|$|E
5|$|In 1987, almost 200 former cleanup workers took {{legal action}} against the United States. The action was unsuccessful, but {{resulted}} in the release of hundreds of classified documents. The documents revealed that USAF personnel involved in the clean-up were not subsequently monitored for health problems, despite the likelihood of greater exposure to radiation than the Danes. The United States has since instigated regular examinations of its workers. In 1995, <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> paid 1,700 workers compensation of 50,000kroner each.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was {{severely}} weakened. In 1389 Norway {{entered into a}} personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the Reformation most of its separate institutions were abolished. <b>The</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> in Copenhagen regarded Norway as a backward province to be exploited, but not worthy of investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious Renaissance architecture is unusual in Norway compared to other European countries.|$|E

5|$|The Greenlandic Government and the SAS Group are {{the largest}} {{shareholders}} of the airline, owning a 37.5% stake each. <b>The</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>Government</b> owns the remaining 25% of the stock. The Ministry of Housing, Infrastructure, and Transport oversees {{the development of the}} transport industry in Greenland and controls Mittarfeqarfiit, the airport authority in Greenland. Between them, they control mandatory services, airport taxes, pricing policies, maritime connections and tourism development, effectively allowing Greenland Home Rule to control the company in spite of the other stakeholders.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{maintained}} {{the reputation of}} an outsider during his lifetime, both {{in his own country}} and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through Leonard Bernstein and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was sealed in 2006 when three of his compositions were listed by the Ministry of Culture amongst the twelve greatest pieces of Danish music. For many years, he appeared on the Danish hundred-kroner banknote. The Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the Royal Danish Library, sponsored by <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government,</b> completed the Carl Nielsen Edition, freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hervik {{said that}} the cartoon {{controversy}} must {{be seen in the}} context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002. Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that Jyllands-Posten and <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate. Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April 1940, neutral Denmark was {{invaded by}} Nazi Germany and was {{occupied}} {{for the rest}} of World War II. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served as officers in the Danish Army, they were interned as prisoners of war, but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months. Other Russian émigrés, keen to fight against the Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism. After the surrender of Germany in 1945, the Soviet Union wrote to <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> accusing the Grand Duchess of conspiracy against the Soviet authorities. With the end of the war, Soviet troops occupied the easternmost part of Denmark, and Olga grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt. She decided to move her family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada, a decision with which Kulikovsky complied.|$|E
5|$|The Danish sloop Jordenxiold {{was intercepted}} off Isla Palominos on September 3, 1824, as she {{completed}} a voyage from Saint Thomas to Fajardo; the pirates stole goods and cash from the passengers. The incident {{attracted the attention}} of <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government,</b> which commissioned the Santa Cruz (a 16-gun brigantine commanded by Michael Klariman) to monitor the areas off Vieques and Culebra. On September 8–9 a hurricane, Nuestra Señora de la Monserrate, struck southern Puerto Rico and passed directly over the Mona Passage. Cofresí and his crew were caught in the storm, which drove their ship towards Hispaniola. According to historian Enrique Ramírez Brau, an expedition weeks later by Fajardo commander Ramón Aboy to search Vieques, Culebra and the Windward Islands for pirates was actually after Cofresí. The operation used the schooner Aurora (owned by Nicolás Márquez) and Flor de Mayo, owned by José María Marujo. After weeks of searching, the team failed to locate anything of interest.|$|E

25|$|For {{five months}} Bismarck did nothing. However, in November <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> instituted a new {{constitution}} whereby Holstein was bound closer to Denmark. Schleswig had already {{been a part of}} Denmark for centuries. By the year's end, the Prussian and Austrian armies were massing on the River Eider. On 1 February 1864 the Prussian-Austrian armies invaded Schleswig-Holstein, and ten days afterwards <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> requested British help to resist this. Russell urged Palmerston to send a fleet to Copenhagen and persuade Napoleon III that he should mobilise his soldiers that were placed on the borders of Prussia's Rhineland provinces. Palmerston replied that the fleet could not do much to assist the Danes in Copenhagen and that nothing should be done to persuade Napoleon to cross the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|During most of World War II, Denmark {{was first}} a protectorate, then an {{occupied}} territory under Germany. The decision to invade Denmark {{was taken in}} Berlin on 17 December 1939. On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark in Operation Weserübung and established a de facto protectorate over the country. On 29 August 1943 Germany placed Denmark under direct military occupation, which lasted until the Allied victory on 5 May 1945. Contrary {{to the situation in}} other countries under German occupation, most Danish institutions continued to function relatively normally until 1945. Both <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> and king remained in the country in an uneasy relationship between a democratic and a totalitarian system until <b>the</b> <b>Danish</b> <b>government</b> stepped down in a protest against the German demands to institute the death penalty for sabotage.|$|E
