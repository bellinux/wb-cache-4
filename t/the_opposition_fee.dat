25|$|An {{opposition}} {{can only}} {{be based on a}} limited number of grounds, i.e. {{on the grounds that the}} subject-matter of the patent is not patentable, that the invention is insufficiently disclosed, or that the content of the patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed. <b>The</b> notice of <b>opposition</b> to a European patent must be filed in writing at the EPO (either at Munich, The Hague or Berlin), along with the payment of an <b>opposition</b> <b>fee,</b> within nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the patent in the European Patent Bulletin. <b>Opposition</b> Divisions of <b>the</b> EPO are responsible for <b>the</b> examination of <b>oppositions.</b> <b>The</b> <b>opposition</b> procedure may involve multiple opponents.

5000|$|With social {{tensions}} {{increasing in}} the {{years leading up to}} the American Civil War, and especially after John Brown's Raid, in December 1859 a band of armed pro-slavery men came to Berea while Fee was still away in the East. They delivered notice to J.A.R. Rogers and others to leave the state within 10 days, because of <b>the</b> group's <b>opposition</b> to <b>Fee,</b> their church and college. Although the Berea appealed to the governor of the state for protection, he said he was unable to do so. For a time townspeople abandoned the village and school. Abolitionists were expelled from Lewis and Bracken counties as well. After Fee's return to Bracken County, where he and his family were staying with his in-laws, a committee of 62 men of [...] "high standing" [...] told Fee he and his supporters had to leave Bracken County. [...] Fee lived with his family in exile in Cincinnati, Ohio until 1864. Although they tried to return to Berea before that, violent <b>opposition</b> to <b>Fee</b> and abolitionists forced them out of state again. Matilda Fee had returned to their house in Berea with two of their children without much incident, although both Union and Confederate troops were in the area. Fee was unable to get through to her, so she had to get back to Cincinnati.|$|R

In this way, there can be a situation where <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> members are for example, rightist National Union on one hand, and the Arab parties, on the other hand.
