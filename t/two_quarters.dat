5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the <b>two</b> <b>quarters.</b> The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, for all intents and purposes, the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN). They have faced many of the same restrictions on their lives as have the Palestinians.|$|E

The manufacturers claimed that the movements were simply attempts to increase his appeal to values voters for his presidential run.|$|E
