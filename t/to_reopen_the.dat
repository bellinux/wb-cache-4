5|$|Excavations at {{the quarry}} were stopped in 1881, {{although}} it was not exhausted of fossils, as recent drilling operations have shown. During World War I, when the town was occupied by German forces, preparations were made <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> <b>the</b> mine for palaeontology, and Otto Jaekel was sent from Berlin to supervise. The Allies recaptured Bernissart just as the first fossiliferous layer was about to be uncovered. Further attempts <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> <b>the</b> mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when the mine flooded.|$|E

5|$|Thunder Run {{operated}} {{until the}} end of the 2009 season on November 1. Amid a corporate bankruptcy, on February 4, 2010, Six Flags announced the park would cease operations immediately due to the rejection of an amended lease by the Kentucky State Fair Board. Many attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> <b>the</b> park under new operators. Eventually, on June 27, 2013, a group of investors led by Ed Hart negotiated an agreement <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> <b>the</b> park. The group would spend $36 million <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> <b>the</b> park in May 2014. Thunder Run would be part of the opening day lineup of attractions. Rocky Mountain Construction was hired to refurbish the ride, resulting in the existing wooden track to be replaced. On October 10, 2013, Kentucky Kingdom invited members of the media and amusement industry to ride the refurbished Thunder Run. The ride reopened to the public on May 24, 2014. After the 2016 season, Kentucky Kingdom announced that Thunder Run would get new trains from the Philadelphia Toboggan Company for the 2017 season. These trains would replace the ones first put into service in 1990.|$|E

Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> <b>the</b> investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|By 17 February, the Khmer Republic {{abandoned}} attempts <b>to</b> <b>reopen</b> <b>the</b> Mekong supply line.
