5|$|After mating, {{the female}} washes her vulva thoroughly. If a male {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.|$|E

5000|$|Males {{were highly}} {{motivated}} to achieve high rank. The short term reward {{of this was}} the position itself and the long-term reward was reproductive success, which resulted from greater access <b>to</b> <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> high rank position.|$|R
5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a {{pheromone}} that mimics the sex attractant of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female bee, {{and from there to}} the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} mating system. It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, {{there does not}} appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin sniffing the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status. After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> them. However, a male that attempts <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a direct}} {{competition}} between males to win {{the attention of the}} females in salamanders and newts, with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female's attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with.</b> Some species store sperm through long breeding seasons, as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm.|$|E
5|$|Yellowhammer males {{learn their}} songs from their fathers, {{and over the}} course of time {{regional}} dialects have developed, with minor differences to the conclusion of the basic song; all are mutually recognised by birds from different areas. Each male has an individual repertoire of song variants within its regional dialect; females tend <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> males that share their dialect, and prefer those with the largest repertoires.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Evidence {{suggests}} that each male {{may have a}} unique semen signature, and {{there are reasons to}} consider the possibility that semen sampling (i. e., being inseminated by different prospective mates during courtship) may be part of an evolved female mate assessment strategy. Here we theorize that seminal plasma hypersensitivity represents the extreme negative end of this continuum and functions as a deterrent <b>to</b> <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> genetically incompatible suitors...|$|R
5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E
5|$|Males {{without them}} {{are known as}} unflanged males in {{contrast}} to the more developed flanged males. The transformation from unflanged to flanged can occur very quickly. Unflanged and flanged males have two different mating strategies. Flanged males attract oestrous females with their characteristic long calls. Those calls may also suppress development in younger males. Unflanged males wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one, will force copulation on her. While both strategies are successful, females prefer <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> flanged males and seek their company for protection against unflanged males. Resident males may form consortships with females that can last days, weeks or months after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Satellite males, about 16% of {{the total}} number, have white or mottled ruffs and do not occupy territories; they enter leks and attempt <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the females visiting the territories {{occupied}} by the resident males. Resident males tolerate the satellite birds because, although they are competitors for mating with the females, the presence of both types of male on a territory attracts additional females. Females also prefer larger leks, and leks surrounded by taller plants, which give better nesting habitat.|$|E

5|$|Several {{types of}} cricket songs {{are in the}} {{repertoire}} of some species. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket is near and encourages her <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the caller. A triumphal song is produced {{for a brief period}} after a successful mating, and may reinforce the mating bond to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male. An aggressive song is triggered by contact chemoreceptors on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket.|$|E
5|$|The king grows only {{slightly}} larger after initial mating and continues <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the queen for life (a termite queen can live between 30 to 50years); {{this is very}} different from ant colonies, in which a queen mates once with the male(s) and stores the gametes for life, as the male ants die shortly after mating. If a queen is absent, a termite king produces pheromones which encourage the development of replacement termite queens. As the queen and king are monogamous, sperm competition does not occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of {{pinnipeds}} varies from extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, {{and the remaining}} 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> {{them as well as}} defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> as many females as they can; some of them will even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur—all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber. Larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy stores. In some instances, only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and females.|$|E
25|$|In the newt species Notophthalmus viridescens, {{the males}} rub off {{hormonal}} secretions onto {{the skin of}} the females they are courting. These hormones have been shown to make the female more receptive <b>to</b> <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> the male. When the male deposits the secretions, he detaches from the female and releases a spermatophore (containing spermatozoa). It is then the female’s decision to either accept it and pick it up or reject it by running away; these hormones make her more likely to accept it.|$|R
50|$|In {{the common}} toad, sexual {{competition}} is driven {{in large part}} by fighting - successful males often physically displaced other males from the backs of a female in order to gain access <b>to</b> <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> that female. Larger males were more successful in such takeovers, and had higher reproductive success as a result. However, the vocalizations of these toads provide a reliable signal of body size and thus fighting ability, allowing contests for possession of females to be settled without risk of injury.|$|R

5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{generally}} polygynous, and individual males try <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> as many females as they can. Monogamous pairings {{have been recorded}} in American alligators. Dominant male crocodilians patrol and defend territories which contain several females. Males of some species, like the American alligator, try to attract females with elaborate courtship displays. During courtship, crocodilian males and females may rub against each other, circle around, and perform swimming displays. Copulation typically occurs in the water. When a female is ready to mate, she arches her back while her head and tail submerge. The male rubs across the female's neck and then grasps her with his hindlimbs, placing his tail underneath hers so their cloacas align and his penis can be inserted. Mating can last up to 15 minutes, during which time the pair continuously submerge and surface. While dominant males usually monopolise reproductive females, multiple paternity is known to exist in American alligators, where {{as many as three}} different males may sire offspring in a single clutch. Within a month of mating, the female crocodilian begins to make a nest.|$|E

500|$|Females {{are more}} {{aggressive}} than males during the courtship period, often fighting for access <b>to</b> <b>mates,</b> <b>with</b> fights among females accounting {{for more than half}} the aggressive interactions during this period. [...] If females court a male that already has a partner, the incumbent female will try to repel the competitor, usually by chasing and kicking. [...] These interactions can be prolonged, lasting up to five hours, especially when the male being fought over is single and neither female has the advantage of incumbency. In these cases, the females typically intensify their calls and displays.|$|R
5|$|Bees {{are also}} mimicked by {{plants such as}} the bee orchid which imitates both the {{appearance}} and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt <b>to</b> <b>mate</b> (pseudocopulation) <b>with</b> the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.|$|R
