40|$|<b>Tear</b> <b>trough</b> {{deformity}} is a {{major concern}} in a lot of individuals seeking periorbital rejuvenation. A prominent <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> deformity is characterised by a sunken appearance of the eye that results in the casting of a dark shadow over the lower eyelid, giving the patient a fatigued appearance despite adequate rest, and is refractory to attempts at cosmetic concealment. The <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> deformity is a natural consequence of the anatomic attachments of the periorbital tissues. A variety of techniques have evolved to address this cosmetic issue. Traditional techniques relied on surgical excision of skin, muscle, and fat as well as chemical peels. Treatment is now tailored towards specific anatomic abnormalities and often employs multiple modalities including surgery, botulinum toxin, and replacement of volume. Various original research articles, text book publications and review articles were studied. Data specific to the historical aspect and anatomy of <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> have been enumerated. Techniques of different authors were analysed and their results and complications have been summarised. The technique of the author has also been described here...|$|E
40|$|Aim : To {{explore the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> deformity treatment {{with the use of}} hyaluronic acid gel or autologous fat for soft tissue augmentation and fat repositioning via arcus marginalis release. Material and methods : Seventy-eight patients with the <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> were divided into three groups. Class I has <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> without bulging orbital fat or excess of the lower eyelid skin. Class II is associated with mild to moderate orbital fat bulging, without excess of the lower eyelid skin. Class III is associated with severe orbital fat bulging and excess of the lower eyelid skin. Class I or II was treated using hyaluronic acid gel or autologous fat injections. Class III was treated with fat repositioning via arcus marginalis release. The patients with a deep nasojugal groove of class III were treated with injecting autologous fat into the <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> during fat repositioning lower blepharoplasty as a way of supplementing the volume added by the repositioned fat. Results : Seventy-eight patients with <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> deformity were confirmed from photographs taken before and after surgery. There were some complications, but all had complete resolution. Conclusions : Patients with mild to moderate peri-orbital volume loss without severe orbital fat bulging may be good candidates for hyaluronic acid filler or fat grafting alone. However, patients with more pronounced deformities, severe orbital fat bulging and excess of the lower eyelid skin are often better served by fat repositioning via arcus marginalis release and fat grafting...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tear</b> <b>trough</b> is {{the main}} {{irregularity}} at midface, of which treatment is difficult. There is no agreement in literature about its anatomy and best treatment. The author presented an anatomical study and personal autologous fat grafting technique for <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> treatment. Anatomical dissections were done on two fresh cadavers to examine the skin, subcutaneous, muscle and bone layers, spaces, and attachments. Safety and efficacy were evaluated via retrospective analysis of the last 200 consecutive procedures performed by the author. <b>Tear</b> <b>trough</b> {{is caused by the}} abrupt transition of the palpebral orbicular oculi muscle (OOM) (i. e., thin skin without subcutaneous fat compartment) to the orbital OOM (i. e., thicker skin with malar fat compartment). The <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> region is located at the OOM bony origin at the medial canthus where no specific ligament was found. The grafted fat volume stabilized at two or three months after the procedure, instead of six months as stated in literature, with excellent results and no severe complications. <b>Tear</b> <b>trough</b> is a personal characteristic, a natural anatomical depression caused by subcutaneous irregularity and can worsen with age. The lack of volume is not effectively corrected by surgeries and thus it must be filled. Fat grafting has several advantages over alloplastic fillers, although it may be more difficult. Fat graft is autologous and abundant, and tissue transplantation could enhance skin quality. Fat grafting is a simple, safe, and effective solution for adding extra volume to correct the deflation phenomenon of the midface aging process. There is no specific anatomical plane for volume injection; the fat graft must be evenly distributed in the deep and superficial plane for uniformity...|$|E
40|$|Aging of the midface {{involves}} {{fat tissue}} atrophy, ptosis of the malar and cheek fat pads, osseous rotation, and alterations in the appearance and {{tone of the}} outer layers of the skin. 1 Fat tissue at-rophy and ptosis lead to loss of contours in the malar area, development of <b>tear</b> <b>troughs,</b> nasolabial folds and marionette lines, and increasing fullness of the lower cheeks. 2, 3 Facial fat repositioning is key to any natural re-juvenation protocol. 4, 5 In the early aging process and in patients with thin faces, fillers or fat grafting can be used alone. Patients with medium and heavy faces—and when ptosis is the main issue—will re-quire deep tissue support of the fat pads (in some cases combined with fillers or fat grafts) to achieve the desired effect. 4 Traditional surgical solutions for midfacial rejuvenation (and even some newer ones) 6 include use of temporal, frontal, and buccal ap-proaches combined with extensive subperiosteal dis-section and bony anchoring of suspension material. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> {{deformity}} is {{a natural}} consequence of the anatomic attachments of the periorbital tissues.

40|$|Background: Loss {{of volume}} is an {{important}} aspect in facial aging, but its relevance is frequently neglected during treatment. Objectives: The authors discuss lipofilling as an ancillary procedure to improve the impact of facelifting procedures. Methods: Fifty patients who underwent minimal access cranial suspension (MACS) lifting alone were retrospectively analyzed, and their results were compared to 42 retrospective cases of MACS lifting with adjuvant lipofilling. The results were evaluated with a photographic ranking system by two panels (five plastic surgeons and five medical students). Results: Combined MACS lifting and lipofilling yielded overall cosmetic results that were significantly better than the results achieved with MACS lifting alone. Photographic evaluations showed that improvements were more pronounced in the <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> (P. 05). Conclusions: Volume restoration with lipofilling following MACS lifting procedures produces significantly better postoperative results than MACS lifting alone. This combined procedure produces the most dramatic improvements in the <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> and malar eminence regions...|$|E
40|$|Summary:. To treat <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> {{deformities}} {{in young}} patients, transconjunctival orbital fat repositioning {{has been widely}} used. Although internal fixation of transposed fat enables more secure and stable fixation than the externalized percutaneous suture method, the latter is used more commonly because of the narrow operation field and consequent technical difficulty of the internal fixation method. We describe a novel technique using a newly devised needle (Chang's needle) that facilitates internal fixation of transposed fat pedicles...|$|E

40|$|Jürgen Huber-Vorländer, Martin KürtenFort Malakoff Klinik, Mainz, GermanyAbstract: The <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> or infraorbital hollow is a {{challenging}} area to treat, {{and only a}} few fillers are suitable for this delicate area. We report on a European case series of six subjects with mild to severe tear troughs who received treatment with cohesive polydensified matrix (CPM®) technology hyaluronic acid gel (Belotero® Balance). The product was injected as small depots (up to ten small boli 0. 2 mL maximum each per side) at the supraperiosteal level along or below the orbital rim. Follow-up visits took place at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months after injection for independent evaluation of the clinical effect using the Merz Aesthetics Scale™ for infraorbital hollows and the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale. Adverse events were also recorded. Mean hollowness scores were considerably improved compared with baseline in all subjects. In all women, the improvements remained throughout the 9 -month study, with none reverting to their baseline score. Subjects’ satisfaction with treatment was very high throughout the study, and all women stated that they would repeat treatment with the same product. The CPM hyaluronic acid gel was well tolerated. CPM hyaluronic acid gel is a safe and effective treatment for the <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> area.

40|$|Background: Volume {{loss and}} muscular {{hyperactivity}} {{are two major}} components of the aging process {{that contribute to the}} formation of the folds and wrinkles. <b>Tear</b> <b>trough</b> deformity {{is one of the most}} difficult depressions to correct surgically. Objective: the authors evaluate the results of periorbital filling with hyaluronic acid (HA) in a small series of patients. Methods: Between June 2008 and December 2009, 25 patients were treated with HA to correct <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> deformities. the HA was administered into the preperiosteal tissues with a serial puncture technique and approximately 0. 1 mL was injected at each pass. Each patient's before and after photographs were reviewed by three surgeons; to objectively assess the outcomes, a quantitative scale was used to grade the pre- and postinjection results. the significance of subjective aesthetic evaluation of the photographs was evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U-test. Differences were regarded as significant if probabilities were less than 0. 05. Results: the mean (SD) volume per side needed to achieve correction was 0. 54 (0. 27) mL on the right and 0. 61 (0. 30) mL on the left. Complications included some degree of bruising, erythema, and local swelling. Most patients (88 %) had cosmetic improvement according to the independent evaluation. Conclusions: All patients were very satisfied with their results. During the course of the study, the authors determined that the ideal candidates for this treatment are young, with thick skin and a definite hollow.

40|$|Background Orbital fat {{repositioning}} {{in association}} with subperiosteal midface elevation has been variably described via both the transconjunctival and skin muscle flap approaches. Poor visualization, middle and posterior lamellar cicatricial fibrosis, technical difficulty, and incomplete release are disadvantages commonly ascribed to the transconjunctival approach. Lower eyelid malposition and retraction also are commonly seen {{in association with}} skin muscle flap approaches. A simple technique using the intraoral approach to release the orbital septum and postseptal fat is described in this report. This procedure avoids complications associated with the violation of key lower eyelid anatomic structures and markedly improves visualization through an incision allowing a much larger access. Methods A retrospective review of six patients who underwent endoscopically assisted midface elevation in combination with lower eyelid fat repositioning via a transoral approach since 2009 and were followed up for at least 1 year is presented. A pre- and postoperative assessment of <b>tear</b> <b>trough</b> depth, lower eyelid fat herniation, and midface descent is made. Four of the six patients presented also underwent concurrent additional facial rejuvenation procedures including endoscopically assisted brow-lift, genioplasty, structural fat grafting to the nasolabial folds, and lower eyelid ‘‘pinch’ ’ blepharoplasty. Standard upper buccal sulcus access incisions were used for subperiosteal midface elevation and exposure of the lower orbita...|$|E
40|$|Background:. Indians {{constitute}} one of {{the largest}} population groups in the world. Facial anthropometry, morphology, and age-related changes in Indians differ from those of other ethnic groups, necessitating a good understanding of their facial structure and the required aesthetic treatment strategies. However, published recommendations specific to Indians are few, particularly regarding combination treatment. Methods:. The Indian Facial Aesthetics Expert Group (19 dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and aesthetic physicians with a mean 15. 5 years’ aesthetic treatment experience) met to develop consensus recommendations for the cosmetic facial use of botulinum toxin and hyaluronic acid fillers, alone and in combination, in Indians. Treatment strategies and dosage recommendations (agreed by ≥ 75 % of the group) were based on results of a premeeting survey, peer-reviewed literature, and the experts’ clinical experience. Results:. The need for combination treatment increases with age. <b>Tear</b> <b>trough</b> deficiency is the most common midface indication in Indian women aged 20 – 40 years. In older women, malar volume loss and jowls are the most common aesthetic concerns. Excess medial soft tissue on a relatively smaller midface precedes age-related sagging. Hence, in older Indians, fillers should be used peripherally to achieve lift and conservatively in the medial zones to avoid adding bulk medially. The shorter, wider lower face requires 3 -dimensional correction, including chin augmentation, to achieve increased facial height and the oval shape desired by most Indian women. Conclusions:. These recommendations give physicians treating Indians worldwide a better understanding of their unique facial characteristics and provide treatment strategies to achieve optimal aesthetic outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers {{have become}} the most popular tool for wrinkle {{treatment}} and volumization, although HA is generally absorbed within 6 – 12 months and requires repeated treatments to maintain the effects. Methods: HA was injected onto the bone for volumization with a small 30 -gauge needle to examine the long-lasting effects. Of the 63 Japanese patients with 97 treated sites followed up more than 12 months, 51 had HA injections for cosmetic purposes and 12 were treated for reconstructive volumization of facial deformity such as localized scleroderma and postsurgical bony deformity. Treated sites included the forehead, temple, nasal root, mentum, <b>tear</b> <b>trough,</b> and infraorbital sulcus. Results: After long-term follow-up (12 – 93 months, mean = 21. 6), persistent volumizing effects were observed in most patients. In fact, 86. 6 % of the treated sites showed > 50 % volume retention and 49. 5 % showed > 75 % retention. Magnetic resonance imaging analyses revealed that the injected space was well maintained, capsulated, and filled with heterogeneous content. Magnetic resonance imaging quantitative T 2 maps indicated {{that much of the}} injected HA was replaced with other materials. Together with clinical inspection, these findings suggest that onlay injection of HA on the bone induced formation of capsule, fibrosis, and/or calcification/ossification, which contributed to persistent volumization. Conclusions: Semipermanent volumizing effects can be achieved by HA injection if the target area has an underlying bony floor. Periosteal stem cells may be activated by HA injection and may contribute to persistent volumizing effects. This treatment may be a much less invasive alternative to fat or bone grafting...|$|E
40|$|Background - Although recent {{research}} on micro fat {{has shown the}} potential advantages of superficial implantation and high stem cell content, clinical applications thus far have been limited. Objectives - The authors report their experience with superficial enhanced fluid fat injection (SEFFI) for the correction of volume loss and skin aging of the face in general and in the periocular region. Methods - The finer SEFFI preparation (0. 5 mL) was injected into the orbicularis in the periorbital and perioral areas, and the 0. 8 -mL preparation was injected subdermally elsewhere in the face. Results - The records of 98 consecutive patients were reviewed. Average follow-up time was 6 months, and average volume of implanted fat was 20 mL and 51. 4 mL for the 0. 5 -mL and 0. 8 -mL preparations, respectively. Good or excellent results were achieved for volume restoration and skin improvement in all patients. Complications were minor and included an oil cyst in 3 patients. The smaller SEFFI quantity (0. 5 mL) was well suited to correct volume loss in the eyelids, especially the deep upper sulcus and <b>tear</b> <b>trough,</b> whereas the larger SEFFI content was effective for larger volume deficits {{in other areas of}} the face, including the brow, temporal fossa, zygomatic-malar region, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, chin, and lips. Conclusions - The fat administered by SEFFI is easily harvested via small side-port cannulae, yielding micro fat that is rich in viable adipocytes and stem cells. Both volumes of fat (0. 5 mL and 0. 8 mL) were effective for treating age-related lipoatrophy, reducing facial rhytids, and improving skin quality...|$|E
