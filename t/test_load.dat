50|$|In {{order to}} reduce failures, a precise {{knowledge}} of bond strength quality measurement during product design and subsequent manufacture is of vital importance. The best {{place to start is}} with the failure mode. This {{is based on the assumption}} that there is a particular failure mode, or range of modes, that may occur within a product. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the bond test should replicate the mode, or modes of interest. However, exact replication is not always possible. The <b>test</b> <b>load</b> must be applied to some part of the sample and transferred through the sample to the bond. If this part of the sample is the only option and is weaker than the bond itself, the sample will fail before the bond.|$|E
50|$|The {{melt flow}} index (MFI) {{is a measure}} of the ease of flow of the melt of a {{thermoplastic}} polymer. It is defined as the mass of polymer, in grams, flowing in ten minutes through a capillary of a specific diameter and length by a pressure applied via prescribed alternative gravimetric weights for alternative prescribed temperatures. Polymer processors usually correlate the value of MFI with the polymer grade that they have to choose for different processes, and most often this value is not accompanied by the units, because it is taken for granted to be g/10min. Similarly, the <b>test</b> <b>load</b> conditions of MFI measurement is normally expressed in kilograms rather than any other units. The method is described in the similar standards ASTM D1238 and ISO 1133.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{bending fatigue}} limit moment and crack {{initiation}} life of 4105 crankishaft in five groups of bending moments are obtained by resonant bending fatigue tests first. Then, the static finite element calculation using sub-model is performed {{to get the}} strain distributions in every <b>test</b> <b>load.</b> The results show that in the region where stress concentrate, the strain field {{could be seen as}} plane strain state. So two dimensional strain field intensity model is selected. In order to remove the influences of size and surface conditions, the radius of strain field is determined with the strain distribution under the low-life <b>test</b> <b>load.</b> After that, the local strain field intensities under each <b>test</b> <b>load</b> are calculated with the radius of strain field. Finally, the strain-life curve of material is modified by the fatigue intensity limit of crankshaft, and the predicted life agree with the test results...|$|E

40|$|For {{existing}} bridges {{with large}} uncertainties, analytical methods have limitations. Therefore, to reduce these uncertainties, field testing of a bridge can be used. A type {{of such a}} field test is a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> in which a load equivalent to the factored live load is applied. If the bridge can carry this load without signs of distress, the proof <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is successful, {{and it has been}} shown experimentally that the bridge fulfils the code requirements. It should be understood that this method for assessment is different from the diagnostic <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> that are carried out in Ecuador prior to opening a bridge. The loads used for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are significantly larger. Therefore, it is important to instrument the bridge for a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> and to evaluate during the <b>test</b> that the <b>load</b> does not result in permanent damage to the bridge. To research this topic, and to develop recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests,</b> a series of proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> and a collapse test were carried out in the Netherlands. Additional laboratory testing was carried out as well. Based on this information, recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> of reinforced concrete slab bridges have been developed for the failure modes of flexure and shear. In the German and North American guidelines for <b>load</b> <b>testing,</b> <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> for shear is not permitted. However, many existing bridges do not fulfil the requirements for shear upon assessment according to the current live load models. Even though more experimental research is needed to develop proof <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> for shear in a guideline or code for the Netherlands, the currently available research results already lead to interesting conclusions with regard to the behaviour of bridges proof <b>load</b> <b>tested</b> in shear, and the required safety margin to avoid damage to the bridge.
