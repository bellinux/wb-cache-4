40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{spectrum}} compatibility of <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> (T-DAB) and the microwave Radio Relay Links (RRL) in the L-Band. The two systems {{are using the}} L-Band but the systems characteristics should protect them from each other except for some cases. It is the intention of this paper to provide clear guidelines for full compatibility and therefore avoid mutual interference. The calculation of the coordination distance, that is the minimum tolerable distance between the two transmitter stations, is based upon ITU-R protection ratios and an iterative method that we attempt to detail in this paper...|$|E
30|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) has been attracting substantial attention {{due to its}} excellent performance under severe channel condition[1 â€“ 4]. OFDM has been standardized in many wireless applications with high-speed data transmission such as <b>terrestrial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> and digital video broadcasting[2] and also has been implemented in wireless local area networks and wireless metropolitan area networks due to its robustness to multipath fading and bandwidth efficiency and other advantages. However, some challenging issues still remain unresolved in design of OFDM systems. One of the major problems is its sensitivity to peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of transmitted signals, and some schemes have been proposed to reduce the PAPR in OFDM systems[3, 4]. High PAPR results {{in a way that}} an OFDM receiver's detection efficiency becomes very sensitive to nonlinear devices used in a signal processing loop, such as digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and high-power amplifier, which may severely impair performance due to induced spectral regrowth and detection efficiency degradation[5, 6]. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} accurately identify PAPR distribution in OFDM systems to work out some effective measures to curb PAPR.|$|E
40|$|In every {{wireless}} system, {{the weakest}} link determines {{the performance of}} the network. In this paper the Radio Frequency (RF) performance of both band III and L-band <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> (T-DAB) consumer receivers are discussed. The receivers have been tested based on the EN 50248 standard. The test results show that the average consumer receiver for band III meets the requirements set by EN 50248, except for the non-adjacent interferer experiments. In this experiment, the average consumer receiver performs up to 10 dB worse than required. In addition, the experiments reveal that there is a large difference in performance between consumer receivers. Besides band III, also L-band consumer receivers have been evaluated. The results of the L-band experiments show that the consumer receivers are not capable of decoding a DAB signal with a COST 207 rural area channel model in case of T-DAB mode IV. Network operators should for this reason use mode II for the L-band and should expect a larger influence of non-adjacent interference on receiver performance in band III than anticipated based on EN 50248...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how radio {{frequency}} interference (RFI) generated by <b>digital</b> video <b>broadcasting</b> <b>terrestrial</b> and <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> transmitters {{can be an important}} noise source for forward-looking ground penetrating radar (FLGPR) systems. Even in remote locations the average interference power sometimes exceeds ultra-wideband signals by many dB, becoming the limiting factor in the system sensitivity. The overall problem of RFI and its impact in GPR systems is briefly described and several signal processing approaches to removal of RFI are discussed. These include spectral estimation and coherent subtraction algorithms and various filter approaches which have been developed and applied by the research community in similar contexts. We evaluate the performance of these methods by simulating two different scenarios submitted to real RFI acquired with a FLGPR system developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques (FHR), (GE R). The effectiveness of these algorithms in removing RFI is presented using some performance indices after suppression...|$|R

40|$|A novel low-mast {{low-power}} <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> (T-DAB) single frequency {{network topology}} is described and evaluated in this paper. For this purpose, a pilot network (band III and L-band) {{was constructed in}} Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The performance of the band III pilot network (channel 12 B) is compared with the existing traditional high-power high-mast T-DAB network (channel 12 C) of the public service broadcaster. An important goal is to investigate whether the pilot network can co-exist with an existing traditional T-DAB network. The field trial shows that a gap filler can effectively neutralize the adjacent channel interference of the pilot network on the existing T-DAB network. Moreover, the L-band pilot network is compared with both band III networks by assessing the indoor coverage of every network. For estimation of the indoor coverage, 34 objects were investigated. Both the indoor penetration loss for band III and L-band was determined for each object. Indoor coverage in a region is reached if 95 % of the buildings or more have indoor coverage. Using this definition, the loss for band III is 21. 6 dB and for L-band 24. 6 dB. As a result we consider the indoor penetration loss values reported in literature as too optimistic. Also other parameters of the pilot network were measured, such as the frequency re-use distance...|$|E
