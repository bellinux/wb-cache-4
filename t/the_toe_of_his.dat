60|$|With <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> slipper Sakr-el-Bahr stirred his brother.|$|E
60|$|Whilst <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoe was violently tagged at from below.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} grasped the mantel shelf with both hands, {{and touched the}} log with <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot.|$|E
60|$|Sir Everard tapped <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{carefully}} polished brown {{shoes with}} the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> walking stick.|$|R
6000|$|McNutt wiggled <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> good {{foot and}} {{regarded}} them reflectively. These city folks were surely the [...] "easiest marks" [...] {{he had ever}} come across.|$|R
50|$|In 2015 in an {{interview}} on The Project he commented on the 1994 Le Mans motorcycle accident where he lost <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left foot in the motorcycle chain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mike Delaney!" [...] he cried, kicking on {{the wagon}} wheel with <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot; [...] "Mike Delaney, have you seen my father anywhere?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{torrent of}} Burney's indignation carried with it bodily assault. <b>The</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoe sent the would-be cutter of ropes {{tumbling}} from his seat.|$|E
60|$|Falling {{into line}} behind Mr. Flushing, they were careful {{to leave at}} least three yards' {{distance}} between <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot and the rim of her skirt.|$|E
60|$|Almayer, sitting sidewise to the table, {{his elbow}} pushed amongst the dirty plates, his chin on his breast {{and his legs}} {{stretched}} stiffly out, kept his eyes steadily on <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grass slippers and laughed abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{husband on}} the other hand, his legs outstretched, looked {{straight}} at <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boots. [...] "Are you very sure?" [...] Then as he remained without an answer: [...] "Why should she if he hasn't told HER?" ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. He's as vain as a peacock. He'll cringe when he's {{afraid of}} you and he'll bully when he's not. You can never rely on him. He's crooked from the crown <b>of</b> <b>his</b> German hat to <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> American boots.|$|R
60|$|Again, with <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> moccasin, {{he touched}} the Cossack—a grisly spectacle, no longer conscious—yet in whose dismembered body the pain-racked life clung and was loth to go.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they looked}} at the doctor, who was kicking <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot against the tent pole in {{speculative}} way. It was several seconds before the medical man spoke.|$|E
6000|$|John Clayton, Lord Greystoke--he who {{had been}} [...] "Tarzan of the Apes"--sat in silence in the apartments of his friend, Lieutenant Paul D'Arnot, in Paris, gazing meditatively at <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> immaculate boot.|$|E
50|$|In May 2005, Johnson {{suffered}} {{an injury to}} <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right foot that sidelined him until August of that year. After returning to MLS in August - he scored only five goals during the season - Johnson re-injured his toes in mid-September and was sidelined until January 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Iorg {{was most}} {{recognizable}} for his strange batting stance, on <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> front foot and leaning {{back toward the}} catcher as the ball was being pitched. Usually a singles hitter, Iorg had the highest batting average (.313) and a [...]469 slugging percentage on the Blue Jays in their division-winning 1985 season.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pendyce {{came out}} first; he stared angrily at the dogcart, {{and moved to}} his own carriage. Lord Quarryman came out second. His massive sun-burned head--the back of which, sparsely adorned by hairs, ran {{perfectly}} straight into his neck--was crowned by a grey top-hat. The skirts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grey coat were square-shaped, and so were <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boots.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{short of}} what I expected," [...] said Shark Dodson, kicking softly at the {{packages}} with <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot. And then he looked pensively at the wet sides of his tired horse.|$|E
60|$|Less {{than sixty}} seconds passed, {{and he was}} {{pounding}} vigorously {{on the front door}} of the heavy log building. Not content with using his fist he banged away with <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cowhide boot.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Abbot slipped, or {{the ladder}} slipped, I know not which," [...] {{answered}} Jeffrey gruffly, staring at <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sea-boot. [...] "At least he is safe {{enough in the}} boat now," [...] and, turning, he vanished aft into the mist, muttering to himself-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's another Braddock victory," [...] said Barringford, sarcastically, as he limped painfully along, a horse having {{stepped on}} <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left foot. [...] "Them reg'lars don't {{understand}} fightin' {{in the woods}} nohow. Ye hev got to fight Injuns Injun fashion, an' French likewise. 'Twon't do no good to set yerself up like a target to be shot at." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1979, Costello {{got lost}} for over 24 {{hours on a}} camping trip, and {{subsequently}} had several toes amputated due to frostbite. Although his skating ability was significantly impaired by his disability, he continued his involvement with the team, stuffing rolled-up socks into <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> skates. <b>The</b> incident also attracted international media attention, including coverage in People magazine and on the television show Real People.|$|R
60|$|He {{led the way}} out of the reception-room, and tripped lightly in his slippered feet up {{the steps}} against which Barker knocked <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> clumsy boots. He was not large, nor {{naturally}} loutish, but the heaviness of the country was in every touch and movement. He dropped the photograph twice in his endeavour to hold it between his stiff thumb and finger.|$|R
60|$|He {{gave the}} man a violent kick with <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot. The man groaned, {{stretched}} himself, turned over and rubbed his eyes. The light of the swinging lanthorn showed him the wrathful face of his employer. He struggled to his feet very quickly after that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, at last," [...] said Mab, sharply. [...] "But {{he might}} have said {{something}} encouraging sooner. I thought him dreadfully ugly when he sat frowning, and only said, 'Continue.' I hated him all the {{long way from the}} top of his hair to <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> polished boot." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Mr. Cope came back, Ellen {{was serving}} a customer. He stood looking redder {{than they had}} ever seen him, and tapping <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot impatiently with his stick; and the moment the buyer had turned away, he said, 'Ellen, ask your mother to be kind enough to come down.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{continued}} scraping {{his feet}} vigorously while {{the three women}} went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies' dressing-room. A light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat and like toecaps on <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> goloshes; and, as the buttons <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.|$|R
60|$|He understood, and one morning, a {{few days}} later, as I looked in the pasture for the gray pony, he {{was nowhere to be}} seen. In the dust of the driveway, I {{detected}} the marks <b>of</b> <b>his</b> small feet. <b>The</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoes pointed toward the gate, and there were no returning foot-prints. He had gone away on the long trail which leads to the River of Darkness and The Wide Lands Beyond It.|$|R
50|$|When he {{was still}} young, Read was already an {{accomplished}} street fighter {{and the leader of}} the Surrey Road gang. He began his criminal career by robbing drug dealers, based in massage parlours in the Prahran area. He later graduated to kidnapping and torturing members of the criminal underworld, often using a blowtorch or bolt cutters to remove <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victims as an incentive for them to produce enough money so that Read would leave them alive.|$|R
6000|$|That night, after supper, Sanford {{sat in his}} snug little skting {{room with}} a baby on each knee, looking as cheerful and happy as any man in the village. The {{children}} crowed and shouted as he [...] "trotted them to Boston," [...] or rode them on <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot. They made a noisy, merry group.|$|E
60|$|At 10:30 o'clock old man Ballinger {{came out}} of his house in his {{stocking}} feet and leaned over the gate, smoking his pipe. He looked down the big road, white in the moonshine, and rubbed one ankle with <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> other foot. It was time for the Fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{certainly}} did. There are no tracks besides their own, {{and each}} is powder-burned." [...] Smoke dragged the corpse {{to one side}} and with <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> moccasin nosed a revolver out of the snow into which it had been pressed by the body. [...] "That's what did the work. I told you we'd find something." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 15 June, with Shackleton and the James Caird crew now {{away for}} a month, Macklin, {{assisted}} by McIlroy, carried out the necessary amputations. Greenstreet described the operation. “Blackborow had … all <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left foot taken off ¼ inch stumps being left … The poor beggar behaved splendidly and it went without a hitch … Time {{from start to finish}} 55 minutes. When Blackborow came to he was cheerful as anything and started joking directly.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing,' replied Martin. So saying, the surly man leisurely {{descended from}} the wheel, on {{which he had been}} poising himself on <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right foot, and having summoned the boy in the gray livery, opened the coach door, flung down the steps, and {{thrusting}} in a hand enveloped in a dark wash-leather glove, pulled out the old lady with as much unconcern in his manner {{as if she were a}} bandbox.|$|R
60|$|He {{was lost}} in thought for some little time, and then, rising, he touched the bell upon the table. Gilray trotted in upon the signal so rapidly and noiselessly, {{that he might have}} been one of those {{convenient}} genii in the Eastern fables, only that the little clerk's appearance, from the tips <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ink-stained fingers to <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> seedy boots, was so hopelessly prosaic {{that it was impossible to}} picture him as anything but what he was.|$|R
