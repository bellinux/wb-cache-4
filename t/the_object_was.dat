5|$|Apart from Islam and Christianity, Periyar {{also found}} in Buddhism a basis for his {{philosophy}} {{though he did not}} accept that religion. It was again an alternative in the search for self-respect and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> to get liberation from the discrimination of Hinduism. Through Periyar's movement Temple Entry Acts of 1924, 1931, and up to 1950 were created for the non-Brahmins. Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the Temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits were finally eligible for priesthood.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{had also}} speculated that Persephone, {{the wife of}} the god Pluto, would be a good name for the object. The name had been used several times in science fiction, and was popular with the public, having handily won a poll {{conducted}} by New Scientist magazine ("Xena", despite only being a nickname, came fourth). This was not possible once <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> classified as a dwarf planet, because there is already an asteroid with that name, 399 Persephone.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Pluto was discovered. After initial {{observations}} led to {{the belief}} it was larger than Earth, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> immediately accepted as the ninth planet. Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in 1936, Raymond Lyttleton suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of Neptune, and Fred Whipple suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet. As it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population, it kept its status until 2006.|$|E

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of metal spinning {{is that if}} a crack forms or <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> dented, it must <b>be</b> scrapped. Repairing <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> not cost-effective.|$|R
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing of the critical detonators was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E
5|$|Several astronomers, {{including}} Alan Hale, claimed <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> {{simply an}} 8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, {{which did not}} appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly. Later, Art Bell even claimed to have obtained {{an image of the}} object from an anonymous astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers Olivier Hainaut and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> four car lengths long.|$|E
50|$|The {{form of an}} <b>object</b> that <b>the</b> mind assumes, {{after coming}} into contact with that object or {{enveloping}} it, is called Vritti. The process of enveloping is called Vritti-Vyapti. Vyapti is pervasion and the pervasion by {{the mind of a}} certain location called <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> Vritti-Vyapti. <b>The</b> awareness that <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> there illuminates <b>the</b> <b>object</b> due to <b>the</b> presence in this moving process called the mind and is called phala-vyapti. It is only because of the consciousness attending on the mind that <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> perceived. Vedanta says that <b>the</b> <b>object</b> cannot <b>be</b> wholly material and there is no qualitative difference between <b>the</b> <b>object</b> and consciousness which consciousness by coming into contact with <b>the</b> <b>object</b> knows that <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> there which fact implies that consciousness <b>is</b> inherent in <b>the</b> <b>object.</b> This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Vishaya- chaitanya or the 'object-consciousness' which does not mean consciousness of <b>the</b> <b>object</b> but <b>the</b> <b>object</b> which <b>is</b> a phase of consciousness which prevails everywhere.|$|R
5000|$|Assuming <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> not accelerated, light emitted when <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> closest {{together}} will {{be received}} some time later. At reception, {{the amount of}} redshift will be ...|$|R
50|$|If {{the receive}} signal {{falls in the}} same sample number for both PRF, then <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> first {{ambiguous}} range interval. If the receive signal falls into sample numbers that are different by one, then <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> second ambiguous range interval.

5|$|The plan of Bodenplatte {{called for}} a {{surprise}} attack against 16 Allied air bases in Belgium, the Netherlands and France. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> to destroy or cripple as many Allied aircraft, hangars and airstrips as possible. Every fighter and fighter-bomber Geschwader (Wing) currently occupied with air defence along the Western Front was redeployed. Additional night-fighter units (Nachtjagdgeschwader) and medium bomber units (Kampfgeschwader) acted as pathfinders. The strike formations themselves were mostly single-engine Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{an object}} that is either a planet or a brown dwarf in the orbit of the star HIP 78530. It was {{observed}} as early as 2000, but <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed as one in orbit of the star HIP 78530 until a direct imaging project photographed the star in 2008. The image {{caught the attention of}} the project's science team, so the team followed up on its initial observations. HIP 78530 b orbits a young, hot, bright blue star in the Upper Scorpius association. The planet itself is over twenty-three times more massive than Jupiter, orbiting eighteen times further from its host star than Pluto does from the Sun by the estimates published in its discovery paper. In this predicted orbit, HIP 78530 b completes an orbit every twelve thousand years.|$|E
50|$|Some typical {{circumstances}} <b>are</b> where <b>the</b> <b>object</b> to <b>be</b> measured <b>is</b> moving; where <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> {{surrounded by}} an electromagnetic field, as in induction heating; where <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> contained in a vacuum or other controlled atmosphere; or in applications where a fast response is required, an accurate surface temperature <b>is</b> desired or <b>the</b> <b>object</b> temperature <b>is</b> above <b>the</b> recommended use point for contact sensors, or contact with a sensor would mar <b>the</b> <b>object</b> or <b>the</b> sensor, or introduce a significant temperature gradient on <b>the</b> <b>object's</b> surface.|$|R

5|$|Hale {{had spent}} many {{hundreds}} of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> moving relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of the Mary Rose and her {{contents}} was {{an essential}} part of the project from the start. Though many artefacts, especially those that were buried in silt, had been preserved, the long exposure to an underwater environment had rendered most of them sensitive to exposure to air after recovery. Archaeologists and conservators had to work in tandem from the start to prevent deterioration of the artefacts. After recovery, finds were placed in so-called passive storage, which would prevent any immediate deterioration before the active conservation which would allow them to be stored in an open-air environment. Passive storage depended on the type of material that <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> made of, and could vary considerably. Smaller objects from the most common material, wood, were sealed in polyethylene bags to preserve moisture. Timbers and other objects that were too large to be wrapped were stored in unsealed water tanks. Growth of fungi and microbes that could degrade wood were controlled by various techniques, including low-temperature storage, chemicals, and in the case of large objects, common pond snails that consumed wood-degrading organisms but not the wood itself.|$|E
50|$|This {{category}} {{contains an}} odd mixture of <b>objects.</b> Two of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> edge-on disk galaxies with smaller companion galaxies nearby. Two of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> connected by tidal bridges. <b>The</b> last two <b>objects</b> may simply <b>be</b> interacting {{with each other}} over long distance.|$|R
40|$|<b>Objects</b> <b>are</b> {{accessed}} via references. When {{we create}} an object- by class instantiation- we obtain {{a reference to}} <b>the</b> new <b>object.</b> If we {{send a message to}} <b>the</b> <b>object</b> it <b>is</b> done via the reference. If <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> passed as parameter it is done via the reference. And when <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> returned from a method it is the reference to <b>the</b> <b>object</b> which <b>is</b> returned. We sometimes use the word reference semantics for all of this. Reference semantics should be seen as a contrast to value semantics. Value semantics is discussed in Chapter 14...|$|R
50|$|Animating <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} motion {{tweening}} in Macromedia Flash. A keyframe <b>is</b> created with <b>the</b> <b>object</b> in <b>the</b> desired position. A second keyframe is then created and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> moved to <b>the</b> new desired position. One can then preview {{this with the}} convenient Preview button.|$|R
25|$|Proponents of {{the comet}} {{hypothesis}} have suggested that <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> an extinct comet with a stony mantle that allowed it to penetrate the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|As an {{application}} of the free-choice paradigm, the study How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the striatum changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> chosen, neural activity decreased if <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> rejected. Moreover, studies such as The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2010) and How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification (2011) confirm the neural bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance.|$|E
25|$|On July 17, 2009, a passer-by {{discovered}} a glittering silver object under a black BMW in Eberswalde. Reports say <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> a homemade bomb {{and the car}} belonged {{to the president of}} the local Chicanos.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>object</b> focus, meanwhile, <b>the</b> {{agent is}} {{introduced}} by ng or ni names, and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> introduced by ang, or si, for names. If a sentence has an object focus verb but no indicated object, then {{this means that}} <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> inferred and is already known.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> viewed individually, {{without taking}} other {{documents}} {{as a reference}} and participants did not move objects to compare one to another. <b>The</b> <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> not displayed in the numeric order (1 – 17, as in Table  2), but were arranged randomly.|$|R
5000|$|Hands-on athentication: <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> fully under <b>the</b> {{control of}} the {{verifier}}.

25|$|Illegal force: The FBI conspired {{with local}} police {{departments}} to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins {{in order to}} search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> to frighten or eliminate dissidents and disrupt their movements.|$|E
25|$|Handles are {{identifiers}} {{that represent}} {{a reference to}} a kernel resource through an opaque value. Similarly, opening an object through its name is subject to security checks, but acting through an existing, open handle is only limited to the level of access requested when <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> opened or created.|$|E
25|$|Observers on {{the ground}} {{could not see the}} {{fireball}} because of rain, but the plane was able to find an opening in the clouds. The fireball was a bright naked eye object. Spectroscopic data was acquired that will help determine what <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> made of.|$|E
5000|$|Context {{allows for}} a much greater {{accuracy}} in object recognition. When an identifiable <b>object</b> <b>is</b> blurred, <b>the</b> accuracy of recognition is much greater when <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> placed in a familiar context. In addition to this, even an unfamiliar context allows for more accurate object recognition compared to <b>the</b> <b>object</b> being shown in isolation. [...] This {{can be attributed to}} <b>the</b> fact that <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> typically seen in some setting rather than no setting at all. When <b>the</b> setting <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> in is familiar to the viewer, it becomes much easier to determine what <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is.</b> Though context is not required to correctly recognize, {{it is part of the}} association that one makes with a certain object.|$|R

40|$|An indoor {{positioning}} technique {{based on the}} inertial measurement of <b>the</b> <b>object</b> and <b>the</b> received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measured from an active RFID tag placed on <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> presented. <b>The</b> inertial measurement complements the inaccuracy of the RSSI measurements, especially when <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> far away from RFID reader. Correspondingly, a strong RSSI reading when <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> near a RFID reader provides accurate information about the location of <b>the</b> <b>object.</b> This information could then be used to amend the position estimated from the inertial measurement.
