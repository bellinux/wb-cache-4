40|$|Cylcosporin A (CSA) is {{a potent}} {{immunosuppressive}} drug that inhibits <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> activated T cells by blocking the production of interleukin 2. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} CSA also inhibits <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> neoplastic cells of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic origin. CSA has also been reported to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis, which is characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation. As so many of the therapeutically effective agents in psoriasis are antiproliferative, we sought to determine whether CSA affects <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> keratinocytes. We studied the effect <b>of</b> CSA on <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> normal and transformed keratinocytes and demonstrated that CSA inhibits DNA synthesis and <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> keratinocytes. CSA also inhibits DNA synthesis of other neoplastic cells of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic origin. These findings indicate the CSA inhibits <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> various cell types...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the influence and mechanism of blue light on <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> human retinal pigment epithelial cells. METHODS: Cells {{were divided into}} two groups, including blue light group and control group. The 35 W white light lamp with blue filter was used to establish damaged RPE cell model in vitro. Blue ray wavelength ranged between 470 nm and 520 nm. And the light intensity was about 2 000 Lx. After exposure to blue light, we tested <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> human retinal pigment epithelial cells by CCK- 8 kit. And then expression of miR- 103 was measured by the real-time PCR. RESULTS: Exposure to blue light inhibited <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> human retinal pigment epithelial cells and increased the expression of miR- 103. Moreover, up-regulation of miR- 103 inhibited <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> human retinal pigment epithelial cells, and down-regulates miR- 103 promoted <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> human retinal pigment epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: Blue light inhibits <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> human retinal pigment epithelial cells by the up-regulation of miR- 103...|$|R
40|$|Infection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) changed <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> gastric {{epithelial}} cells and decreased {{the expression of}} heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70). However, the effects of H. pylori on <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> gastric {{epithelial cells}} and the roles of HSP 70 during the progress need further investigation. Objective. To investigate the effects of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) on <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> human gastric epithelial cells. Methods. H. pylori and a human gastric epithelial cell line (AGS) were cocultured. <b>The</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> AGS cells was quantitated by an MTT assay, and the expression of HSP 70 in AGS cells was detected by Western blotting. HSP 70 expression in AGS cells was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) to investigate the role of HSP 70. The siRNA-treated AGS cells were cocultured with H. pylori and cell proliferation was measured by an MTT assay. Results. <b>The</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> AGS cells was accelerated by coculturing with H. pylori for 4 and 8 [*]h, but was suppressed at 24 and 48 [*]h. HSP 70 expression was decreased in AGS cells infected by H. pylori for 48 [*]h. <b>The</b> <b>proliferation</b> in HSP 70 -silenced AGS cells was inhibited after coculturing with H. pylori for 24 and 48 [*]h compared with the control group. Conclusions. Coculture of H. pylori altered <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> gastric epithelial cells and decreased HSP 70 expression. HSP 70 knockdown supplemented the inhibitory effect of H. pylori on <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> epithelial cells. These {{results indicate that the}} effects of H. pylori on <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> gastric epithelial cells at least partially depend on the decreased expression of HSP 70 induced by the bacterium...|$|R
40|$|AIM:To study {{potential}} {{mechanism and}} effects <b>of</b> resveratrol on <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> human retinal vascular endothelial cells in high glucose environment. METHODS:Human retinal vascular endothelial {{cells were cultured in}} low glucoseor high glucose environment. The MTT assay {{was used to}} detect <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> each group to study the effects <b>of</b> resveratrol on <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> human retinal vascular endothelial cells in high glucose environment. Detection of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1) expression and acetylated high mobility group box- 1 protein 1 (HMGB 1) was performed by western-blot and coimmunoprecipitation. RESULTS:Resveratrol inhibited <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> human retinal vascular endothelial cells in high glucose in a dose-dependent manner. High glucose decreased SIRT 1 expression andincrease the degree of HMGB 1 deacetylation, which can be reversed by resveratrol.

50|$|Production {{of fewer}} 'bad' colonies: While c-myc {{promotes}} <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> reprogrammed cells, it also promotes <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> 'bad' cells {{which have not}} reprogrammed properly and make up {{the vast majority of}} cells in a dish of treated cells. Glis1 actively suppresses <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> cells that have not fully reprogrammed, making the selection and harvesting of the properly reprogrammed cells less laborious. This is likely to be due to many of these 'bad' cells expressing Glis1 but not all four of the reprogramming factors. When expressed on its own, Glis1 inhibits proliferation.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effects <b>of</b> {{resveratrol}} on <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> cholangiocarcinoma cells and expression of p 21 and p 27 proteins. Methods: The influences <b>of</b> resveratrol on <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> cholangiocarcinoma cells and expression of p 21 and p 27 proteins were detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method and Western blotting method, respectively. Results: Resveratrol had a conspicuous inhibitory effect on <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> cholangiocarcinoma QBC 939 cells, and was concentration- and time-dependant (P < 0. 05). In addition, it could up regulate {{the expression of}} p 21 and p 27 proteins obviously, and was concentration-dependant (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Resveratrol can significantly inhibit <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> cholangiocarcinoma QBC 939 cells, which {{may be related to}} regulation of p 21 and p 27 expression and negative regulation to cell cycles...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} a novel Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor, AV 65 on imatinib mesylate (IM) -sensitive and -resistant human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells in vitro.

40|$|Available anticancer drugs do {{not seem}} to modify the {{prognosis}} of metastatic melanoma. Salicylate and acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin) were found to suppress growth in a number of transformed cells, that is, prostate and colon. Therefore, we studied the direct effects of aspirin on metastatic B 16 melanoma cells. Aspirin at a plasma-attainable and nontoxic level suppressed <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> B 16 cells. Aspirin induced the activation of p 38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases. Inhibition of JNK, but not p 38, decreased the suppressive effect <b>of</b> aspirin upon <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> B 16 cells. The aspirin-induced reduction in B 16 proliferation was cumulative over time. Aspirin and the chemotherapeutic drug 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU) induced B 16 cell death synergistically. In addition to the murine B 16 cell line, <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> SK- 28 human melanoma cells was also suppressed by aspirin. In conclusion, aspirin suppresses <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> metastatic B 16 cells in a JNK-dependent mechanism...|$|R
