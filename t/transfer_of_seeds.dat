Within the OAKFLOW project natural and artificial gene flow, including interspecific geneflow, was monitored in white oaks (mainly Q. petraea and Q. robur) in different purposely installed study plots across Europe.

We carried out a full factorial experiment with all combinations of these factors and monitored it for 4 years. We studied the effect of seed availability in the soil seed bank on species abundance in the vegetation and compared it to the effect of species introduction by hay. We observed large differences in species composition between different treatments after 4 years. The combination of hay transfer, deep soil removal, and exclusion of large animals resulted in a community with highest similarity to the target vegetation. We found that the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> with hay had a larger effect on species abundance than the soil seed bank.

40|$|In {{support of}} Hanford's waste {{certification}} {{and delivery of}} tank waste to the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP), Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was tasked by the Washington River Protection Solutions (WRPS) {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} <b>of</b> mixing and <b>transferring</b> tank waste in a Double Shell Tank (DST) to the WTP Receipt Tank. The work discussed in this report (Phase III) address the impacts cohesive simulants have on mixing and batch transfer performance. The objective of the demonstrations performed in Phase III was to determine the impact that cohesive particle interactions in the simulants have on tank mixing using 1 / 22 {sup nd} scale mixing system and batch <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> particles. This testing is intended to provide supporting evidence to the assumption that Hanford Small Scale Mixing Demonstration (SSMD) testing in water is conservative. The batch transfers were made by pumping the simulants from the Mixing Demonstration Tank (MDT) to six Receipt Tanks (RTs), and the consistency in the amount <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> particles in each batch was compared. Tests were conducted with non-Newtonian cohesive simulants with Bingham yield stress ranging from 0. 3 Pa to 7 Pa. Kaolin clay and 100 {mu}m stainless steel seed particles were used for all the non-Newtonian simulants. To specifically determine the role of the yield stress on mixing and batch transfer, tests were conducted with a Newtonian mixture of glycerol and water with at viscosity of 6. 2 cP that was selected to match the Bingham consistency (high shear rate viscosity) of the higher yield stress kaolin slurries. The water/glycerol mixtures used the same 100 {mu}m stainless steel seed particles. For the transfer demonstrations in Phase III, the mixer jet pumps were operated either at 10. 0 gpm (28 ft/s nozzle velocity, U{sub o}D= 0. 63 ft{sup 2 }/s) or 8. 0 gpm (22. 4 ft/s nozzle velocity, U{sub o}D= 0. 504 ft{sup 2 }/s). All batch transfers from the MDT to the RTs were made at 0. 58 gpm (MDT suction velocity 3. 95 ft/s). The demonstrations that used simulants that ranged from 1. 6 Pa to 7 Pa yield stress had the most successful batch <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> solids to the RTs in terms of the total quantity <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> particles <b>transferred.</b> Testing suggest that when mixing water/seed particles and transferring, water provides the least desired batch <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> solids based on the total quantity transferred. For the water tests, large dead zones of solids formed in the MDT and fewer solids get transferred to the RTs. For simulants with a yield stress of 0. 3 Pa and below, the batch transfer behavior in terms <b>of</b> total <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> particles was slightly higher than water test results. The testing did show somewhat more batch-to-batch variation in the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> particles with the slurries in comparison to water. A comparison <b>of</b> batch <b>transfers</b> with the kaolin slurries that had Bingham consistencies (viscosities) that wernearly the same as the Newtonian glycerol/water mixtures showed that the kaolin slurries with Bingham yield stresses of 1. 6 and 7 Pa gave better batch <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> particles based on the total quantities transferred. Overall, the batch transfer testing results show that testing with water is conservative, since using a simulant with a yield stress and/or elevated viscosity always resulted in a better total <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> solids...|$|R

The present review of our research work stresses the role of phenolic compounds in the defense mechanism against different fungi and bacteria. It has been established, that the content of phenolics is greatly affected by the infection with pathogenic organisms. Studies on several horticultural plants have demonstrated that the response to infection differs among the analyzed plant species. Generally, an increase of phenolic compounds can be expected in tissues near the infection site. The comparison of healthy and infected tissue reflects an increase of phenolics in infected tissues. Higher levels of all analyzed phenolic groups have been measured in the latter, {{with the exception of the}} anthocyanins. Based on the findings of many-year research studies, it can be concluded that phenolic compounds are involved in the plant defense mechanisms, but the response varies among species...|$|E
40|$|Mastication is {{a forest}} fuel {{thinning}} treatment that involves chipping or shredding small {{trees and shrubs}} and depositing the material across the forest floor. By decreasing forest density mastication {{has been shown to}} lessen crown fire hazard, yet other impacts have only recently started to be studied. Our study evaluates how mastication treatments alter the density and composition of soil seed banks in three Colorado conifer forest types. The three forest types were (1) lodgepole pine, (2) ponderosa pine and (3) pinyon pine-juniper. Results showed that masticated sites contained higher seed bank densities than untreated sites: a pattern primarily driven by treatment effects in ponderosa pine forests. The seed bank was dominated by forbs regardless of forest type or treatment. This pattern of forb dominance was not observed in the above ground vegetation cover as it demonstrated more even proportions of the functional groups. Graminoids showed a higher seed density in treated sites than untreated and, similarly, the identified non-native species only occurred in the treated ponderosa pine sites suggesting a potential below ground invasion for this forest type. These results suggest that presence of masticated material might not be creating a physical barrier hindering the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> as predicted...|$|E
40|$|Many {{herbaceous}} and graminoid {{plants from}} open communities {{are characterized by}} their relatively small size and by seeds that appear to lack any clear traits for dispersal. Such syndrome is likely the result of several selective pressures and their tradeoffs acting together. Drawing on the putative relationship of these plants with large mammals that graze on them, with respect to defoliation and the dispersal of seeds (endozoochory), we included plant stature as a trait in a simulation model to elaborate on these animals relative contribution in plant evolution. Different configurations of the landscape were used as a template, as these are known to affect the response of plants through additional costs levied in dispersal. As such, two herbivore parameters (the intensity of grazing and the efficacy of endozoochorous dispersal) were tested along with two parameters of the landscape (the proportion and connectivity of suitable habitat). Plants were allowed to evolve freely under these conditions, assuming that taller plants 1) produce more seeds and 2) have a more distant seed rain in wind dispersal, but 3) {{are also more likely}} to suffer failed reproduction because of herbivory. Our model confirmed the effects of landscape on the resulting dispersal capacity of plants, although these effects were readily overruled by the actions of grazers. We found the evolution of plant size to primarily result from the effects of defoliation, but also (though to a lesser degree) from endozoochory. This provides support for the adaptive value of unassisted dispersal syndromes in plants. Endozoochory also succeeded in maintaining increased population densities. However, these effects only hold when grazers sustain a considerable <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> towards suitable plant habitat...|$|E

40|$|A {{radiative}} {{mechanism is}} proposed for magnetic flares near luminous accreting black holes. It {{is based on}} recent first-principle simulations of magnetic reconnection, which show a hierarchical chain of fast-moving plasmoids. The reconnection occurs in a compact region (comparable to the black hole radius), and the chain experiences fast Compton cooling accompanied by electron-positron pair creation. The distribution of plasmoid speeds is shaped by radiative losses, and the self-regulated chain radiates its energy in hard X-rays. The mechanism is illustrated by Monte-Carlo simulations <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> soft photons through the reconnection layer. The emerging radiation spectrum has a cutoff near 100 keV similar to the hard-state spectra of X-ray binaries and AGN.

40|$|Throughout the world, diverse avian populations {{continuously}} utilize wetlands. The {{abundance of}} the resources, including shoreline habitat and food, {{has resulted in}} bird species that are adapted exclusively to this habitat and others that use this habitat only during portions of their life cycle or during migration. Today, we witness many adaptations which maximize benefit from this semi-aquatic life style, including: anatomical and morphological adaptations (including rear leg placement for swimming, bone and lung modifications for diving, water resistant plumage), adapted feeding tactics, modified migratory flight paths, and life history adaptations (Weller). These adaptations have created a dependency upon wetland habitat availability for sustained population levels. The effect of birds on wetland habitat is critical for the ecosystem. They are responsible for seed dispersal of many plants, and also for the dispersal of many invertebrates. In addition to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> and organisms, the birds {{have an effect on}} many wetland soils through their waste products, which can serve as nutrient deposits (WB). Birds are also critical to wetlands because they draw the attention of humans to the environment. Many critical pieces of wetland legislation have resulted from the pressure of waterfowl hunters who are concerned with the decline in habitat and the potential ramifications on their recreation. They are also critical to local economies, and then residents may choose to maintain wetlands for their recreational value rather than convert them for another use. Groups such as Ducks Unlimited and Audubon are able to work on a national level to preserve wetlands. In northern Michigan, coastal marshes nurture a diversity of plants and animals. The variance in perennial Great Lakes' water levels has sustained a myriad of plant species. With the long-term cycling of low and high water levels, many changes in micro-habitat occur which result in a shift of the entire biotic community. Plants are directly affected by nutrient availability and water saturation, thus becoming good indicators of many chemical and geophysical properties of the soil in the immediate area surrounding them. Bird populations are directly affected by plant presence and by the availability of insects, invertebrates, small mammals and other birds, which makes them an indicator of the entire productivity of an ecosystem (Weller). The cycling of water levels also has effects on the macro-habitat by significantly affecting the amount of shoreline which is nesting and foraging habitat for birds and therefore the bird populations. This effect was studied through the observation of bird species diversity and abundance at several northern Michigan coastal marsh sites and was compared to historical recrods to determine if Great Lakes' water levels had an effect on bird species diversity and abundance...|$|E
40|$|In many {{tropical}} countries we {{can distinguish}} two seed systems: a formal seed system (comprising breeding companies and national institutes) and an informal seed system, often called farmer seed system (comprising of all farmer {{activities related to}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds).</b> These two systems are intertwined in various degrees for different crops and different regions. Related to these two seed systems are formal and informal crop development systems. In recent years, it is suggested to link these two systems in a more structural way, for example, through Participatory Variety Selection and Participatory Plant Breeding. Various research projects {{have shown that the}} integration of these two systems is feasible and provide various advantages compared to formal crop development, such as varieties that better fit farmer' preferences and are better adapted to their conditions, a higher adoption rate of varieties, enhancement of biodiversity and germplasm conservation. It is often suggested that farmer varieties are well adapted to local conditions and that farmers maintain high levels of diversity in their fields, enabling conditions for the creation of new genetic diversity and new varieties. However, how exactly farmers manage such processes, or whether they actually manage these processes at all is not much studied. With better information {{it will be possible to}} identify opportunities to maintain and enhance farmer selection practices, and to prevent elimination of local processes of value in maintaining genetic diversity. Hence, the objective of this study was to get a better understanding of local gene flow and its effects on crop genetic diversity (i. e. availability, genetic make-up and diversity of varieties) and as such on the farming system as a whole, and whether these effects are related to or influenced by breeding system, gender, farmer selection, or possibly other agricultural practices, socio-economic factors or cultural understandings, consciously or tacitly. The three main research questions that follow from this objective were: 1.       How is gene flow managed by farmers and which factors play a crucial role? 2.       What is the impact of gene flow on the adaptability and resilience of the farming system? 3.       Based on the answers to questions 1 and 2, what suggestions can be made to integrate formal and informal crop improvement? To answer these questions, the following model of gene flow is used:   Gene flow = (seed flow             +           pollen flow)       *           selection pressure   To achieve a better understanding how the various factors related to seed flow, pollen flow and selection pressure interact an interdisciplinary approach is used combining natural and social science. A comparative approach is chosen focusing on two key-variables: crop breeding system and gender. In The Gambia millet (an outbreeding crop) is grown by men and rice (an inbreeding crop) grown by women. During the fieldwork, farmer cultivation practices, seed selection and use and management of varieties are compared between millet and rice and between men and women. In the analyses, quantitative and qualitative plant data and socio-economic data are integrated. Chapters 2 to 9 described the various aspects of the model above. In chapter 12, the concluding chapter, these aspects are brought together and the short formula on gene flow (presented in Chapter 1) further elaborated. With this information, and information from Chapters 10 and 11, the second research question is answered. Finally, this information is used to illuminate the third question through some suggestions on how formal and informal crop improvement might be better integrated. Below, a few of the major findings are highlighted. It seems logical that the higher the rate of cross-pollination, the higher the chances are for new varieties to develop in farmers' fields. In Chapter 7, however, it is shown that for pollen flow to result in the development of new genotypes, the level of pollen flow should not be too high. Distinct, stable genotypes develop more easily in crops with a low cross-pollination rate, like rice. Hence, it is also easier for farmers to select off-types in strong inbreeding crops, and develop them into new varieties, than in strongly outbreeding crops. Other factors determining the chances of the development of new stable genotypes are the distances between fields, the time of flowering, the number of varieties in different fields and the number of mixed-in varieties within fields. Farmers do not mind mixed-in varieties in their seed as they consider it insurance. Because of all these factors, chances of cross-pollination between rice varieties are much higher within fields than between fields. Since within a village almost all farmers grow the same variety of millet chances of pollen flow between millet varieties are very low. Although many people (both farmers and scientists) believe that women are better in distinguishing varieties and plant types, Chapter 9 shows there is no difference in capability between men and women. Additionally, both male and female farmers think off-types are caused by God and they do not have a clear understanding of what exactly causes change in rice and millet. Although men and women have a similar understanding on the development of strange off-types in millet and rice, men have never tried to test strange millet off-types, while women sometimes test and develop strange rice off-types into new varieties. As mentioned above, new stable, distinct off-types develop more easily in rice than in millet. Distinctness of off-types is a requirement for farmers to notice them. The harvesting process enables observations of strange off-types in rice more readily than in millet. Additionally, this study found evidence that it is an aspect of male identity not to test any strange off-types. Men often know how to differentiate varieties, but seemingly this is not knowledge that is important to their self image and to their image within the community. The second main research question was whether gene flow plays a role in keeping farming systems adaptable and resilient. In Chapter 10 it was concluded that processes in relation to genetic diversity differ between rice and millet. In the case of rice, pollen flow between varieties and farmer off-type-selection have important roles in the development of new varieties. Moreover, for rice, seed exchange between communities is crucial to maintain genetic diversity at village level and regional level, whereas it is less important for millet. In millet it is primarily pollen flow within varieties and seed selection through which genetic diversity is maintained. It is likely that genetic diversity for rice fluctuates more over time and space than for millet. For rice, the effect of pollen flow and seed flow on genetic diversity shows in the development of new varieties, whereas for millet, seed and pollen flow lead to the maintenance, or in some cases an increase, of genetic diversity at population level. In Chapter 11 it was elaborated that adaptability (and resilience) can be achieved through genetic diversity and plasticity. Chapter 11 elaborated further on the impact of selection on local adaptation. It shows that millet varieties are not narrowly adapted and that variety choice seems more related to cultural preferences than to local adaptation. Although no data are available, it seems that rice varieties are also quite widely adaptable. For rice, another factor that seems to influence variety choice is the time of introduction of varieties in a village and the range of suitable varieties in that village. At farming system level pollen flow likely plays a limited role in keeping populations adaptable to rapid environmental changes. This does not mean that the process of adaptation through genetic evolution at field level should be ignored, but that it is too slow a process, compared to the decision making process of farmers who can decide in a few years (sometimes in only one year) to change varieties. In Chapter 12 the implications of these findings for the importance of gene flow are discussed. Under slowly changing conditions, a high cross-pollination rate contributes to adaptation at field level, which then in turn contributes to adaptation at farming system level. Under fast changing conditions (whether ecological or socio-economic), seed flows (exchange of varieties) are essential to maintain adaptation at farming system level. A low cross-pollination rate also contributes to the adaptability of farming systems through the development of new varieties. Hence, it can be argued that for late millet the process of adaptation is more gradual, while for rice it is more of a stop-and-go process. Whereas late millet populations slowly adapt to the changing climatic conditions in The Gambia, rice varieties tend toward replacement when the 'older' ones do not fit the conditions anymore. Hence, the millet seed system can be considered low-cost and more robust, whereas the rice seed system is more a higher maintenance and less robust system, needing constant exchange and testing of off-types to keep it adaptable. Finally, in Chapter 12 some suggestions are given how to integrate farmer and formal breeding in the context of The Gambia. There is scope to improve the formal breeding system in itself, particularly by improving funding conditions and the capacity of NARI. Important is also to stimulate two-way traffic of information and seed materials between researchers and farmers, and local testing of materials. As farmer breeding is very much a random process, which is also one of its strengths, it is difficult to improve it. There is more scope in improving farmer breeding by linking it to the formal system. One way to link farmer and formal breeding is through PVS methodologies which can be easily integrated into the 'conventional system of crop improvement'. If formal breeding is improved following the above suggestions, PPB methodologies do not have any apparent advantages in the context of The Gambia, but may be used to reflect how conventional breeding methods can be improved. In the last section it is emphasised that as long as formal crop development excludes particular crop types, farmer crop development remains to play an important role, particularly in risk-prone environments. A last remark is that crop development can only improve agriculture as part of a farming systems approach understanding the complex processes through which crops are formed, maintained and improved...|$|E

40|$|Because {{jasmonic acid}} regulates {{a number of}} processes, {{including}} the expression of vegetative storage proteins in soybean (Glycine max L.) leaves, the relative activity of a specific portion of the jasmonic acid biosynthetic pathway in soybean tissues was examined. Allene oxide synthase and allene oxide cyclase were examined because they constitute a branch point leading specifically from 13 (S) -hydroperoxy- 9 (Z), 11 (E), 15 (Z) -octadecatrienoic acid to 12 -oxo-phytodienoic acid, the precursor of jasmonic acid. From growing plants, seed coats (hila plus testae) of green fruits (38 d post-anthesis) were most active, eliciting about 1. 5 times greater activity on a per milligram of protein basis than the next most active tissue, which was the pericarp. Leaves from fruiting plants were only one-seventh as active as seed coats, and activities in both immature cotyledons and embryonic axes were very low. No activity was detected in any part <b>of</b> stored, mature <b>seeds.</b> After 72 h of germination <b>of</b> stored <b>seeds,</b> {{a small amount of}} activity, about 4 % of that in immature seed coats, was found in the plumule-hypocotyl-root, and no activity was detected in the cotyledons.

40|$|Grain mould (GM) is {{the most}} {{important}} biotic constraint of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) in India {{and other parts of the}} world and host plant resistance {{is the most}} convenient method of control of this disease. Breeding for disease resistance has been slow due to the total reliance on field screening which is used once a year during rainy season. To conduct screening independent of season and to detect possible escapes from field screening, an in vitro screening technique has been developed. The technique involves dip inoculation <b>of</b> mature <b>seed</b> in a mixed spore suspension (1 x 106 spores ml- 1) of major GM fungi (Fusarium moniliforme [Gibberella fujikuroi], F. pallidoroseum and Curvularia lunata [Cochliobolus lunatus]), <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> inoculated <b>seeds</b> to the pre-sterilized Petri dish humid chamber at 25 seeds plate- 1, and their incubation at 28 ± 1 °C with or without light for 5 days. Visual evaluation of mould infection was done on a 1 - 9 scale (where 1 =no colonization and 9 = > 75 % seed surface colonization by the mould fungi) using an illuminated magnifier. The efficiency of the technique was measured by comparing the mean grain mould scores (MGMS) of 43 accessions evaluated at Bhavanisagar, Mysore and Patancheru in India. There was a significant correlation (P < 0. 01) between in vitro MGMS and field scores at or across three locations. Of the 66 photoperiod-sensitive accessions that were screened using the in vitro screening, 14 showed high level of resistance even under field disease nursery situation.

30|$|The current {{geographical}} {{distributions of}} rice landraces and their wild relatives have provided critical hints about the domestication process [32]. One difficulty {{of using the}} current geographical distribution to discuss domestication is that the distribution of O. rufipogon has changed in response to long-term climate changes. Archeological evidence and old literature found in China {{have suggested that the}} northern upper limit of O. rufipogon's geographical distribution was around 30 °N, versus a current limit of around 25 °N [14, 32]. This, together with archeological evidence such as the remains of rice paddies, is sometimes considered to be strong evidence that japonica rice was domesticated around the Yangtze River (Changjiang) region of China more than 7, 000  years ago. However, since the current range of O. rufipogon indicates that adaptation to local regions has occurred during the last 10, 000  years due to climate changes, {{it is likely that the}} change in areas of cultivation due to the adaptation to climate changes may interfere with elucidating the domestication process. Although the current population structures of rice landraces and wild species should reflect the effects of such migration: the movement of natural populations under the influence of climate, once a type of rice is cultivated, rapid expansion of its area of cultivation can be hypothesized to follow migrations of human populations or <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> and plants between populations. Indeed, genome-wide polymorphisms of landraces are strongly associated with their local origins [15, 27]. Furthermore, the associations of the genome-wide polymorphisms with local growing areas would also occur for existing wild rice species, although no evidence to support this hypothesis has been reported yet. Note that the current population structures of landraces and their wild relatives may be affected by certain distinct factors. For example, the population structures of landraces can be affected by the migration of ancient human beings and by their cultivation preferences, whereas those of their wild relatives would be more strongly affected by climate changes. These genome-wide polymorphisms, which reflect local origins or a history <b>of</b> migrations and <b>transfers,</b> are very useful information to elucidate the domestication process. In particular, it is possible to speculate how such landraces migrated and propagated into different areas based on such information. When a single agronomic trait conferred by a specific FNP was favored and selected in early rice intermediates, plants with this FNP would be propagated via migrations and transfers from the plant's original local origin, regardless of whether the FNP originated from selection of a simple mutation or introgression with a locus containing a certain standing variation.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} salinities on the germination <b>of</b> Spartina ciliata <b>seeds</b> were tested during 40 {{days in the}} laboratory, using six concentrations of NaCl (0, 45, 80, 130, 170 and 215 mM) besides three concentrations of seawater (25, 30 and 35 &# 8240;). In addition, the survival and growth of seedlings were tested in five constant salinity regimes (0, 45, 80 and 170 mM NaCl) {{as well as in}} five regimes of simulating seawater overwash. The results showed that seeds possed a high germination capacity over a wide range of salinities (0 to 215 mM NaCl). Although concentrations close to full-strength seawater completely inhibited <b>seed</b> germination, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the ungerminated <b>seeds</b> to freshwater immediately stimulated this. The effects of salinity on seedling growth showed that shoot height and root length were the variables most sensitive to salt stress. Frequent overwash with seawater significantly reduced the survival and growth of Spartina ciliata seedlings. The success in seed germination, survival, and growth of Spartina ciliata in salinities above those normally found in the natural environment could explain the species being distributed throughout salt-stressed foredune habitats in southern Brazil...|$|R

40|$|Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is a North American {{invasive}} alien species, {{which causes}} environmental and health problems. By {{virtue of the}} Slovenian law, landowners are committed to eliminate the plant. Before common ragweed becomes fertile, it is allowed to compost or throw away (into organic waste) the uprooted and mown plants. The main goal {{of the study was}} to examine the effect of composting and elevated temperatures which appear during the processing of the organic waste on the seeds. Fertile common ragweed plants were uprooted in the autumn, near the Ljubljana Railway Station (Slovenia). The plant fruits (nuts, containing one seed) were exposed to following treatments: a homemade composter along with 5 temperature treatments; 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C. The control group were the fruits preserved at room temperature. After the treatments, the fruits were put in the refrigerator for one month. After a superficial sterilisation <b>of</b> the <b>seeds,</b> a germination test was performed in petri dishes on moist filter paper. Germination <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> was surveilled for a period of three weeks. Due to the low germination rate, the test was performed again. After a given time in the second test, the seeds were transfered from petri dishes to a seed germinator containing soil. The germination rate within the first test was the highest in the control group, followed by the 50 °C treatment. The lowest germination rate in the first test was in the composter. In other temperature treatments, there were no seeds that germinated. In the second test, the highest germination rate was achieved in the composter, followed by the control group and lastly the temperature treatment of 50 °C. After the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> to the germinator with soil, another 3 seeds germinated: two from the control group and one from the 50 °C treatment. From the results of the experiment we can conclude that the seeds survive composting in the homemade composter. During the processing of organic waste, however, the temperature of 50 °C should be exceeded so that the seeds are destroyed, which is in accordance with the regulation. ...|$|R

Depuis 2004, une étude a été menée sur des cédraies et sapinières de la région Languedoc-Roussillon.

Certaines mesures sanitaires et le maintien du suivi des populations de ravageurs sont préconisées pour mieux anticiper et limiter l’impact de ces insectes sur la régénération naturelle des peuplementsNatural regeneration {{of forest}} stands {{is subject to}} various environmental constraints. Among these, cone and seed insects are often considered the main biotic factor during the pre-dispersal phase. Since 2004, we have estimated {{the impact of these}} pests in 11 Atlas cedar and 11 fir stands in the Languedoc-Roussillon region. The results show that these insects can cause a significant loss <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> that would otherwise contribute to stand regeneration. Indeed, <b>seed</b> pests <b>of</b> the genus Megastigmus were responsible for the loss of 13 % and 9 % <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> in fir and Atlas cedar stands, respectively.
