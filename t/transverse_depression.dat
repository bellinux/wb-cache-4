40|$|This paper {{examines}} two mold powder related process problems {{experienced at}} BHP's Whyalla operations. Bands of deep <b>transverse</b> <b>depressions</b> extending about {{the perimeter of}} the strand in the first meter of cast product were identified as a potential cause of breakouts. These were associated with level drops in the mold during startup that allow sintered material to accumulate against the mold wall creating a template for depression formation. Extended delays in achieving steady state heat transfer conditions were observed on grades employing low basicity operating powders, and are ascribed to the retention of high basicity slag in the mold. Laboratory studies have identified a possible difficulty in replacing high basicity slags from the mold using low basicity slags due to their greater adhesion with the mold wall (as indicated by lower interfacial heat transfer resistance measurements). Mathematical modelling simulations indicated that higher slag consumption and a static solid slag layer both decrease mold temperature. Steady state conditions were achieved more rapidly by reducing the amount of mixing between startup and operating powders in the mold by delaying the addition of operating powder. This practice also reduced the severity of <b>transverse</b> <b>depressions</b> during startup...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{report the}} results of a joint {{analysis}} of aeromagnetic, topographic and tectonic data in Central-Eastern mainland Greece. The emphasis of the analysis is placed on the detection of coherent lineations (discontinuities), collocated and correlated with faulting structures detected by geological field observation. To this effect, edge detection and image enhancement was applied to digital aeromagnetic anomaly maps and digital elevation models, comprising bidirectional differentiation, wavelet transformation (imaging) and spatial decomposition/ reconstruction in the wavenumber domain. The analysis facilitated the detection of significant topographic lineaments with NNE-SSW, ENE-WSW and ESE-WNW orientations. Respectively, the aeromagnetic data exhibit two families of significant NE-SW, and one family of ESE-WNW lineaments. The major aeromagnetic and topographic lineaments coincide and have comparable width scales of the order of 2 - 3 km, indicating that they are produced by significant discontinuities in the upper crust. The kinematics of the NE-SW faults varies between oblique-slip and strike-slip. These faults affect Neogene to Late Quaternary deposits and have been responsible for the formation of <b>transverse</b> <b>depressions</b> and horsts. This is also corroborated by focal plane solutions from small earthquakes recorded by local networks. The nature of these structures is not yet clear.

40|$|A two-dimensional, transient, finite-element {{model has}} been {{developed}} to simulate temperature, shape, and stress development in the steel shell, during {{the initial stages of}} solidification in the mold.

The calculation includes the effects of temperature-dependent properties, thermal shrinkage, phase transformations, and creep, using an elastic-viscoplastic constitutive equation for low carbon steel. The model features a robust, efficient algorithm to integrate the highly temperature- and stress-dependent constitutive equation for the inelastic-creep strain rate. The results show that thermal stress causes the exposed portion of the thin shell to bend towards the liquid, when there is a sudden drop in liquid level. In addition, the axial temperature gradient creates high transverse stresses. The subsequent rise in liquid level increases the bending. These results illustrate an important mechanism contributing to the formation of <b>transverse</b> surface <b>depressions</b> and short longitudinal surface cracks associated with liquid level fluctuations. 2 Introductio...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{pre-existing}} tectonic {{structures and}} regional stress regime on {{the geometry of}} calderas is widely recognized in the more recent literature on this topic. In fact, although {{in many cases the}} shape of calderas is broadly circular at a great scale, a detailed study of the collapse structures, almost always evidences the presence of linear features inherited from the “pre-caldera” regional tectonic setting. These features, commonly visible in the outcropping rocks that form the pre-volcanic basement, also testify the regional stress field in which volcanism took place. A complete range of increasing complexity examples exists in nature, from elliptical calderas, with a variable degree of ellipticity, to fully irregular calderas, with large linear border sectors due to re-activation of pre-existing regional faults. Elliptical calderas are usually associated with continental rifting, in which regional extension is marked by different horizontal stress components. In these cases the elongation of calderas is parallel to the trend of the regional structures. In some other cases the elongation of the calderas is perpendicular or oblique to the rift structures. This suggests that additional factors may influence the formation of these calderas and the related magma chambers at depth. Examples of such transverse calderas are found along the oceanic ridge of Iceland and along the East African Rift System. Recent studies demonstrated that re-activation of pre-existing structures, orthogonal to the main rift direction, controlled migration and storage of magma bodies at depth, and conditioned activation of volcanism and caldera formation at shallower levels. These so-called transfer structures control the emplacement of surface magma chambers and magma extrusion mainly in that regions in which tectonism and deformational history are very complex, {{as in the case of}} the Apennine chain and the peri-Tyrrhenian area. Where multiple extensional systems intersects to each other, <b>transverse</b> <b>depressions</b> are formed, and volcanism is dominated by caldera-forming eruptions. In these cases it is well evident the control exerted by pre-existing regional structures on the geometry of calderas. Some of these calderas have been later affected by resurgence processes, in which the uplifted blocks are bordered by faults whose geometry is inherited by the pre-caldera regional tectonic setting. The Campi Flegrei caldera and the island of Ischia are good examples of complex, resurgent calderas, characterized by a non regular shape, with large linear rim sectors, for which it is possible to demonstrate the control exerted by pre-existing regional tectonic structure...|$|R

Abrupt lateral variations in {{thickness of the}} Middle to Upper Miocene strata are quite significant among these provinces in the North Fossa Magna. The development of the thrust/fold belt is attributed not only to horizontal compression but also to vertical block movements as basement-involved tectonics. In response to the Pliocene and later compression regime, the old fault-block boundaries were reactivated and produced differential block movement such as the tilting of the Central Upheaval Zone and uplifting of the Nishikubiki Belt. One possible model for the deeper geologic structure is presented that high-angled block faults on the surface among tectonic provinces originate in vertical weak zones in the deep seismogenic zone under the sedimentary layer. The folded Neogene system comprises the present-day thrust-fault province of the North Fossa Magna and the stress regime of strikeslip faulting occupies the basement, as inferred from focal mechanism solutions for small events.
