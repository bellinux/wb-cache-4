The simplest reactions of perfluoroarenes result in C−F oxida <b>tive</b> <b>addition,</b> but C−H activation competes with C−F activation for partially fluorinated molecules. We first consider the reactivity of the fluoroaromatics toward nickel and platinum complexes, but extend to rhenium and rhodium where they give special insight. Sections on spectroscopy and molecular structure are followed by discussions of energetics and mechanism that incorporate experimental and computational results. We highlight special characteristics of the metal−fluorine bond {{and the influence of}} the fluorine substituents on energetics and mechanism. Fluoroaromatics reacting at an ML 2 center initially yield η 2 -arene complexes, followed usually by oxidative addition to generate MF(ArF) (L) 2 or MH(ArF) (L) 2 (M is Ni, Pd, or Pt; L is trialkylphosphine). The outcome of competition between C−F and C−H bond activation is strongly metal dependent and regioselective. When C−H bonds of fluoroaromatics are activated, there is a preference for the remaining C−F bonds to lie ortho to the metal. An unusual feature of metal−fluorine bonds is their response to replacement of nickel by platinum. The Pt−F bonds are weaker than their nickel counterparts; the opposite is true for M−H bonds. Metal−fluorine bonds are sufficiently polar to form M−F***H−X hydrogen bonds and M−F***I−C 6 F 5 halogen bonds. In the competition between C−F and C−H activation, the thermodynamic product is always the metal fluoride, but marked differences emerge between metals in the energetics of C−H activation. In metal−fluoroaryl bonds, ortho-fluorine substituents generally control regioselectivity and make C−H activation more energetically favorable. The role of fluorine substituents in directing C−H activation is traced to their effect on bond energies. Correlations between M−C and H−C bond energies demonstrate that M−C bond energies increase far more on ortho-fluorine substitution than do H−C bonds. Conventional oxidative addition reactions involve a three-center triangular transition state between the carbon, metal, and X, where X is hydrogen or fluorine, but M(d) −F(2 p) repulsion raises the activation energies when X is fluorine. Platinum complexes exhibit an alternative set of reactions involving rearrangement of the phosphine and the fluoroaromatics to a metal(alkyl) (fluorophosphine), M(R) (ArF) (PR 3) (PR 2 F). In these phosphine-assisted C−F activation reactions, the phosphine is no spectator but rather is intimately involved as a fluorine acceptor. Addition of the C−F bond across the M−PR 3 bond leads to a metallophosphorane four-center transition state; subsequent transfer of the R group to the metal generates the fluorophosphine product. We find evidence that a phosphine-assisted pathway may even be significant in some apparently simple oxidative addition reactions. While transition metal catalysis has revolutionized hydrocarbon chemistry, its impact on fluorocarbon chemistry has been more limited. Recent developments have changed the outlook as catalytic reactions involving C−F or C−H bond activation of fluorocarbons have emerged. The principles established here have several implications for catalysis, including the regioselectivity of C−H activation and the unfavorable energetics of C−F reductive elimination. Palladium-catalyzed C−H arylation is analyzed to illustrate how ortho-fluorine substituents influence thermodynamics, kinetics, and regioselectivity...|$|E

40|$|Urecizis can po is an echiuroid worm inhabiting sandy mud flats in the {{estuaries}} of {{the coast}} of California. Its characters and habits have been (lescribed by Fisher and MacGinitie (1928). Because of its large size, the simple nature of its circulatory and respiratory systems, {{and the fact that}} its coelomic fluid is voluminous and contains abundant red blood corpuscles, it affords unusually suitable material for the study of respiratory problems. The present paper contains a description of those propertiesof the blood of Urechis which are of importance in respira tion, together with certain observations designed to evaluate the sig nificance of these properties. The material used for these studies was collected in the Elkhorn Slough, a tributary of Monterey Bay. The authors wish to express their indebtedness to Dr. MacGinitie for assistance in procuring the animals and to Professor Fisher for the many courtesies received while they were at the Hopkins Marine Station. I. THE BLOOD OF UREcHIS Fisher and MacGinitie (1928) state that the coelom is filled with bright red blood, the pigment being lodged in subcircular cells, about 0. 025 mm. in diameter, which readily distort when crowded. There are also very numerous amoeboid cells which when aggregated are yellow in color. We have found the color of the blood to vary, being frequently of a dull brownish-red color; less often, and particularly in smaller specimens, of a bright scarlet resembling the blood of vertebrates. A volume of 15 or 20 cc. may be secured from a singlespecimen. The Blood The plasma does not clot, and when separated from the cells is a pale yellow color; not infrequently it may be tinged with the corpuscular pigment. Under microscopic examination the cytoplasm of the cor puscles appears yellow and is seen to be filled with small, highly refrac <b>tive</b> granules. In <b>addition,</b> there are many granules of a brown pigmen...|$|R
