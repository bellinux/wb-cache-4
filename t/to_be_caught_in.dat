5|$|Porpoises {{are highly}} {{affected}} by bycatch. Many porpoises, mainly the vaquita, {{are subject to}} great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara {{was estimated to be}} at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size. Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a less threatening scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{magnetic}} field serves to deflect {{most of the}} solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. One stripping mechanism is for gas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> bubbles of {{magnetic field}}, which are ripped off by solar winds. Calculations {{of the loss of}} carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Yonekura {{and his men}} {{had reached}} Kaiapit after an {{exhausting}} night march. Yonekura was aware that the Australians had reached Kaiapit but his main concern was not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the open by Allied aircraft. Spotting Australian positions in the pre-dawn light, the Japanese column opened fire. A torrent of fire descended on the Australians, who replied sporadically, attempting to conserve their ammunition. Although he was running low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Poland, Hergé was conscripted into the Belgian Army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Discharged within the month, {{he returned to}} Brussels and began Land of Black Gold. The story subsequently began serialisation in Le Vingtième Siècle on 25 September 1939. He was re-mobilised in December and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to Le Petit Vingtième. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium, and Le Vingtième Siècle was shut down part way through the serialisation of Land of Black Gold, on 8 May. The {{point at which the}} story was ended corresponds to page 30 of the current book edition, when Tintin is about <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a sandstorm following his first confrontation with Muller.|$|E

25|$|Management and {{regulation}} are lacking in many fisheries today. Management measures are urgently needed to monitor fisheries (and illegal fisheries) to protect cetaceans. Efforts to document bycatch {{should focus on}} gill-net fisheries because cetaceans are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> gill-nets. Conservation efforts should be directed to areas where marine mammal bycatch is high but where no infrastructure exists to assess the impact. There {{is a lack of}} reporting on a global scale of cetacean bycatch.|$|E
25|$|A ball {{rotating}} {{around the}} seam will move either {{right or left}} when it hits the pitch, depending on which way the ball is spinning. A ball bouncing to the right {{is said to be}} an off cutter as it is travelling from off stump to leg stump for a right-handed batsman. Conversely, a ball that bounces to the left is a leg cutter, travelling from leg to off stump for a right-handed batsman. Cutters are usually aimed so that they hit the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and move away from the wicket. This will cause the ball to catch the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the slips.|$|E
25|$|Back at the Sawyer home, Verna {{stitches}} {{the remnants}} of the mentally-scarred Jedidiah Sawyer's face and applies a muzzle to hold them together. She then leads him into a room where his siblings are holding Elizabeth and Hartman captive. She gifts Jedidiah with his original chainsaw and Elizabeth watches on in horror as he bisects Hartman to death. As the family celebrates, Elizabeth flees into the woods while the Sawyers give chase. She nearly escapes, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a bear trap. Elizabeth attempts to appeal to Jedidiah's sympathy, while Verna encourages him to kill her to protect their family. Jedidiah begins to listen to Elizabeth's pleas that he is not a killer, unable to recall events prior to his injury, until she insults Verna. This causes him to decapitate her in retaliation.|$|E

25|$|Six months later, the {{commander}} returns from Guadeloupe {{with a new}} ward whom he intends for Frontignac. This new ward is Dora, the Creole whom René wanted to marry. So to avoid revealing the truth Antoinette and René pretend to be wed, while Frontignac pays court to the beautiful Creole. However, Frontignac allows himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> tête-à-tête with his wife, while René finally manages to convince Dora that {{she has not been}} deceived and he still loves her; she then swears her love for him. The commandant tries to join Frontignac and Dora but she refuses. Just then three canons sound, and a new order arrives for him to return to sea. He goes, taking all the young people with him, and all, including the notaries, set off.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{were set}} {{a target of}} 239 for victory, and {{although}} {{that would have made}} it the highest-scoring innings in the match, they had five sessions in which to do it. However, what followed was a master-class in bowling from Broad, who took seven wickets for 44 runs in just 11 overs – his best Test figures – as New Zealand were bowled out for 68, their sixth-lowest score in Tests against England. Only BJ Watling and Neil Wagner managed to make it into double figures, theirs being two of the three wickets that Broad did not manage to take. Watling was not helped by a knee injury he had picked up on day 3 that meant McCullum had to keep wicket {{for the rest of the}} innings, but he nevertheless came out to bat, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the slips off Anderson for 13. Wagner's wicket was the last to fall; it looked as though he would be caught after hitting the ball straight up in the air to long leg, but the fielder missed the catch. In the confusion that followed, the ball was thrown back to Anderson at the bowler's end with Wagner stranded mid-pitch in the middle of his second run. With that, the day's play concluded with 14 wickets in less than two sessions and England went 1–0 up in the two-match series.|$|E

500|$|In {{deploying}} his {{ships in}} this way, Brueys {{hoped that the}} British would be forced by the shoals to attack his strong centre and rear, allowing his van to use the prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack the British once they were engaged. However, {{he had made a}} serious misjudgement: he had left enough room between Guerrier and the shoals for an enemy ship to cut across the head of the French line and proceed between the shoals and the French ships, allowing the unsupported vanguard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a crossfire by two divisions of enemy ships. [...] Compounding this error, the French only prepared their ships for battle on their starboard (seaward) sides, from which they expected the attack would have to come; their landward port sides were unprepared.|$|E
500|$|At {{the peak}} of his career, Gilligan was a fast bowler. He bowled with his arm quite low, but was very accurate; his usual {{strategy}} was to aim at the stumps or to try to induce the batsmen to edge the ball <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the slips. According to his Wisden obituary, he [...] "regarded it as a cardinal sin to bowl short". Following his injury, he could not reach his former speed and was reduced to medium pace. In this style, he continued to have some success at county level. His batting was based mainly around driving the ball. He batted low in the order, and tried to score quickly, particularly against fast bowling. Several of his centuries were scored against the most successful teams, and often in difficult situations. He excelled as a fielder; his Wisden obituary stated: [...] "At mid-off he has had few rivals".|$|E
