40|$|The {{pharmacological}} properties of a phenothiazine derivative <b>thioproperazine</b> have been {{compared with those}} of chlorpromazine, and the modifications by some anti-Parkinsonian drugs of its actions on the central nervous system have been studied. <b>Thioproperazine</b> was less potent than chlorpromazine in lowering blood pressure and antagonizing adrenaline in the cat, in depressing respiratory rate in the rabbit, in producing hypothermia and analgesia and in reducing the minimum anaesthetic dose of hexobarbitone in mice, and in protecting rats from convulsions induced by tryptamine. It was roughly equipotent to chlorpromazine in reducing locomotor activity of mice. <b>Thioproperazine</b> was more potent than chlorpromazine in protecting grouped mice from the acute toxicity of dexamphetamine, in preventing the acute behavioural disturbances produced by dexamphetamine in the rat, in producing a state of experimental catatonia in the rat and in preventing the emetic action of apomorphine in the dog. Hyoscine, benztropine or promethazine greatly reduced the ability of <b>thioproperazine</b> to prevent behavioural changes due to dexamphetamine in the rat and also abolished symptoms of experimental catatonia produced by <b>thioproperazine.</b> In contrast, the antiapomorphine activity of <b>thioproperazine</b> in the dog was not reduced to any extent by hyoscine or benztropine...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{phenothiazine}} derivatives {{have been}} studied for anti-emetic potency in dogs against emesis induced by apomorphine. The PD 50 s of all the compounds were determined and the activities compared with chlorpromazine hydrochloride as standard. <b>Thioproperazine</b> methanesulphonate was 300 times more active than chlorpromazine hydrochloride and twice as active as perphenazine sodium citrate. The anti-emetic activity of the compounds has been correlated with their chemical structure...|$|E

A Bondclone C 18 contg. ODS column with mobile phase of methanol:water (60 : 40) and isothipendyl hydrochloride as internal std. were used. The flow rate was 1 ml/min and effluent was monitored at 276 and 265 nm for PPH and TPPM, resp. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{phenothiazine}} derivatives {{were tested}} for their detection by gas chromatography (GC) -surface ionization detection(SID). The sensitivity of GC-SID was highest with trimeprazine and levomepromazine and lowest with thiethylperazine and <b>thioproperazine</b> containing sulfur residues in their structurs. The detection limit of chlorpromazine was {{as low as}} 10 pg in an injected volume.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic {{method has}} been developed for the simultaneous analysis of the 12 phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, levomepromazine, perazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, profenamine, promethazine, propericiazine, <b>thioproperazine,</b> thioridazine and trifluoperazine) in human serum using HPLC/UV. The separation was achieved using a C 18 reversed-phase column (250 mm × 4. 6 mm I. D., particle size 5 μm, Inersil ODS-SP). The mobile phase, consisting of acetonitrile–methanol– 30 mM NaH 2 PO 4 (pH 5. 6) (300 : 200 : 500, v/v/v), was delivered at a flow rate of 0. 9 mL/min and UV detection was carried out at 250 nm. The recoveries of the 12 phenothiazines spiked into serum samples were 87. 6 – 99. 8 %. Regression equations for the 12 phenothiazines showed excellent linearity, with detection limits of 3. 2 – 5. 5 ng/mL for serum. The inter-day and intra-day coefficients of variation for serum samples were commonly below 8. 8 %. The selectivity, accuracy and precision of this method are satisfactory for clinical and forensic purposes. This sensitive and selective method offers the opportunity for simultaneous screening and quantification of almost all phenothiazines available in Japan {{for the purposes of}} clinical and forensic applications...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the outcome of}} 15 patients with chlorpromazine (CPZ) -induced abnormal skin pigmentation (ASP) in whom CPZ was replaced with other neuroleptics for three to 13 years. Complete resolution of ASP occurred {{over a period of}} six months to five years following substitution with haloperidol (four patients), levomepromazine (three patients), trifluoperazine (one patient), <b>thioproperazine</b> (one patient) as the sole neuroleptic, by a combination of two of the three phenothiazines (four patients) or haloperidol plus pipotiazine (one patient). Resolution was maintained during the remainder of the follow-up period. In one patient, at final follow-up, marked improvement was present three years after CPZ was replaced with levomepromazine. Bilateral lenticular pigmentary deposits persisted in all eight patients examined 3. 3 to 13 years after replacing CPZ and less than three months to nine years after resolution of ASP; improvement was noted in only one of these patients. Bilateral endothelial corneal deposits, present in five patients while on CPZ therapy, had disappeared in two patients seven and 13 years, respectively, after replacing CPZ; improvement was noted in two other patients. These findings indicate that: 1. CPZ-induced ASP is completely reversible in most, if not all, patients if CPZ is withdrawn; 2. a variety of neuroleptics including other phenothiazines can be used to replace CPZ without risk of re-emergence of ASP; 3. CPZ-induced lenticular changes persist whereas corneal changes may resolve slowly over a period of many years following replacement of CPZ; 4. ASP and ocular changes induced by CPZ may be subserved by two different pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|E
