5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} as oil mines but by then the emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed {{before the end of the}} war and in most instances even the slightest traces of their original locations have disappeared. A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained an oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Johnson had {{purchased}} the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore {{the car as}} a father-son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. Johnson utilized spare parts from many different sources to refurbish <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> hulk. He bought the mahogany dash from a parts dealer in Caracas, Venezuela and used Convair 440 aluminum sheets to replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended Florida State on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete.|$|E
50|$|A robot named Rodney Copperbottom {{decides to}} leave his home at Rivet Town and head to Robot City to realize his dream of working for his {{childhood}} hero, Bigweld. He makes a flying robot called Wonderbot out of scrap before he leaves. At the city, he goes to Bigweld's factory, but realizes that Bigweld is mysteriously absent, and finds out that the factory is currently being run by a robot {{by the name of}} Phineas T. Ratchet, who hatches an evil plan to create more futuristic robots like himself and destroying old robots made out of scrap. Rodney also meets a gang of colorful outmodes called <b>the</b> <b>Rusties,</b> who are also affected from the change Ratchet has made. A robot named Jack Hammer tells Rodney that there are many scrap parts in the sewers of Robot City and that Rodney can go collect the scrap in order to keep <b>the</b> <b>Rusties</b> alive. After doing so, Rodney and <b>the</b> <b>Rusties</b> go to Bigweld's Mansion to find Bigweld. Bigweld agrees to help Rodney and <b>the</b> <b>Rusties,</b> and sets off with Rodney to stop Ratchet and save all robot-kind.|$|R

5|$|Realizing he is {{powerless}} to defeat Julius, the Hero learns from Cibba about a powerful sword called Excalibur. Cibba helps him find the Excalibur {{only to find}} a rusty Sword instead. He explains that <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> sword is the Excalibur and would reveal its true strength to whoever it finds worthy. The Hero then raises Dime Tower to reach the Mana Sanctuary and meets a robot known as Marcie. After reaching the top, the tower begins to collapse and Marcie sacrifices himself by throwing the Hero across. After obtaining and passing the sword's trials, the Hero confronts and defeats Julius {{at the cost of}} the Mana Tree's life. The Heroine's mother reveals she is the current Mana Tree and before dying, asks the Heroine to succeed her position. The Heroine agrees and bids farewell to the Hero as she becomes the next Mana Tree and the Hero her guardian.|$|E
25|$|Two {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{but one of}} these, <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> numbat (M. f. rufus), {{has been}} extinct {{since at least the}} 1960s, and only the nominate subspecies (M. f. fasciatus) remains alive today. As its name implies, <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> numbat was said to have a more reddish coat than the surviving subspecies.

25|$|The {{maiden voyage}} of the Livadia {{revealed}} that her wide flat bottom was highly prone to damage by wave slamming. She spent her brief {{career as a}} yacht in the docks and was used for her intended purpose only once, carrying Grand Dukes Constantine and Mikhail across the Black Sea. Alexander III {{had no interest in}} resurrecting an inherently flawed ship, and in August 1881 Livadia was moored in Nikolaev and then hulked and stripped of her former luxuries. Her engines were removed and reused on the Russian cruisers. <b>The</b> <b>rusty</b> hulk saw some use during World War I and was finally decommissioned in 1926.|$|E
500|$|Ficus rubiginosa, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> fig or Port Jackson fig (damun in the Dharug language), is a species of flowering plant native to eastern Australia in the genus Ficus. Beginning as a seedling that grows on other plants (hemiepiphyte) or rocks (lithophyte), F.rubiginosa matures into a tree [...] high and nearly as wide with a yellow-brown buttressed trunk. The leaves are oval and glossy green and measure from [...] long and [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{felt that}} the visual style was {{similar to those of}} the {{previous}} Silent Hill installments. Enjoying the visuals, Jeff Haynes of IGN wrote: [...] "From the cluttered and junk strewn locations to <b>the</b> <b>rusty,</b> chaos filled doppelgangers of the alternate dimensions, everything feels like it's been stripped from one of the other titles and shrunk down to the handheld." [...] Reviewers praised the graphics, the monster designs, the detailed environments, and atmosphere. However, some reviewers wrote that the character models could have been more detailed.|$|E

500|$|Banksia oblongifolia can be {{distinguished}} from B.robur, which it often co-occurs with, by its smaller leaves and bare fruiting spikes. B.robur has more metallic green flower spikes, and often grows in wetter areas within the same region. B.plagiocarpa has longer leaves with more coarsely serrated margins, and its flower spikes are blue-grey in bud, and later bear wedge-shaped follicles. In the Sydney Basin, B.paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to B.oblongifolia, but its leaves are more prominently [...] (spoon-shaped) and tend to point up rather than down. The leaf undersides are white and lack the prominent midrib of B.oblongifolia, the new growth is bare and lacks <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> fur, and the aged flower parts remain on the old spikes.|$|E
500|$|In October 2006, volunteers led {{a two-day}} search {{within a few}} miles of where the car was found. In the closet of an A-frame house {{approximately}} [...] from the crash site, cadaver dogs allegedly went [...] "bonkers," [...] possibly identifying the presence of human remains. The house had formerly been the residence of the man implicated by his brother, who had given Fred Murray <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> knife in 2004. A sample of carpet from the home was sent to the New Hampshire State Police, but the results were never released to the public. [...] In July 2008, volunteers led another two-day search through wooded areas in Haverhill. The group consisted of dog teams and licensed private investigators.|$|E
500|$|Ficus rubiginosa was {{described}} by French botanist René Louiche Desfontaines in 1804, from a type specimen whose locality is documented simply as [...] "New Holland". In searching for the type specimen, Australian botanist Dale Dixon found one from the herbarium of Desfontaines at Florence Herbarium and one from the herbarium of Étienne Pierre Ventenat at Geneva. As Ventenat had used Desfontaines' name, Dixon selected the Florence specimen to be the type in 2001. The specific epithet rubiginosa related to <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> coloration of the undersides of the leaves. Indeed, rusty fig is an alternate common name; others include Illawarra fig and Port Jackson fig. It was known as damun (pron. [...] "tam-mun") to the Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin.|$|E
5000|$|In {{early to}} mid 2011 the band changed their name to [...] "The Tiny Giants" [...] on the {{suggestion}} of drummer George Wilson's brother, Fenn Wilson. The band began to play live shows under this name and released two EP's. Their self-titled debut EP came out in late 2012 and was self released. They only made a short run of 50 CD's and they sold out shortly after their 2nd release. The EP was recorded at 94.7 The Pulse and was produced by Beau Torrence of <b>The</b> <b>Rustys.</b> <b>The</b> EP was well received and was a big achievement for the band as they were only 13.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} the first time that the {{characters}} of Nina Sharp and David Robert Jones had common scenes within the show, but both Blair Brown and Jared Harris had previously acted together as mother and son in an off-Broadway production of the play Humble Boy. During the scene in which Nina was tortured to taunt Olivia into using her powers, Brown actually injured herself on <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> bedsprings used as the prop for the show. Brown referred to the alternative version of her character as [...] "Meana" [...] due to her seemingly [...] "mean" [...] personality, and speculated that Nina may have become this way because without William Bell, [...] "she wasn’t at the party with all of the boys, the science boys" [...] and thus developed an [...] "outsider" [...] perspective. She said of the role, [...] "It’s a really interesting thing to play. I love the fact that they look exactly the same, at least for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|The summits of {{the five}} volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as sacred mountains. Hawaiians {{associated}} elements of their natural environment with particular deities. In Hawaiian mythology, the sky father Wākea marries the earth mother Papa, giving birth to the Hawaiian Islands. Kīlauea itself means [...] "spewing" [...] or [...] "much spreading" [...] in Hawaiian, referencing its high state of activity, and in Hawaiian mythology Kīlauea is {{the body of the}} deity Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes. It is here that the conflict between Pele and the rain god Kamapuaa was centered; Halemaumau, [...] "House of the amaumau fern", derives its name from the struggle between the two gods. Kamapuaa, hard-pressed by Pele's ability to make lava spout from the ground at will, covered the feature, a favorite residence of the goddess, with fern fronds. Choked by trapped smoke, Pele emerged. Realizing that each could threaten the other with destruction, the others gods called a draw and divided the island between them, with Kamapuaa getting the moist windward northeastern side, and Pele directing the drier Kona (or leeward) side. <b>The</b> <b>rusty</b> singed appearance of the young fronds of the amaumau {{is said to be a}} product of the legendary struggle.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers also {{commented on}} the {{accompanying}} alternate reality game. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times, praised the album and game concept as [...] "a total marriage of the pop and gamer aesthetics that unlocks <b>the</b> <b>rusty</b> cages {{of the music industry}} and solves some key problems facing rock music as its cultural dominance dissolves into dust." [...] In relation to the declining music industry, Joseph Jaffe of Brandweek commented that such [...] "mysterious marketing measures [...] are what's desperately needed to gain attention in this uncertain era of distribution dilemmas and sagging sales", also commending acts such as Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead for being [...] "more innovative than marketers". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+, comparing it to The X-Files and calling it [...] "A sci-fi concept album whose end-of-days, paranoia-drenched story line has been disseminated via the Internet". It also stated: [...] "Amid its carefully calibrated sonic assaults, Year Zero has a number of tracks that will stop you in yours. Sometimes, it's a matter of dropping the volume [...] Even his use of electronics has shifted to a new level [...] Is the truth in here? Dunno, but Reznor's claim that 'I got my violence in high def ultra-realism' sounds like gospel to us." ...|$|E
