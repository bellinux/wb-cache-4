500|$|The word [...] "stearn" [...] {{was used}} for these birds in Old English {{as early as the}} eighth century, and appears in the poem The Seafarer, written in the ninth century or earlier. Variants such as [...] "tearn" [...] {{occurred}} by the eleventh century, although the older form lingered on in Norfolk dialect for several centuries. As now, the term {{was used for}} the inland black tern as well as the marine species. Some authorities consider [...] "tearn" [...] and similar forms to be variants of [...] "stearn", while others derive the English words from Scandinavian equivalents such as Danish and Norwegian <b>terne</b> or Swedish tärna, and ultimately from Old Norse þerna. Linnaeus adopted [...] "stearn" [...] or [...] "sterna" [...] (which the naturalist William Turner had used in 1544 as a Latinisation of an English word, presumably [...] "stern", for the black tern) or a North Germanic equivalent for his genus name Sterna.|$|E

2500|$|Kenworthy Hall {{is closely}} related to a series of Italian villa style residences that Upjohn {{designed}} in the Atlantic Northeast, most notably the Edward King House in Newport, Rhode Island. [...] But in this house Upjohn designed a residence adapted to a hot, humid climate and a plantation lifestyle. [...] The most obvious adaptations were the wide cross hall {{at the rear of the}} main entrance hall, the detached kitchen, and the full width rear porch. [...] Edward Carlisle's correspondence with Upjohn stressed that the house use the finest materials and the best construction. [...] The house is built in brick, including the interior walls. [...] The original standing-seam <b>terne</b> roof survives to the present. [...] Kenworthy Hall features a partial basement, three separate stairways, three large hallways, seven major rooms on the first floor, six major rooms on the second floor, a large attic, a third floor tower room, and a fourth floor tower room. [...] Ancillary structures that contribute to the National Historic Landmark status of the house include the detached two-room brick kitchen, a brick smokehouse, a partially buried brick water cistern, and a brick and wood well house. [...] The house also originally had its own gas plant for gas lighting, though this is now marked only by a brick and brownstone platform.|$|E
6000|$|The {{terrestrial}} Carnivora and Insectivora rarely exhibit sexual {{differences of}} any kind, and their colours {{are almost always}} exactly the same in both sexes. The ocelot (Felis pardalis), however, offers an exception, for the colours of the female, {{compared with those of}} the male, are “moins apparentes, le fauve étant plus <b>terne,</b> le blanc moins pur, les raies ayant moins de largeur et les taches moins de diamètre.”[353] The sexes of the allied Felis mitis also differ, but even in a less degree, the general hues of the female being rather paler than in the male, with the spots less black. The marine Carnivora or Seals, on the other hand, sometimes differ considerably in colour, and they present, as we have already seen, other remarkable sexual differences. Thus the male of the Otaria nigrescens of the southern hemisphere is of a rich brown shade above; whilst the female, who acquires her adult tints earlier in life than the male, is dark-grey above, the young of both sexes being of a very deep chocolate colour. The male of the northern Phoca groenlandica is tawny grey, with a curious saddle-shaped dark mark on the back; the female is much smaller, and has a very different appearance, being “dull white or yellowish straw-colour, with a tawny hue on the back;” the young at first are pure white, and can “hardly be distinguished among the icy hummocks and snow, their colour thus acting as a protection.”[354] ...|$|E

60|$|We have {{records of}} at least a dozen speeches, made B.C. 55 and B.C. 54, between that against Piso and the next that is extant, which was {{delivered}} in defence of Plancius. He defended Cispius, but Cispius was convicted. He defended Caninius Gallus, of whom we may presume that he was condemned and exiled, because Cicero found him at Athens on his way to Cilicia, Athens being the place to which exiled Roman oligarchs generally betook themselves.[35] In this letter to his young friend Cælius he speaks of the pleasure he had in meeting with Caninius at Athens; but in the letter to Marius which I have quoted he complains of the necessity which has befallen him of defending the man. The heat of the summer of this year he passed in the country, but on his return to the city in November he found Crassus defending his old enemy Gabinius. Gabinius had crept back from his province into the city, and had been received with universal scorn and a shower of accusations. Cicero at first neither accused nor defended him, but, having been called on as a witness, seems to have been unable to refrain from something of the severity with which he had treated Piso. There was at any rate a passage of arms in which Gabinius called him a banished criminal.[36] The Senate then rose as one body to do honor to their late exile. He was, however, afterward driven by the expostulations of Pompey to defend the man. At his first trial Gabinius was acquitted, but was convicted and banished when Cicero defended him. Cicero suffered very greatly in the constraint thus put upon him by Pompey, and refused Pompey till Cæsar's request was added. We can imagine that nothing was more bitter to him than the obligation thus forced upon him. We have nothing of the speech left, but can hardly believe that it was eloquent. From this, however, there rose a reconciliation between Crassus and Cicero, both Cæsar and Pompey having found it to their interest to interfere. As a result of this, early in the next year Cicero defended Crassus in the Senate, when an attempt was made to rob the late Consul of his coveted mission to Syria. Of what he did in this respect he boasts in a letter to Crassus,[37] which, regarded from our point of view, would no doubt be looked upon as base. He despised Crassus, and here takes credit for all the fine things he had said of him; but we have no right to think that Cicero could have been altogether unlike a Roman. He speaks also in the Senate on behalf of the people of Tenedos, who had brought their immunities and privileges into question by some supposed want of faith. All we know of this speech is that it was spoken in vain. He pleaded against an Asiatic king, Antiochus of Comagene, who was befriended by Pompey, but Cicero seems to have laughed him out of some of his petty possessions.[38] He spoke for the inhabitants of Reate on some question of water-privilege against the Interamnates. Interamna we now know as <b>Terne,</b> where a modern Pope made a lovely water-fall, {{and at the same time}} rectified the water-privileges of the surrounding district. Cicero went down to its pleasant Tempe, as he calls it, and stayed there awhile with one Axius.[39] He returned thence to Rome to undertake some case for Fonteius, and attended the games which Milo was giving, Milo having been elected Ædile. Here we have a morsel of dramatic criticism on Antiphon the actor and Arbuscula the actress, which reminds one of Pepys. Then he defended Messius, then Drusus, then Scaurus. He mentions all these cases in the same letter, but so slightly that we cannot trouble ourselves with their details. We only feel that he was kept as busy as a London barrister in full practice. He also defended Vatinius--that Vatinius with whose iniquities he had been so indignant at the trial of Sextius. He defended him twice at the instigation of Cæsar; and he does not seem to have suffered in doing so, as he had certainly done when called upon to stand up and plead for his late consular enemy, Gabinius. Valerius Maximus, a dull author, often quoted but seldom read, whose task it was to give instances of all the virtues and vices produced by mankind, refers to these pleadings for Gabinius and Vatinius as instances of an almost divine forgiveness of injury.[40] I think we must seek for the good, if good is to be discovered in the proceeding, in the presumed strength which might be added to the Republic by friendly relations between himself and Cæsar.|$|E
