5|$|Although French is an {{official}} language for <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act {{does not require}} it to be {{an official}} language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge is {{presently}} {{part of the}} burgh constituency of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Before the constituency's creation in 2005, Coatbridge lay in the Coatbridge and Chryston constituency. Hugh Gaffney of the Scottish Labour Party has been the MP since the 2017 snap election. For <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Parliament, Coatbridge forms part of the Coatbridge and Cryston constituency, which is represented by Fulton MacGregor of the Scottish National Party. Coatbridge is further represented by seven regional MSPs from the Central Scotland electoral region.

5|$|Historically Bournemouth {{was part}} of Hampshire, with {{neighbouring}} Poole, just {{to the west of}} the border, in Dorset. At the time of the 1974 local government re-organisation, it was considered desirable that the whole of the Poole/Bournemouth urban area should be part of the same county. Bournemouth therefore became part of the non-metropolitan county of Dorset on 1 April 1974. On 1 April 1997, Bournemouth became a unitary authority, independent from Dorset County Council. For <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lieutenancy it remains part of the ceremonial county of Dorset.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, the {{sectional}} {{differences that}} eventually {{culminated in the}} Civil War led to a convention {{to be held in}} Nashville, Tennessee, for the purpose of defining a common course of action for all Southern (slave-holding) states. Although Mallory had held no statewide offices, he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state Democratic Party to be chosen as an alternate delegate to the convention. Personal considerations kept him from attending, but he expressed his agreement with <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convention in a letter that was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers.|$|E

5|$|New {{claims on}} Antarctica have been {{suspended}} since 1959, although in 2015 Norway formally defined Queen Maud Land as including the unclaimed area {{between it and the}} South Pole. Antarctica's status is regulated by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty and other related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System. Antarctica is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60Â° S for <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the Soviet Union (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the United States. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica. This was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{appear in}} art, either to {{illustrate}} their botanical appearance, or for <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the Virgin Mary was compared by the Venerable Bede to a lily, the white petals denoting purity of body, while the yellow anthers signified the radiant {{light of the}} soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's Annunciation may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in still lifes.|$|E

The highway then progresses towards County Route617 (CR617; Ryders Lane), which heads southward from a roundabout with Route172. Route172 then turns to the west along George Street. After the roundabout, the highway intersects with Nichol Avenue and Route172 continues into downtown New Brunswick. There, the highway intersects with Bishop Street, and terminates at an intersection with Commercial Avenue and CR527 continues along George Street, the right-of-way.|$|E

5|$|TETCO was {{the brainchild}} of {{corporate}} lawyers Charles Francis and James Elkins, who convinced the construction specialists George and Herman Brown, and the fuel engineer E. Holley Poe, that buying the Big and Little Inch pipelines could be a lucrative opportunity. The corporation was established specifically for <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bid, and came to their bidding figure by estimating that the likely competition would bid at $130 million; their own figure exceeded this by 10 percent, and added on $127,000 to avoid a suspiciously round number. TETCO believed it could afford to make this offer because it intended to reuse the electric motors in the oil pumping mechanisms for moving the natural gas; it also believed that the price of gas would rise considerably in the post-war markets.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the temple was completed ten days ahead of schedule, allowing for more non-member guests to visit the temple before the dedication.

Before its formal dedication, over 50 percent of the Tongan population had toured the temple. The church's Nuku'alofa Tonga Temple was dedicated in 1983 by Gordon B.

As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not be dismissed as this was a procedural irregularity that could be cured by substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E
5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E
5|$|If morning {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a stimulation test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough for <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring {{the response of the}} adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E
