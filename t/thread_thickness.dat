Mode II {{delamination}} {{properties of}} Vectran stitched composites were investigated, and tabbed end notch flexural specimen testing {{was used to}} prevent premature failure. The effects of stitch density and stitch <b>thread</b> <b>thickness</b> were explored, and fibre compaction due to the stitching process was also verified. The results show that, in moderately stitched laminates (low stitch density), the improvement in GIIC was negligible. Crack bridging by the stitch threads at the crack zone were mostly compensated for the effect of fibre compaction, which reduced the GIIC values. Conversely, in densely stitched laminates (high stitch density), GIIC values were improved significantly (2 · 4 times {{higher than those of}} unstitched laminates). The effects of stitch <b>thread</b> <b>thickness</b> appeared to be negligible in moderately stitched laminates. For densely stitched laminates, thicker stitch thread (500 denier) possessed GIIC values that were 45 · 7 % higher than thinner stitch thread (200 denier) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringResearch and {{development}} of graphene and graphene based materials have been increasing significantly since they were invented. This report presents {{the development of a}} highly conductive graphene thin film (GTF) to reduce the damage of lightning effects on composite aircrafts. Furthermore, there are three new developments that are presented in this research: (a) the development of a highly conductive functionalized nanosize GTF, (b) a new approach of incorporating the GTF into the carbon fiber reinforced composite panel, and (c) a new development of 3 D stitching concept were introduced specifically using polyester threads instead of fiber yarns that can be useful for the applications of aircraft protections against the effects of lightning strike. In addition, graphene was chemically functionalized and oxidized to form GTF. The highest electrical conductivity measured on the GTF was approximately 1800 S/cm. Furthermore, the GTF was then incorporated into the carbon fiber reinforced composite. Delamination was observed between the GTF and the composite. To investigate this issue, the composite was mechanically tested and there was a 40 % decrease in tensile strength compared to the baseline. Therefore, 3 D stitching concept was then introduced to reduce the delamination. Four stitch configurations having different stitch length, thread to <b>thread</b> <b>thickness,</b> thread tension, and <b>thread</b> <b>thickness</b> respectively were used in this study. 3 D stitching was initially done on six sheets of unidirectional prepreg, MTM 45 - 1 without the incorporation of GTF. Furthermore, mechanical testing was carried out and the stitch configuration that delivered the most appropriate result was then further used on twelve sheets of unidirectional prepreg, 5320. Here, three samples which was the baseline, 5320 with and without the incorporation of GTF respectively were prepared and mechanically tested, and the strength values were observed...|$|E

30|$|Spiders {{which had}} already started to spin in {{daylight}} began with single, tightly stretched anchor <b>threads</b> (<b>thickness</b> up to 1.8 μm). These were set between crossing sticks or between a stick and the glass wall. The anchor threads were fixed by a small blob of ‘cement’ visible on the glass wall. The spiders continued to add bundles of smaller, parallel threads (0.5 – 1.0 μm thick) between these strong threads, or between the anchor threads and the sticks (Figure  1 E). In this way, a coarse scaffold for a horizontal sheet-web was formed within 2 – 4 hours. In most cases it was still permeable for small gas bubbles (1 – 2 mm in diameter) released below the web by a micropipette. However, during the first night, such web compartments were functionally completed far enough that no bubbles could pass (Figure  1 C).|$|R

40|$|By locally {{fixing the}} structure, the {{reproducibility}} of complex preforms can be greatly improved during pattern cutting, handling, batching, and assembly processes. In order {{to simplify the}} handling and draping of the textile structure, to keep the geometry deviations as marginal as possible and to secure {{the location of the}} fibers in the preform, a local fixation via binder or laser, aligned with the pattern cutting geometry, is proposed. Various textile stock with different patterns, <b>thread</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> densities and compositions (glass fibers (GF) and hybrid yarns (GF+PP)) were examined. A thermoplastic matrix was used to produce the laminates. In the production of lightweight structures using textile reinforcements, sometimes mechanical properties of the component can be adversely affected by undefined stacking of the reinforcement textiles when defining and configuring complexly curved free form surfaces. Pattern cuts are developed directly in the model geometry so the reinforcement structures can be correctly placed according to loads in the desired 3 D-components without requiring reworking. In this research project, 4 reference geometries were chosen and subsequently investigated theoretically (calculations) and practically (experiments). The pattern cut was derived from the 3 D geometry with inverse computational methods. A subsequent analysis of occurring deformation was conducted to distinguish areas with even slight fiber displacement or shifts in angle, which are candidates for local fixation. In order to evaluate the textile structures' shear behavior, picture frame tests were developed at the ITM [3]. Predictions of expected deformability (drapability) were derived from the calculated shear load-shear angle diagram. The increased local stiffness of the separate pattern cuts enables better and simpler handling and draping reproducibility. Necessary post-finishing processes to achieve good selvage quality are reduced to a minimum...|$|R

Here we report that overexpression of TAM by the ASK 1 :TAM transgene also led {{to the production of}} triads and dyads in meiosis, as well as shriveled seeds, in a dominant fashion. However, the partial loss-of-function mutant tam- 1, an ASK 1 :TAM line, and the wild type differed in dynamic changes in chromosome <b>thread</b> <b>thickness</b> from zygotene to diplotene. We also found that the pericentromeric heterochromatin regions in male meiocytes in tam- 1 and tam- 2 (a null allele) frequently formed a tight cluster at the pachytene and diplotene stages, in contrast to the infrequent occurrences of such clusters in the wild type and the ASK 1 :TAM line. Immunolocalization studies of the chromosome axial component ASY 1 revealed that ASY 1 was highly expressed at the appropriate male meiotic stages but not localized to the chromosomes in tam- 2. The level of ASY 1, however, was greatly reduced in another ASK 1 :TAM line with much overexpressed TAM. Our results indicate that the reduction and increase in the activity of TAM differentially affect chromosomal morphology and the action of ASY 1 in prophase I. Based on these results, we propose that either the different meiotic defects or a common defect such as missing ASY 1 on the chromosomal axes triggers a hitherto uncharacterized cell cycle checkpoint in the male meiocytes in the ta...|$|E

When using higher magnification, they appear as tiny, 50 Å thick fibrils irregularly twisted along the axis of the threads.

30|$|Jaouadi et al. (2006) {{reveals that}} {{parameters}} such as stitch density, fabric <b>thickness,</b> <b>thread</b> linear density and seam width are mainly {{being used to}} predict sewing thread consumption. In practice, garment manufacturers calculate thread requirement based on consumption estimate charts provided by specific thread suppliers (Carr & Latham 1994; Amann Group 2010; American & Efird Inc 2007). The charts calculate thread consumption using different variables and assumptions. They either estimate approximated thread consumption per garment or thread requirement per unit length of the stitch. Since these charts can be used under given specific scenarios; i.e. for given set of stitch densities or for a given thickness of fabric etc., it provides less flexibility in using for varying stitch densities and fabric thicknesses.|$|R

He did manage to gain the help of one weaver, who made two cotton strips that worked. However, the cotton wore out quickly, so de Mestral turned to {{synthetic}} fibers.

Next he found that nylon thread, when woven in loops and heat-treated, retains its shape and is resilient; however, the loops had to be cut in just the right spot so that they could be fastened and unfastened many times. On the verge of giving up, a new idea came to him. He bought a pair of shears and trimmed the tops off the loops, thus creating hooks that would match up perfectly with the loops in the pile.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{report has}} been prepared based upon an assignment {{given by the}} company, Ortopedic Care Scandinavia AB. The paper is an exam on basic level, 15 credit points at higher level education within product development. Ortopedic Care Scandinavia AB is working with product development of medical technology products. What makes the corporate unique {{is the fact that}} the development is based upon problems encountered by surgeons in their daily work. Suggestions for improvement in technology are given directly by the end users. This paper is based upon such problems. Product development was made on the medical instrument called, suture passer. The instrument is used in endoscopic surgery of the rotator cuff. The cuff is a group of four muscles (and their respective tendons) that stabilize the shoulder. In case of an accident, mostly sport related, these muscles can loosen from the bone. In surgery a suture passer is then used to penetrate the injured tendon with a needle with an attached suture. The passer creates a loop of suture that can be used to attach the damaged tendon. The report is based upon the following problem formulations: The needle has an inconvenient edge that can damage the muscle. The strength of the suture thread is deteriorated by the design of the needle. The suture thread has been known to snap when the surgeon apply to much pressure when tying. If the patient is suffering from subacromial impingement the jaw of the instrument can appear to be clumsy and hard to open. The jaw has sharp teeth which have been known to get stuck in the tendon. The surgeon must then perform an uncontrolled movement which might damage the tendon. The jaw limits the surgeons’ choice of thickness of the suture <b>thread.</b> The <b>thickness</b> of the needle used in the suture passer is limited to one size.   The purpose of the project is to develop a new concept that minimizes the risk for the patient and at the same time the concept should facilitate the work of the surgeon. The concept should meet the set requirements and be presented in the form of renderings of CAD-models and drawings. To achieve this process the instrument uses four different components. The needle, the jaw, the handle and an attachment between the needle and the handle.   Under heading 5, the generating process, each component presents to together with arguments of its design. The instrument consist of 25 components that are all developed from the ground up. The result should be viewed as a thorough concept that can be used for further development. It is recommended that the next step should be an investigation about material choice. When the material is specified a prototype should be manufacture and then used for testing. ...|$|R
