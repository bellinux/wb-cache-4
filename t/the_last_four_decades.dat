40|$|Abstract: Zayandeh-Rood {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} rivers flows in the central Part of Iran. The river source is located in Koohrang Mountains. The river passes through two Provinces; Chaharmohal-Bakhtiari and Isfahan. The river at the end discharges to the Gavkhooni Wetland. The river water is used for drinking, industrial and agricultural purposes. The determination of pollutants such as pesticides, heavy metals and other chemical parameters through out the river is important and has a great role in the control of the ecological condition of this water media. The anthropogenic impact on the environment in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>decade</b> has proven to be extremely negative due to the quick development of industry. An example is the Zayandeh Rood River in center of Iran, one of the most polluted sites in this region. Trace elements concentrations (Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) were measured seasonal in the Zayandeh Rood River waters during October 2004 to September 2005. In the present work, ICP-AES as a multi-elemental technique has been used for the determination of trace heavy metals. No Significant differences between the seven studied sites were observed for heavy metals and this result was attributed to the influence of the industrial activities in the region and/or the municipal runoff in this area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Zayanderood {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} river of Iran from west to east. The river source is located in Koohrang Mountains. The river passes through two provinces, Chaharmahal-Bakhtiary and esfahan. The river at the end discharges to the Govkhooni wetland. The river water is used for drinking, industrial and agricultural purposes. The determination of pollutants as heavy metals and other chemical parameters throughout the river is important and has a great role in the control of ecological condition of water media. The anthropogenic impact on the environment in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>decade</b> has proven to be extremely negative due to the quick development of industry. In the present work, ICP-MS as a multi-elemental technique has been used for the determination of heavy metals. the concentration of heavy metals in different stations of this river was different. The analysis shows the critical points of the river and also shown the points that continuous control should be done. In this paper, using multiple attribute decision making (MADM) is proposed. MADM problem is management science technique, which is popularly used to rank the priority of alternatives with respect to their competing attributes. Weights from the core of MADM: it is obvious that different weight lead to various evaluation results and decisions. The proposed model is applied for finding the best option from all the feasible alternatives. 1...|$|R

25|$|Before {{the late}} 20th century, {{suffrage}} — {{the right to}} vote — was so limited in most nations that turnout figures have little relevance to today. One exception was the United States, which had near universal white male suffrage by 1840. The U.S. saw a steady rise in voter turnout during the century, reaching its peak in the years after the Civil War. Turnout declined from the 1890s until the 1930s, then increased again until 1960 before beginning its current long decline. In Europe, voter turnouts steadily increased from the introduction of universal suffrage before peaking in the mid-to-late 1960s, with modest declines since then. These declines have been smaller than those in the United States, and in some European countries turnouts have remained stable and even slightly increased. Globally, voter turnout has decreased by about five percentage points over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the shift}} of {{agriculture}} from self-supporting production to highly intensified cropland systems {{there has been a}} total investment of the Vietnamese Government of ~125 trillion VND in irrigation infrastructure during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> The constructions built during that time include approximately 100 large to medium scale hydraulic works. Furthermore, there are more than 8000 other irrigation systems (e.g. reservoirs, weirs, irrigation and drainage gates and pumping stations). The main irrigation form used is paddy field irrigation. Whereas gravity irrigation is widely distributed in the Mekong region, in the Central North and coastal regions (3/5 of total irrigation schemes). Irrigation utilizing pumps (electric or with oil engines) is mainly located in the delta regions (~2/3 of total). The other irrigation forms are informal (non-governmental) systems like small private pumps or small gravity diversions. Other investments are made by foreign donors; both foreign and internal investments tend to concentrate on the upgrading and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage schemes.|$|E

Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government, republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic. Throughout the coup Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions put forward by politicians and military leaders for quelling the rebellion. The Emperor and his family were sent into exile in Portugal and France. Although there was significant monarchist reaction {{after the fall of the}} Empire, this was thoroughly suppressed, and neither Pedro II nor his daughter and heiress supported a forced restoration.|$|E
