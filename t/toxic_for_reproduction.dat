25|$|In 2008 the European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) {{reviewed}} {{the safety of}} DEHP in medical devices. The SCENIHR report states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes {{there is still a}} reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee said there are some alternative plasticizers available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticizers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices. Risk assessment results have shown positive results regarding the safe use of High Molecular Weight Phthalates. They have all been registered for REACH and do not require any classification for health and environmental effects, nor are they on the Candidate List for Authorisation. High phthalates are not CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or <b>toxic</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction),</b> neither are they considered endocrine disruptors.|$|E
2500|$|Borax {{was added}} to the Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) {{candidate}} list on 16 December 2010. The SVHC candidate list is part of the EU Regulations on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals 2006 (REACH), and the addition was based on the revised classification of borax as <b>toxic</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> category 1B under the CLP Regulations. Substances and mixtures imported into the EU which contain borax are now required to be labelled with the warnings [...] "May damage fertility" [...] and [...] "May damage the unborn child". [...] It was proposed for addition to REACH Annex XIV by the ECHA on 1 July 2015. [...] If this recommendation is approved, all imports and uses of borax in the EU will have to be authorized by the ECHA. Review of the boron toxicity (as boric acid and borates) published 2012 in Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health concluded: [...] "It clearly appears that human B [...] exposures, even in the highest exposed cohorts, are too low to reach the blood (and target tissue) concentrations that would be required to exert adverse effects on reproductive functions." ...|$|E
50|$|One {{well known}} group of {{substances}} which are <b>toxic</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> are teratogens - substances which cause birth defects - of which (S)-thalidomide is {{possibly the most}} notorious. Another group of substances which has received much attention (and some controversy) as possibly <b>toxic</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> are the so-called endocrine disruptors. However, many substances which are <b>toxic</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> do not fall into either of these groups: lead compounds, for example, {{are considered to be}} <b>toxic</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> given their adverse effects on the normal intellectual and psychomotor development of human babies and children.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFor many years, medical {{aptitude}} in occupational health, a French exception, did {{not raise}} any particular issue. However, from the 1980 's onwards, this concept has been approached from a more critical point of view, authors questioning its compatibility with personal liberty. The increase in precarious working conditions have but reinforced such criticism, raising {{the question of the}} confrontation of such a concept with due respect of the right to work and the right for health protection. Special decrees, in particular the CMR decree (relating to carcinogenic, mutagenic and <b>toxic</b> substances <b>for</b> <b>reproduction),</b> issued in 2001, have added further force to the debate, particularly with regard to the problematic compatibility between the notice of aptitude and the respect of medical ethics and deontology.
