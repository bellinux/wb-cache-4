25|$|Unfortunately for the French Masséna {{failed to}} <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> chance. Crucially, {{in the two}} days bought by Ney, Masséna had not {{attempted}} a coup de main against Coimbra, even though Trant's rather weak garrison had orders to retire immediately if strongly pressed. At the end of 12 March the French were still {{to the south of}} the river, and in danger of being trapped by Wellington. The only alternative route open to Masséna was to retreat east towards the Spanish border, and the only road available led east from Condeixa. With the British close to that village, on the morning of 13 March Masséna began the long costly retreat back into Spain which marked the complete failure of his great invasion of Portugal.|$|E
25|$|Soon thereafter, Li Ji's {{grandson}} Li Jingye, the Duke of Ying, who {{had been}} disaffected by his own exile, started a rebellion at Yang Prefecture (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). The rebellion initially drew much popular support in the region, however, Li Jingye progressed slowly in his attack and did not <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> popular support. Meanwhile, Pei suggested to Empress Dowager Wu that she return imperial authority to the Emperor and argued that doing so would cause the rebellion to collapse on its own. This offended her, and she {{accused him of being}} complicit with Li Jingye and had him executed; she also demoted, exiled, and killed a number of officials who, when Pei was arrested, tried to speak on his behalf. She sent a general, Li Xiaoyi (李孝逸), to attack Li Jingye, and while Li Xiaoyi was initially unsuccessful, he pushed on at the urging of his assistant Wei Yuanzhong and eventually was able to crush Li Jingye's forces. Li Jingye fled and was killed in flight.|$|E

[...] Metroid Prime Hunters includes several references to previous games in the Metroid Prime series. Samus' ship is from the original Metroid Prime, and her suit is the same one that appears in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. The developers decided to add them because they wanted to show that the technology has evolved, and they also wanted to include something that was instantly recognizable to those who had played previous games in the series. On level design, Abe said that as the game's controls shifted from an analog stick method to touchscreen aiming, the developers wanted to avoid making the gameplay and the control scheme more difficult.|$|E

Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live." [...] Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, [...] "I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Because of You", was originally intended for Thankful. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. [...] "Gone", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, [...] "Addicted", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003). She remarked, [...] "I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And then I heard that Evanescence record... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.|$|E
