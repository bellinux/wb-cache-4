The experimental mate-rial comprised the lumbar and thoracic parts of the longissimus dorsi (musculus longissimus lumborum et musculus longissimus thoracis) muscle of pigs. The aim of the performed experiments was to analyse the impact of different composition of brines which contained a specific quantity of salts of inorganic acids on the value of active acidity, water activity, water holding capacity and the way of water binding. It was found that both parts of raw longissimus dorsi muscle differed with regard to the pH value, water activity and molecular dynamics of bound water. The water holding capacity as well as the mutual relationships between the quantities of free and bound waters were identical. The type of the applied brine exerted some influence on the level of water holding capacity. The relative amount of free water in relation to bound water analysed on the basis of relaxation measurements was the highest when the mixture of sodium chloride and sodium triphosphate was applied.

40|$|During {{the last}} few decades governments all around the world have {{increased}} concerns about water shortages and pollution. Consequently, they issued a multitude of environmental legislations and regulations, land and water-use planning measures, and other environmentally related procedures. The objective of this work was to contribute in developing efficient adsorbent for heavy metal ions from wastewater. Two different kinds of adsorbents were studied: MCM- 41 (Mobil Catalytic Material number 41) mesoporous silica whose pores have been expanded by a post-synthesis hydrothermal treatment in the presence of N,N-dimethyldecylamine (DMDA), and 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (AMP) grafted MCM- 41 after being pore expanded and calcined. The pore-expanded MCM- 41, (PE) MCM- 41, (i. e., containing DMDA) has been tested as adsorbent for Cu 2 + cations. Regeneration ability and factors affecting the stability of this material such as pH and stirring time have been investigated. The results showed that (PE) MCM- 41 is fast, sensitive, and high capacity adsorbent. However, it is not an appropriate material for environmental applications due to its poor stability in aqueous solutions. Further studies using calcined and pore-expanded MCM- 41, (CPE) MCM- 41, silica as support for grafting AMP have been carried out. A systematic investigation of the amine loading {{as a function of the}} relative amount of AMP and water used during the grafting procedure was carried out. The surface characteristics, AMP loading, Cu 2 + adsorption capacity, CO 2 adsorption capacity, and rate of CO 2 adsorption were determined for all materials. Surface area, pore size and pore volume decreased significantly from 950 m 2 /g, 11. 3 nm and 2. 16 mL/g for unmodified (CPE) MCM- 41 to 783 m 2 /g, 7. 4 nm and 1. 54 mL/g for the materials grafted under dry conditions in the presence of 1. 0 mL AMP/g silica, and to 730 m 2 /g, 6. 34 nm and 0. 77 mL/g for the materials grafted under wet conditions in the presence of 2. 0 mL AMP/g silica and 0. 4 mL water/g silica. The maximum amine loading, CO 2 adsorption capacity and Cu 2 + adsorption capacity suggested that the optimum grafting conditions are 2 mL AMP/g silica and 0. 4 mL of water/g silica, and that any excess of water or amine added to the grafting mixture has negative effect on the adsorption performance of the material. Two approaches have been investigated to recycle the copper loaded adsorbent: treatment with acidic solution and treatment with complexing agent, ethylenediamine-tetra acetic acid <b>tetra</b> <b>sodium</b> salt (EDTA). The results showed a significant drop in the adsorption capacity after the first regeneration cycle. With further testing of the material, it was concluded that the (CPE) MCM- 41 is not stable when being in contact with water and thus, even the material was still loaded with amine, structural changes of the material caused the amine to become inaccessible for Cu 2 + or CO 2 molecules. So, further work is still required to improve the stability of this material in water or to use more robust material...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of sol-gel silica materials doped {{with three different}} types of metallophthalocyanines has been studied. Homogeneous materials of good optical quality were prepared and the first optical limiting measurements of dyes in sol-gel hosts were carried out. The properties of these solid state limiters are similar to limiters based on phthalocyanine (Pc) in solution. Sol-gel silica materials containing copper, tin and germanium phthalocyanines were investigated. The initial step in all cases was to prepare silica sols by the sonogel method using tetramethoxy silane (TMOS), HCl and distilled water. Thereafter, the synthesis depended upon the specific Pc and its solubility characteristics. Copper phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid <b>tetra</b> <b>sodium</b> salt (CuPc 4 S) is soluble in water and various doping levels (1 x 10 (exp - 4) M to 1 x 10 (exp - 5) M) {{were added to the}} sol. The group IV Pc's, SnPc(OSi(n-hexyl) 3) 2 and GePc(OSi(n-hexyl) 3) 2, are insoluble in water and the process was changed accordingly. In these cases, the compounds were dissolved in THF and then added to the sol. The Pc concentration in the sol was 2 x 10 (exp - 5) M. The samples were then aged and dried in the standard method of making xerogel monoliths. Comparative nanosecond optical limiting experiments were performed on silica xerogels that were doped with the different metallophthalocyanines. The ratio of the net excited state absorption cross section (sigma(sub e)) to the ground state cross section (sigma(sub g)) is an important figure of merit that is used to characterize these materials. By this standard the SnPc sample exhibits the best limiting for the Pc doped sol-gel materials. Its cross section ratio of 19 compares favorably with the value of 22 that was measured in toluene. The GePc materials appear to not be as useful as those containing SnPc. The GePc doped solids exhibit a higher onset energy (2. 5 mj and lower cross section ratio, 7. The CuPc 4 S sol-gel material has a still lower cross section ratio, 4, however, the tetrasulfonate groups make the dye soluble in water which greatly facilitates its incorporation into the sol-gel matrix. The nonlinear transmission of CuPc 4 S in a pH 2 buffer solution and in a silica xerogel were compared. It is evident that the CuPc 4 S preserves its optical limiting behavior in the sol-gel matrix, indicating that the fundamental excited state absorption process is essentially the same for a molecule in solution or in the solid state. Although the spectroscopic details of energy level lifetimes are unknown, the significance is that passive optical limiting has been achieved in the solid state via incorporation of a dye into an inorganic host. The only compromise occurs at the extremely high energy regime where photobleaching is observed. This {{is a result of the}} limited mobility of the dye molecules in the solid silica host relative to a liquid host. The effects of photodegradation in the xerogel are additive, whereas the solution provides a supply of fresh molecules that are free to enter the active volume between pulses...|$|R

In these crude enzyme fractions, high concentrations of trehalose-P inhibited the ADP-Glc and GDP-Glc pyrophosphorylases but did not effect the UDP-Glc or TDP-Glc pyrophosphorylases. Both the ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase and the UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase were partially purified (about 140 -fold and 60 -fold, respectively), and their properties were compared. For the ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, the Km for adenosine triphosphate was 6 × 10 − 4 m, whereas that for glucose- 1 -P was 8 × 10 − 4 m. The optimal concentration of Mg 2 + was 1 × 10 − 3 m, and the pH optimum was 8. 5. For the UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, the Km for uridine triphosphate was 1 × 10 − 3 m and for glucose- 1 -P was 2 × 10 − 3 m. The optimal Mg 2 + concentration was 1 × 10 − 3 m, and the pH optimum was about 8. 0. The purified ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase was inhibited by fructose- 6 -P, fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate, glucose- 6 -P, and phosphoenolpyruvate. On the other hand, trehalose, trehalose <b>diphosphate,</b> <b>sodium</b> pyruvate, and ribose- 5 -P did not effect the ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase. None of these compounds, including trehalose-P, had any effect on the UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase...|$|R
40|$|An In Tank Processing (ITP) {{technology}} was {{developed at the}} Savannah River Site to remove Cs- 137 from high-level waste supernates. During the ITP process monosodium titanate and sodium tetraphenylborate (NaTPB) {{were added to the}} salt supernate to adsorb Sr- 90 /Pu- 238 and precipitate Cs- 137 as CsTPB, respectively. This process was demonstrated at the SRS in 1983. The demonstration produced 53, 000 gallons of 2. 5 weight per cent Cs rich precipitate containing TPB, which was later washed and diluted to 250, 000 gallons. This material is currently stored in SRS tanks. The washed precipitate was to ultimately be disposed in borosilicate glass in the Defense Waste Processing Facility. Due to safety concerns the ITP process was abandoned in 1998, and new technologies are being researched for Cs- 137 removal. In order to make space in the SRS Tank farm, the tank waste must be removed. Therefore, the tank waste must be processed to reduce or eliminate levels of nitrates, nitrites, and <b>sodium</b> <b>tetra</b> phenylborate (NaTPB) in order to reduce impacts of these species before it is vitrified at the DWPF. Fluidized Bed Steam Reforming (FBSR) is being considered as a candidate technology for destroying the nitrates and the NaTPB prior to melting. The purposes of the current study, organic destruction and downstream processing of T 48 H waste slurry were fulfilled. TPB was destroyed in all 19 samples tested with the simulated FBSR process at operational temperatures 650 - 725 degrees Celsius...|$|R
