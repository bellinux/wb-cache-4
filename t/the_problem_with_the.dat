Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E
5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> book's central {{approach}} is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined {{by the introduction of}} biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E

5|$|As Eliot was {{finishing}} his second poem, World War II began to disrupt {{his life and}} he spent more time lecturing across Great Britain and helping out during the war when he could. It was during this time that Eliot began working on The Dry Salvages, the third poem, which was put together {{near the end of}} 1940. This poem was published in February 1941 and Eliot immediately began to plot out his fourth poem, Little Gidding. Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green to recuperate. His illness and the war disrupted his ability to write and he became dissatisfied with each draft. He believed that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> poem was with himself and that he had started the poem too soon and written it too quickly. By September 1941, he stopped writing and focused on his lecturing. It was not until September 1942 that Eliot finished the last poem and it was finally published.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV {{and the other with}} an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> i-MiEV battery pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E
5|$|Lacking the {{available}} naval forces {{to launch a}} sizeable campaign in the Gulf, the British authorities attempted to use diplomacy to end the threat. In February 1806, the young Sultan of Oman, Sa'id II ibn Sultan, signed a treaty at Bandar Abbas promising {{to bring an end}} to attacks originating from his territory, but by 1807 the French had installed consulates in Tehran and Muscat and attacks continued unabated with their encouragement. In 1807, Lord Minto, Governor General of India, determined to send ambassadors to the Sikh Empire, Afghanistan and Persia in an effort to secure their support and prevent the French from gaining allies on India's western borders. As part of this diplomatic campaign, the ambassador to Persia was instructed to discuss <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Persian government, but due to French influence in Tehran, he was unable to obtain any guarantees.|$|E

5|$|Researchers in {{the field}} {{advocate}} a teaching style that incorporates group problem-solving activities and demands higher-level thought. According to this process, a teacher initially poses a single question {{in a number of}} ways. Next, students discuss <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> teacher and amongst themselves, asking questions. In forming these questions, students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their peers, to generate a solution. Other curriculum designs tailored to young children such as “” incorporate practices which aim to improve students’ capacity to shift and prolong attention as well as think “outside the box” (i.e. generate creative solutions).|$|E
5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{animation}} {{from the}} producers' point-of-view {{was that it}} did not exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At the time {{there were only a few}} choices for animation style. Usually, they would either follow the style of Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example with the early animation being cartoonish was that the doors behaved liked rubber when slammed. The style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either.|$|E

25|$|The running key {{variant of}} the Vigenère cipher was also {{considered}} unbreakable at one time. This version uses as the key a block of text {{as long as the}} plaintext.

In 1920, Friedman was the first to discover this variant's weaknesses. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> running key Vigenère cipher is that the cryptanalyst has statistical information about the key (assuming that the block of text is in a known language) and that information will be reflected in the ciphertext.|$|E

25|$|On 22 January 1913 the new Dock was {{declared}} open by the Countess of Dalkeith; it had cost £750,000, {{and it was}} actually opened to shipping on 24 March 1913. Even then there was continual difficulty with {{the operation of the}} dock gates, probably due to mining subsidence under their supports. Attempts to rectify this problem dragged on, and the onset of World War I in 1914 overtook events, as the export coal trade collapsed during hostilities. In 1915 it was stated to be necessary to close the dock temporarily to rectify <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> gates, but the NBR directed instead that the closure should be semi-permanent, as the available business could now easily be handled at the nos 1 and 2 docks. This closure took place on 18 March 1915; the whole construction had been abortive.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of July 15, 1995, VRS {{personnel}} from the Zvornik Brigade, including drivers and trucks from the 6th Infantry Battalion of the Zvornik Brigade, transported the surviving members of the group of approximately 1,000 prisoners from the school in Petkovci to an area below the Dam near Petkovci. They were assembled below the Dam and summarily executed by VRS or MUP soldiers with automatic weapons. VRS personnel from the Engineering Company of the Zvornik Brigade used excavators and other heavy equipment to bury the victims while the executions continued. Later that day, at Zvornik Brigade headquarters, Obrenović spoke with Chief of Operations Dragan Jokić briefly at 11:00 and discussed <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> burials of those executed and the guarding of prisoners still to be executed, as well as orders to not make records of any sort regarding the executions and burials.|$|E
25|$|However, whilst the {{rationale}} behind the equation is sound, {{it is unlikely that}} the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> formula is that it is not usable to generate or support hypotheses because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, R*, number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, fp, stars with planets and fe, planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or pseudoscientific arguments. Another associated topic is the Fermi paradox, which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the universe, then there should be obvious signs of it.|$|E
