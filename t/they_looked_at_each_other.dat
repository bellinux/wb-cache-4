"I {{wrote the}} initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and I stopped and said, 'I really wanna {{do this with}} Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm {{a big fan of}} theirs and I just thought that the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, so I put it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because I want it to be our song if we ever do it together. [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E

6000|$|This {{cleared the}} air while <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other; yet {{she had already}} asked: [...] "What {{in the world can}} you do, and how in the world can you do it?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> gleefully. Again {{they had}} found a new contact.|$|E

50|$|Fireworks are set alight as midnight approaches; {{the group}} watches, and Eve and Alice {{return to the}} cabin. Alex and Alice go to their bedroom, where <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other and touch, {{resigned}} to their loving relationship.|$|R
50|$|In a post-credit scene, {{we see a}} hungover and half-naked Shelby waking up. Then, a hungover and half-naked Quentin {{wakes up}} (implying that they had sex). <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other and scream in disgust as they fall out of bed.|$|R

6000|$|It was in {{the mirror}} that <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other--in the strange, candle-lighted {{duplication}} of the scene that their eyes met.

5000|$|When {{reciprocal}} socialization {{has been}} investigated in infancy, mutual gaze or eye contact {{has been found to}} play an important role in early social interaction. [...] "In one investigation, the mother and infant engaged in a variety of behaviors while <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other; by contrast, when <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> away from each other, the rate of such behaviors dropped considerably".|$|R
