5|$|In {{a popular}} oleograph {{representation}} of Khandoba, Mhalsa is seated {{in front of}} Khandoba on his white horse. Mhalsa is piercing a demon's chest with a spear, while a dog is biting his thigh and the horse is hitting his head. The other demon is grabbing the reins of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> attacking the demon with his sword. In other representations, Khandoba is seen seated on a horse with the heads of demons trod under the horse's hooves or their heads under Khandoba's knees.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the third}} legend, a white horse of the Prince of Lhasa had wandered into Monpa region.

Eventually, to honour the sacred site, the Tawang Monastery was built at the site.|$|E
5|$|Another tale {{from the}} Devi Bhagavata Purana has a passing {{reference}} to Revanta. Once when Revanta – {{riding on the}} seven headed horse Uchaishravas – went to Vishnu's abode, Vishnu's wife goddess Lakshmi was mesmerized with <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> ignored a question asked by the Lord. Thus, she was cursed by her husband to become a mare.|$|E
5|$|Rarely, Banai {{also appears}} in Khandoba's chief legend where he slays the demons Mani and Malla. Mhalsa and Banai (or Ganga) futilely help Khandoba {{in the battle}} to collect the blood of Mani, every drop of which was {{creating}} a new demon.

5|$|The Pipil used wooden weapons {{with stone}} blades. Their weapons {{included}} long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades {{similar to the}} Aztec macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> firearms. The Spanish described how the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, that extended down {{to their feet and}} significantly encumbered them.|$|E
5|$|The horse {{adapted to}} survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, {{surviving}} in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14families, but only three—Equidae (<b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E

Bodemeister {{finished}} a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from colitis and laminitis. Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E

During the retreat, a soldier named William Kennan found Madison sitting on a log. Kennan was being pursued by Indians and admonished Madison to run, but Madison, who was already known to be of frail constitution, stood to reveal {{that he had been}} badly wounded and was bleeding profusely. Kennan quickly retrieved an abandoned horse he had seen; he helped Madison astride <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> they both escaped.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Bryennios's victory seemed certain, for {{his wings}} began to envelop Alexios's Franks in the centre. Realizing his {{position}} and despairing {{in the face of}} defeat (and, as Bryennios the Younger records, because he had disobeyed imperial orders to wait for more Turkish reinforcements and feared punishment from Botaneiates), Alexios at first resolved to attempt an all-or-nothing attack on Bryennios himself to decapitate the enemy army, but was dissuaded by his servant. With only six of his men around him, he then managed to break through the surrounding enemy soldiers. Confusion reigned behind their lines {{as a result of the}} Pecheneg attack on the rebel camp, and in this tumult Alexios saw Bryennios's imperial parade horse, with his two swords of state, being driven away to safety. Alexios and his men charged the escort, seized <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> rode away with it from the battlefield.|$|E

The kungas of Nagar were in great demand in the Eblaite empire; they cost two kilos of silver, fifty times {{the price of a}} donkey, and were imported regularly by the monarchs of Ebla to be used as transport animals and gifts for allied cities. The horse was known in the region during the third millennium BC, but was not used as a draught animal before c. 18th century BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} of bovids {{has contributed}} in shifting {{the dependence of}} human beings from hunting and gathering to agriculture.

The other two species are <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> pig. Other large bovids that have been domesticated but which remain within the ranges of their wild ancestors are the water buffalo (from the Indian water buffalo), domestic yak (from the wild yak), zebu (from the Indian aurochs), gayal (from the gaur) and Bali cattle (from the banteng).|$|E

5|$|Three legends are narrated to the {{establishment}} of the monastery. In the first legend it is said that location of the present Monastery was selected by a horse which belonged to Merag Lama Lodre Gyatso who was on a mission assigned to him by the 5th Dalai Lama to establish a Monastery. After an intense search, when he failed to locate a suitable place, he retired into a cave to offer prayers seeking divine intervention to choose the site. When {{he came out of the}} cave, he found his horse missing. He then went in search of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> finally found it grazing at the top of a mountain called Tana Mandekhang, which in the past was the palace of King Kala Wangpo. He took this as a divine and auspicious guidance and decided to establish the monastery at that location. Seeking the help of the local people, Mera Lama established the monastery at that location in the latter part of 1681.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} two {{beautiful}} women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider stood near the wheel. Uttanka praised {{the functioning of the}} weaving process, the rider and <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> equated the rider to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} Roman Empire, the {{principal}} military developments were attempts {{to create an}} effective cavalry force {{as well as the}} continued development of highly specialised types of troops. The creation of heavily armoured cataphract-type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies. During the early invasion period, the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because {{it was not possible to}} put the full force of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> rider behind blows struck by the rider. The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour.|$|E
