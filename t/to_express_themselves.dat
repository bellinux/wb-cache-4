5|$|Comedy Central {{has decided}} not to air these two episodes of South Park. It is a {{decision}} we've made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned numberone priority, and therefore we have decided to take these precautionary measures.|$|E
5|$|Medium Alison calls home {{to demand}} a fuller {{response}} from her parents and is astonished when her mother tells her that her father has had sexual relationships with men and boys. Alison explores the tensions her family was under at this time and watches a heated argument between her parents. Medium Alison returns home for vacation with Joan in tow. Helen confesses to Medium Alison her devastation at spending her life in an unfulfilling marriage with Bruce ("Days and Days"). Medium Alison, Joan and Bruce have an unexpectedly pleasant evening around the piano. Bruce asks Alison if she'd like {{to go for a}} drive, and (adult) Alison realizes that Medium Alison is gone; she joins her father in the car, breaking the boundaries of time. On the drive, she and Bruce struggle <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> to each other ("Telephone Wire").|$|E
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves,</b> such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E
5000|$|All {{students}} have the right <b>to</b> freely <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> and {{this should not be}} limited to academic matters.|$|R
50|$|Anonymity {{has also}} {{permitted}} highly trained professionals such as judges <b>to</b> freely <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> regarding the strategies they employ {{to perform their}} jobs objectively.|$|R
25|$|Employees resort <b>to</b> <b>expressing</b> dissent <b>to</b> {{either their}} {{coworkers}} or other ineffectual audiences within the organization. Employees employ this route when they desire {{to voice their}} opinions but lack sufficient avenues <b>to</b> effectively <b>express</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{the night}} of May19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which {{involved}} military and civilian leaders. They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan José de Lezica, the senior alcalde (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator Julián de Leiva, to ask for their support. They asked the Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said {{that if it was}} not freely granted the people and the criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign by any means necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into speeding up the legal system to allow the people <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves,</b> or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that way, it would constitute a rebellion, which would turn the revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Home is a {{community-based}} social gaming networking {{service for}} the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Network (PSN). It is available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar. Membership is free, and only requires a PSN account. Home has been in development since early 2005 and started an open public beta test on December 11, 2008. Home allows users to create a custom avatar, which {{can be made to}} suit the user's preference. Users can decorate their avatar's personal apartment ("HomeSpace") with default, bought, or won items. They can travel throughout the Home world (except cross region), which is constantly updated by Sony and partners. Each part of the world is known as a space. Public spaces can just be for display, fun, or for meeting people. Home features many mini-games which can be single player or multiplayer. Users can shop for new items <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> more through their avatars or HomeSpace. Home features video screens in many places for advertising, but the main video content is shown at the theatre for entertainment. Home plays host to a variety of special events which range from prize-giving events to entertaining events. Users can also use Home to connect with friends and customize content. Xi, a once notable feature of Home, is the world's first console based Alternate Reality Game that took place in secret areas in Home and was created by nDreams.|$|E
25|$|The rise of {{new media}} has {{increased}} communication between {{people all over}} the world and the Internet. It has allowed people <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> through blogs, websites, videos, pictures, and other user-generated media.|$|E
25|$|Various {{competitions}} {{were held}} at school-level to encourage students <b>to</b> think and <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> on courtesy.|$|R
50|$|By photographing {{a person}} in their natural surroundings, {{it is thought that}} {{you will be able to}} better {{illuminate}} their character, and therefore portray the essence of their personality, rather than merely a likeness of their physical features. It is also thought that by photographing {{a person in}} their natural surroundings, the subject will be more at ease, and so be more conducive <b>to</b> <b>expressing</b> <b>themselves,</b> as opposed <b>to</b> in a studio, which can be a rather intimidating and artificial experience.|$|R
50|$|Gillespie {{is known}} for his disfavour of German police and {{bureaucracy}} limiting independent artists' liberties <b>to</b> perform and <b>express</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
25|$|Participants at the Burning Man {{event in}} the Black Rock Desert are {{encouraged}} <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> {{in a number of}} ways through various art forms and projects. The event is clothing-optional and public nudity is common, though not practiced by the majority.|$|E
25|$|Benin: from 2 to 9 May, the NGO Plan Bénin {{organized}} in Cotonou a workshop on comic strips {{for children and}} teenagers of Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Togo. These children can use comic strips <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> about their rights and about their vision of development.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} years, Ivașcu profited from {{liberalization}} and, {{as editor of}} Contemporanul, Lumea, and România Literară, allowed nonconformist talents <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> with confidence, while he himself oscillated between national communism and Western Marxism. His tolerance of dissent irritated the regime, and Ivașcu was pushed back into accepting and even promoting communist censorship during the final two decades of his life.|$|E
5000|$|Being shy {{decreases}} self-disclosure. Among men, {{those who}} are or appear more [...] "tough" [...] are less likely <b>to</b> disclose and <b>express</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R

25|$|It {{also has}} a very active {{expressive}} art room, the Margaret Stewart Lindsay Art Center, where poor and homeless artists create and are given a chance <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves,</b> {{and many of the}} works are displayed and sold. Saori style Japanese weaving is especially therapeutic and useful for many of the artists. Every year, guest artwork is featured in the Art from the Heart Calendar.|$|E
25|$|Joaquin Phoenix as the Abbé du Coulmier, the well-loved {{administrator}} at Charenton asylum. A profoundly religious man, {{he treats}} his wards with kindness and allows them <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> artistically. He {{is in love}} with Maddy, though he does not admit it to her or himself. Before settling on Joaquin Phoenix, casting directors considered Jude Law, Guy Pearce, and Billy Crudup for the role.|$|E
25|$|Many {{children}} of alcoholics score lower on tests measuring cognitive and verbal skills than non-COAs. Lacking requisite skills <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> can impact academic performance, relationships, and job interviews. The lack of these skills do not, however, imply that COAs are intellectually impaired. COAs are also {{shown to have}} difficulty with abstraction and conceptual reasoning, both of which {{play an important role}} in problem-solving academically and otherwise.|$|E
50|$|Blogs are {{increasingly}} {{being used as a}} medium of communication in Uganda. Affordable data rates, increasing internet penetration and free blogging platforms such as Wordpress and blogger are making internet users turn to blogging platforms <b>to</b> creatively <b>express</b> <b>themselves,</b> comment on current affairs, inform the public among other reasons.|$|R
50|$|CAID is {{far more}} {{conceptual}} and less technically focused than CAD. CAID programs tend to offer more tools that allow a designer <b>to</b> freely <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> with more organic shapes and complex curves, whilst CAD software {{tends to be more}} focused on tools for the simple curves and straight lines more suitable for easy manufacturing.|$|R
50|$|Diodorus {{made use}} of the Sorites paradox, and {{is said to have}} invented two others of the same kind, viz. The Masked Man and The Horns, which are, however, also {{ascribed}} to Eubulides. He also rejected the view that words are ambiguous, any uncertainty in understanding was always due <b>to</b> speakers <b>expressing</b> <b>themselves</b> obscurely.|$|R
25|$|During the 19th century, {{women in}} Puerto Rico began <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> through their {{literary}} work. Among them was María Bibiana Benítez, Puerto Rico's first poet and playwright. In 1832, she published her first poem La Ninfa de Puerto Rico (The Nymph of Puerto Rico). Her niece, Alejandrina Benitez de Gautier, whose own Aguinaldo Puertorriqueño (Ode to Puerto Rico) {{was published in}} 1843, has been {{recognized as one of}} the island's great poets.|$|E
25|$|Environments may {{impact on}} the ability of genes <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> and may do this via sex differences. For {{instance}} genes affecting voting behavior would have no effect in females if females are excluded from the vote. More generally, the logic of sex-difference testing can extend to any defined sub-group of individuals. In cases such as these, the correlation for same and opposite sex DZ twins will differ, betraying the effect of the sex difference.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{concept to}} spoken and written Klingon is canonicity. Only words and grammatical forms introduced by Marc Okrand are considered canonical Klingon by the KLI and most Klingonists. However, as {{the growing number}} of speakers employ different strategies <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves,</b> it is often unclear as to what level of neologism is permissible. New vocabulary has been collected in a list maintained by the KLI until 2005 and has since then been followed up by Klingon expert Lieven Litaer.|$|E
50|$|The Lianozovo Group {{was formed}} around the artist Oscar Rabin in the 1960s and {{included}} {{artists such as}} Valentina Kropivnitskaya, Vladimir Nemukhin, and Lydia Masterkova. While not adhering to any common style, these artists sought <b>to</b> faithfully <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> in the mode they deemed appropriate, rather than adhere to the propagandistic style of Socialist Realism.|$|R
50|$|The Military Wives Choir {{formed by}} Gareth Malone at the Royal Marines Base Chivenor, {{as part of}} the fourth series of the BBC/Twenty Twenty {{television}} series The Choir, entitled The Choir: Military Wives. The aim of the choir was to help the wives and girlfriends of servicemen currently deployed <b>to</b> Afghanistan <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> through song.|$|R
50|$|Free Speech Week is an {{opportunity}} for individuals and organizations to undertake independent projects and activities related to free speech. The celebration is designed to raise awareness of free speech issues and encourage a broad audience <b>to</b> openly <b>express</b> <b>themselves.</b> Free Speech Week involves the participation of many partnering organizations, creating a multi-faceted celebration of free speech.|$|R
25|$|The Ragged Hills {{that lie}} between Back Basin and One Hundred Springs Plain are {{thermally}} altered glacial kames. As glaciers receded the underlying thermal features began <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> once again, melting {{remnants of the}} ice and causing masses of debris to be dumped. These debris piles were then altered by steam and hot water flowing through them. Madison lies within the eroded stream channels cut through lava flows formed after the caldera eruption. The Gibbon Falls lies on the caldera boundary as does Virginia Cascades.|$|E
25|$|Commenting on {{the role}} women played in social active issues: Although over sixty {{years have passed since}} the Movement emerged into existence, no women leaders have {{appeared}} that can confront secular and Marxist trends single-handedly and efficiently. This has come about as a result of men's unrelenting attempts to control women's movement, as men have never allowed women a real chance <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> and show special leadership talents and abilities that demonstrate their capability of taking command of their work without men's dominance.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, {{writing is}} a {{critical}} part of learning in English Language Arts and all content areas, and the ability to write effectively is a requirement for success at all levels of education, from elementary school through high school and in university and adult education classes. Studies of dialogue journal writing have shown that students (and the teachers, classroom helpers, or prospective teachers they are writing with) increase their sense of engagement with each other, learn <b>to</b> <b>express</b> <b>themselves</b> for an audience, and experience an atmosphere of openness and expression. Students also develop writing fluency over time.|$|E
