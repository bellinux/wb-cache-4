5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> spring, {{when the}} water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E

5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy in <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length.

5|$|Although {{the battle}} was a British victory, there was {{criticism}} of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that {{a unique opportunity to}} destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The invasion at Quiberon ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline {{for the remainder of the}} year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.|$|E
