50|$|The mobile {{membranes}} and <b>the</b> mobile <b>ambients</b> 11 {{have similar}} structures and common concepts.

A comparing between these new models (mobile ambients and mobile membranes) is provided, and an encoding <b>the</b> <b>ambients</b> into membranes. This embedding is essentially presented in 5.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ambient {{calculus}} is {{a theory}} which deals with mobile computing and computation and encompasses such notions as mobile agents, <b>the</b> <b>ambients</b> where <b>the</b> agents interact and the mobility of <b>the</b> <b>ambients</b> themselves. P systems is a formalism which abstracts from the structure and functioning of living cells and describes distributed parallel computing devices with multiset of objects processing. Ambient calculus and membrane computing {{are based on the}} same concepts and structures though they are developed in different areas of computer science. The purpose of our work now is to express ambient calculus by means of P systems, namely by tissue P systems with dynamic network of membranes. ...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{distinct}} areas {{of work in}} mobility: mobile computing, concerning computation that is carried out in mobile devices (laptops, personal digital assistants, etc.), and mobile computation, concerning mobile code that moves between devices (applets, agents, etc.). We aim to describe all these aspects of mobility within a single framework that encompasses mobile agents, <b>the</b> <b>ambients</b> where agents interact and the mobility of <b>the</b> <b>ambients</b> themselves. This extended abstract of a longer paper [2] presents a minimal calculus of ambients that includes only mobility primitives. Section 1 gives its syntax and introduces its semantics informally. Section 2 gives a formal semantics. Section 3 concludes...|$|R

5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions {{regarding the}} individual and <b>the</b> <b>ambient</b> environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation.

At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E

It marked a departure from <b>the</b> <b>ambient</b> sound of their debut album, Felt Mountain (2000), incorporating glam rock and synthpop music; inspirations were Spanish disco group Baccara and Swedish techno artist Håkan Lidbo. The album was met with positive reviews, with many critics complimenting its blend of retro and modern electropop music.|$|E

Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E

5|$|Dwarf lemurs are {{the only}} {{primates}} known to hibernate for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (May through September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. Unlike any other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with <b>the</b> <b>ambient</b> temperature rather than remaining low and stable.|$|E
5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. <b>The</b> <b>ambient</b> sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E

He proposes a best fit double compartment model for dissolved gas and a single compartment model for undissolved gas as these are the simplest models consistent with available data.|$|E

Keywords: Agents, process calculi, mobility, wide-area computation. 1 Introduction There are two distinct areas of work in mobility: mobile computing, concerning computation that is carried out in mobile devices (laptops, personal digital assistants, etc.), and mobile computation, concerning mobile code that moves between devices (applets, agents, etc.). We aim to describe all these aspects of mobility within a single framework that encompasses mobile agents, <b>the</b> <b>ambients</b> where agents interact and the mobility of <b>the</b> <b>ambients</b> themselves. <b>The</b> inspiration for this work comes from the potential for mobile computation over the World-Wide Web.

Because of recent advances in networking and language technology, the basic tenets of mob [...] ...|$|R
5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. <b>The</b> <b>ambient</b> pressure diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high {{ambient pressure}}. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Canadian Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine {{developed}} the Kidd/Stubbs serial decompression model.

A serial model assumes that the diffusion takes place {{through a series of}} compartments, and only one is exposed to <b>the</b> <b>ambient</b> partial pressures and is in effect a compartmentalised version of the Hempelman bulk diffusion slab model.|$|E
