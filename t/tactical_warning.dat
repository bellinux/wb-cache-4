40|$|With a Free Flight policy, the {{emphasis}} for {{air traffic control}} is shifting from active control to passive air traffic management with a policy of intervention by exception. Aircraft {{will be allowed to}} fly user preferred routes, as long as safety Alert Zones are not violated. If there is a potential conflict, two (or more) aircraft must be able to arrive at a solution for conflict resolution without controller intervention. Thus, decision aid tools are needed in Free Flight to detect and resolve conflicts, and several problems must be solved to develop such tools. In this report, we analyze and solve problems of proximity management, conflict detection, and conflict resolution under a Free Flight policy. For proximity management, we establish a system based on Delaunay Triangulations of aircraft at constant flight levels. Such a system provides a means for analyzing the neighbor relationships between aircraft and the nearby free space around air traffic which can be utilized later in conflict resolution. For conflict detection, we perform both 2 -dimensional and 3 -dimensional analyses based on the penetration of the Protected Airspace Zone. Both deterministic and non-deterministic analyses are performed. We investigate several types of conflict <b>warnings</b> including <b>tactical</b> <b>warnings</b> prior to penetrating the Protected Airspace Zone, methods based on the reachability overlap of both aircraft, and conflict probability maps to establish strategic Alert Zones around aircraft...|$|R

50|$|The Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye is an American all-weather, carrier-capable <b>tactical</b> {{airborne}} early <b>warning</b> (AEW) aircraft. This twin-turboprop {{aircraft was}} designed and developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s by the Grumman Aircraft Company for the United States Navy {{as a replacement for}} the earlier, piston-engined E-1 Tracer, which was rapidly becoming obsolete. The aircraft's performance has been upgraded with the E-2B, and E-2C versions, where most of the changes were made to the radar and radio communications due to advances in electronic integrated circuits and other electronics. The fourth major version of the Hawkeye is the E-2D, which first flew in 2007. The E-2 was the first aircraft designed specifically for its role, as opposed to a modification of an existing airframe, such as the Boeing E-3 Sentry. Variants of the Hawkeye have been in continuous production since 1960, giving it the longest production run of any carrier-based aircraft.|$|R
30|$|Underwater {{acoustic}} sensor networks (UWSNs) enable {{a wide range}} of application, including environment monitoring, <b>tactical</b> surveillance, disaster <b>warning,</b> and many more. UWSNs employ acoustic communications [1 – 5]. Compared with radio transmissions in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the challenges of acoustic transmissions include (1) long propagation delay: The propagation speed for an acoustic link is 1500  m/s, 2 [*]×[*] 105 times lower than the speed of a radio link. This means the propagation delay is 2 [*]×[*] 105 times longer for an acoustic link. (2) Expensive transmitting power consumption: Power consumption for transmitting and receiving is similar in radio links. However, in acoustic links, the transmit power dominates and is typically 100 times more than the receive power. For example, in the WHOI Micro-Modem [6], the transmit power is 10  W which is 125 times of the receive power (80  mW). (3) Lower available bandwidth: Influenced by harsh environment such as transmission loss, noise, and high propagation delay, the available bandwidth is limited and depends on both range and frequency.|$|R

50|$|The {{unit was}} {{originally}} the acquisition radar {{portion of the}} United States' only operational anti-ballistic missile system, known as SAFEGUARD. Due to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT II), components of the SAFEGUARD complex, {{with the exception of}} the PARCS radar at Cavalier Air Force Station, were deactivated in February 1976. The forerunner of the present day 10th SWS began passing <b>tactical</b> <b>warning</b> and attack assessment data to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colo., in January 1977. In December 1979 the unit was transferred from Aerospace Defense Command to Strategic Air Command. The unit, as it exists today, joined Air Force Space Command in 1983 as Detachment 5, 1st Space Wing. On 10 July 1986, the unit was redesignated as the 10th Missile Warning Squadron, and was activated on 1 August 1986.

5000|$|Traditional Soviet {{doctrine}} {{called for}} a first strike {{in order to make}} a nuclear war technically winnable. [...] The Soviets kept most of their missiles in silos located throughout the country, whereas the United States had the majority of their warheads deployed on submarines. This fact contributed to the Soviet Union's increasing paranoia towards the United States, and more specifically, any exercises or war games the United States might participate in. Through this mindset came the philosophy of a Launched On <b>Tactical</b> <b>Warning</b> (LOTW) strike by the Soviets. This was essentially an automatic launch system that would deploy the Soviet Unions warheads at any sign of incoming United States missiles via radar or satellite detection. [...] Because of Project VYAN, any misreading of western intentions could have disatrous consequences. [...] The perception in the Soviet Union at the time was that the United States would stop at nothing to destroy them, including nuclear annihilation. KGB officers who were familiar with the west had no real sway in convincing others that there would never be a nuclear strike.|$|E
50|$|Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station is {{supported}} {{and operated by}} the 21st Space Wing, which is headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base and {{under the command of}} 14th Air Force and Air Force Space Command. In addition to supporting Peterson Air Force Base, the wing conducts operation space missions such as operating missile warning radar and cataloging objects in space for the U.S. Strategic Command. Those operational missions are managed by the 21st Operations Group. The 21st Space Wing operates radar systems in the United States and worldwide, monitoring for launches of ballistic missiles and new space systems up to 22,300 mi above the earth. As of 2014, there are at least 20 countries able to launch long-range weapons, including chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis {{will address the}} relative ability of the command and control systems of the United States and Soviet Union to support a protracted nuclear war. It will address the organizations {{as well as the}} various systems used to support the respective National Command Authorities. This includes the threat warning and attack assessment equipment used to determine strategic and <b>tactical</b> <b>warning,</b> the communications equipment used to alert forces of increased readiness and the contribution of these systems in the conduct of nuclear strikes, if required. It also includes a review of the technical factors associated with the performance of C 3 in a nuclear environment. The result is a net assessment of the two command and control systems that highlights the strengths and weaknesses inherent in each. Specific recommendations, such as better aircraft support schemes and more robust command and control systems, are developed to help enhance the United States' position regarding this vital national security issue.
