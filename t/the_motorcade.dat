5|$|Morrow ordered <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> to {{turn around}} at the Bridge Street {{intersection}} because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning <b>the</b> <b>motorcade,</b> Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning, on 28 June 1914, Ilić positioned the six assassins along <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> route. Ilić {{walked the}} street, exhorting the assassins to bravery.|$|E

25|$|Outside the airport, a few taxis {{attempted}} to blockade the highway, preventing Lien {{from reaching the}} airport, but they were repelled by <b>the</b> <b>motorcade's</b> police escort. Taiwan independence advocate Shi Ming and pan-Green supporters lit firecrackers {{in front of the}} terminal, but were not arrested.|$|R

5|$|On 6 September 2007, eight {{members of}} the team (including five runners dressed as bodyguards) and three hired chauffeurs manned a fake Canadian {{motorcade}} consisting of two motorcycles, two black four-wheel drive vehicles, and a black sedan. The group—including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden, and Julian Morrow—drove <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone. The premise of the stunt was that bin Laden should have been invited to the summit as a world leader, to discuss the War on Terror, with another motive being to test the event's security. The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry.|$|E
5|$|The {{state funeral}} {{marked the first}} time that Washington had hosted a major event since the September 11 attacks. As a result, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) {{designated}} the state funeral a National Special Security Event (NSSE). Special precautions were taken because many of the events were open to the public and there were multiple protectees. As means of assisting <b>the</b> <b>motorcade,</b> many streets were temporarily blocked off by law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E

The royal fleet also {{includes}} Range Rover models (when he goes to mountainous places only), Mercedes-Benz S500 and various Lexus models.

An ambulance is always present in <b>the</b> royal <b>motorcade,</b> which is usually escorted by police motorcycles.|$|R
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Altgens was {{scheduled}} {{to work in the}} AP offices in Dallas as the wirephoto editor. He asked instead to go to the railroad overpass (the bridge under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets converge at the west end of Dealey Plaza) to photograph <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> that was to take President Kennedy from Love Field to his scheduled appearance at the Dallas Trade Mart. Altgens was not assigned to work in the field that day, so he took his personal single-lens reflex camera rather than the motor-driven equipment normally used for news events.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>motorcade</b> {{passed the}} first assassin, Mehmedbašić. Danilo Ilić had {{placed him in}} front of the garden of the Mostar Cafe and armed him with a bomb. Mehmedbašić failed to act. Ilić had placed Vaso Čubrilović next to Mehmedbašić, arming him with a pistol and a bomb. He too failed to act. Further along the route, Ilić had placed Nedeljko Čabrinović on the {{opposite}} side of the street near the Miljacka River, arming him with a bomb.|$|E
5|$|Viktor Ilyin, a disenfranchised Soviet soldier, {{attempted}} to assassinate Brezhnev on 22 January 1969 by firing shots at a motorcade carrying Brezhnev through Moscow. Though Brezhnev was unhurt, the shots killed a driver and lightly injured several celebrated cosmonauts of the Soviet space programme {{who were also}} travelling in <b>the</b> <b>motorcade.</b> Brezhnev's attacker was captured, and interrogated personally by Andropov, then KGB chairman and future Soviet leader. Ilyin was not given the death penalty because his desire to kill Brezhnev was considered so absurd that {{he was sent to}} the Kazan mental asylum instead for treatment.|$|E

50|$|The Department of Public Works and Highways {{utilized}} {{at least}} 23,000 concrete barriers {{along the route}} the pope took around Metro Manila to restrain the crowd from blocking <b>the</b> pope's <b>motorcade.</b> Each barrier measures about 1.25 meters high, some being borrowed from the North and South Luzon Expressways. During John Paul II's visit devotees had rushed into the streets slowing down or stopping <b>the</b> pope's <b>motorcade,</b> which <b>the</b> concrete barriers were meant to forestall.|$|R
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|In the present, {{during the}} re-dedication ceremony, Mulder realizes {{that no one}} can see Teager if they are in his line of sight. Teager follows Skinner and Bloch to <b>the</b> <b>motorcade,</b> where he unsuccessfully shoots at the general and Skinner suffers a flesh wound. Teager is shot in turn by the agents as he tries to escape. As he succumbs to his wounds, Teager repeats his Army identification. Afterwards, the Pentagon states that the assassin was a {{different}} person—which Mulder denounces as a lie. He leaves Skinner to silently ponder his own service in the Vietnam War as he looks upon Teager's name on the memorial wall.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, <b>the</b> <b>motorcade,</b> are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Reagan was {{in great}} pain from the bullet that struck his rib, and he {{believed}} that the rib had cracked when Parr pushed him into the limousine. When the agent checked him for gunshot wounds, however, Reagan coughed up bright, frothy blood. Although the president believed that he had cut his lip, Parr believed that the cracked rib had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> to divert to nearby George Washington University Hospital, which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use. The limousine arrived there less than four minutes after leaving the hotel, while other agents took Hinckley to a DC jail, and Nancy Reagan ("Rainbow") left the White House for the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie got back into <b>the</b> <b>motorcade,</b> {{once again in the}} third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E
25|$|No {{radio or}} {{television}} stations broadcast the assassination live because the area through which <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> was traveling {{was not considered}} important enough for a live broadcast. Most media crews were not even with <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> but were waiting instead at the Dallas Trade Mart in anticipation of President Kennedy's arrival. Those {{members of the media}} who were with <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> were riding {{at the rear of the}} procession.|$|E
50|$|Kellerman's {{report and}} later {{testimony}} {{indicate that he}} was with the president without interruption from <b>the</b> <b>motorcade's</b> departure from Love Field, through the entire autopsy and embalming and up until the president's remains were brought back to the White House. In photographs and footage of the casket being loaded aboard Air Force One at Love Field, and later upon its arrival at Andrews Air Force Base, Kellerman can be seen directing the movements of the president's casket.|$|R
50|$|That night, Choi {{was taking}} a bus home when the {{president}} came to stalk on her. The bus driver stopped when two of <b>the</b> <b>motorcades</b> rode in front of him, forcing him to stop his bus. The bus driver was shocked {{when he saw the}} president boarding the bus. The passengers on the bus were treated to ride on the president's limousines to their designated destinations while Choi and the president would sit on the bus.|$|R

25|$|Rizzo's {{funeral was}} {{purported to be}} the largest in the history of Philadelphia, with people lining the streets of <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> from the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul to the cemetery.

25|$|In 1996, bin Laden {{personally}} engineered a plot {{to assassinate}} Clinton while the president was in Manila for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. However, intelligence agents intercepted a message just minutes before <b>the</b> <b>motorcade</b> was to leave, and alerted the U.S. Secret Service. Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge.|$|E
