[...] The No-Vita moniker is a play on the Vita console name and the Japanese word nobita, meaning [...] "to lengthen or extend". While the core mechanics are similar to other games in the series, <b>Touch</b> <b>My</b> Katamari allows the player to use the rear touch pad on the Vita to temporarily stretch the katamari into an ovoid shape, allowing it to roll through narrow spaces or collect small objects.|$|E

500|$|Overall, Katamari Damacy {{was well}} {{received}} in Japan and North America. The game was dubbed a sleeper hit and won several awards. Katamari Damacy inspired {{the development of}} other video games, {{and led to the}} release of eight sequels in Japan and other territories: We Love Katamari (PlayStation 2), Me & My Katamari (PlayStation Portable), Beautiful Katamari (Xbox 360), i Love Katamari (iOS, Windows Phone 7, Android), [...] Katamari Forever (PlayStation 3), Katamari Amore (iOS), <b>Touch</b> <b>My</b> Katamari (PlayStation Vita), and Tap My Katamari (iOS, Android).|$|E

500|$|<b>Touch</b> <b>My</b> Katamari, {{known in}} Japan as , is {{a video game}} {{produced}} by Namco Bandai Games for the PlayStation Vita in 2011. As has become commonplace for the series, its music was composed by {{a large number of}} composers: a large team headed by Taku Inoue included series veteran Yuu Miyake, Ken Inaoka, BAKUBAKU DOKIN, Akitaka Tohyama, Hiroyuki Kawada, Yoshihito Yano, Yuichi Nakamura, Hiroshi Okubo, and Trine. The music includes both original pieces as well as many remixes of pieces from prior games, such as a new version of [...] "Lonely Rolling Star". Inoue was charged by Miyake with making the music of the game [...] "newer and fresher", as Miyake was tired of the series repeating the same concepts, and Inoue attempted to impart his own style into the original pieces and to use new styles of arrangements.|$|E

500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke {{felt that}} Ellen brought a [...] "maternal energy" [...] to the series, and {{described}} the character as [...] "a lioness, which is tough and badass and 'You <b>touch</b> <b>my</b> children, I will kill you.'" [...] Likewise, actress Samantha Ferris described her as a [...] "gun-toting, beer-slinging, bar-owning broad" [...] with a [...] "very maternal core". Ferris also feels that, despite Ellen having gone through a lot in her life, she is cautious rather than jaded, and is [...] "very protective {{of the things she}} has in her life", especially her daughter Jo and the Winchesters. Thus, her main concern is Jo's safety, which prompts her to forbid her daughter from going on hunts. When she realizes that she can no longer stop Jo from doing what she wants, Ellen becomes her hunting partner, deciding it {{is the best way to}} look after her. By the time of Ellen's final appearance, actress Alona Tal came to view their characters more as equals rather than mother and daughter.|$|E
500|$|The South African League, a new uitlander movement, {{prepared}} two petitions, {{each with}} more than 20,000 signatures, that appealed to Queen Victoria for intervention against the Transvaal government, which they called inefficient, corrupt and oppressive. Other uitlanders produced a counter-petition in which about as many affirmed their satisfaction with Kruger's government. Attempting to address the main point of contention raised by Milner and Chamberlain, Kruger spoke of reducing the residency qualification for foreigners to nine years or perhaps less. In May and June 1899 he and Milner met in Bloemfontein, with Steyn taking {{on the role of}} mediator. [...] "You must make concessions on the franchise issue", Steyn counselled. [...] "Franchise after a residence of 14 years is in conflict with the first principles of a republican and democratic government. The Free State expects you to concede... Should you not give in on this issue, you will lose all sympathy and all your friends." [...] Kruger answered that he had already indicated his willingness to lower the franchise and was [...] "prepared to do anything"—"but they must not <b>touch</b> <b>my</b> independence", he said. [...] "They must be reasonable in their demands." ...|$|E

The film, entitled , was directed by Bruce Hendricks and produced by Art Repola. The film compiled some of the show's performances, along with backstage footage.

500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to <b>touch</b> <b>my</b> face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Madonna has been {{involved}} in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, who worked on Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), said that [...] "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it." [...] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: [...] "I don't know where [...] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'." [...] Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including [...] "Lucky Star" [...] which she composed on synthesizer. Rolling Stone has named her [...] "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." [...] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing [...] "incredible" [...] hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and its line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; <b>Touch</b> <b>my</b> body, and move in time, now I know you're mine." [...] Though Madonna has worked with producers across many genres, her songs have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Some of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which led to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the [...] "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time".|$|E
