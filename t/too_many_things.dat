25|$|Mike Bracken of IGN {{criticized the}} film, saying that EM Embalmings {{greatest}} failure {{is that it}} often tries to be <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> at once and the film itself is almost as schizophrenic as its antagonist. However, he felt that several sequences of the embalming process are gruesome and extended conversations between Miyako and the black market organ harvester are eerily intriguing.|$|E

[...] Manning said he prays every night and before games and added, [...] "I hope (and pray) I don't do <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> that displease Him before I get to Heaven myself. I believe, too, that life is much better and freer when you're committed to God in that way." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 5, Sergeant Lee again {{went out}} {{in an attempt to}} attach the charge to a frigate {{anchored}} off Manhattan. [...] He reported the ship's watch spotted him, so he abandoned the attempt. The submarine was sunk some days later by the British aboard its tender vessel near Fort Lee, New Jersey. [...] Bushnell reported salvaging Turtle, but its final fate is unknown. [...] Washington called the attempt [...] "an effort of genius", but [...] "a combination of <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> was requisite" [...] for such an attempt to succeed.|$|E

500|$|Before release, Mad Max {{received}} positive reviews. Game Revolution called its gameplay [...] "exhilarating, fast, violent, and fun" [...] {{and said}} it would be the title that fans of the series would want to play. Hardcore Gamer thought the game could be [...] "the biggest surprise of 2015" [...] and praised its vehicle customization, which it compared to the ship customization of [...] According to IGN, Mad Max was 2015's [...] PC Gamer expressed concern that the game [...] "is trying to be <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> at once" [...] and some critics compared it negatively to the critically acclaimed film [...]|$|E
500|$|In a {{comprehensive}} assessment, The Observer rationalised the spectacle: [...] "They {{did what they}} always do: <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> at the same time. Their points are lost along with the plot. So, just to explain: ... Bill and Jimmy were dressed as old men as a comment on elderly pop groups making a comeback. The brass band playing house music tunes was organised by Jeremy Deller as a comment on class culture (working-class band playing working-class music). The dockers were asked along because their cause is important." [...] The Guardian called the performance [...] "a glorious, jaw-dropping mess", and The Times ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Turtles failure, Washington called Bushnell “a Man {{of great}} Mechanical Powers, fertile of {{invention}} {{and a master}} in execution.” In retrospect, Washington observed {{in a letter to}} Thomas Jefferson, “ came to me in 1776 recommended by Governor Trumbull (now dead) and other respectable characters…Although I wanted faith myself, I furnished him with money, and other aids to carry it into execution. He laboured for some time ineffectually, and though the advocates for his scheme continued sanguine he never did succeed. One accident or another was always intervening. I then thought, and still think, that it was an effort of genius; but that a combination of <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> were requisite…” ...|$|E

500|$|Timberlake {{revealed}} in 2013 that he originally asked rapper JAY-Z (Whom he would collaborate with extensively {{in his later}} career) {{to appear on the}} track before T.I. [...] "I wanted to do a record with him on FutureSex/LoveSounds..." [...] he explained [...] "...and he at that time had done a record with Beyoncé, it was 'Déjà Vu.' And he said—respectfully, I can't knock him for saying like I have this one feature, I think he was working on his own music as well so he didn't want to be on <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things.</b> And I said, 'I totally respect that. I'm obviously not gonna get into any domestic anything. That's your wife.' But the record was 'My Love.'

500|$|Reviewing the Telugu dubbed version, Sathyame Sivam, Jeevi of Idlebrain.com {{said that}} [...] "this art-kind-of film does {{entertain}} {{the people who}} love Kamal Hassan flicks" [...] while concluding that it [...] "would remain {{as one of the}} good films made in the recent times". Another critic from The Hindu, Gudipoodi Srihari, appreciated the pair of Kamal and Madhavan, noting that the duo [...] "make a fine combination of pals each with different mental make up, but goodness overflowing." [...] A reviewer from Sify, in comparison, labelled the film as [...] "average", stating that it was [...] "another predictable and corny film which is neither a comedy caper nor a class act." [...] Similarly, Arkay of Rediff.com praised the performances of the lead cast but wrote the film [...] "tries to do <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things,</b> and ends up failing at most, if not all, of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Broady panned the {{navigation}} for being confusing, counter-intuitive, and requiring the player to revisit locations multiple times. He concluded his review by saying, [...] "The net effect {{is that the}} story—which made this game so intriguing in the first place—is almost totally lost, {{and that is a}} shame." [...] GameSpot considered the game one of the most disappointing of 1996 in their annual recap, writing [...] "the great premise is buried like the mysteries of the ages themselves under a mediocre Myst clone". Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly opined that the game tried to be <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things,</b> and quipped, [...] "the result is a game so obscure, you'd be better off perusing something more comprehensible—like the collected works of Zoroaster." [...] Mark Reece and Brooke Adams of Deseret News also had mixed feelings about the game, calling it both [...] "clever and deep" [...] and [...] "frustrating and difficult". McDonald wrote that he was [...] "frustrated by the lack of good game play." [...] Hughes called the pace of the game and its puzzles both [...] "tedious" [...] and [...] "ponderous", but said it [...] "had ambition out the genetically modified ears." ...|$|E

60|$|The frigates did {{not fire}} at us, after the guns already mentioned. Why, I cannot {{positively}} say; but I thought, at the time, {{that they had}} <b>too</b> <b>many</b> other <b>things</b> to attend to, besides seeing the little chance there was of overtaking us, should they even happen to cripple a spar or two.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] she said, [...] "I don't think I shall go {{very far}} with them.

[...] She shuddered. [...] "I hate them!" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{pilot was}} met with {{extremely}} positive critical reception. Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the series premiere four out of four stars, commenting that it was as [...] "involving as any new drama and funnier than any new sitcom [...] matches high visual style with a witty-but-never arch sensibility." [...] He highlighted the performances of the six leading actresses, writing, [...] "Individually, each is terrific; combined, they're an irresistible feminine force", and praised Hatcher's [...] "revelatory performance." [...] Bianco also noted that Cherry avoided making the pilot campy. The San Francisco Chronicle Tim Goodman complimented the pilot's tonal diversity while expressing concern that American audiences would [...] "tune in, get freaked out by the scattershot emotional chords and flip over to something safer." [...] However, he praised Cherry's writing {{as well as the}} acting, declaring, [...] "There are almost <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to love in 'Desperate Housewives.'" [...] In his review of the episode, Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe commended the episode for its [...] "marvelous tonal elasticity, as it stretches from sharp satire to dishy soap opera to tragique tribute and back again." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Calusari" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews, with critics citing {{inconsistencies in}} the plot as the main detractions. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a [...] "B–" [...] rating, calling it [...] "an Exorcist/Omen rip-off, but a classy one". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave it a [...] "C+", writing that it was [...] "an episode {{with a lot of}} great and spooky moments", but [...] "a messy, chaotic story that could have been much better developed, and <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> that happen [...] just because the writers thought it would be cool if they happened". However, while he was [...] "not sure everything hangs together" [...] and he wished for more backstory, VanDerWerff did praise some [...] "really great moments", particularly the opening teaser. John Keegan from Critical Myth, while calling the episode [...] "a mixed bag", awarded it a 7 out of 10. He praised the entry's [...] "fascinating implications [...] the mythology hidden within the events depicted", and noted that it was [...] "well directed and acted". Despite this, he was more critical of the episode's plot and wrote that there were [...] "clear logical flaws [...] and the subject matter can be disturbing. This is an episode that falls heavily to subjective interpretation." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a largely negative review and rated it one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two called it a [...] "pale retread of The Exorcist" [...] and noted that many of the episode's elements, like the chicken-sacrificing grandmother and the Calusari members, were [...] "tremendously crass". Shearman and Pearson, however, did enjoy the episode's dialogue, praising one scene in particular where the spirit of Michael torments his mother by asking to be taken to the amusement park and ride the train that killed his younger brother. Regardless, however, the duo concluded that [...] "there's something stale and pointless at [...] heart." [...] The plot for [...] "The Calusari" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Garth Nix.|$|E
2500|$|Navratilova responded, [...] "And I'm {{giving it}} back. This is why I speak out. When I see {{something}} that I don't like, I'm going to speak out because {{you can do that}} here. And again, I feel there are <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> happening that are taking our rights away." ...|$|E
5000|$|GameSpot {{stated that}} the game was [...] "...the video game {{equivalent}} of fan fiction: familiar characters dropped into a formulaic story meant to elicit giggles from aficionados. Everything else is just the standard RPG rigmarole." [...] IGN said, [...] "With colorful graphics, a decent soundtrack (many of the songs are simple but catchy), 300 missions and countless hours of gameplay, it's hard to say <b>too</b> <b>many</b> negative <b>things</b> about Radiant Mythology." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of how to construct an appropriate geometry curriculum is a long-standing one. A recent estimate suggests that there are more than 50 geometries. This creates a fundamental problem in devising a geometry curriculum: there are just <b>too</b> <b>many</b> interesting <b>things</b> to include so some decision has to be made as to what to include and what to exclude. This report features three perspectives {{on the issue of the}} design of the school geometry curriculum...|$|R
5000|$|Daniel Carlson of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "It's {{not that}} the {{telefilm}} is necessarily bad; it's that co-writer and director John Kent Harrison only occasionally manages to imbue the story with the requisite tension and emotional strife deserving {{of one of the}} darkest chapters in history. There are a few harrowing moments that skillfully bring home the human and emotional cost of the war, but mostly the TV movie plays like <b>too</b> <b>many</b> other <b>things</b> we've seen before." ...|$|R
2500|$|Despite this, Harrison {{was unable}} to {{displace}} Paine and {{spent the rest of}} the season in the reserves. In his biography, Kevin Smallbone argues that Harrison was [...] "too talented for his own good" [...] and Harrison said (in 2005) that he [...] "was doing <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things,</b> I didn't have time to train". Speaking to Paine's biographer, David Bull, Harrison commented that he [...] "couldn't understand" [...] why Ted Bates didn't switch Terry Paine to inside-left to accommodate him on the right.|$|E
2500|$|.....Technically, {{their paper}} connects <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things.</b> It {{would be too}} good if all these ideas and (correct) {{formulae}} were necessary for a justification of a working solution to the initial singularity problem. But if one accepts that the papers about these difficult questions don't have {{to be just a}} well-defined science but maybe also a bit of inspiring art, the brothers have done a pretty good job, I think. And I want to know the answers to many questions that are opened in their paper.|$|E
2500|$|Thanks to the {{diplomacy}} of Dr. Barlow and {{a bright}} idea from Alek, the two groups decide to combine their technologies and leave together as one group. Alek also admits his true origins to Deryn/Dylan and Dr. Barlow when he realizes he let a few <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> slip. The Austrians dismantle the Stormwalker and use its engines to replace those lost by the Leviathan. The Austrian engines prove {{to be much more}} powerful than its previous ones, propelling them quickly away from danger and Herkules, a deadly Clanker ship [...]|$|E
5000|$|It was {{the funniest}} and the stupidest movie I've ever seen because <b>too</b> <b>many</b> stupid <b>things</b> {{happened}} in it. For instance, no shark can pull a boat backwards {{at a fast}} speed with a light line and stern cleats that are only held in there by two bolts. And I've never boiled shark jaws. If you do, you'll only {{end up with a}} bunch of teeth at the bottom of your bucket because the jaw cartilage melts.|$|R

60|$|I am re-reading Ticknor's diary, and am charmed with it, though I {{still say}} {{he refers to}} <b>too</b> <b>many</b> good <b>things</b> when he {{could just as well}} have told them. Think of the man {{traveling}} 8 days in convoy and familiar intercourse with a band of outlaws through the mountain fastnesses of Spain--he the fourth stranger they had encountered in thirty years--and compressing this priceless experience into a single colorless paragraph of his diary! They spun yarns to this unworthy devil, too.|$|R
2500|$|Kirkman and the showrunners {{wondered}} if Glenn's death was necessary, since Abraham {{had already been}} chosen for Negan's fatal beating. Glenn was the first character cast for the series whose fate was uncertain in the comics; Kirkman wrote [...] "Issue #100" [...] knowing that Steven Yeun was playing Glenn in the series, which made writing that issue difficult. Kirkman and the showrunners discussed options which would have spared Glenn's life, but [...] "pulling the thread on this sweater just pulls <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> apart"; Glenn's death in the comics drives several characters' plotlines (Maggie in particular) and they considered it [...] "essential" [...] to the episode.|$|E
2500|$|However, The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} Xbox 360 version three-and-a-half stars {{out of five}} and called it [...] "a game that would have benefitted from being streamlined, with {{additional}} FPS levels replacing the awkward driving. It should have been an id game. Instead it occupies this weird halfway-house between Borderlands, MotorStorm and Doom, not quite an RPG, not quite a racer and not quite an FPS." [...] The A.V. Club gave the same console version a C+ and said that its [...] "huge swaths... are lifted wholesale from Fallout 3, Borderlands, and BioShock, making Rage forever veer between loving homage and blatant plagiarism. In the end, Rage is an insecure, overly busy game that tries too hard to be <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>things,</b> and winds up with a greasy sheen of flop-sweat on its brow." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lisa Macklem of SpoilerTV wrote, [...] "I {{thought this}} was an {{interesting}} episode. And I always appreciate {{the inclusion of a}} Louden Swain song - 'Big One.' Lots of thinky thoughts and good bro-moments in this episode. The episode did seem a bit disjointed, however, perhaps a function of trying to do <b>too</b> <b>many</b> different <b>things.</b> Regardless, I'm happy to see the Cas-spell problem dealt with quickly. As a final note, I apologize for the tardiness of this review due to a personal crisis." ...|$|R

40|$|CAD-programs {{belong to}} the most complex kinds of {{software}} - complex and difficult in using and especially in learning for architects and for students. Some years ago we already tried to find ways for making the first steps easier for students and more comfortable for teachers: Our first attempt was {{to reduce the number}} of commands from 150 to only 20 in the first lesson by cutting off many of the pull-down-menus (it was even the time before the cad-program, we use, was running under windows). We supported the reduced menus on the screen by handing out a template with all the needed commands for the first lesson. We had two positive results: the first was a reduction of beginners frustrations about <b>too</b> <b>many</b> new <b>things,</b> the second was a homogenisation among the studentsi know how: the very eager ones were no longer able to test <b>too</b> <b>many</b> new <b>things!</b> In the second lesson the students got another twenty new commands and so on (they could start the program with a batch rib- 1, rib- 2 etc.). Our second attempt was the development of new dialogues due to our experience in teaching and in looking at the same points of difficulties every year. ...|$|R
