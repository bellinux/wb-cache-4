5|$|Of the 403 sorties {{put up by}} Fighter Command to {{meet the}} major German attacks, 320 of those made contact with the enemy, meaning 80 percent of the fighters sent to {{intercept}} <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> did so. The percentage would have been higher, had <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> on the afternoon raid not turned around short of their targets.|$|E
5|$|Göring also placed {{emphasis}} on correct rendezvous with <b>the</b> <b>bombers,</b> {{which had been}} lacking in recent operations (see Adlertag). The longer-range bombers were ordered directly to fighter airfields {{to pick up their}} escorts {{on the way to the}} target. He determined that as many fighters as possible should remain on sweeps while a smaller number maintained close contact with <b>the</b> <b>bombers.</b> For now, this would be the main tactical arrangement of fighter-bomber cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Latham and Farris {{both made}} their wrestling debuts in 1976 and later {{signed with the}} Continental Wrestling Association (CWA). CWA owners Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler paired Latham and Farris as a new {{incarnation}} of the Blond Bombers. Managed by Sergeant Danny Davis, <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> were the promotion's top heel tag team, Their first championship came on June 15, 1979, when they won an infamous match against Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee in Tupelo, Mississippi. After the Blond Bombers controversially won the title, Lawler and Dundee attacked the new champions and fought {{with them in the}} concession stands. They soon dropped the belts to Robert Gibson and his real-life brother Ricky, but they regained them in a rematch later that summer. Meanwhile, the Fabulous Freebirds, who had been the region's number two heel tag team became faces and challenged <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> for the belts. They won the title from the Latham and Farris in September 1979, but <b>the</b> <b>Bombers</b> won a rematch to reclaim the championship.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} attack, before <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> had been identified, Hezbollah's TV channel {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> was named Shahanaz Al Amouri, from An-Najah National University in Nablus.

5000|$|Oxford-based Malaysian jurist Shaykh Afifi al-Akiti, issued his fatwa forbidding {{suicide bombing}} and {{targeting}} innocent civilians: [...] "If the attack involves a bomb {{placed on the}} body or placed so close to <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> that when <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> detonates it <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> is certain yaqin to die, then the More Correct Position according to us {{is that it does}} constitute suicide. This is because <b>the</b> <b>bomber,</b> being also <b>the</b> Maqtul one killed, is unquestionably the same Qatil immediate/active agent that kills = Qatil Nafsahu oneself, i.e., suicide." ...|$|R
5|$|Next day, <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> {{went after}} rubber {{factories}} in Hannover, along with Hamburg U-Boat Yards. Feldwebel Alfred Miksch of 8./JG 1 and Hauptmann Robert Olejnik of III./JG 1 each claimed one bomber.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{forecasts}} {{indicated that}} weather conditions at Kaafjord were changing rapidly, {{and during the}} morning of 11 September Harris judged {{that it would not}} be feasible to launch <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> from Scotland with confidence that Kaafjord would be free of cloud by the time they arrived. Accordingly, he decided to change the plans for the operation, with all of <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> now flying to Yagodnik first and mounting the attack from that airfield. Harris ordered the attack force to depart that afternoon, before advising the Air Ministry or Soviets of the change in plans.|$|E
5|$|After {{the devastating}} bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe, the Germans {{threatened}} to bomb other Dutch cities if the Dutch forces refused to surrender. The General Staff {{knew it could}} not stop <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> and ordered the Dutch army to cease hostilities. The last occupied parts of the Netherlands were liberated in 1945.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> was to {{one side}} of the target, or {{drifting}} away from the proper approach, the line control wheel was used to rotate the entire sight to place the crosshair back on the target. Simply flying at that angle will not bring <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> back along <b>the</b> proper approach, it will cause <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> to fly parallel to the correct line. In order to re-capture <b>the</b> approach, <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> has to turn past the correct heading and erase the accumulated error, then turn back onto the proper line.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> {{attempts}} to flee and is cornered by Sato. Sato prepares to avenge her partner, Jinpei Matsuda (...) , {{who was killed}} by <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> three years prior but is stopped by Takagi. After confiding in Takagi {{over the death of}} Matsuda and the satisfaction that <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> was captured, she is able to lay her memories of Matsuda to rest and move onwards with her life.|$|R
50|$|According {{to police}} officials, <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> was a {{teenager}} who refused to be checked at a checkpost and instead be detonated himself. 7 people were injured while two, excluding <b>the</b> <b>bomber,</b> were killed.|$|R
5|$|At 06:00 448 B-24 Liberators of the United States Army Air Forces, {{having already}} {{completed}} one bombing mission over Omaha late the previous day, returned. However, with the skies overcast and under orders to avoid bombing the troops which were by then approaching the beach, <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> overshot their targets {{and only three}} bombs fell near the beach area.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 14 September, 26 Lancasters from the attack forces and the Film Unit {{aircraft}} were ready; 20 of <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> were armed with Tallboys and the remainder with JW mines. The Mosquito took off bound for Kaafjord at 2:10am, but the planned departure of <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> at 8:00am was cancelled when it returned to Yagodnik at 6:45 and reported that conditions over the target area were unsuitable. For {{the remainder of the}} day the Soviets provided hospitality including a formal lunch, a football tournament and a film that night. Some of the Allied airmen were disturbed to see political prisoners being beaten by overseers while undertaking forced labour. Work on repairing the damaged Lancasters also continued on 14 September, and an additional Tallboy-armed aircraft was ready by the next morning.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "twelve o'clock high" [...] {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of calling out the positions of attacking enemy aircraft by reference to an imaginary clock face, with <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> at <b>the</b> center. The terms [...] "high" [...] (above <b>the</b> <b>bomber),</b> [...] "level" [...] (at the same altitude as <b>the</b> <b>bomber)</b> and [...] "low" [...] (below <b>the</b> <b>bomber)</b> further refine <b>the</b> location of the enemy. Thus [...] "twelve o'clock high" [...] meant the attacker was approaching from directly ahead and above. This location was preferred by German fighter pilots because, until the introduction of the Bendix chin turret in the B-17G model, the nose of the B-17 was the most lightly armed and vulnerable part of <b>the</b> <b>bomber.</b> Enemy fighter aircraft diving from above were also more difficult targets for the B-17 gunners due to their high closing speeds.|$|R

50|$|Their December report noted a {{key problem}} in air defense using {{ground-based}} radars. A bomber approaching a radar station would detect the {{signals from the}} radar long before the reflection off <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> {{was strong enough to}} be detected by the station. The committee suggested that when this occurred, <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> would descend to low altitude, thereby greatly limiting the radar horizon, allowing <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> to fly past the station undetected. Although flying at low altitude greatly increased fuel consumption, the team calculated that <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> would only need to do this for about 10% of its flight, making the fuel penalty easily acceptable.|$|R
5|$|Crossley {{attempted}} a second pass on <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> soon after. This time, the Bf 110s {{succeeded in getting}} in between <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> and 32 Squadron. One Bf 110 was damaged while their gunners shot down and wounded Flight Lieutenant 'Humph' Russell. Seconds later, No. 64 Squadron's eight Spitfires turned up, led by Squadron Leader Donald MacDonell. They dived on the Dorniers from high-altitude. Some of the Squadron, including Squadron Leader MacDonell, attacked the Bf 110s, believing them to be Dorniers. MacDonell damaged a Bf 110 flown by Ruediger. Proske crash-landed and was taken prisoner. Several confusing dogfights broke out and lasted for some time.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Do 17s of KG 76 had touched down, {{the next wave}} was already just getting airborne. II and III./Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2), (from Boissy-Saint-Léger and Cambrai) II./Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3) (from Antwerp), I and II./Kampfgeschwader 53 (KG 53) (from Lille) and I and II./Kampfgeschwader 26 (from Wevelghem and Gilze en Rijen) took off to target the West India Docks and Royal Victoria Dock north of the Thames {{as well as the}} {{warehouses}} of the Surrey Commercial Docks in the south. JG 53 and Adolf Galland's Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) were to escort <b>the</b> <b>bombers.</b> The fighters met them as <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> formed up over Calais.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly who was {{responsible}} for the damage on the German ships. It is possible that the mines were air-dropped by RAF Handley Page Hampden bombers. Should this be the case, <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> achieved far more damage than the Royal Navy {{and the rest of the}} RAF combined.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> {{arrived in}} <b>the</b> mosque {{approximately}} 12.10 when the khatib was finishing the sermon. The perpetrator was approximately 25 to 30 {{years old and}} 165-170 cm tall and carried a backpack. <b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> {{showed up in the}} mosque wearing a full black dress, and concealed the explosives behind his black jacket. <b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> was probably targeting the Cirebon police chief, Adjutant Senior Commander (Police) Herukoco, since he chose to stand near him.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> suicide <b>bomber</b> struck <b>the</b> pilgrims {{during a}} dhamaal (ritual dance) after the evening prayers. The {{perpetrator}} blew himself {{up inside the}} shrine hall under the dome, near its Golden Gate. <b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> also threw a grenade which failed to explode. <b>The</b> <b>bomber,</b> believed to be an Afghan national, had bypassed the security check at the shrine.|$|R
25|$|During questioning, Javadi {{says that}} one of Nazir's men detonated the Langley bomb, and that Brody {{had nothing to do}} with it. As Carrie {{delivers}} Javadi to the airport, he tells her that Bennett knows <b>the</b> <b>bomber's</b> identity. Carrie enlists Quinn to help clear Brody's name. To track down <b>the</b> <b>bomber,</b> she tells Franklin that Leland's firm has been linked to the bombing, provoking Leland into ordering <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> moved out of the country. She takes part in a stakeout of <b>the</b> <b>bomber's</b> hotel room and watches as Franklin approaches with a silenced pistol. Carrie insists on intervening, as she cannot prove Brody's innocence without <b>the</b> <b>bomber's</b> testimony. Black ops agent Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) orders her to stand down, but she ignores him and starts running toward the hotel. Quinn shoots her in the shoulder to stop her. Adal's team then drives her to the hospital.|$|R
5|$|Later, 18 B-17s {{from the}} 97th Bomb Group bombed Axis airfields at El Aounina. Two Me 323s, two Ju 52s and five Italian {{transports}} were destroyed. A second mission was flown to Sid Ahmed. Both raids were flown with Spitfire escorts. Only a few German fighters intercepted, without success. <b>The</b> <b>bombers</b> claimed one German fighter destroyed.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 1944, the Eighth Air Force {{attempted}} {{to repeat the}} success of 20 February. 1st and 2nd Divisions flew due east towards Germany and the 3rd Division east-northeast without escort. After crossing into Schleswig-Holstein they attacked targets along the Baltic sea coast. The 1st and 2nd Divisions {{were considered to be}} the main thrust of the attack and the 3rd Division went unmolested. The B-24 bombers of the 2nd Division were scheduled to bomb Gotha and JG 1 were directed to attack these B-24s. Due to strong tailwinds and flying at lower altitude, <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> were separated from their escorting fighters and JG 1 reached Gotha before <b>the</b> <b>bombers.</b> Major Heinz Bär led II./JG 1 in a diving attack and claimed four B-24s while I./JG 1 attacked head-on and claimed five B-24s downed.|$|E
5|$|Swiss {{aircraft}} also intercepted U.S. aircraft {{who were}} off-course, or whose crews preferred asylum in Swiss internment camps over German or Italian POW camps; {{they were then}} forced to land on Swiss airstrips. When <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> did not cooperate or even fired at the Swiss (who were using Axis-type interceptors), they were shot down.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> is <b>the</b> game's {{equivalent}} of an atomic bomb (minus radiation poisoning and nuclear winters) and each can only be used once, after which it is destroyed. In this sense, <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> represents <b>the</b> bomb itself, rather than an aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> suicide <b>bomber</b> {{was among}} <b>the</b> crowd {{awaiting}} outside the Al-Atik mosque {{the arrival of}} President Bouteflika when his device, a [...] "plastic bag containing the explosive" [...] and his [...] "agitated" [...] manner was noticed 45 minutes prior to the Presidents arrival. This forced <b>the</b> <b>bomber,</b> a [...] "man aged 30 to 35" [...] to detonate his device prematurely as police approached him. However it is unknown whether <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> himself escaped <b>the</b> blast, however interior minister Noureddine Yazid was quoted by the Algerian news agency APS as stating that <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> had escaped through a security cordon.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> patrolling <b>bomber</b> {{loaded with}} depth charges and bombs {{reported}} that the submarine had a white flag with a red cross and they had unsuccessfully challenged the submarine via radio to display its national flag. The submarine blinked via signal light what <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> crew understood to read [...] "German Sir". <b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> crew asked Ascension Island what to do next.|$|R
5|$|The {{cancellation}} order had {{not reached}} Luftflotte 3 HQ at all. Its commander, Hugo Sperrle ordered attacks to commence. At 05:00, 20 Junkers Ju 88s of I./KG 54 took off {{to bomb the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment's airfield at 'RAF Farnborough' (RAE Farnborough). At 05:05, 18 Ju 88s from II./KG 54 took off for RAF Odiham. At 05:50, 88 Junkers Ju 87s of StG 77 began heading for Portland Harbour. The raids were escorted by about 60 Bf 110s of Zerstörergeschwader 2 (Destroyer Wing 2; ZG 2), and V./LG 1 and 173 Bf 109s from Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27), JG 53 and JG 3, which all flew ahead of the bomber stream to clear the airspace of enemy fighters. StG 77's target was obscured by cloud, but KG 54 continued to their target. RAF fighters from RAF Northolt, RAF Tangmere and RAF Middle Wallop intercepted. Four Ju 88s and one Bf 109 from JG 2 was shot down. The German fighters claimed six RAF fighters and <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> another 14. In reality, <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> only damaged five. The Bf 109s destroyed only one and damaged another. Of the five RAF fighters damaged by <b>the</b> <b>bombers,</b> two were write-offs. Of the 20 claimed, just three fighters were lost and three pilots were wounded. None were killed.|$|E
5|$|The unusual {{behaviour}} of <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> concerned Kapitän zur See Mecke. At 00:00 on 28 March, {{he issued}} a warning {{that there might be}} a parachute landing in progress. At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case <b>the</b> <b>bombers</b> were using them to locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships' crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters. During all this a lookout reported seeing some activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Up until now, the Bf 109s had {{successfully}} blocked attacks on <b>the</b> <b>bombers.</b> However, Park's tactics of attacking the Germans {{all along the}} route forced their fighters to use up fuel more quickly in dogfights. When the outskirts of London came into view, they began to depart at 12:07 north of Lewisham.|$|E
50|$|Per <b>the</b> <b>Bomber</b> liner notes.|$|R
50|$|As {{a safety}} {{mechanism}} to protect <b>the</b> <b>bomber,</b> <b>the</b> placer {{of the bomb}} may rig a timing device incorporated with the circuit to activate the circuit only after a certain time period, therefore ensuring <b>the</b> <b>bomber</b> will not accidentally activate the bomb before {{he or she is}} able to get clear of the blast radius.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> group, {{with about}} 350 crew members, {{suffered}} heavy losses: four killed, four wounded and 54 missing. 56 tons of bombs killed two civilians, and destroyed the marshalling yards and the Wilten monastery. <b>The</b> <b>bomber</b> crews received a [...] "Presidential Unit Citation".|$|R
