40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide the {{information}} model for the worldwide <b>tanker</b> <b>shipping</b> market 2010 – 2020. The evaluation and analysis of the relevant variables of the model and the resulting growth rates are used to describe the most important theoretical principles of the worldwide <b>tanker</b> <b>shipping</b> market over the observed period of time. The research produced direct growth rates of the variables on the index scale from 1 to 100 : 1. Innovations in maritime shipping (37. 5), 2. Global economy (25. 0), 3. Shipbuilding (14. 3). 4. Globalisation (12. 5) and 5. Freight rates (12. 5). It can be concluded that the direct growth rates of all model variables of the worldwide <b>tanker</b> <b>shipping</b> market 2010 – 2020 have realistic chances to be implemented. By 2020 it is expected that the demand on the <b>tanker</b> <b>shipping</b> market will increase more intensely than the demand in other trades...|$|R

McLean had initially favored the construction of [...] "trailerships"—taking trailers from large trucks and stowing them in a ship's cargo hold. This method of stowage, referred to as roll-on/roll-off, was not adopted because of the large waste in potential cargo space on board the vessel, known as broken stowage. Instead, McLean modified his original concept into loading just the containers, not the chassis, onto the ship; hence the designation [...] "container ship" [...] or [...] "box" [...] ship.
