In spite of positive economic evolutions and considerable governmental concerns, income inequality is still high in Romania and has remained almost unchanged during the past 15 years. Neither economic growth, nor the economic crisis that followed during recent years, has been equally distributed across households. The contribution of our paper lies in the decomposition of income inequality by groups of households based on socio-economic characteristics and the estimation of between and within group inequality. We assess the size of income inequality by using the Theil inequality index.

40|$|High {{unemployment}} rates among educated workers in Morocco {{and many other}} developing countries is a serious issue.

The results also show that the contraction of employment opportunities has increased the probability of considering self-employment as an alternative to unemployment, except for university graduates who still prefer paid work and, consequently, risk long periods of unemployment.

Certain stylized features will have to suffice. Of these, and as distinct from developed countries, two prominent features are: (1) that developing countries are characterized by a <b>status</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> which own-account work, rather than paid employment, (wage-earning) is considerably greater; and, (2) somewhat contrary to a standard textbook in labour economics, much economic activity in developing countries cannot be understood as the “derived demand for labour ” – i. e. labour demand derived from product-market demand. Much own-account work is actually an effort at “demand creation. ” Much activity is in fact outside of a “market ” altogether, e. g. subsistence farming, or endeavoring to “create demand”, e. g. street vending, which can be understood as an “employment-led”, survivalist strategy, rather than a “growth-led ” demand for labour. 3 The distinction here is that between “growth” or “demand ” absorbing labour into jobs, as is common in developed countries, versus an abundant, underemployed supply of labour seeking to create its own demand for its services.

40|$|The past 50 {{years has}} seen the {{development}} of schemes <b>in</b> higher education, <b>employment</b> and professional work that either identify what people should know and/or {{what they should be}} able to do with what they have learned and experienced. Within higher education this is usually equated with the learning outcomes students are expected to achieve at the end of studying a course, module or qualification and increasingly the teaching, learning and assessment strategies of those courses, modules or qualifications are being designed to align with those learning outcomes. <b>In</b> <b>employment,</b> there has been the emergence of job and role specifications setting out the knowledge and skills required of incumbent and recruits alike.

This paper explores the varied relationships between these three means of measuring knowledge and skills within people including the nature of the knowledge and skills being measured as well as the specificity of the knowledge and skills being measured, using the case study of environmental management in the UK. It then argues that there needs to be a more constructive alignment between these three forms of measurement, achieved through a dynamic conversation between all concerned, but also that such alignment needs both to recognise the importance of less tangible ‘systems thinking’ abilities alongside the more tangible ‘technical’ and ‘managerial’ abilities and that some abilities emerge from the trajectories of praxis and cannot readily be specified as an outcome in advance...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, {{bankruptcy}} {{retains a}} social stigma, {{as is often}} seen as a personal failing, and {{an indication that the}} individual cannot be trusted to meet their obligations. Official labelling and informal labelling reinforce this stigmatisation of bankruptcy <b>in</b> <b>employment</b> and business contexts. This occurs through legislation and policy that imposes restrictions on participation in some occupations on the grounds of bankruptcy, and imposes obligations on persons to disclose their bankruptcy to their employer. These restrictions and obligations that are varying in length and extent, both within industries and professions and across industries and professions, and appear to lack a coherent policy justification. Further, informal labelling is facilitated by the law providing for a permanent, publicly accessible record of bankruptcy, and failing to restrict the use of bankruptcy information <b>in</b> <b>employment</b> and business decision-making. This stigmatisation of bankruptcy inhibits the fresh start objective of bankruptcy, and is not supported by a strong correlation between bankruptcy and negative personal or other attributes. This article therefore argues that a review is needed to determine the circumstances {{in which there is a}} genuine policy justification for employment restrictions, and the appropriate length and scope of such restrictions. Reform of the Bankruptcy Act should also be considered. Possible areas for law reform including reducing the minimum period of bankruptcy; removing the permanency and/or public accessibility of the bankruptcy record; revising the language used in the Bankruptcy Act; and introducing a prohibition or restriction on the ability of employers to use bankruptcy <b>status</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment</b> decision making. Such changes would promote the fresh start objective of Australia’s bankruptcy system, and increase the likelihood that bankruptcy does not unfairly inhibit an individual’s ability to engage as an economic actor in Australian society and thereby improve their financial well-being...|$|R

30|$|First, {{employment}} protection legislation {{is a set}} of rules that govern (a) termination of regular contracts, in case of individual and collective dismissals, and (b) hiring of employees on fixed-term contracts. The legal coverage data that we collected concern both types of regulations, and hence both types of workers—regular wage employees and wage employees holding fixed-term contracts. However, in many developing countries, but also recently in developed countries as well, total wage employment is not exhaustively measured as a sum of regular and fixed-term employees, and other categories, such as casual workers, additionally exist. According to the 1993 Resolution concerning the International Classification of <b>Status</b> <b>in</b> <b>Employment,</b> 7 casual workers are defined as persons “who have an explicit or implicit contract of employment which is not expected to continue for more than a short period, whose duration is to be determined by national circumstance.” As shown by De Stefano (2016), in the majority of countries, these workers are totally or partially excluded from labor protection, either de jure, or de facto. One country that particularly stands out in this regard is Australia. In this country, casual workers are explicitly excluded by law from EPL provisions. We thus also excluded them from computation of de jure coverage. In other countries, as shown by De Stefano (2016), the law is less clear cut and may exclude casual workers from some of the provisions or contain special provisions for them. Thus, we do not exclude casual workers from computing de jure coverage in all other countries, though de facto, {{they are likely to be}} excluded.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] This is {{the fourth}} issue of the ILO 2 ̆ 7 s report series: Global Estimates on Child Labour. The present Report {{provides}} new global and regional estimates on child labour for the year 2012 and compares them with the previous estimates for 2000, 2004 and 2008. The Report draws on an increasing amount of data from national-level child labour surveys (SIMPOC surveys) and other sources. Understanding Children 2 ̆ 7 s Work (UCW), an interagency programme on child labour statistics and research, provided access to non-ILO data and assisted in the analysis. The new child labour estimates are based on refined estimation techniques fully comparable with the ones for 2000, 2004 and 2008 rounds. They also benefited from: (a) the international standards on child labour statistics adopted by the 18 th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) in 2008; and (b) an integrated approach to estimation using standardized tabulation schemes for national data and composite estimation procedures for arriving at regional and global trends. The remainder of the Report is structured as follows. Chapter 1 highlights the main estimation findings for 2012. Chapter 2 presents the current child labour situation. Chapter 3 presents the dynamic child labour situation, comparing estimation results from 2012 with those of 2000, 2004 and 2008. For Chapters 2 and 3, data are disaggregated {{to the extent possible}} by age group, sex, region, branch of economic activity, national income category and <b>status</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment.</b> Chapter 4 provides some pointers for the way forward.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the rights}} and the <b>status</b> of probationers <b>in</b> the context of Malaysian employment relations. A probationer is someone who is on trial to give proof of certain qualifications for a place or <b>status</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment.</b> The term “probation” however, is not found {{in any of the}} <b>employment</b> legislation <b>in</b> Malaysia. This means a probationer is an employee in the context of Employment Act 1955 (EA 1955) and a workman in the context of Industrial Relations Act 1955 (IRA 1967). <b>In</b> the <b>employment</b> relations, the probationary period is also an opportunity for both employer and employee to decide whether they are suited for each other. The Industrial Court and the superior courts in Malaysia have over the years ruled that an employee (also refers to workman) on probation enjoys the same rights as a permanent employee. As a result the services of a probationer cannot be terminated without just cause or excuse (Section 20, IRA 1967). Although an employer retains the right to confirm or not to confirm an employee on probation, this prerogative must be exercised in a bona fide manner not arbitrarily or capriciously and there must also be grounds for the decision. In this paper, the authors analyses some of key issues on {{the rights and}} status of probationers which also include the employers right to confirm, extend or terminate the services of a probationer. The methodology employed in this paper is the analysis of industrial case laws on probation using criterion based sampling of Industrial Court and superior court awards. Findings from the analysis reveals that many termination awards on probation were made against the employers as the employers have failed or violated the principles of natural justice in the termination of probationers. The basic principle of industrial jurisprudence in Malaysia is that it is the employer who must prove the employee (probationer) guilty, and not the employee (probationer) who must prove himself (herself) not guilty. As such, the burden of prove is on the employer and not on the employee (probationer) for termination cases referred to the Industrial Court. In this paper the authors also provide some recommendation in the management probationers besides other guidelines to improve and create a harmonious employment relationship...|$|R

Using data gathered from the 2002 / 03 household survey, the 2006 nationwide census and a questionnaire on rural - urban migration in Lesotho administered to 500 respondents in Maseru and Leribe, we estimate a logit model of the probability of <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> Lesotho in 2008 given a set of independent variables. The independent variables are respondent's work experience; years of education completed; <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> <b>in</b> 2004; <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> <b>in</b> 2008; gender; job skill level; place of residence in 2004 and a categorical variable that measures {{whether or not the}} respondent is a rural - urban migrant. The results suggest that migration and work experience have no significant impact on an individual's likelihood of being employed in the country's formal sector. Also, {{it was found that the}} higher the level of education an individual has, the less likely are their chances of <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> the country's formal sector because of the lack of formal jobs in the urban areas. Over 50 % of Lesotho's workforce employed in the urban areas was discovered to work in the informal sector. The study concludes that there is a lack of jobs in Lesotho's urban formal sector that results in a thriving informal sector. The advantages of informal sector jobs to the rural - urban migrant include an increase in their standard of living as well as that of their family members left behind in the rural areas but the disadvantages include low levels of investor confidence that lead to a decrease in overall economic development and growth in the country. ...|$|R

Marriage to a Japanese spouse is presented as a bulwark against alignment with problematic discourses that threaten the status of white masculinity: it is associated with fidelity and maturity, and with integration into Japanese social, linguistic and professional communities.

Interestingly, the model also suggests that the reform would bring an increase of 4.9 percent in the formal wage rate, net of taxes and transfers. This implies that formal workers may actually bear a significant share of the tax burden imposed by non-wage labor costs through lower wages.|$|R
