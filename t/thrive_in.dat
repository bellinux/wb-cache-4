5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E
5|$|Many {{non-native}} plants also <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> Phoenix including, but {{not limited}} to, the date palm, Mexican fan palm, pineapple palm, Afghan pine, Canary Island pine, Mexican fencepost cactus, cardon cactus, acacia, eucalyptus, aloe, bougainvillea, oleander, lantana, bottlebrush, olive, citrus, and red bird of paradise.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2010 {{concluded}} that {{the main source of}} the mercury is likely worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16 percent of the mercury comes in from rivers, and 84 percent comes from the atmosphere in a non-toxic, inorganic form. The non-toxic mercury is converted into toxic methyl mercury by bacteria which <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway.|$|E

5|$|Although Shetlands {{are small}} and slow-growing {{compared}} to commercial breeds, they are hardy, thrifty, easy lambers, adaptable and long-lived. The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions and on a poor diet, but they <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, so they are easier to care for than many modern breeds.|$|E
5|$|Ants have colonised {{almost every}} landmass on Earth. The only places lacking {{indigenous}} ants are Antarctica {{and a few}} remote or inhospitable islands. Ants <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the terrestrial animal biomass. Their success in so many environments {{has been attributed to}} their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E

Colonies of termites have been seen thriving in warm buildings located in cold regions. Some termites are considered invasive species. Cryptotermes brevis, the most widely introduced invasive termite species in the world, has been introduced to all the islands in the West Indies and to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Native grasses <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> {{many parts}} of the {{monument}} despite competition from medusahead rye, Dalmatian toadflax, cheatgrass, and other invasive species. Bunchgrasses in the park include basin wildrye, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, among others. Native grasses that form sod in parts of the monument include Sandberg's bluegrass and other bluegrass species. Reed canary grass, if mowed, also forms sod along stream banks.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises, {{as opposed}} to their dolphin counterparts, {{generally}} do not <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> captivity, and {{are very difficult to}} maintain.

5|$|The {{water in}} the bog is low in {{nutrients}} and high in acidity, which {{makes it difficult for}} most plants to live there. Only specialized plants can <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> the park bogs: there are three species of carnivorous plants and seventeen varieties of orchid. Wild cranberries and blueberries grow in the bog along with sedges, leatherleaf shrubs, Arctic cotton grass, and viburnums. The bogs are all protected by the state of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E

5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as between 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland {{and its ability to}} <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from exploitation of the local pine forests.|$|E
5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This {{makes them}} a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E
