5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} {{is one of}} two {{foramina}} located in the base of the human skull, on the sphenoid bone. It is situated just anterior to <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sphenoid bone, and just lateral to the foramen ovale. The middle meningeal artery, middle meningeal vein, and the meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve pass through the foramen.|$|E
5|$|Drizzt is {{the main}} {{character}} in only two books of the Paths of Darkness series. The Silent Blade (1998) describes the group's journey to permanently destroy the Crystal Shard. Sea of Swords (2001) continues Drizzt's story after the events of <b>The</b> <b>Spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World (1999), which focuses on Wulfgar, and Servant of the Shard (2000), which has Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle as the main characters. Sea of Swords covers the companions' search for Wulfgar's lost magical warhammer, Aegis-fang, and the reunion of the group after an extended separation.|$|E
5|$|It {{is crucial}} for these {{definitions}} that edges are only allowed to stay within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs need this many spine crossings.|$|E

5|$|Testing the {{existence}} of a three-page book embedding of a graph, given a fixed ordering of the vertices along <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embedding, has unknown computational complexity: it is neither known to be solvable in polynomial time nor known to be NP-hard. And, although every planar graph has book thickness at most four, it is unknown whether there exists a planar graph whose book thickness is exactly four.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} perfect ring-shaped {{formation of}} the foramen spinosum was observed in the eighth month after birth and the latest seven years after birth in a developmental study of the foramen rotundum, foramen ovale and foramen spinosum. The majority of the foramina in the skull studies were round in shape. The sphenomandibular ligament, derived from the first pharyngeal arch and usually attached to <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sphenoid bone, may be found attached to {{the rim of the}} foramen.|$|E
5|$|As {{the size}} of the AEF grew, the {{division}} was placed under command of I Corps in July. When the Aisne-Marne campaign began shortly thereafter, the division, under I Corps was placed under command of the French Sixth Army protecting its east flank. When the offensive began, the division advanced up <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marne salient for several weeks, pushing through Belleau Wood, moving 10 miles from 18 to 25 July. On 12 August it was pulled from the lines near Toul to prepare for the next offensive. The division was then a part of the offensive at St. Mihiel, during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. The division then moved in position for the last major offensive of the war, at Meuse-Argonne. This campaign was the last of the war, as an armistice was signed shortly thereafter. During World War I the 26th Division spent 210 days in combat, and suffered 1,587 killed in action and 12,077 wounded in action. The division returned to the United States and was demobilized on 3 May 1919 at Camp Devens, Massachusetts.|$|E

A. alisae, close to A. callirhoe (Macpherson, 1994), can be distinguished easily by <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carapace and the antennal peduncle.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Fells runs {{north from}} High Raise, forming the {{watershed}} between Thirlmere and Borrowdale. A number of lesser ridges radiate out eastwards from High Raise, centred upon the subsidiary top of Sergeant Man. One of these runs between the valleys of Far Easedale and Easedale, terminating at their confluence above Grasmere village.|$|E
25|$|The {{back of the}} scapula (also {{called the}} dorsal or {{posterior}} surface) is arched from above downward, and is subdivided into two unequal parts by <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scapula. The portion above the spine is called the supraspinous fossa, and that below it the infraspinous fossa. The two fossae are connected by the spinoglenoid notch, situated lateral {{to the root of}} the spine.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{principal}} dialects of Malagasy; Eastern (including Merina) and Western (including Sakalava), with the isogloss running down <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, the south being western, {{and the central}} plateau {{and much of the}} north (apart from the very tip) being eastern.

25|$|As Dunedin {{developed}} the Peninsula's southern end became a city recreation ground {{and then a}} suburb. Native bush was cleared {{over most of the}} terrain in a massive transformation of the landscape.

25|$|The sphenomandibular {{ligament}} {{runs from}} <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sphenoid bone to the lingula of mandible. The inferior alveolar nerve descends between the sphenomandibular ligament and the ramus of the mandible {{to gain access}} to the mandibular foramen. The sphenomandibular ligament, because of its attachment to the lingula, overlaps the opening of the foramen. It is a vestige of the embryonic lower jaw, Meckel cartilage. The ligament becomes accentuated and taut when the mandible is protruded.|$|E

Dellums peacefully marched with the crowd back West along 14th Street to the steps of City Hall, where he attempted to address the crowd, but cut the meeting short and entered City Hall after the crowd became agitated, began booing, and shouted Dellums down.|$|E
25|$|Sitting astride <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Fells, High Tove is an outlier of High Seat.

The ridge moves on south across further upland marsh towards Ullscarf, passing over the three rocky (and dry) outcrops of Middle Crag, Shivery Knott and Watendlath Fell (summit unnamed on Ordnance Survey maps). Armboth Fell lies to the south east of High Tove, connected to the ridge by a broad heathery saddle.|$|E
