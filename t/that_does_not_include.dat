5|$|When a {{continuous}} spectrum of energy is {{passed through a}} gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E

25|$|Following {{successful}} recombination of {{the linear}} DNA {{to the target}} genome, plasmid origins and markers can be re-used {{as a result of}} the plasmid curing method. The pKDsgRNA contains a temperature sensitive open reading frame which, when grown at 37oC, denatures the plasmid. This allows for easy plasmid curing <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> any additional reagents. This is useful because upon curing of the pKDsg-XXX plasmid, another pKDsg-XXX plasmid with a different sgRNA can subsequently be transfected into the E. coli cells to introduce further mutations to the target cellular sequences. After all mutations are introduced, both plasmids should be cured. Unfortunately, the pCas9cr4 plasmid lacks an inherent curing mechanism, so Reisch and Prather pioneered a plasmid curing mechanism by introducing a pKDsgRNA whose sgRNA is complement to the pCas9cr4 plasmid. Specifically, they constructed a pKDsg-p15A which targeted the p15A origin of replication of the pCas9cr4 plasmid. After recombinants were selected for, expression of Cas9 and sgRNA was induced with the addition of aTc. After plating on selective plates and growing at 37oC, they observed no colony formation on the LB plates containing chloramphenicol indicating loss of the pCas9cr4 plasmid due to a Cas9-mediated double strand break in the plasmid. Additional plasmid mini-preps demonstrated that neither plasmid was retained in the cells, therefore indicating plasmid curing. This technique can easily be applied to curing other plasmids as well.|$|E

500|$|An intein is a [...] "parasitic" [...] {{segment of}} a protein that {{is able to}} excise itself from the chain of amino acids as they emerge from the {{ribosome}} and rejoin the remaining portions with a peptide bond {{in such a manner}} that the main protein [...] "backbone" [...] does not fall apart.

Additionally, most inteins contain a homing endonuclease or HEG domain which is capable of finding a copy of the parent gene <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> the intein nucleotide sequence. On contact with the intein-free copy, the HEG domain initiates the DNA double-stranded break repair mechanism. This process causes the intein sequence to be copied from the original source gene to the intein-free gene. This is an example of protein directly editing DNA sequence, as well as increasing the sequence's heritable propagation.|$|E
500|$|Okereke has {{discussed}} a natural progression in Bloc Party's compositional style {{to a more}} explorative, electronic direction.

[...] "Mercury" [...] continues the complex drumming theme by incorporating layered percussion and contains a vocally manipulated chorus. The track is an attempt at drum and bass and features brass dissonance, effects Okereke has called [...] "harsh, glacial, layered and energetic".
