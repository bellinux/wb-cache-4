5|$|Counsel for the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor {{presented}} {{evidence that}} the Amana was on fire before it first struck trees. Counsel for the widow {{of one of the}} victims suggested the crash may have been caused by the elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> jamming in the diving position.|$|E
25|$|Investigation of {{the crash}} {{uncovered}} some errors in the information {{used to determine the}} position of the aircraft's centre of gravity. It became clear that the aircraft had taken off with its centre of gravity slightly outside the approved limits. Investigators also found evidence that the takeoff may have been performed with the elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> still set for landing. If the elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> had not been set for takeoff this would have been exacerbated by the incorrect position of the centre of gravity and the aircraft would have been uncontrollable.|$|E
25|$|Developmental {{evolution}} of the Parrot to include common engine cowling, nose gear and rudder assemblies with the PS-28 Cruiser, plus the addition of rear windows, larger elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab,</b> removal of rudder horn and the empty weight was reduced. First flown 6 December 2010.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Typical <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> on ailerons, rudder and elevator. Aileron and rudder <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> are {{not very}} common on light {{training}} aircraft.|$|R
5|$|The {{control system}} was revised and <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> were fitted to the elevators.|$|R
25|$|Control {{devices such}} as a rudder, <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> or {{stabilizing}} fins may be fitted.|$|R
25|$|As {{well the}} new engines, the AX2000 differs chiefly from the AX3 {{in having a}} {{completely}} double surface wing of reduced area and modified structure, a change of alloy for the main keel beam, a revised and lightened fuselage with new undercarriage, an increased fuel capacity {{and the addition of}} an elevator anti-balance <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b>|$|E
25|$|On June 4, 2007, a Cessna Citation II crashed after {{reporting}} a runaway <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b> The pilot issued a distress signal {{within five minutes}} after taking off. The plane then crashed into Lake Michigan two miles (3km) off shore. The plane was carrying an organ transplant team from the University of Michigan back to Willow Run Airport. There was a crew of two and four passengers aboard. All six died.|$|E
25|$|The Renegade {{fuselage}} {{is constructed}} of aluminium square tubing extrusions and fittings, fastened with Avex rivets. The turtle deck and engine cowling {{are made from}} fibreglass. The fin, rudder, horizontal stabilizer and elevators are built from aluminum tubing and channel sections. The tail is wire-braced. A manual <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> mounted on the elevator is an option. The landing gear is of conventional configuration and incorporates bungee suspension. The welded engine mount is 4130 steel.|$|E
25|$|The rudder and {{elevators}} were of {{the same}} construction as the ailerons. <b>Trim</b> <b>tabs</b> were adjustable from the cockpit.|$|R
50|$|Another unusual control feature, {{allowing}} for independent trimming in pitch and yaw, are the independent <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> on the flaps.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trim</b> <b>tabs</b> {{are most}} found on cruisers, sport fishing boats and center console boats ranging from 20 feet and up.|$|R
25|$|The third prototype, piloted by Kudrin, lost {{horizontal}} <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> in flight; {{the pilot}} managed {{to land the}} plane but refused to fly on SPB (D) prototypes anymore. On 29 July 1940 the project was cancelled; tests required for proper crash examination were not completed. The government preferred to build twin-engined dive bombers on a simplified Petlyakov VI-100 platform, – the conversion, named Petlyakov Pe-2, took over the roles originally intended for the SPB (D).|$|E
25|$|The {{undercarriage}} of the Ka-2 comprises a large rubber-sprung wooden skid {{under the}} forward fuselage {{in front of}} a non-retractable semi recessed mainwheel, as well as a steel rubber-sprung tail-skid. Conventional controls are fitted with ailerons on each wingtip trailing edge, elevator with anti-balance <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> behind the tailplane and rudder aft of the fin. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, at 38% chord and approx ⅓ span, open out above and below the wing to provide approach control.|$|E
25|$|With the {{information}} obtained from Learmonth’s radio commentary the problem plaguing the Australian-built Beauforts was {{traced to a}} component in the elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> actuating unit. All the RAAF Beauforts were grounded until they were modified to eliminate the problem. Learmonth is credited with supplying the vital information that was necessary to identify the problem and eventually solve it. A secret World War II landing field at Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, known only by the code-name Potshot, was eventually developed into a permanent military base and named RAAF Learmonth in honour of Wing Commander Charles Learmonth.|$|E
5000|$|All {{aircraft}} {{must have}} a system for ensuring trim in the pitch axis, though methods other than <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> may be used. Alternatives include: ...|$|R
50|$|Boats with {{outboard}} engines will often have <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> {{attached to the}} lower unit of the engine. These are used to adjust the pitch attitude of the boat while underway. Changes in boat speed or weight placement will usually require the <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> to be adjusted to keep the boat at a comfortable and efficient pitch attitude. This reduces {{the work of the}} engine by reducing the amount of manual control necessary, as well as providing for greater efficiency by keeping the ship in the ideal orientation for the conditions.|$|R
50|$|Multi-engined {{aircraft}} {{often have}} <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> on the rudder {{to reduce the}} pilot effort required to keep the aircraft straight in situations of asymmetrical thrust, such as single engine operations.|$|R
25|$|Vim: Designed in 1939 by Olin Stephens who {{considered}} the possibilities given by {{every aspect of}} the rules and produced a very fast boat. Vim had numerous innovative features including a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> on the rudder, two-speed winches and a lighter mast made of Duralumin (a form of aluminium used in the aircraft industry). Vim is considered a benchmark design which was continually refined over her racing career. In 1939 Vim came to the UK and won 19 races out of 28. The next generations of 12 Metres designed and built 20 years after Vim was launched still found Vim extremely difficult to beat in competition.|$|E
25|$|The PT-22 {{fuel system}} {{consists}} of a single tank mounted forward of the front cockpit. Fuel is gravity fed to the carburetor. The oil system is a dry-sump type, with all oil stored in a tank located on the front side of the firewall in the upper section of the fuselage. The wing flaps are mechanically operated from a lever located {{on the left side}} of each cockpit. Adjustable elevator trim is provided via an elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> controllable from a handwheel mounted {{on the left side of}} each cockpit. In its original configuration, the aircraft was not equipped with an electrical system. Hydraulic brakes are provided for each wheel, controllable via the rudder pedals in each cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The {{exact number}} of prototypes built is not clear, some sources say three, {{but at least}} two {{appear to have been}} built, based on {{photographic}} evidence. The prototype was first flown in 1945 and the engine's torque, coupled with the short rear fuselage, resulted in poor longitudinal stability characteristics. To correct the problem the second prototype had the rear fuselage lengthened , the area of the vertical tail was increased and the rudder was given a <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b> These changes were successful in improving the aircraft's flight characteristics, but the engine proved troublesome and prolonged flight testing into 1946. Its problems proved intractable and the program was canceled in the summer of 1946.|$|E
50|$|Plywood-skinned low-set {{tailplane}} and {{fin with}} fabric-covered built-up wooden elevators and rudder {{are at the}} tail end of the fuselage, the elevators fitted with <b>trim</b> <b>tabs,</b> one for longitudinal trim and one to compensate for pitch-up with operation of the airbrakes.|$|R
5000|$|The Merchantman had {{a similar}} boom mounted tail to the Aerovan, with an almost {{straight}} leading edge to the horizontal stabiliser, carrying elevators with <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> on a strongly tapered trailing edge. There were three vertical surfaces, one central with a rudder and two endplate fins with large moveable surfaces that acted as <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b> [...] The outer fins had the same shape found on many Miles aircraft: symmetrical and elliptical at the top but blunted below. The Aerovan's central fin was semi-elliptical, but the initial arrangement on the Merchantman continued the ellipse below the boom. This form was changed quite soon after the first flight tests, when a dorsal fin above the boom replaced the lower surface.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> {{significantly}} reduces pilots' workload during continuous maneuvers (e.g. sustained {{climb to}} altitude after takeoff or descent prior to landing), {{allowing them to}} focus their attention on other tasks such as traffic avoidance or communication with air traffic control.|$|R
500|$|On {{learning}} of the crash at nearby Seven-Mile Beach employees of Australian National Airways raced from Cambridge aerodrome to lend assistance. [...] About 11:15pm the rear fuselage came to the surface a short distance off-shore. Donald Butler, one of the employees, feared the air hostess might still be trapped in her seat {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. [...] He took a length of rope, swam out to the floating piece of structure, attached the rope to the tailwheel and then swam back to the beach. [...] A motor lorry was used to drag the rear fuselage ashore but there was no-one inside. The right tailplane, elevator and <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> were almost undamaged. [...] The elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> was still set appropriately for a shallow climb after take-off.|$|E
2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a control surface (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a control surface changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> acts as a servo tab. [...] Because the center of pressure of the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is further away from the axis of rotation of the control surface than the center of pressure of the control surface, the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the control surface. The position of the control surface on its axis will change until the torque from the control surface and the trim surface balance each other.|$|E
2500|$|The A1 is a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. The wing has straight edges, with sweep only on {{the leading}} edge, and squared tips. [...] It is a single piece structure of light alloy construction, with Frise type mass balanced ailerons which are fabric covered aft of the spar; a ground adjustable <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is fitted on the port side. [...] There are no flaps. [...] The empennage is also straight tapered and of similar construction to the wing, though the rudder is fabric covered. There is a small dorsal fin. [...] All rear control surfaces are horn balanced; the tailplane's incidence can be adjusted {{on the ground and}} the starboard elevator has a ground adjustable <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Monocoach's {{horizontal}} tail {{was similar}} in plan {{to that of}} the wing and its vertical tail was rounded, with a large fin. The rear control surfaces were all balanced and fitted with <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b> All rear surfaces had steel structures and were fabric covered.|$|R
50|$|On many aircraft, the {{tailplane}} assembly {{consists of}} a fixed surface fitted with a hinged aft elevator surface. <b>Trim</b> <b>tabs</b> {{may be used to}} relieve pilot input forces; conversely in some cases, such as small aircraft with all-moving stabilizers, anti-servo tabs are used to increase these forces.|$|R
5000|$|The Couach fast {{interceptor}} {{boats are}} equipped with twin [...] MAN engines driving through a complete Twin Disc propulsion system consisting of MGX-5114A QuickShift transmissions, ASD11 Arneson Surface Drives with BCS <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> and EC300 electronic controls, and can achieve {{a top speed of}} 50 kn.|$|R
2500|$|In {{its report}} the panel stated the {{accident}} {{was caused by the}} aircraft being loaded so its centre of gravity was behind the rear limit. [...] The report also stated that incorrect setting of the elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> may have been a contributory cause.|$|E
2500|$|The Antilope {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{turboprop}} powered light aircraft. [...] Apart from its engine, it was a conventional all-metal low-wing machine. [...] The cantilever wing was built around two spars and was a semi-monocoque structure, carrying unslotted ailerons and electrically powered, single slot Fowler flaps. The fuselage was also of semi-monocoque construction. [...] The tail unit included a variable incidence tailplane and a rudder with a <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Kittiwake II differs chiefly {{in having}} two {{side-by-side}} seating {{and a more}} powerful 130hp (97kW) Continental O-240. It is longer, heavier and has an increased span which increases the wing area by about 8%. [...] The fuselage is wider and the small dorsal fillet of the Kittiwake I gone; the rudder gained a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> and the elevators full width tabs. It first flew on 19 March 1972.|$|E
50|$|The Molniya-1 six-seat {{aircraft}} is a three surface {{design with}} a forward balanced canard surface and a square section fuselage with a Vedeneyev M14P nine cylinder radial engine in the rear. Twin booms carry fins with balanced and <b>trim</b> <b>tabbed</b> rudders {{and a high}} set tailplane, similarly tabbed and balanced.|$|R
50|$|The {{tail unit}} was metal framed and fabric covered. The {{tailplane}} was externally braced and the elevators carried <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b> The fin was straight edged but the rudder, which {{extended to the}} bottom of the fuselage and worked in a cut-out between the elevators, had a full, curved trailing edge.|$|R
5000|$|During World War I, Flettner {{developed}} the servo tab / anti-servo tab. [...] The servo tab {{evolved into the}} [...] "trim tab" [...] which is still in use on all airplanes and many large vessels. [...] <b>Trim</b> <b>tabs</b> are extremely useful in moving large rudders on vessels with vastly reduced power.|$|R
