5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E

500|$|According to Inglis, [...] "Love You To" [...] is [...] "defined" [...] by {{the interplay}} between sitar and tabla. Bhagwat later {{recalled}} of his involvement: [...] "George <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> he wanted and I tuned the tabla with him. He suggested I play something in the Ravi Shankar style, 16-beats, though he agreed that I should improvise. Indian music is all improvisation." [...] After rehearsing the song together many times, Harrison and Bhagwat recorded the sitar and tabla parts onto the vocal and guitar performance taped earlier that day.|$|E
500|$|Cudi {{commented that}} the way the song was {{recorded}} {{was similar to the}} way prior collaborations between the two were recorded; West will bounce ideas off of other writers and gauge their reaction before going forward with any of his own ideas. In an interview with MTV Cudi commented, [...] "that's always our collab formula, and that's just how 'Gorgeous' came about. He just kind of <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> he was trying to say, I threw out some words, we rearranged words, and we came out with a bunch of different options before we come up with the hook." ...|$|E
500|$|During the visit, Plavšić {{requested}} that Arkan transfer control of Bijeljina to the JNA. Arkan refused, citing unfinished business, {{and said he}} would target Bosanski Brod next. Plavšić consequently withdrew her request and commended Arkan for [...] "protecting" [...] Bijeljina's Serbs from the Bosniaks. She called him a [...] "Serb hero... who was prepared to give his life for his people", adding that [...] "we need such people". She then thanked and kissed Arkan in public to which the local members of the SDS responded with [...] "shouts of approval". In a conversation with Cedric Thornberry, a United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) representative, she described Bijeljina as a [...] "liberated" [...] town. Abdić was initially turned back at gunpoint, but was later able to enter. He was then kept in custody by Arkan until Plavšić arrived to release him. [...] "Bijeljina was practically empty," [...] he recalled. [...] "I met with the local authorities, they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> had happened, but there wasn't a single Muslim there, so we couldn't discuss the problem as a whole. Muslims didn't answer our appeal. They were too scared to come out, and specially scared to talk about it at all."

500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you going to do with an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E
500|$|Stalmaster {{convinced}} Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve {{stunned the}} director and producers, but {{he was told to}} wear a [...] "muscle suit" [...] to produce the desired muscular physique. Reeve refused, undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming. Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both Superman and Superman II, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for Superman I. However, Reeve felt, [...] "'Superman' brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face." [...] Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. [...] "I was not happy about it because the producers never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> they had in mind," [...] East commented. [...] "It was done without my permission {{but it turned out to}} be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later." [...] East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. He applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to facially resemble Reeve.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence, and filmed in Malibu, California, {{during the week of}} October 29, 2002. Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, [...] " [...] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> the song was about, but in a [...] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it". Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. [...] "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does." [...] The music video for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was released onto the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003.|$|E

Wilkie at the time had no idea what had gone on, as he was talking to United's Andy Cole at the time: [...] "It was only in the dressing room that one of the assistants <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> he (Cantona) had done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ned {{loved the}} Navy {{as a man}} might love his own family.

He served with distinction approaching perfection and, like his father, would then write about the things he'd seen and done... More than once I spoke with him about the psychological aspects of combat, and every time he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> I needed to know, always from his own rich experiences. Ned was a serious student of history -- he wrote several splendid books on this subject -- and of human nature. What he didn't know had never happened.|$|E

First I hear this, I couldn't believe, I said no way, not my man Torque. That cracker bleeding out in the basement, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what's</b> what and he got no reason to lie. My brain ready to pop. It's too whack, nobody'd make this up. Nobody would never say that you..." [...] However, Torque blacks out, and when he awakens, Miles is dead. Blackmore then contacts Torque, telling him to come to the drowning pool beneath the prison's factory. As Torque heads there, he is attacked by Foundation soldiers backed up by a helicopter piloted by Jordan, who was lying about her men betraying her. Torque defeats the soldiers and kills Jordan.|$|R
2500|$|On August 14, United States Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) {{stated that}} [...] "militarization {{of the police}} {{escalated}} the protesters' response." [...] St. Louis Chief of Police Sam Dotson stated {{he would not have}} employed military-style policing such as that which transpired. According to Chief Dotson, [...] "My gut <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> I was seeing were not tactics that I would use in the city and I would never put officers in situations that I would not do myself." [...] Another reason Dotson did not want the city and county police to collaborate was because of the history of racial profiling by police in that county. In an email to a St. Louis Alderman who brought up concerns of racial profiling, he wrote: [...] "I agree and removed our tactical assistance. We did not send tactical resources to Ferguson on Tuesday or Wednesday. Our only assistance was that of four traffic officers to help divert traffic and keep both pedestrians and motorists safe. On Thursday we will have no officers assisting Ferguson." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of her career, Blackwell played mostly soubrette roles and has since moved more into the lyric coloratura soprano repertoire. Blackwell has commented that she felt opera houses were initially uncertain as to how to cast her because of her musical theater background. She said, [...] "They saw me in the lighter repertoire and my voice teacher and I saw me in the lyric repertoire." [...] In addition, her small frame and 5'1" [...] stature in combination with girlish looks made her a perfect physical casting choice for soubrette roles. It wasn't until Blackwell studied in Busseto with Carlo Bergonzi, Renata Tebaldi, and Sylvia Barrachi in the late 1980s that she finally was given direction into the lyric coloratura repertoire. Blackwell recalls, [...] "At {{the end of the program}} Mrs. Barrachi and Renata Tebaldi sat down with me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> roles I should sing if I wanted to have a major career. Having those two women take the time to talk to me made a big difference. I have always been the type of individual that takes all the information and then makes the decision that's appropriate for me. I can be very stubborn. I really do have to credit those two women for saving me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
