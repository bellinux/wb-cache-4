The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) subsequently refused U.S. Senate subpoenas for four USAF officers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> the Senate investigation, which was never publicly released.

Thus, This Week were unable to present their conclusions to a member of the government and broadcast their reaction, as was the usual practice for closing such a documentary. In place of such a conclusion, Bolton approached George Carman—a leading London lawyer specialising in human rights issues—who agreed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> the programme.|$|E
5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He declined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control of {{the running of the}} club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement {{that he would not be}} sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E

25|$|When Music from Big Pink was {{released}} in 1968, The Band initially avoided media attention, and discouraged Capitol Records from promotional efforts. They also did not immediately pursue touring to support the album, and declined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> a year. The resulting mystery surrounding the group led to speculation in the underground press. Music from Big Pink received excellent reviews, and the album influenced many well-known musicians of the period.|$|E

A number of passengers also came forward <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> the inquiry upon seeing the advertisement the board had placed in the newspapers. One of the key aims of the inquiry was to establish whether or not acetylene gas, which had been used in lighting, had caused the fire.

The White Sox retired his uniform number 35 in 2010, and unveiled a statue of him at U.S. Cellular Field in 2011. He is now a commentator for NBC Sports Chicago White Sox broadcasts.

For example, though Bill Belichick coached the New England Patriots to three Super Bowls {{in four years}} (2001, 2003, and 2004) he was only interviewed for the episode on the 2004 team. A handful of subjects were interviewed twice: Bill Curry (1966 Green Bay Packers and 1970 Baltimore Colts), Joe Greene (1974 and 1978 Pittsburgh Steelers), Eli Manning and Tom Coughlin, (2007 and 2011 New York Giants), Ray Lewis (2000 and 2012 Baltimore Ravens), and Peyton Manning (2006 Indianapolis Colts and 2015 Denver Broncos).

No one from Corwood Industries is represented on screen, but the label did suggest several people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> the movie, including music critics Phil Milstein and Gary Pig Gold, and Katy Vine. Corwood's recommendation of Vine for the documentary is seen as essentially endorsing the contents and confirming {{the authenticity of the}} Texas Monthly interview.

Jack's wife, Wendy, tells a doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he dislocated Danny's shoulder following a binge.|$|E

One such student, Shirley Blaney, persuaded Salinger <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> the high school page of The Daily Eagle, the city paper. Nonetheless, after Blaney's interview appeared prominently in the newspaper's editorial section, Salinger cut off all contact with the high schoolers without explanation. He was also seen less frequently around town, meeting only one close friend—jurist Learned Hand—with any regularity. He also began to publish with less frequency. After the 1953 publication of Nine Stories, he published only four stories {{through the rest of}} the decade; two in 1955 and one each in 1957 and 1959.|$|E

She then moved to Los Angeles, where she spent 18 months living off her savings trying to get auditions. In those 18 months, her only jobs were a single commercial and a job interviewing LA-based film actors for Australian television. In 2001, her lawyer informed her {{that she would have to}} travel to Sydney, Australia <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> her green card. On the day she was due to fly back to Australia, her agent informed her of an audition for the British television series Cold Feet, whose producer was looking for an Australian actress to become a new main cast member. Two weeks later she had moved to Manchester, England and was doing script read-throughs with the rest of the cast. Her character, Jo Ellison, appeared in all episodes of the fourth and fifth series.
