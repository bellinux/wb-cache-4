5|$|The cost of {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>can</b> be inflated to contemporary values using {{changes in the}} British Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This measures the social cost {{of construction}} or investment {{as a proportion of}} the economy's total output of goods and services. This allows consideration of the equivalent social impact in current terms: how much contemporary Britons would need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy. As of 2012, the figures are updated using data from 2010, the latest year for which data is available.|$|E
5|$|If {{the church}} from the {{marginal}} note is equated with the Round Church, {{then it can}} be conclusively dated {{to no more than}} a few years before 907. While <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>can</b> be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, some scholars have suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of at least part of the church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church. The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.|$|E

5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government, Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they have to cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates {{have to make sure that}} <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>can</b> fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates have to expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|There was major {{restoration}} {{work done}} to the church in 1886, and {{a large amount of}} the Chancel woodwork dates from this period. During the restoration the east window was also replaced; it now depicts the stylised form of Saint Oswald, flanked on either side by Saint Aidan, and Saint Cuthbert, both Christian saints of the same era, and who helped him in missionary work in the Kingdom of Northumbria. These windows are directly opposite the western window, above the font {{at the other end of}} the church, which depicts the queen at the time, Queen Victoria. Further modern additions to <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>can</b> be seen in the bell turret and organ chamber, as well as the south porch, which is currently the sole congregational entrance to the church. The church uses an electric organ during services.|$|E
25|$|Politics has a {{fundamental}} ethical dimension {{because it is}} first and foremost a service to man. <b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>can</b> and must remind men—and in particular those who govern—of their ethical duties {{for the good of the}} whole of society.

25|$|Congregationalism is {{more easily}} {{identified}} as a movement than a single denomination, given its distinguishing commitment to the complete autonomy of the local congregation. The idea that each distinct congregation fully constitutes the visible Body of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>can,</b> however, be traced to John Wycliffe and the Lollard movement, which followed Wycliffe's removal from teaching authority in the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E

25|$|The Church of St John the Baptist {{is located}} on the site of a Roman temple, and was {{mentioned}} in 1182. It holds a baptismal font from 1587. The church was destroyed during the First World War, but was rebuilt in 1923 to the design of Armand Lemay, an architect from Lille. It consists of a nave and two aisles. In the choir, the stained glass windows of Pierre Turpin, master glass lillois retrace the life of St. John the Baptist. A 1/50th scale model of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>can</b> be seen inside the church which was made in 1951.|$|E
25|$|By tradition, the Orthodox Church, {{when faced}} with issues that are larger than a single bishop can resolve, holds a local council. The bishops and such others as may attend convene (as St. Paul called the Corinthians to do) to seek {{the mind of the}} church. A council's {{declarations}} or edicts then reflect its consensus (if one can be found). An ecumencial council is only called for issues of such import or difficulty or pervasiveness that smaller councils are insufficient to address them. Ecumenical councils' declarations and canons carry binding weight by virtue of their representation across the whole church, by which the mind of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>can</b> be readily seen. However, not all issues are so difficult as to require an ecumenical council to resolve. Some doctrines or decisions, not defined in a formal statement or proclaimed officially, nevertheless are held by the Church unshakably and unanimously without internal disturbance, and these, also reflecting the mind of the church, are just as firmly irrevocable as a formal declaration of an ecumenical council. Lack of formality does not imply lack of authority within Holy Tradition. An example of such unanimity {{can be found in the}} acceptance in the 5th century of the lists of books that comprise Holy Scripture, a true canon without official stamp.|$|E

25|$|The {{president}} of the Community of Christ is sometimes referred to by the titles of Prophet or Prophet-President. The {{president of}} the church acts as a prophet when bringing occasional inspired counsel or inspired documents to the church. These are usually brief passages of text which bring encouragement, counsel and direction to the church. When an inspired document is presented to the World Conference by the {{president of the}} church, an elaborate review process takes place. Each quorum of the church and several caucuses review the document and vote upon it. The quorums typically vote heavily in favor of the documents and sometimes unanimously. Debate is allowed, however, and the body has been known to refer the inspired document back to the president for further reflection or for clarification. When the document comes to the floor of the World Conference for debate, the president retires from the room to allow for more impartial consideration. The World Conference may vote to include the document as a new section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which is regarded as scripture by the denomination. If the delegates at the World Conference do approve an inspired document, it is the custom of the church to then have a courtesy vote, which is opened to all non-delegates attending the conference. This is the only time non-delegates are permitted to vote on World Conference business. Through this action, the president of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>can</b> be assured that a large representation of the church membership supports the inspired document.|$|E

Outside of the bodega, crumbling walls, open yards and part of the Gothic roof of the church are visible.

500|$|The Grade II listed Church of St James, Milnrow's Anglican parish church, {{was built}} in 1869 and is {{dedicated}} to James the Apostle. It {{is part of the}} Church of England and lies within the Diocese of Manchester. The origins of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>can</b> be traced to a chantry built by the Byrons in the year 1400. When that baronial family moved from Milnrow to another of their homes following the Wars of the Roses, the local population was left without a place of worship and a chapel was constructed by the River Beal to serve this community. This structure existed until the 1790s, when a [...] "poorly designed" [...] chapel was erected and consecrated; however, due to structural weaknesses, that church was demolished in 1814. Following an interim period when a [...] "plain building" [...] was used for worship, the present church building was built and consecrated by the Bishop of Manchester on 21 August 1869.|$|E
500|$|In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey {{discusses}} grace, {{calling it}} [...] "our last best word". The book's thesis is that, although people crave grace {{and it is}} centrally important to the gospel, many local churches ignore grace {{in their quest to}} exterminate immorality. Yancey uses the word [...] "ungrace" [...] to describe actions that fail to demonstrate grace. According to the author, the greatest gift the Christian Church can give the world is grace, but the church sometimes offers ungrace instead. Yancey writes that there are secular analogues to most Christian activities benefiting the world, such as social justice work and community service, but that [...] "grace is theological; it comes from God. It's one thing <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>can</b> offer that isn't found anywhere else". He describes his experiences attempting to make grace part of the way he lived and not just part of his theology. Yancey quotes Christian counselor David Seamands: [...] "The two major causes of most emotional problems among Evangelical Christians are these: the failure to understand, receive and live out God's unconditional grace and forgiveness; and the failure to give out that unconditional love, forgiveness, and grace to other people".|$|E
