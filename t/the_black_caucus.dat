25|$|What {{eventually}} led to Hamilton being defeated for re-election in 1984, was a 1980 reapportionment battle against <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Caucus,</b> who wanted the reapportionment figured to their advantage. Hamilton felt so strongly they were wrong, that she ended up testifying before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 1982. <b>The</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Caucus</b> were so angered by what they {{believed to be a}} betrayal by Hamilton, that they put Mable Thomas against her in the primary. Hamilton lost to Thomas in the run-off election and never held elected office again.|$|E

500|$|While Sam and Bruno are {{concerned}} about the loyalty of a powerful California union official (Sandoval), Toby and Josh are preparing for a meeting with the congressional opposition to re-negotiate the estate tax—or the [...] "death tax" [...] as the Republicans have labeled it—but are then surprised by a last-minute cancellation. It soon becomes clear that the Republicans are planning to repeal the estate tax altogether, and might have the votes to do so. An attempt to win over <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>caucus,</b> led by Congressman Mark Richardson (Barry), fails. At a loss over what to do, an initiative comes from unexpected quarters. The previously over-cautious political strategist, Doug Wegland, suggests the president responds by doing something he has never done before: veto the bill.|$|E
