These operations, conducted by Wehrmacht troops as well as SS, were bloody, although not unusual by German Eastern Front standards. In conjunction with <b>the</b> <b>ruthless</b> scorched earth policies he followed during his retreats, they would lead to the Soviet Union's declaring him a war criminal.|$|E
5|$|While {{the leaders}} of Congress languished in jail, the other parties {{supported}} the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications flailed at <b>the</b> <b>ruthless</b> suppression of Congress, but it had little control over events. At {{the end of the}} war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.|$|E

5|$|Sarmiento {{grew up in}} a poor but {{politically}} active family that paved the way for much of his future accomplishments. Between 1843 and 1850 he was frequently in exile, and wrote in both Chile and in Argentina. His greatest literary achievement was Facundo, a critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas, that Sarmiento wrote while working for the newspaper El Progreso during his exile in Chile. The book brought him far more than just literary recognition; he expended his efforts and energy on the war against dictatorships, specifically that of Rosas, and contrasted enlightened Europea world where, in his eyes, democracy, social services, and intelligent thought were valuedwith the barbarism of the gaucho and especially the caudillo, <b>the</b> <b>ruthless</b> strongmen of nineteenth-century Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund III {{subsequently}} {{rejected the}} compromise solution and demanded the tsar's throne for himself, {{which would mean}} complete subjugation of Russia, and as such {{was rejected by the}} bulk of the Russian society. Sigismund's refusal and demands only intensified the chaos, as the Swedes proposed their own candidate and took over Veliki Novgorod. The result of this situation and of <b>the</b> <b>ruthless</b> Commonwealth occupation in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia was the 1611 popular Russian anti-Polish uprising, heavy fighting in Moscow and a siege of the Polish garrison occupying the Kremlin.|$|E
5|$|The Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation, {{otherwise}} known as the IMC, started out small, in natural resource extraction industries, under the name Hammond Engineering. Increasing demand for Titan manufacturing materials, combined with Hammond's market-cornering planetary survey technology and map database rights, contributed to explosive growth for the company. Over {{the course of a}} century, a series of acquisitions, mergers, and re-brandings lead to the transformation of Hammond Engineering into <b>the</b> <b>ruthless</b> commercial empire that is the IMC. With the Frontier’s valuable shipping lanes and vast planetary resources ripe for exploitation, the IMC is dedicated to maximizing profits and shareholder wealth, using the legal application of force when necessary.|$|E

5|$|Colonial {{rule in the}} Congo {{began in}} the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, {{frustrated}} by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. By the turn of the century, however, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and <b>the</b> <b>ruthless</b> system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.|$|E

5|$|In 2072, {{after the}} Citadel Station's demise, TriOptimum's {{attempts}} {{to cover up}} the incident were exposed to the media and the corporation was brought up on charges from multiple individuals and companies for the ensuing scandal. The virus developed there killed the station's population; <b>the</b> <b>ruthless</b> malevolent A.I supercomputer named SHODAN controlled, and eventually destroyed the Citadel Station in hopes of enslaving and destroying humanity. After a massive number of trials, the company went bankrupt and their operations were shut down. The United Nations Nominate (UNN), a UN successor, was established to combat the malevolence and corruption of power-hungry corporations, including TriOptimum. Artificial intelligence was reduced to most rudimentary tasks in order to prevent the creation of another SHODAN-like malevolent AI, and development of new technologies was halted. Meanwhile, the hacker, who became the most famous person in the world, vanished from public eye.|$|E

5|$|In the 15 {{years since}} he had left Red River, his {{megalomania}} had grown greater than ever. His ungovernable rages, delusions of grandeur, messianic claims, and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme; but these violent excesses {{were not the only}} symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline. He had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities. His sense of direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal. He showed, at intervals, a cynical selfishness and <b>the</b> <b>ruthless</b> cupidity.... although in public he professed that his sole aim was the redress of the Métis grievances, and private he was quite ready to promise that if the government made him a satisfactory personal payment of a few thousand dollars he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement the federal authorities desired, and would quietly leave Canada forever.|$|E
5|$|The main villain of Crimson Echoes is King Zeal, revived by Lavos {{through the}} Frozen Flame. Confused and {{saddened by the}} loss of his kingdom, he is easily {{manipulated}} by Lavos, who uses him to attempt revenge on Crono and his friends. He later learns of his deception, and seeks to dominate Lavos and recreate his kingdom through unmatched temporal power. While under Lavos's influence, he recruits Dalton and Kasmir to his cause. Kasmir is an illusionist who served under Magus in the Mystic War. King Zeal gives him the Masamune, and he assumes leadership of the Mystics after 600A.D. Other foes come from the Reptite timeline, an alternate universe temporarily brought into existence by King Zeal's meddling. They number the Dragon God—a Reptite artificial intelligence created in an alternate timeline—and the Xamoltan time travelers, who were used by King Zeal and survive into the restored human world. The party also visit 1A.D., the era of the founding of Guardia. There, they meet Cedric the Executor, <b>the</b> <b>ruthless</b> first King of Guardia, as well as Antaeus, the ancestor of Porre.|$|E
5|$|The Outlaw Star manga {{series and}} {{animated}} television series are paced differently. The anime episodes often involve Gene and his comrades taking on various jobs or missions to fund their ship's massive maintenance costs. Throughout their travels, the crew often encounters Ronald MacDougall and Harry MacDougall, {{a pair of}} bounty hunters {{responsible for the death}} of Gene's father. Ronald acts as a rival to Gene, while Harry wishes to form a bond with Melfina, a bio-android like himself, who instead develops strong feelings for Gene. The crew also contends with others that learn of the Outlaw Star's connection to the Galactic Leyline. They are Nguyen Khan, a scientist wishing to gain omniscience through the Leyline; and Lord Hazanko, the leader of <b>the</b> <b>ruthless</b> assassin organization the Anten Seven that seek the Leyline to gain ultimate power. The series climaxes when all parties meet on the physical plane of the Leyline. In the end, Ron MacDougall retreats, saved by a computer copy of his brother Harry (who is killed trying to protect Melfina from Hazanko), Khan is integrated into the Leyline as data, Gene reveals to Melfina that he is in love with her and frees her from the Leyline by making it their shared wish to be together forever, and Hazanko is eventually defeated by the Outlaw Star crewmembers. Once the conflict comes to a close, Gene and his friends return to Sentinel III and go their separate ways, but ultimately reunite to continue their adventures together.|$|E
