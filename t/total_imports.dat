25|$|The {{effect of}} the 1974–85 period's {{industrialization}} on the balance of trade was significant. The balance of trade moved from an average deficit of US$3.4billion in the 1974–76 period to an average surplus of US$10.7billion in the 1983–85 period. In 1985 the share of manufactures (processed and semi-processed) of total exports reached 66 percent, and between 1971–75 and 1978–83 the share of basic input imports in <b>total</b> <b>imports</b> declined from 32.3% to 19.2%. The recession and stagnation of the early 1980s {{had a role in}} reducing imports. However, import substitution was also important, as demonstrated by the few years of the 1980s that experienced a significant growth in GDP while the trade surplus was maintained.|$|E

25|$|By 1952 the Bolivian {{economy had}} {{deteriorated}} even further. The {{governments of the}} sexenio had been reluctant to increase taxes for the upper class and to reduce social spending, resulting in high inflation. The tin industry had stagnated since the Great Depression, despite short revivals during World War II. Ore content had declined, and the richer veins were depleted, increasing tin production costs; at the same time, tin prices on the international market fell. A disagreement with the United States over tin prices halted exports temporarily and caused a decline in income that further hurt the economy. The agricultural sector lacked capital, and food imports had increased, reaching 19% of <b>total</b> <b>imports</b> in 1950. Land was unequally distributed - 92% of the cultivable land was held by estates of 1,000 hectares or more.|$|E
25|$|Between 1980 and 1983, the taka {{sustained}} {{a decline of}} some 50 percent because of a deterioration in Bangladesh's balance of payments. Between 1985 and 1987, the taka was adjusted in frequent incremental steps, stabilising again around 12 percent lower in real terms against the US dollar, {{but at the same}} time narrowing the difference between the official rate and the preferential secondary rate from 15 percent to 7.5 percent. Accompanying this structural adjustment was an expansion in trade conducted at the secondary rate, to 53 percent of total exports and 28 percent of <b>total</b> <b>imports.</b> In mid-1987, the official rate was relatively stable, approaching less than ৳31 to US$1.

25|$|The {{primary energy}} {{consumption}} in India is the third biggest after China and USA with 5.5% global share in 2016. The total {{primary energy consumption}} from crude oil (212.7 Mtoe; 29.38%), natural gas (45.1 Mtoe; 6.23%), coal (411.9 Mtoe; 56.90%), nuclear energy (8.6 Mtoe; 1.19%), hydro electricity (29.1 Mtoe; 4.01%) and renewable power (16.5 Mtoe; 2.28%) is 723.9 Mtoe (excluding traditional biomass use) in the calendar year 2016. In 2013, India's net imports are nearly 144.3 million tons of crude oil, 16 Mtoe of LNG and 95 Mtoe coal totalling to 255.3 Mtoe of primary energy which is equal to 42.9% of total primary energy consumption. About 70% of India's electricity generation capacity is from fossil fuels. India is largely dependent on fossil fuel imports to meet its energy demands – by 2030, India's dependence on energy imports is expected to exceed 53% of the country's total energy consumption. In 2009-10, the country imported 159.26 million tonnes of crude oil which amounts to 80% of its domestic crude oil consumption and 31% of the country's <b>total</b> <b>imports</b> are oil imports. By the end of calendar year 2015, India has become a power surplus country with huge power generation capacity idling for want of electricity demand. India ranks second after China in renewables production with 208.7 Mtoe in 2014.|$|E

Total mineral imports, which were mostly petroleum and derivatives, however, increased by about 34.8% to $3.1 billion compared with $2.3 billion in 2005. <b>Total</b> <b>imports</b> increased by about 21.5% to $14.7 billion compared with $12.1 billion in 2005 and generated a surplus of $2.6 billion compared with $5.3 billion in 2005. In 2006, the United States (34%), China (11%), Chile (7%), Canada (6%), and Japan (5%) were Peru’s leading mineral consumers. The United States, China, and Chile were the main importers of gold, copper, and molybdenum, respectively. Peru sold about 6% of its exports to {{other members of the}} Mercado Común Andino (ANCOM), whose members were Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela; about 3% was sold to the Mercado Común del Cono Sur (MERCOSUR) countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and associate members Bolivia and Chile; and 15% was sold to other Latin American countries. Peruvian mineral exports could increase if the negotiations between ANCOM and MERCOSUR lead to a South American free trade agreement and owing to the free trade agreement signed recently (2006) between the United States and Peru.|$|E
