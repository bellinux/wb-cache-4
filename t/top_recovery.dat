40|$|We try to {{understand}} the role of technological change and diffusion of energy efficient technologies in order to explain the trend of energy intensity developments in the German steel industry. We selected six key energy efficient technologies and collected data to derive their diffusion since their introduction in Germany. Since all technologies have been applied in Germany for more than 30 years we would expect complete diffusion. We found complete diffusion only for basic oxygen furnaces and continuous casting. Newer technologies (i. e. basic oxygen furnace gas <b>recovery,</b> <b>top</b> pressure <b>recovery</b> turbine, coke dry quenching and pulverized coal injection) diffused quicker in the initial phase but then diffusion slowed down. Key improvements in energy efficiency are due to electric arc furnaces (24 %), basic oxygen furnaces (12 %), and continuous casting (6 %) between 1958 and 2012. The contribution of <b>top</b> pressure <b>recovery</b> turbines, pulverized coal injection and basic oxygen furnaces gas recovery accounts in total of about 3 %. If the selected technologies were diffused completely, the future energy consumption could be reduced by 4. 5 % compared to 2012.

40|$|AbstractHow to {{understand}} the top coal caving process and increase the <b>top</b> coal <b>recovery</b> ratio {{is one of the}} urgent problems to be resolved for the longwall top coal caving technology. The paper mainly studies a new theory and technique of top coal caving with vibration. The vibration device is mounted on the shield beam of the top coal caving support. The laboratory experiment and the numerical simulation were adopted in the study. The Distinct Element Method (DEM) numerical software (PFC 2 D) is used for the numerical simulation. Finally, the technique is applied to the 5209 top coal caving working face. Based on the experiment, the numerical simulation and the practice, the vibration can easily destroy the arch structure which is formed during the top coal caving process. The parameters about when the arch structure would be formed during the top coal caving process are obtained. The movement of the top coal caving process under the vibration condition makes a more stable layer uniform caving performance. The aim of the top coal caving with vibration technique, to increase the <b>top</b> coal <b>recovery</b> ratio and to lower the waste content rate, has been achieved...|$|R

30|$|It is {{important}} to select a rational top-coal drawing interval to improve coal recovery and reduce the percentage of gangue. If the drawing interval is too large, the top coals might be caved into the goaf, resulting in a coal loss. On the other hand, if the drawing interval is too small, the gangue might be mixed with coals and cave into the discharge window, which may not only affect the coal quality, but also be mistaken for top coal exhaustion and result in coal loss. The factors for determining the drawing interval consists of {{the thickness of the}} top coal, the discharge window length of support, the center height of the discharge window and the shearer’s cutting depth. The principal for determining the drawing interval is to fracture and loosen the top coal in the range of the discharged coal, increase <b>top</b> coal <b>recovery</b> and reduce the percentage of gangue. In addition, the rational drawing interval should match the coal mining process and form an integer-times relationship with the shearer’s cutting depth.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{iron and}} steel sector is the largest {{industrial}} CO 2 emitter and energy consumer in the world. Energy efficiency is key to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions. To understand future developments of energy use in the steel sector, it is worthwhile to analyze energy efficiency developments {{over the past two}} decades. This paper analyses the development of the specific energy consumption (SEC) (measured as primary energy use per unit of product) in the German steel sector between 1991 and 2007. We found that the total SEC declined by 0. 4 %/year. Of this 75 %, or 0. 3 %/year, is due to a structural change towards more electric arc furnaces (EAF). Energy efficiency improvement accounts for about 25 % of the observed change in SEC, or 0. 1 %/year. Energy efficiency improvements are found, especially in rolling (1. 4 %/year). The net SEC of blast furnaces decreased due to increased <b>top</b> gas <b>recovery</b> by 0. 2 %/year per tonne iron. Improvements in other processes were very limited or non-existent. In basic oxygen furnaces (BOF) net SEC increased due to a 60 % decrease in BOF gas recovery between 1993 and 2007. In EAF and sinter plants the SEC remained constant or, respectively, even increased by 9 % between 1991 and 2007 per tonne sinter...|$|R

40|$|Fractionation {{of fried}} oils by Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (SC-CO 2) {{is one of}} the most {{interesting}} purification techniques, since a selective separation of the oil components can be attained [1, 2, 3]. Unfortunately, the specific quantity of CO 2 with respect the feed oil is fairly high [2, 3] and thus the operating cost is estimated to be high [4]. The hexane as cosolvent has been successfully used to reduce CO 2 flow rate at given pressure [5]. In this work the influence of the hexane concentration at different pressure (P= 35 and 28 MPa at T = 323 °K) has been tested. At constant CO 2 flow rate, 60 % vol ratio has been maintained for hexane in the oil. Ratio between CO 2 and oil has been changed from about 53 to about 17. Fractionation yields and composition of products has been analyzed and discussed. Experimental results shows that at 323 °K hexane cosolvent can allow a significant CO 2 flow rate reduction, still maintaining a good selectivity with respect the oil obtained on tower top. Moreover, data show that column pressure is the main variable to be considered for oil <b>top</b> fraction <b>recovery.</b> Hexane cosolvent effect seems to be not significant at 28 MPa, for any CO 2 /oil ratio with respect to oil recovery and its composition. The cosolvent feed became more important for oil recovery and composition at 35 MPa. Nevertheless, the presence of some percentage of hexane residues in the top fraction of the oil has been detected and then a further treatment for the oil is necessary...|$|R

40|$|Improving energy {{efficiency}} {{has been recognized}} as the key short- to medium-run strategy to reduce CO 2 emissions and energy consumption in a cost-efficient way, in particular for energy-intensive industry sectors like steel production. To improve {{energy efficiency}}, voluntary agreements (VAs) between industry associations and governments have been implemented in Germany in 2001 as the main policy instrument. For the iron and steel sector the VA is specified as a 22 % reduction of the CO 2 emissions per ton of crude steel between 1990 and 2012. To {{shed some light on}} the effectiveness of the VA this paper analyses the development of the specific energy consumption (primary energy use per unit of product) in the German steel sector between 1991 and 2007. We find that the total energy intensity declined by 0. 4 %/year. Of this 75 %, or 0. 3 %/year, is due to a structural change towards more electric arc furnaces (EAF). Energy efficiency improvement accounts for about 25 % of the observed change in energy intensity, or 0. 1 %/year. Energy efficiency improvements are found, especially in rolling (1. 4 %/year). The specific net energy consumption of blast furnaces decreased due to increased <b>top</b> gas <b>recovery</b> by 0. 2 %/year per ton iron. Improvements in other processes were very limited or non-existent. In basic oxygen furnaces (BOF) net energy consumption increased due to a 60 % decrease in BOF gas recovery between 1993 and 2007. In electric arc furnaces and sinter plants the specific energy consumption remained constant or, respectively, even increased by 9 % between 1991 and 2007 per ton sinter. In sum, our findings do not support the view that the VA has led to noticeable improvements in the energy efficiency of the single processes in the German iron and steel industry. Improvements could only been observed for steel rolling. Instead, observed reductions in the SEC for crude steel originate mainly from the production shift towards EAF...|$|R

40|$|This brief {{communication}} {{reports on}} the main findings of the LEMTOX workshop, held from 9 to 12 September 2007, at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Leipzig, Germany. The workshop brought together {{a diverse group of}} stakeholders from academia, regulatory authorities, contract research organizations, and industry, representing Europe, the United States, and Asia, to discuss the role of ecological modeling in risk assessments of pesticides, particularly under the European regulatory framework. The following questions were addressed: What are the potential benefits of using ecological models in pesticide registration and risk assessment? What obstacles prevent ecological modeling from being used routinely in regulatory submissions? What actions are needed to overcome the identified obstacles? What recommendations should be made to ensure good modeling practice in this context? The workshop focused exclusively on population models, and discussion was focused on those categories of population models that link effects on individuals (e. g., survival, growth, reproduction, behavior) to effects on population dynamics. The workshop participants concluded that the overall benefits of ecological modeling are that it could bring more ecology into ecological risk assessment, and it could provide an excellent tool for exploring the importance of, and interactions among, ecological complexities. However, {{there are a number of}} challenges that need to be overcome before such models will receive wide acceptance for pesticide risk assessment, despite having been used extensively in other contexts (e. g., conservation biology).

However, from 1998 onwards, he was dominant. He won three of six events in 1998, including a home win in Linköping, and ended up beating fellow Swede Jimmy Nilsen by 12 points. Joining Hans Nielsen as the only 2 riders to have won word titles in both the single meeting and grand prix formats. This year, he also won the Elitserien with Valsarna of Hagfors, being the highest averaging rider that season, and he won the British Elite League with Ipswich, averaging the highest for them as well. 1999 was an almost equally stunning season, although it started badly when he got disqualified in the first race at Prague, finishing eleventh. After three races, he was third, 24 points behind Tomasz Gollob, who looked to be cruising to victory. However, Gollob ran into trouble in the fourth race at Coventry, being forced to retire after the introductory stages and finishing eighth, meaning that Rickardsson caught up 15 points in one race. With one event left at Vojens, Gollob still led by four points, but in a quarter-final heat where Ryan Sullivan had been excluded and he only had to finish in the top two to qualify for the semi-final, Gollob finished third, and the pressure was off Rickardsson - who would now win if he finished in the <b>top</b> six.

The only part missing is the beneficiation of brine to separate the potassium from the sodium. The use of electrostatic beneficiation in this experiment utilizes the electrical charge differences between aluminum and dried brine by surface contact. The helixes within the aluminum tribocharger allows for more surface contact when being agitated. When two materials are in contact, the material with the highest affinity for electrons becomes negatively charged, while the other becomes positively charged. This contact exchange of charge may cause the particles to agglomerate depending on their residence time within the tribocharger, compromising the efficiency of separation. The aim of this experiment is to further the development in electrostatic beneficiation by optimizing the separation of ersatz and possibly real wastewater brine residues. In doing so, ideally it will yield a high potassium enrichment for use in spacecraft plant systems...|$|R
