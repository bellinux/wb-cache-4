25|$|At one time, {{the golden}} eagle {{lived in a}} great {{majority}} of temperate Europe, North Asia, North America, North Africa, and Japan. Although widespread and quite secure in some areas, {{in many parts of}} the range golden eagles have experienced sharp population declines and have even been extirpated from some areas. The total number of individual golden eagles from around the range is estimated to range somewhere between 170,000 and 250,000 while the estimated total number of breeding pairs ranges from 60,000 to 100,000. Few other eagle species are as numerous, though some species like <b>tawny</b> <b>eagle,</b> wedge-tailed eagle and bald eagle have total estimated populations of a similar size to the golden eagle’s despite having distributions which are more restricted. The world’s most populous eagle may be the African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), which has a stable total population estimated at 300,000 individuals and is found solely in Africa. On a global scale, the golden eagle is not considered threatened by the IUCN.|$|E
25|$|Distinguishing {{the golden}} eagle from other Aquila eagles in Eurasia is {{potentially}} a greater identification problem. This identification may {{rely on the}} golden's relatively long tail and patterns of white or gray on the wings and tail. Other Aquila eagles do not generally fly in a pronounced dihedral as do golden eagles. At close range, the golden to rufous nape-shawl of the golden eagle is distinctive from other Aquila. Most other Aquila eagles are darker looking in plumage, although the smaller <b>tawny</b> <b>eagle</b> (A. rapax) is often paler than the golden eagle (overlap in range verified only in Bale Mountains, Ethiopia). Among Eurasian Aquila, the adult eastern imperial (A. heliaca) and Spanish imperial eagle (A. adalberti) come closest to attaining similar sizes as golden eagles but this species pair are distinguished by their relatively longer neck, flatter wings in flight, white markings on their shoulder forewing-coverts, paler cream-straw colored nape patch and generally darker coloration. Juvenile imperial eagles are much paler overall (caramel-cream in the Spanish; cream and tawny streaks in the Eastern) and {{are not likely to}} be confused. Steppe eagles (A. nipalensis) can also be nearly golden eagle-sized but are more compact and smaller headed than a golden eagle with little color variation to their dark earth-brown plumage but for juvenile birds which have distinctive cream-colored bands running through their coverts and secondaries. Verreaux's eagle (A. verreauxii) are most similar in size and body shape to the golden, with the Verreaux's being slightly longer overall but marginally less heavy and long-winged than the golden eagle. The plumage is very distinctly different, however, as Verreaux's eagles are almost entirely jet-black but for some striking, contrasting white on the wing primaries, shoulders and upper-wing. This closely related species is known to co-occur with the golden eagle only in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. Other booted eagles in the golden eagle’s range are unlikely to be confused, due to the differences in size and form. Among the Aquila genus, only the long-winged and tailed wedge-tailed eagle (A. audax) of Australasia notably exceeds the golden eagle in average wingspan and length. However, the wedge-tailed eagle is a slightly less heavy bird.|$|E

500|$|Springbok {{often go}} into bouts of {{repeated}} high leaps {{of up to}} [...] into the air – a practice known as pronking (derived from the Afrikaans pronk, [...] "to show off") or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking {{is that it is}} a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to get a better view of a concealed predator; it may also be used for display. Springbok are very fast antelopes, clocked at [...] They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding. Caracals, cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyaenas, and wild dogs are major predators of the springbok. Southern African wildcats, black-backed jackals, black eagles, martial <b>eagles,</b> and <b>tawny</b> <b>eagles</b> target juveniles.

50|$|Although it is {{the most}} {{specialized}} predator of rock hyrax in the world, it does not have monopoly on this prey. Many wild predators are also attracted to rock hyraxes, which thus puts them in potential competition with the Verreaux's eagles. Amongst the other very large eagles which are widely found in sub-Saharan Africa, both the crowned eagle and the martial eagle may also locally favor rock hyraxes in their diets. However, these species have highly different habitat preferences and hunting techniques. The crowned eagle, a forest-dwelling species, is primarily a perch-hunter and can spend hours watching for prey activity from a prominent tree perch. The martial eagle is a dweller mainly of lightly wooded savanna and often hunts on the wing. soaring high and watching for prey activity with its superb vision, quite unlike the contour-hunting technique used by Verreaux's eagles. While the habitats of crowned and Verreaux's eagle keep them segregated enough to likely eliminate competition, confrontations between Verreaux's and martial eagles have been recorded. Although somewhat larger and more powerful, the martial eagle is relatively less nimble in the air and there is a case where a martial eagle was robbed of rock hyrax prey by a Verreaux's eagle. Another case of kleptoparasitism by a Verreaux's eagle involved one stealing some carrion from a lammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus). A unique opportunity to study Verreaux's eagle living with its closest extant cousin, the golden eagle, has been afforded in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. The two species, with similar habitat preferences, were observed to defend their territories from one another exclusively, with many cases of goldens chasing Verreaux's eagles out of their respective territories in flight and only one of Verreaux's chasing the goldens. However, since the golden eagles prefer hares and Verreaux prefers rock hyraxes, they actually seem to have no deleterious effect on each other’s breeding activities. African hawk-eagles (Aquila spilogaster) may also take a few hyraxes, but are likely to avoid direct conflicts with their much larger cousins, so will <b>tawny</b> <b>eagles</b> (Aquila rapax). Other predators of rock hyrax may include felids like African wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica), servals (Leptailurus serval), caracals (Caracal caracal) and leopards (Panthera pardus) as well as jackals (Canis ssp.), African rock pythons (Python sebae) and owls (mainly the large Verreaux's eagle-owl (Bubo lacteus) or possibly the Cape eagle-owl (B. capensis)). Neonate rock hyraxes may fall prey to mongooses and venomous snakes like Egyptian cobras (Naja haje) and puff adders (Bitis arietans). Due to the formidable range of competitors it pays for Verreaux's eagle to be cautious from the moment it bears down on its prey. Cases where pirating has been attempted has involved diverse carnivores like caracals and jackals. In at least one case, a Verreaux's eagle was observed to be displaced off a rodent-kill (likely a cane-rat) by an Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis). As is often the case with reintroduced eagles (i.e. seen even in the huge harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja)), reintroduced Verreaux's eagle may lose their fear of other predators to their own detriment and one such bird fell victim to a caracal. Cases where Verreaux's eagles have swooped at leopards are not likely competitive but are more likely to try to displace from their territory and such attacks have occasionally had fatal results for the birds. This species is not normally aggressive to humans but may swoop uncomfortably close when the nest is being investigated.|$|R

50|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of the nature reserve is very rich. In the Kaiser Mountains there are about 940 {{different}} flowering plants, 38 different species of fern and over 400 different mosses. The colonies of fungi and lichen are very rich, with 100 and 236 different species respectively being represented. The forest region comprises mainly mixed forest with beech, fir and spruce. In the submontane area there are also ash and sycamore maple, and, in sunny areas, alder. Hay meadows, poor grassland and pastures are typical of the alpine meadows. In the subalpine region we find the typical dwarf shrub types such as mountain pine and alpenrose, and the rare dwarf alpenrose. Alpine polsterrasen ("cushion grasslands") are found {{all the way up}} to the summit areas. There are various wetlands also stocked with typical plants. As a product of ice age processes the Kaiser is also home to a number of rare, partly endemic invertebrates, such as Allobobophora smaragdina (a yellow-green earthworm), a door snail, and a number of spiders and butterflies. Typical vertebrates are the alpine and fire salamanders, smooth snake, viper (unusual color variants), edible dormouse, hazel dormouse and bank vole. In higher regions there are chamois, stoat, snow vole and mountain hare. Typical birds are wood warbler, the red-breasted flycatcher (for North Tyrol endemic), alpine chough, raven, crag martin, alpine willow tit, lesser redpoll (Carduelis linaria rufescens), alpine accentor, alpine wallcreeper and black grouse - capercaillie and rock ptarmigan.

40|$|Breeding {{success for}} {{specialist}} avian predators in northern Fennoscandia is {{highly dependent on}} cyclic vole populations. The 3 - 4 year high amplitude vole cycles once regular to this region have shown significant long term declines in abundance since the 1970 s. The vole decline in Sweden, detected by the National Environmental Monitoring Program, is suggested to have negative consequences on breeding performance for specialist raptors. Complete, long term monitoring data to show this on particularly northern owls are scarce. I compared Tengmalm’s owl to the European kestrel, an increasing generalist, in northern Sweden, and used these as model species for comparing with other northern raptors. Diet compilation for 15 raptors revealed the snowy, great grey, hawk, long and short-eared owls are also small mammal specialists and were placed together with Tengmalm’s owl in an ‘owl’ predator category; the hen harrier, common buzzard, kestrel, and <b>eagle,</b> <b>tawny,</b> Ural, and pygmy owls are generalists and were placed in a ‘kestrel’ predator category; and the rough-legged buzzard is an intermediate placed in a combined owl/kestrel category. I predicted trends for species based on degree of small mammal specialization and model predator category. I suggested those in the owl category should decline, those in the kestrel category should not decline, and rough-legged buzzard should probably decline. Population data for raptors from Sweden, including migration counts from Falsterbo and breeding density of Tengmalm’s owl and kestrel in Västerbotten County, were analyzed against the spring and previous autumn vole food supply indices from Västerbotten County. Migration counts of the common and rough-legged buzzards showed a significant positive relationship with the spring vole index. Breeding density of Tengmalm’s owl and kestrel showed significant positive relationships with the previous autumn vole index (and also spring for Tengmalm’s owl), while mean annual brood size for kestrels was only dependent on the spring vole index. For species with data available from Sweden, only the kestrel showed an increasing population trend. However, breeding density of Tengmalm’s owl, a vole specialist, has declined in northern Sweden since the 1980 s. The specialists placed in the owl category are predicted show similar patterns as Tengmalm’s owl and {{are the most likely}} species that have been {{and will continue to be}} adversely affected by significant declines in vole abundance...|$|R
2500|$|In the Palearctic, {{the golden}} eagle co-exists {{with several other}} large {{raptorial}} birds called eagles. Unlike in their relationship with smaller raptors, golden eagles are rarely reported to hunt other eagle species. Most conflicts between different eagles are over kills or carrion, though some species will defend nesting territories from each other. When it comes to carrion and kills, usually the “aggressor” (that is the eagle who initiates the agonistic behavior) is victorious over the other eagle. Considering that they overlap considerably in both distribution and prey selection, there is remarkably almost no known accounts from Eurasia of golden eagles behaving aggressively with other Aquila eagles. This is possibly due to segregated habitat preferences amongst these species, with lesser and greater spotted eagles being essentially woodland or wooded wetland-dwelling birds, Spanish and eastern imperial eagles inhabiting fragmented, open woods and steppe eagles generally living in flat, often treeless steppe and desert-like habitats. In central Asia, where golden eagles and other Aquila species are rare or absent, steppe eagles sometimes nest in mountainous rock formations like golden eagles. Compared to these eagles, the Bonelli's eagle {{appears to have a}} more contentious relationship with golden eagles, as they are often attracted to similar prey (largely rabbits and gamebirds) and occur in abutting habitats. The larger golden eagle is apparently dominant and, in at least one case, has killed and consumed a Bonelli's. The two species defend their territories from one another exclusively, in the same way they defend them from others of their own species. Both will use nests built by the other species, more so the golden using Bonelli's nests than vice versa. Further east, in Israel, Bonelli's and golden eagles are competitors as well. In the dry, barren Negev Desert, golden eagles nests were found [...] apart and Bonelli's were scarce. In the Judaean Desert, which has more annual rainfall and more available prey, the distance between golden eagle nests averaged [...] and the Bonelli's eagle easily outnumbered them. Apparently, the Bonelli's eagle exceptionally outcompeted its larger cousin here due to a subtle topographic variation in the habitat. Still, in areas without unnatural human pressures, the gradation between these species is still adequate enough that they can exist without serious negative effect on either population. In Japan, golden eagles were observed to hunt mountain hawk-eagles (Nisaetus nipalensis), {{despite the fact that the}} local race of hawk eagle is around the same mass as a Japanese golden eagle. The Bale Mountains of Ethiopia is arguably the richest biosphere the golden eagle is known to inhabit and there, this species may potentially interact with more than 10 other eagle species and nearly 30 other accipitrid species, including both migratory and resident breeding species. These are often supported by an exceptionally diverse, dense population of rodents there. The Bale Mountains golden eagles were recorded kleptoparatisizing steppe eagles, augur buzzard (Buteo augur), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus) and lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus) and the eagles were themselves kleptoparatisized by steppe eagles on three occasions. The golden eagles were also observed to chase <b>tawny</b> and steppe <b>eagles</b> out of their nesting territories. In the Bale Mountains, the golden eagle overlaps with perhaps its closest living relative, the Verreaux's eagle. The golden eagles appear to vigorously defend their territories from the Verreaux's eagles and, as in its relationship with the Bonelli's, the two species appear to maintain exclusive territories. Several chases involving the golden chasing Verreaux's were witnessed but only one where a Verreaux's chased off the golden. Despite several reported antagonistic interactions, no other raptors were found as prey in the Bale Mountains nests of golden eagles.|$|R
