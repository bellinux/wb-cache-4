5|$|Abd al-Rahman at this <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{flamboyant}} {{figure with}} broad popular support. His stature served to diminish {{that of the}} politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|According to the Kennel Club {{studbook}}, Old Jock was bred at {{some point}} during 1859 either by Captain Percy Williams in his Rufford Kennels, or by Jack Morgan who at the <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huntsman with the Grove Kennels. He was bred from Jock and Grove Pepper, both huntman's terriers. Jock was owned by Captain Williams, while Grove Pepper was owned by Morgan. It was claimed in W.D. Drury's 1903 work British Dogs, Their Points, Selection, And Show Preparation that Old Jock was in fact bred from Quorn Kennels and that the listing in the Kennel Club studbook was incorrect.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, {{in order}} to clarify the {{relationships}} between space-time coordinates, new <b>time</b> scales <b>were</b> introduced, each with a different frame of reference. Terrestrial <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> at Earth's surface. Geocentric Coordinate <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> coordinate <b>time</b> scale at Earth's center. Barycentric Coordinate <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> coordinate <b>time</b> scale {{at the center of}} mass of the solar system, which is called the barycenter.

5|$|As {{a senior}} Pressey earned TABC All-state {{recognition}} and Dallas Morning News first team All-area recognition. The All-area team included Perry Jones, Le'Bryan Nash, Marcus Smart and Kyan Anderson. During the 2010 SPC championship game, Pressey tallied 32 points, 9 assists, 8 rebounds and 3 steals against Greenhill School. Videos of him dunking {{in high school}} have made him a YouTube sensation. During the 2010 TABC All-star game, he dunked over Tony Mitchell, who at the <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> player approximately a foot taller than Pressey. , this video has about 800,000 views. Because of his diminutive stature, he is often compared to another undersized Dallas basketball player, Spud Webb.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist. He {{had hoped to}} write his thesis {{under the supervision of}} Friedrich Gundolf, who at that <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> well known literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the Normans conquered England in 1066, the town of Southampton {{occupied}} a rectangular area overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to the north and east. Southampton at this <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> relatively large town, but not as significant as in the later medieval period. The Normans built a castle within the town on the site of a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification.|$|E

Dunford, with a 51.14 time, set a new Olympic record, beating Phelps' previous record of 51.25 seconds, achieved in {{the final of the}} 100 metre butterfly in Athens; he also set new African and Kenyan records. Andrew Lauterstein's 51.37 <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> new Oceanic and Australian best. Takuro Fujii set a Japanese and an Asian record with his 51.50 time.|$|E
5|$|Former player Terry Neill succeeded Mee in 1976. At {{the age of}} 34, {{he became}} the {{youngest}} Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings, and a crop of talent in the side such as Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, the club reached a trio of FA Cup finals (1978, 1979 and 1980), and lost the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final on penalties. The club's only trophy during this <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup Final, widely regarded as a classic.|$|E

5|$|Historian Keith W. Olson {{has written}} that Nixon left a {{negative}} legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious {{than those of the}} incumbent. Another legacy, for a <b>time,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> decrease {{in the power of the}} presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.|$|E
5|$|In 1589, he was {{appointed}} to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{engaged in}} chain smoking. He {{maintained}} 18-hour workdays and rarely took {{time off for}} vacations. The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health. He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s {{and by the time}} of his death in 1970, he also had arteriosclerosis, heart disease, and high blood pressure. He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode. State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> result of influenza.|$|E

5|$|Producing {{plutonium}} in useful quantities for {{the first}} <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E
5|$|Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875) {{was also}} from Angus and his Principles of Geology built on Hutton's ideas.
