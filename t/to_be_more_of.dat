It did indeed approached the islands, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Rick's intensity was much greater than Pauline's, Hurricane Pauline re-curved sooner than Rick. While the surf did rise somewhat, the waves were {{significantly lower than the}} heights experienced during Pauline. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue sailing vessel en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E
5|$|The Flash {{version of}} Flow {{received}} 100,000 downloads within {{its first two}} weeks of release, and had been played over 3.5million times by 2008. Its PlayStation 3 re-release was the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007, and won the Best Downloadable Game award at the 2008 Game Developers Choice Awards. It was nominated for awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). Reviewers praised Flows visual and audio appeal, but noted the simplicity of its gameplay; several considered it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an art piece than a game.|$|E

5|$|The {{police force}} {{comprised}} around 200 {{men at the}} start, and Gens appointed Salk Dessler as his deputy commandant. Other chief subordinates included Joseph Muszkat and Meir Levas. Dessler was a Revisionist Zionist, and Muszkat and Levas had been members of the Betar, the youth movement of the Revisionist Zionists. The police force included many other former Betar members, and {{this may have been}} because Gens favored people coming from his own political leanings. This led to a conflict with the Bund, another Jewish political group. The Bund appears to have wanted the police force <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a militia, with Gens and his supporters wishing it to be a more conventional police force. After some initial political wrangling, Gens' faction won, but the Bundists remained strong in the Judenrat.|$|E

According to Kessler's book, in the summer of 1999, Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the home of Felt's daughter and took him to lunch. Joan Felt, who was taking care of him at her home, told Kessler her father greeted Woodward like an old friend, and their mysterious meeting appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a celebration than an interview.|$|E
25|$|Despite these problems, one of {{the main}} {{achievements}} of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce. In fact labour shortages proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built.|$|E

25|$|A bust and {{historical}} plaque marks her birthplace in Toronto, now {{the site of}} the Hospital for Sick Children. The plaque was unveiled by her husband Buddy Rogers in 1973. The bust by artist Eino Gira was added ten years later. Her date of birth on the plaque is April 8, 1893. This can only be assumed to be because her date of birth was never registered – and throughout her life, beginning as a child, she led many people to believe that she was a year younger so she would appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an acting prodigy and continue to be cast in younger roles, which were more plentiful in the theatre.|$|E
25|$|The {{trousers}} worn by Indiana Jones in {{all three}} films were based on original World War II Army and Army Air Corps officer trousers. Although not original Pinks {{they are based on}} the same basic design and do carry a slight pinkish hue. The trousers made for Raiders are said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a greyish-brown whereas the trousers made for Temple of Doom and Last Crusade were supposedly a purer reddish brown. The trousers were made of a khaki wool-twill, pleated with seven belt loops, two scalloped button flap rear pockets, a button fly and a four-inch military style hem. They were all most likely subcontracted by the costume department and made by famed London based cinema costumers, Angels and Bermans, to be tailored perfectly for Harrison Ford for the production.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Independent Company {{was formed}} in May/June 1941 and was trained at the No. 7 Infantry Training Centre at Tidal River on Wilsons Promontory in Victoria. Originally the company was raised {{to serve in the}} Middle East although, at that time there was {{uncertainty}} about the role that the company would fill there. Indeed, within the Australian Army there was a section that saw no need for the independent companies, believing that they would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a drain on resources than anything else. However, later in 1941, as the threat of war with Imperial Japan loomed, {{the main body of the}} company was sent to Kavieng, New Ireland, to protect Kavieng airfield whilst other sections were sent to Namatanai on New Ireland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka on Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers and provided medical treatment to the inhabitants.|$|E

50|$|Based off mindfulness-based {{cognitive}} therapy (MBCT), Williams, et al. (2000) {{found that this}} intervention effectively reduced OGM and symptoms of depression as compared to a control group. Though MBCT was not developed as a memory-specificity training intervention, the core idea of MBCT is awareness. This type of therapy focuses on teaching the person how <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> aware <b>of</b> his/her environment, allowing memories <b>to</b> <b>be</b> encoded at a higher specificity, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> aware <b>of</b> his/her own thought processes, allowing the person to recognize when his/her mind wanders and how {{to come back to}} the present situation. The finding that an already developed intervention program could reduce OGM was promising and galvanized further research on intervention programs for OGM.|$|R
25|$|With the new ball due six overs {{into the}} fourth day Sri Lankan wickets fell thick and fast, half the team falling before lunch, the last of which being opener Michael Vandort who {{narrowly}} missed out on being the fifth batsmen ever to hold his wicket throughout an entire innings. England took to the crease just before lunch with a very slow run rate that came only from Strauss - Trescothick fell after nine runs, none of them contributed by him. The third man, Alastair Cook held out {{for the rest of}} the innings though achieving 34 not out; during this time Strauss fell to a controversial catch, replays showed it popped off his pads. Pietersen, wanting to end the Test quickly, took the wicket with his usual speed, taking 13 runs off 25 balls his confidence assured by a catch by the tourists' skipper to be called a no ball, and a further two no balls which he took boundaries off. However, his cockiness proved his downfall as he lashed out at a ball from Murali, the only bowler to take wickets in the second innings, and was caught plumb. Collingwood soon fell for 3 and it seemed as if the easy target of 78 was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a struggle but Cook, remaining from the second partnership, took two runs and two byes and skipper Flintoff, who done nothing with his first three balls, drove Murali down the ground to long on for four on his fourth ball to win the match, and his third in a row as English skipper.|$|E
