500|$|After Mitchell {{declared}} for the 2001 NFL Draft, one NFL scout {{told the}} Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in February, [...] "I don't think he's {{as fast as}} people in the press <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he is. He's absolutely fearless over the middle but he prefers to trap the ball instead of to extend for it. I don't think he has nearly the explosion {{to be considered a}} first." [...] Mitchell was also criticized by scouts for his small frame and potential character issues. Draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. rated Mitchell as the 16th-best prospect in the draft following the NFL Scouting Combine in which he ran a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, and called him a player on the rise. Kiper also rated him as the fifth-best wide receiver in the draft and projected Mitchell to be drafted in the mid-first round following his performance at the Combine. In rating players several times leading up to the draft, Kiper re-watched game film of each player and adjusted their rankings accordingly. In his March 5 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Green Bay Packers with the tenth overall selection. He ranked Mitchell as the 18th-best player in the draft on March 30. NFLDraftScout.com projected Mitchell to be drafted in the second round and rated him as the eighth-best wide receiver in the draft. Kiper ranked him the fourth-best wide receiver in the draft on April 2. In his April 10 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Denver Broncos with the 24th overall selection. Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ranked Mitchell as the sixth-best wide receiver in the draft. Mitchell hired Tom Condon of IMG Football as his agent leading up to the draft.|$|E

Personal assistant Tim Duckworth explained: [...] "I would make sure he would eat breakfast instead of waking up drinking every morning, which was probably the worst thing he was doing."

2500|$|Another {{prominent}} {{feature of}} Rebbe Nachman's teachings is his Tikkun HaKlali ("General Rectification" [...] or [...] "General Remedy") for spiritual correction. This general rectification can override the spiritual harm caused by many sins, or one sin whose ramifications are many. On Shavuot 5566 (May 23, 1806) Rebbe Nachman revealed that ten specific Psalms, recited in this order: Psalms 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, and 150, constitute a special remedy for {{the sin of}} wasting seed, which defiles {{the sign of the}} covenant, and, by extension, all the other mitzvot.

2500|$|She {{has spoken}} {{out on a}} number of {{volatile}} political issues, including tort/litigation reform, but perhaps her most consistent theme—aside from gay and lesbian rights—has been her unstinting opposition to Communism, and unrelenting opposition to the former Eastern Bloc power structure that compelled her to flee her native Czechoslovakia. She has denounced the Soviet Union's control over Czechoslovakia, maintaining that she refuses to speak Russian to this day because of the Soviet Union's former hegemony over Eastern Europe."Whenever people go into politics and they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Communism was a good thing, I say, 'Go ahead and live in a Communist country then, if you think it's so great.'

But he liked me being there because I knew to wait and let him finish his sentences between gasps. I didn't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the words for him because I knew how much they mattered. That was strange for me – to be patient and quiet. But I always wanted to listen to John." ...|$|E
2500|$|Radke {{discussed}} {{his relationship with}} Escape the Fate members since his departure from the band, stating that {{they have tried to}} reconcile with Radke but he was uninterested in getting back on friendly terms with them after they kicked him out and misinformed their fans about Radke getting caught with heroin inside prison. Radke stated in an interview, [...] "They make a whole album called This War Is Ours, and then they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'We didn't name that album after you, dude.' Which in fact, they did. I could be wrong; they could be talking about the war on terrorism or something. I don't know. But I just have a feeling that record name was about me. They talk a lot of shit. It is always about forgive and forget, but there's some things that I would like to say. So I did. On the record." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{everyday}} interactions Genie became steadily {{more willing}} and able to speak during her stay with the Riglers, often spontaneously contributing to an ongoing discussion and sometimes doing so even if the conversation did not initially involve her and was not specifically about her. She was generally more willing to start or enter conversations on topics which interested her, although she would sometimes attempt to join in a conversation on other matters. When she wanted to talk about a particular subject she would sometimes allow the topic to change, but often persisted by repeating herself even after someone made multiple efforts to discuss something else. Otherwise she normally went along with a topic somebody else raised, and when attempting to enter an ongoing conversation she would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something relevant. If she could not say something semantically related to a topic, she sometimes tried to join in using other means; Curtiss recalled one dinner conversation at the Riglers' home in 1972 in which several people used the word [...] "tenant", and in an effort to contribute Genie said the word [...] "ten" [...] and held up ten fingers.|$|E
