5|$|Fincher's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who objected to the film's sexual content. The filmmakers {{considered}} Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher objected that she was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> the role. He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove.|$|E
5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were highly valued. Long, thick hair {{was seen as a}} sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children. In keeping with this general theme, women who were <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> marriage would shave a portion of their heads to signal so. This tradition, however, did not extend to every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E
5|$|James Villiers as MI6 Chief of Staff Bill Tanner. The role of Tanner first {{appeared}} on film in The Man with the Golden Gun, although in an un-credited capacity. Villiers presumed he would {{play the role of}} M in subsequent films and was disappointed not to be asked; the producers thought him <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> the role and wanted an actor in his 70s.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance, {{starring}} as Willy Loman in a Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman. Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre's history. Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> the role of 62-year-old Loman, and Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune felt that the character had been interpreted poorly. Hoffman admitted that he found the role difficult, but he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, Cherry was sent to Claremont Camp and assumed duties as a drill instructor. On 5 March 1915, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was allotted to the 26th Battalion, where he qualified as an infantry officer, but was considered <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> a commission in the Australian Imperial Force and was instead made a Quartermaster Sergeant. On 29 June, the battalion embarked from Brisbane for Egypt with Cherry aboard HMAT Aeneas.

On 12 September, the battalion landed at Gallipoli and played a defensive role at Courtney’s and Steele’s Posts, and Russell’s Top.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in 1861, Johnston was fifteen years old and {{attending}} Highland Military College in Newburg, New York. He remained in school through 1862, but then left to raise a company for a regiment being organized in New York. De Peyster's father paid ten-dollar bounties to the men who signed the muster roll of his company. He was not able to assume command because of his age, and his family also felt he was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> service. However, in the winter of 1863, he threatened to travel to Washington, D.C. and stand for examination for an officership with a colored regiment.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tiger {{pitching}} injuries, {{and with}} many top players {{still in the}} military late in World War II (Houtteman was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> the draft), he made his major league debut on April 29. At 17years old, he was the youngest player in the American League in the 1945 season before being optioned back to Buffalo, where on June 20 he threw seven no-hit innings, facing only 22 batters in the process, but lost the game 2–0 in extra innings. He also appeared in 13 games as a relief pitcher, and finished his minor league season with no wins, two losses and an ERA of 5.33 in just over 25 innings pitched. He {{was not on the}} active roster, and as a result did not pitch during the Tigers' World Series victory over the Chicago Cubs.|$|E
5|$|In this period, it {{was common}} for {{aspiring}} Australian artists to seek further training in Europe, particularly London and Paris. Henry Rix arranged to take his family there {{in conjunction with a}} trip he was making to study British education reforms, purchasing first-class tickets to travel in 1906. But Henry, who had been overworked and ill, died suddenly, and for a time it appeared the trip might not happen. Denied a widow's pension (Henry had been 58: <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> his wife to be eligible), the family had to reorganise their affairs and work out if they could afford to get to Europe. Finally, by combining an inheritance, rental income from their home, and money raised through the sale of works by both mother and daughter, they were able to trade the first class tickets for second class berths, and they set sail for England early in 1907.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Tarkovsky {{wanted his}} ex-wife, Irma Raush, as Hari. After meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970, however, {{he decided that}} she was a better actress for the role. Wishing to work with Tarkovsky, Andersson {{accepted}} her salary in rubles. Nevertheless, Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as Hari. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she who had introduced the novel, Solaris to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970 but decided she was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko who cast her in You and I. Half-a-year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari after all.|$|E
5|$|Records {{from the}} Pool Adit copper mine at Trevenson (the most {{successful}} {{of the early}} copper mines) show in 1729, 25 bal maidens and three males worked as 'pickers' sorting high quality from poor quality ore, earning a flat rate of 4d per day and typically working 20 days per month. (Records do not show {{the ages of the}} pickers at Pool Adit, but the male pickers are likely to have been boys <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> heavy labour.) In 1730 Pool Adit employed 30 female and four male pickers, and by 1731 the figures had risen to 55 female and five male, typically working 22 to 26 days per month. The number of bal maidens employed in the industry rose dramatically, and by the early 1770s Dolcoath, by then the most significant of the Cornish copper mines, employed around 220 bal maidens on the copper dressing floors alone.|$|E

5|$|Several {{developments}} {{were made}} over the following years, including the introduction of co-educational units of boys and girls, initially restricted to the Venture Scouts section in 1976, but from 1991 junior sections were allowed to become mixed as well.

5|$|Taking {{as a wife}} an epikleros who {{had little}} estate was {{considered}} a praiseworthy action, and was generally stressed in public speeches. Such an heiress was called an epikleros thessa. If the nearest male relative {{did not wish to}} marry an epikleros who belonged to the lowest income class in Athens, he was required to find her a husband and provide her with a dowry on a graduated scale according to his own income class. This dowry was in addition to her own property and the requirement was designed to ensure that even poor heiresses found husbands. The law also did not stipulate what was to happen if the epikleros was still an infant or <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>for</b> consummation of the marriage when she was claimed.|$|E
