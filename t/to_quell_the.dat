5|$|Individual {{resistance}} to power can take two diametrically opposed forms: those which indulge {{the impulse to}} power, and those who seek <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> impulse to power entirely.|$|E
5|$|Fanny Longfellow died in {{the home}} in July 1861 after her dress accidentally caught fire; her husband {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> flames, managing to keep her face from burning. Longfellow himself was burned on his own face and was scarred badly enough that he began growing a beard to hide it.|$|E
5000|$|Team Penn members Matt Wiman and Gabe Ruediger {{repeatedly}} butt heads after Ruediger taunts Wiman {{because of}} an unexplained personal dislike of him. Their verbal sparring impacts the team as time from training was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>quelling</b> <b>the</b> feud.|$|R
25|$|Concerns over {{legitimacy}} {{were not}} limited to the Song alone: states rose up again in the Yuan dynasty, as its rulers were non-Han Chinese. However, the Yuan dynasty adopted a different approach <b>to</b> <b>quelling</b> <b>the</b> conflict. The Yuan asserted that the Song, Liao and Jin were all legitimate; therefore all three dynasties were given their own history, as recognition of their legitimacy.|$|R

5|$|In October, Texians engaged Mexican {{troops in}} the first {{official}} battle of the Texas Revolution. Determined <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> rebellion, Santa Anna began assembling a large force, the Army of Operations in Texas, to restore order. Most of his soldiers were raw recruits, {{and a large number}} had been forcibly conscripted.|$|E
5|$|Letcher {{supported}} Adams' administration, {{but became}} anti-administration when Jackson won the 1828 presidential contest. Consistent with {{his support of}} Clay, he promoted expansion of internal improvements, including the Maysville Road bill vetoed by Jackson. In 1833, Clay proposed a compromise in the Senate <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> Nullification Crisis; Letcher introduced Clay's compromise in the House.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus' and Elagabalus' troops met {{somewhere near}} the border of Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice. Despite Macrinus' efforts <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> {{rebellion}} at this engagement, his whole legion defected to Elagabalus forcing Macrinus to retire to Antioch. Elagabus took to the offensive and marched on Antioch.|$|E
50|$|While the Syrian {{government}} had succeeded <b>to</b> temporarily <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> March-April Daraa protests {{with a large}} scale military operation, this early May military operation in Homs failed to succeed likewise.|$|R

50|$|It took France {{three years}} from 1920 to 1923 to gain full control over Syria and <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> all <b>the</b> insurgencies that broke out, notably in the Alawite territories, Mount Druze and Aleppo.|$|R
5|$|Riots erupted {{again on}} August 1, 1966, after a 19-year-old {{was shot by}} a white, off-duty {{policeman}} during a burglary. The Omaha World-Herald and local television stations blamed African Americans for the conditions they faced in their deteriorating neighborhoods during this period. Three buildings were firebombed, and 180 riot police were required <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> crowds.|$|E
5|$|As MalcolmX and his bodyguards tried <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> disturbance, a man rushed {{forward and}} shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged the stage firing {{semi-automatic}} handguns. MalcolmX was pronounced dead at 3:30pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The autopsy identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder, arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds from the initial shotgun blast.|$|E
5|$|At the camp, {{the other}} survivors' are enjoying dinner when {{a horde of}} walkers {{suddenly}} appear, biting several of the members including Amy and Ed Peletier (Adam Minarovich). Rick and the others arrive in time <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> walkers. Amy dies in Andrea's arms, and as the others stand around in shock, Jim recalls why he had dug those holes.|$|E

50|$|In September 1932 {{thousands}} of unemployed people protested {{in a series}} of demonstrations organised by the local branch of the National Unemployed Workers Movement. After three days of rioting, police were brought in from elsewhere <b>to</b> help <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> rioters.|$|R

5|$|Problems arose {{quickly for}} the new Princeps. The Roman legions posted in Pannonia and in Germania had not been paid the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and after {{a short period of}} time mutinied when it was clear that a {{response}} from Tiberius was not forthcoming. Germanicus and Tiberius's son, Drusus Julius Caesar, were dispatched with a small force <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> uprising and bring the legions back in line.|$|E
5|$|United States President Woodrow Wilson and the United States Congress {{attempted}} to promote legislation and organizations to decrease racial discord in America. Illinois Governor Frank Lowden took several actions at Thompson's request <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> riot and promote greater harmony in its aftermath. Sections of the Chicago economy {{were shut down}} for several days {{during and after the}} riots, since plants were closed to avoid interaction among bickering groups. Mayor Thompson drew on his association with this riot to influence later political elections.|$|E
5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for their role in the suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E
50|$|During the February 1915 Singapore Mutiny by Indian Sepoy troops {{against the}} British in Singapore, Otowa {{was the first}} ship {{to respond to the}} British government's request for assistance.

50|$|He was {{a member}} of the Incorporated Society of Artists, and in 1766 subscribed the {{declaration}} roll of that society. Having amassed a fortune sufficient to pay off the encumbrances on the old family estate, Finney retired to Fulshaw in 1769, became a Justice of the Peace, and devoted the remainder of his life <b>to</b> <b>quelling</b> <b>the</b> riots then so prevalent in that part of Cheshire, and to other local improvements. He also compiled a manuscript history of his family, part of which was printed in the first volume of the Cheshire and Lancashire Historical Collector.|$|R
5|$|After {{his failure}} at Constantinople, Maslama was {{dispatched}} to Iraq <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> Kharijites. Following Umar's {{death and the}} accession of his brother Yazid II in 720, he was tasked with {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom he defeated and killed in August 720. He nevertheless fell out of favour with the Caliph, who resented and feared his power as governor of both Iraqs, as well as his interfering in the succession: Maslama favoured his brother Hisham over Yazid's son Walid. Yazid soon recalled Maslama from his post, ostensibly because he had failed to deliver his provinces' tax haul to Damascus, and replaced him by his protege, Umar ibn Hubayra.|$|E
5|$|At the war's outset, FRELIMO {{had little}} {{hope for a}} {{conventional}} military victory, with a mere 7000 combatants against a far larger Portuguese force. Their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency, in order to force a negotiated independence from Lisbon. Portugal fought {{its own version of}} protracted warfare, and a large military force was sent by the Portuguese government <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> unrest, with troop numbers rising from 8,000 to 24,000 between 1964 and 1967. The number of local soldiers recruited for the Portuguese cause rose to 23,000 in the same period. 860 Special Forces operatives were also being trained in Commando Instruction Centres by 1969.|$|E
5|$|Boyle {{sponsored}} a motion of non-confidence against the government. Despite enjoying {{the support of}} twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> controversy by calling a royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence did not show {{a conflict of interest}} on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier. A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.|$|E
50|$|They {{were first}} called to duty on June 11, <b>to</b> help <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> Broad Street Riot.

5000|$|Nevertheless, any {{potential}} effect the uprising {{could have had}} was strictly circumscribed {{by the nature of}} the Soviet regime, which was quick to use massive force <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> even <b>the</b> most humble of threats.

5|$|During the campaign, Mugabe survived two {{assassination}} attempts. In the first, {{which took}} place on 6 February, a grenade was thrown at his Mount Pleasant home, where it exploded against a garden wall. In the second, on 10 February, a roadside bomb exploded near his motorcade as he left a Fort Victoria rally. Mugabe himself was unharmed. Mugabe accused the Rhodesian security forces of being responsible for these attacks. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> possibility that Rhodesia's security forces would launch a coup to prevent the election, Mugabe met with Peter Walls, the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces, {{and asked him to}} remain in his position {{in the event of a}} ZANU-PF victory. At the time Walls refused.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Amin {{was made}} Afande (warrant officer), the highest rank {{possible}} for a black African in the colonial British Army of that time. Amin returned to Uganda the same year and, in 1961, {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant, becoming one of the first two Ugandans to become commissioned officers. He was assigned <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> cattle rustling between Uganda's Karamojong and Kenya's Turkana nomads. In 1962, following Uganda's independence from the United Kingdom, Amin was promoted to captain and then, in 1963, to major. He was appointed Deputy Commander of the Army in 1964 and, the following year, to Commander of the Army. In 1970, he was promoted to commander of all the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|In the gubernatorial {{election}} of 1911, Republicans were divided {{as to whether}} they should celebrate Willson's administration or downplay it. His actions <b>to</b> <b>quell</b> <b>the</b> violence in the Black Patch Wars and his pardons to Taylor and Powers were both unpopular with many voters. The eventual candidate, Edward C. O'Rear, was lukewarm at best to Willson's administration. Willson was upset by this hesitancy and lent O'Rear only modest support on the campaign trail. Former governor Bradley also disagreed with O'Rear's selection and engaged in minimal campaigning. The failure of the party to unite behind their candidate gave Democrat James B. McCreary an easy victory.|$|E
