30|$|There {{have been}} two main {{approaches}} to developing long-term tropical cyclone (TC) climatologies {{over the last two}} decades.

The other has been to examine geological and geochemical records of actual TC events that have occurred over the past several centuries to millennia (Liu and Fearn 2000; Nott and Hayne 2001; Donnelly and Woodruff 2007; Haig et al. 2014). Both of these approaches produce substantially different conclusions regarding the long-term climatology of TCs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Applications using {{quasi-experimental}} {{comparison group}} designs in regional science and geography have increased substantially {{over the last}} three decades, inspired by the work of Andrew Isserman and colleagues in the 1980 s and 1990 s, robust literatures on quasi-experimental design in fields like education and psychology, a vast program evaluation literature, observational studies methodology in statistics, and the growing interest in experimental and non-experimental (natural) designs in empirical economics. This paper discusses the state of quasi-experimental comparison group research today, with a primary focus on studies in which regions—Census tracts, counties, cities, metropolitan areas, provinces, or states—are the units of analysis. There is still progress to be made in improving matching methods, making more extensive use of <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>designs,</b> undertaking more systematic sensitivity testing and checks for the robustness of findings, focusing greater attention on effect heterogeneity and research designs that aid policy and program improvement, and improving the practice of regional quasi-experimental research more generally. 1...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} contribution of evaluation research is {{information regarding the}} extent to which the effect of an intervention is mediated by characteristics of the unit in which it is introduced and/or variations in the way the intervention is implemented in different units.
