5|$|After a {{long night}} of drinking, Homer and Grampa awaken and {{discover}} that they bought the pub from Tom O'Flanagan during the previous night's binge, much to their shock and dismay. They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business and {{have to find a}} way to market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons to turn it into a smokeasy. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and have to pay a small fine. Chief Wiggum arrives to bring them back to the U.S., but accidentally hits himself with his nightstick and then Maces and Tasers himself.|$|E
5|$|Gotcha is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari and released in October 1973. It {{was the fourth}} game by the company, after the 1972 Pong, which {{marked the beginning of}} the commercial video game industry, and the 1973 Space Race and Pong Doubles. In the game, two players move through a maze, which continually changes over time. One player, the Pursuer, attempts to catch the other, the Pursued; if <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>a</b> point is scored, and the players reset positions. The game emits an electronic beeping sound, which increases in pace as the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, and each game lasts a set amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>a</b> fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

25|$|For many engineers, {{technical}} work {{accounts for}} {{only a fraction of}} the work <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> <b>A</b> lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important.|$|E

25|$|The ecophilosophy of Garrett Hardin is one {{perspective}} {{from which to}} analyze the reproductive rights of human beings. For the most part, Hardin argues that it is immoral to have large families, especially since <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> disservice to society by consuming an excessive amount of resources. In an essay titled The Tragedy of the Commons, Hardin states, By encouraging the freedom to breed, the welfare state not only provides for children, but also sustains itself in the process. The net effect of such a policy is the inevitability of a Malthusian catastrophe.|$|E
25|$|Earth: The earth {{signs are}} Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. A native with mainly earth signs will be {{practical}} and cautious, sensible and capable {{and will be}} happier with concrete things than abstract ideas. They move slowly and carry out their work in a thorough and unhurried manner. Earth subjects are shrewd and careful and need emotional and material security, and will put up with quite {{a lot to get}} it. They are generous to those they love, but are otherwise careful not to waste time or money, though there can be a tendency towards meanness. Earth subjects tend to be shy in social situations, and to be slow to commit in love relationships, but are serious when <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> <b>A</b> subject lacking earth signs will lack common sense and practicality and find it difficult to finish anything they start. They may be scatty, unrealistic and clumsy, hopeless with money and unreliable. Planets in the 2nd, 6th and 10th houses and an emphasis on fixed signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|The Agapemonites, {{who held}} decidedly {{unconventional}} views on {{marriage and the}} role of women, relocated to Upper Clapton from their spiritual community in Spaxton, Somerset, and had clearly prospered by this time. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, the outside of the church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion.

500|$|In October 1961, the Bears—utilizing Shaughnessy's complex, {{shifting}} defensive alignments—stifled San Francisco 49ers coach Red Hickey's new shotgun formation, 31–0. Chicago {{had learned}} lessons against the Baltimore Colts who {{had attempted to}} use the shotgun the previous week. Shaughnessy explained his Chicago defensive scheme in November 1961:"We can adjust to fit three things. We have defenses to fit the [...] we face, the personnel we face and {{the situation in the}} game. Bill George calls the basic overall defense. Then Fred Williams calls the defense for the rush men. Richie Petitbon calls the defense for the backs. All of these are real bright boys, and <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> great job." ...|$|E
500|$|Back in Scranton, Jim and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} named the {{reluctant}} heads of the Party Planning Committee by Michael due to previous fights between Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Angela (Angela Kinsey). Jim and Dwight prove terrible at the job, especially when an upset Kelly (Mindy Kaling) chastises them for forgetting her birthday. They {{try to make it}} up to her by throwing a party but <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> poor job, choosing horrible decorations and forgetting Kelly's age. Dwight reads her file and learns Kelly spent time in juvenile hall, but is disappointed to learn it does not affect her job performance. Meanwhile, Andy (Ed Helms) finds himself attracted to Julia, a female potential client who is talking with Stanley (Leslie David Baker). Andy repeatedly acts awkwardly in front of Julia, and accidentally sets off her car alarm while trying to look inside and find out what music she likes. Andy admits his attraction to her to Stanley, who then gives the potential client over to Andy in exchange for two of his clients. [...] After walking her out to the car, Andy tries to kiss her, but is immediately rebuked. Andy apologizes and mentions that he just got out of a relationship. The client claims she also just got out of a relationship and Andy starts feeling a connection, but she still rejects him and he loses the account.|$|E
500|$|Le Guin {{described}} {{the role of}} magic in the novel in the following manner: [...] "in Gifts, the powers of magic are kind of warped. They are mostly used aggressively and destructively and defensively, actually. You know, it’s like having that secret weapon that they use against each other. It’s all gone kind of sour." [...] The characters in the novel often fail to understand the responsibility {{that goes along with}} their power; only {{by the end of the}} story do Orrec and Gry come to terms with their gifts, and understand the best way to use them. Orrec's power is misunderstood for much of the novel: he has inherited his mother's ability to tell stories, rather than his father's ability to unmake things. However, he also has power in his reputation, as a person to be feared. Much of the novel is concerned with the abuse of power, and the problems with following without thinking of consequences, as well as the violence that is contained in the Upland society. Although Orrec's father Canoc he too does not hesitate to use his power for his own ends: his wife Melle was taken in a raid, over the course of which Canoc slew another man. He nonetheless shows more forethought than some of the other characters in the novel, and actually asks Melle to be his wife; he also gives gifts to her town in return. Melle's stories form an important part of the children's morality, featuring as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> number of characters exhibiting kindness and altruism, in contrast to the Upland culture. The violence within the Upland society is exemplified in the person of Ogge Drum, who is depicted as a thief and a bully. He lusts after Melle, and kills her with his gift when he realizes he cannot have her.|$|E

500|$|Every November, Vukovar's {{authorities}} hold {{four days}} of festivities to commemorate the town's fall, culminating in a [...] "Procession of Memory" [...] held on 18 November. This represents the expulsion of the town's Croat inhabitants and involves a five-kilometre (3.1 mile) walk from the city's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims. It is attended by {{tens of thousands of}} people from across Croatia. Local Serbs have avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations, often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November. Until 2003, they held a separate, low-key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November. Such commemorations have been held on 18 November since then. The RSK-era term [...] "Liberation Day" [...] has been dropped, but Serbs also avoid using the Croatian terminology, instead calling it simply [...] "18 November". The issue of how to remember the Serb dead has posed particular difficulties. Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood. The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V-shaped Serbian military cap, or šajkača. After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia, the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised. The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations. Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment, such as war monuments. The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial, a large cross made from white stone, where the Vuka flows into the Danube. According to Kardov, Serbs rarely if ever go there, and they feel great stress if <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> <b>A</b> Serb boy spoke of how he wanted to know what was written on the monument but was too frightened to go and read the inscription; one day he got up the courage, ran to the monument, read it and immediately ran back to [...] "safety". As Kardov puts it, Vukovar remains divided by an [...] "invisible boundary line ... inscribed only on the cognitive map of the members of one particular group." ...|$|E

2500|$|The International Press Institute sent {{a letter}} to Muhame condemning his actions after his paper was shut down by the {{countries}} Constitutional Court.
