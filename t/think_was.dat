40|$|I {{contend that}} there are two dogmas that are still popular among {{philosophers}} of action: that agents can only desire what they <b>think</b> <b>is</b> good and that they can only intentionally pursue what they <b>think</b> <b>is</b> good.

Broadly, I argue that our best theories of action can explain the possibility of intentionally pursuing what one <b>thinks</b> <b>is</b> not at all good, that we need to allow for the possibility of intentionally pursuing what one <b>think</b> <b>is</b> not at all good, and that if we can intentionally pursue what we <b>think</b> <b>is</b> not at all good then we can desire it on similar grounds...|$|R
5|$|The Tempest {{presents}} {{relatively few}} textual problems {{in comparison with}} many of Shakespeare's other plays. First published in the First Folio in December 1623, the play is first in the volume, leading the section of comedies. The play has more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays, though {{they appear to have}} been written for readers instead of actors. Scholars infer from this that the editors of the volume, John Heminges and Henry Condell, included the directions to aid readers, and they were not necessarily Shakespeare's. Scholars have also wondered about the masque in Act 4, which some <b>think</b> <b>was</b> an interpolated afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. However, other scholars see this as unlikely, arguing that taking the masque out of the play creates more problems than it solves.|$|E

Tom Long of The Detroit News gave a D+, saying that Jack Sparrow had [...] "worn out his welcome". Despite the more linear plot, [...] "the movie is still ridiculous". He found On Stranger Tides to be [...] "precisely what you'd expect of the fourth installment of a movie based on an amusement park ride: a whole lot of noise, plenty of stunts and complete silliness." [...] British film critic Mark Kermode gave the film an overwhelmingly negative review on his 5 Live show, saying [...] "it's not as staggeringly misjudged as the third part, because it is just nothing, it is just a big empty nothing, whereas part three I <b>think</b> <b>was</b> an active atrocity, it's just nothing at all".|$|E

500|$|However, {{after the}} splendour of the premiere and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons {{departed}} {{on a tour}} of Britain to promote the film it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and box office revenue poor, as Gerry Anderson explains: [...] "When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. When we got to the next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only thing we could <b>think</b> <b>was</b> that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show.

500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E
