Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's {{president}} at the time, assigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing {{from a wide range of}} inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the Beast, and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to advance the game's plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.|$|E

25|$|Although {{antagonism}} {{about the}} expense of Byzantine domination had long persisted within Italy, the political rupture was set in motion in earnest in 726 by the iconoclasm of Emperor Leo III the Isaurian. The exarch was lynched while trying to enforce the iconoclastic edict and Pope Gregory II saw iconoclasm as <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of imperial heresies. In 731, his successor, Pope Gregory III organized a synod in Rome (attended by the Archbishop of Ravenna), which declared iconoclasm punishable by excommunication. When the exarch donated six columns of onyx to the shrine of St. Peter in thanks for the pope's assistance in his release from the Lombards, Gregory III defiantly had the material crafted into icons.|$|E

The year before, Gallucci was wounded and two of his bodyguards were killed when he tried to make a collection in a shop on First Avenue. Meanwhile, the Morello gang had fallen out with Gallucci and had formed an alliance with the Camorra gangs from Brooklyn.|$|E

His third solo record Paris 1919 (1973) steered back towards the singer-songwriter mode with a backing band that included Lowell George of Little Feat and Wilton Felder of The Crusaders. Made up of songs with arcane and complex lyrics, it has been cited by critics {{as one of his}} best. While affiliated with the label, he produced albums by Jennifer Warnes (her third, Jennifer), Chunky, Novi & Ernie, and the self-titled debut of The Modern Lovers, which Reprise chose not to release; it subsequently appeared on Beserkley Records, <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of important Cale-produced proto-punk records.

At the crime scene, Mulder meets with the LAPD detectives investigating the case, explaining that Lorre's murder is <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of seemingly vampiric serial killings that have spanned two other states. Because the killers write biblical passages in the victims' blood, Mulder believes that they {{view themselves as}} an [...] "Unholy Trinity".|$|E

[...] Mulder also finds a scrap of burned paper in the ashes, which Chao identifies as [...] "hell money", a symbolic offering to deceased spirits. The agents locate Lo's apartment, where they find his collection of charms, as well as bloodstains underneath the recently installed carpet.|$|E

500|$|The {{new plan}} {{appeared}} to make everybody happy, and a $2 million joint-services contract {{managed by the}} Air Force was awarded to Avro to build and test two Avrocars, which the Army {{referred to as the}} VZ-9-AV (with AV standing for [...] "Avro," [...] an unusual departure from normal U.S. Army nomenclature), <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of [...] "VZ" [...] aircraft. Army interest in the Avrocar program was apparently very high. Bernard Lindenbaum of the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory recalls a trip to Washington in the late 1950s to request additional funding for a study on helicopter drag reduction. Although the funding was approved, he overheard an Army General remark that the Huey would be the last helicopter the Army would buy since the helicopter would be replaced by the Avrocar.|$|E
500|$|Following the [...] incident, the Capitals went 2–5–0 {{leading up}} to their November 21 game against the Phoenix Coyotes. For the game, Boudreau again made {{headlines}} for not playing one of his star players, this time making Alexander Semin a healthy scratch (a non-dressing player). Semin led the team in penalties-in-minutes (PIMs), {{as well as being}} tied for second in the NHL with 14 minor penalties. Boudreau previously benched Semin for the second half of a game against the New Jersey Devils after the winger had taken two minor penalties and was deemed not focused. Washington defeated Phoenix in the game 4–3. NBC's Mike Halford echoed Campbell's statement when discussing the benching of Semin, commenting that it was a [...] "bold move" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of messages sent by Boudreau. Halford further questioned if the new stance would eventually cost Boudreau his job.|$|E

500|$|Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is {{investigating}} the woman's murder as <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of cases that she believes are linked by numerology. [...] She realizes that when she adds the numbers of letters in the victims' names with the numbers in their birthdates, a pattern arises. [...] While explaining the case to Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who rejects the idea that numerology is relevant or that {{the world can be}} broken down into one simple equation, Scully discovers another possible clue—marks on each of the victim's cheeks that looks like three small circles, likely imprinted by the killer's ring while he beat the victims. [...] On consulting a numerologist, who happens to have an office in the same building as the killer's apartment, Reyes ties the murders together. However, the killer also finds the numerologist, murdering her as she is on the phone with Reyes.|$|E
500|$|A major {{flood in}} 1931 {{and another in}} 1933 led to <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of {{government}} enquiries. In 1934 the [...] "Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works" [...] recommended that an outlet for the river be created to accommodate flows of up to , covering a 1in60 year flood. The work was partly financed by a Commonwealth Government grant with the State Government arranging for the balance. The State Government, western and eastern local councils and the Municipal Tramways Trust shared interest costs. The scheme was enacted in 1935 and largely completed by 1939 {{with the creation of}} the [...] "Breakout Creek" [...] channel. The scheme involved diversion of the river at Lockleys (near Adelaide Airport), with the original channel blocked and a new channel created to the sea. The reedbeds and swamps were subsequently drained and some of their area is now the site for the suburb of West Lakes.|$|E
500|$|Gellibrand then {{ordered the}} 48th Battalion, and the 47th Battalion on its right, to {{immediately}} take up {{positions on the}} forward slope of the high ground and push posts forward to the railway embankment below. The forward slope was {{in full view of}} the approaching Germans. The 47th moved forward immediately, came under heavy German shelling, and suffered casualties in moving as far as an old half-completed trench some [...] short of the railway line by 17:00. Leane took the view that Gellibrand did not know the full situation on the ground, and that he had the discretion to follow a course of action that would achieve the objective without unnecessary casualties. He decided not to move his troops forward until dark. Bean remarks on Leane again disobeying orders, but notes that the dangers of such action are mitigated when such subordinates, like Leane, have [...] "outstanding qualities of courage and judgement". He concludes, [...] "ut Leane was Leane, and Gellibrand had the sense to know it". Deayton criticises Leane's decision, describing his failure to advise the 47th Battalion of his intentions as [...] "inexcusable", and stating that the serious risk created by Leane's decision could have resulted in a disaster had there been a German attack that afternoon. Deayton also reflects that this was only <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of clashes between Leane and Gellibrand since the latter had taken over the brigade in November of the previous year.|$|E
