50|$|Waterproof {{paper is}} good for outdoor, marine, field use and general wet environments. Often {{designed}} especially for printing topographic maps. It is normally durable and <b>tear-resistant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Eisengarn, meaning [...] "iron yarn" [...] in English, {{is a very}} strong, durable, {{waxed cotton}} material. No iron is {{actually}} in the cloth. Fabric made from the yarn is shiny and highly <b>tear-resistant.</b>|$|E
50|$|Advantages of ripstop are the {{favourable}} {{strength-to-weight ratio}} and that small tears {{can not easily}} spread. Fibers used to make ripstop include cotton, silk, polyester, and polypropylene, with nylon content limited to the crosshatched threads that make it <b>tear-resistant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Eisengarn, meaning [...] "iron yarn" [...] in English, is a light-reflecting, strong, waxed-cotton thread. It {{is made by}} soaking cotton threads in a starch, {{paraffin}} wax solution. The threads are then stretched and polished. The end result of the process is a lustrous, <b>tear-resistant</b> yarn which is extremely hardwearing.|$|E
50|$|In August 2004, Melcher {{received}} a United States patent {{for the process}} of making waterproof books, called DuraBooks. DuraBooks are waterproof, <b>tear-resistant,</b> and virtually indestructible, and they are also up-cycleable, meaning their materials can be recycled in perpetuity—as opposed to regular paper, which can be recycled only a couple of times before the fibers wear out.|$|E
50|$|Despite the name, {{there is}} no iron in eisengarn. The name refers to its {{strength}} and metallic shine. It is made by soaking cotton threads in a starch and paraffin wax solution. The threads are dried and then stretched and polished by steel rollers and brushes. The end result of the process is a lustrous, <b>tear-resistant</b> yarn which is extremely hardwearing.|$|E
50|$|While it {{sometimes}} differs from a catsuit, unitard, or zentai more in purpose than appearance, the typical bondage suit {{is black and}} of very <b>tear-resistant</b> material (often reinforced by straps and barely stretchable) and includes integrated metal rings, belts, buckles, and laces to fasten it and to attach ropes or chains, as to lift and hang the wearer from the ceiling.|$|E
5000|$|Eisengarn, meaning [...] "iron yarn" [...] in English, is a light-reflecting, strong {{material}} {{invented in}} Germany in the 19th century.

The end result of the process is a lustrous, <b>tear-resistant</b> yarn which is extremely hardwearing.|$|E
5000|$|An anti-suicide blanket is a <b>tear-resistant</b> blanket {{that is used}} {{to prevent}} a hospitalized, incarcerated or {{otherwise}} detained individual from forming a noose to commit suicide. The blanket is typically made of simple and sturdily quilted nylon or similarly reinforced material. The stiffness of the blanket makes it impossible to roll or fold without continuously applied pressure. [...] The same material is used for the anti-suicide smock.|$|E
50|$|Polyester fibers are {{sometimes}} spun together with natural fibers {{to produce a}} cloth with blended properties. Cotton-polyester blends (polycotton) can be strong, wrinkle and <b>tear-resistant,</b> and reduce shrinking. Synthetic fibers in polyester also create materials with water, wind and environmental resistance compared to plant-derived fibers. Disadvantages of cotton and polyester blends include being less breathable than cotton and trapping more moisture while sticking to the skin. They are also less fire resistant and can melt when ignited.|$|E
5000|$|Neck guard - For [...] "skaters", a neck guard {{typically}} {{consists of}} a series of nylon or ABS plates for puncture resistance, with padding for comfort and fit and a <b>tear-resistant</b> nylon mesh outer covering. For goalies, the neck protector is usually a curved panel of clear Lexan and hangs just underneath the mask from nylon cords, somewhat {{in the manner of a}} metal military gorget. Both are intended to reduce the potential for injury to the neck or throat by a puck or skate blade.|$|E
5000|$|Evasion charts, are maps {{made for}} servicemembers {{to be used}} when caught behind enemy lines to perform escape and evasion, escape maps were {{secreted}} to prisoners of war by various means to aid in escape attempts. During World War II, these maps were used by many American, British, and allied servicemen to escape from behind enemy lines. [...] "The Allies needed {{to be able to}} print their clandestine maps on a material that would be hardier than paper -- material that wouldn't tear or dissolve in water" [...] Modern evasion charts, produced for the US, UK, and NATO printed on vinyl sheet in the 1960s and currently of Tyvek 'paper', permit printing of minute detail while remaining waterproof and <b>tear-resistant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An anti-suicide smock, Ferguson, turtle suit, Bam Bam suit, or suicide gown is a <b>tear-resistant</b> single-piece {{outer garment}} that is {{generally}} {{used to prevent}} a hospitalized, incarcerated, or otherwise detained individual from forming a noose with the garment to commit suicide. The smock is typically a simple, sturdily quilted, collarless, sleeveless gown with adjustable openings at the shoulders and down the front that are closed with nylon hook-and-loop or similar fasteners. The thickness of the garment {{makes it impossible to}} roll or fold the garment so it {{can be used as a}} noose. It is not a restraint and provides modesty and warmth while not impeding the mobility of the wearer. The suit covers all private areas as the wearer is to be naked under the suit for their own protection.|$|E
50|$|Excess {{moisture}} in concrete {{is defined by}} that amount of moisture emitting from the concrete subfloor that exceeds the amount allowed by the flooring manufacturer. This condition occurs when the flooring is installed before {{the water in the}} concrete mix that is not needed for hydration (strengthening) has had adequate time to evaporate. Causes of this condition include a construction schedule that does not allow at least 28 days for the slab to dry; using too much water in the concrete mix; installing the slab without a puncture- and <b>tear-resistant,</b> low-permeability vapor barrier beneath it; rewetting of the slab due to precipitation; inadequate drying conditions, which can include air temperatures that are lower than 50°F, high humidity in the surrounding air and poor airflow; and liquid water infiltration due to external sources, such as broken pipes, irrigation, improper sloping of the landscape, condensation, cleaning and maintenance, and moisture from flooring adhesives.|$|E
5000|$|The Colloid Chemistry department, {{headed by}} Markus Antonietti, {{deals with the}} {{synthesis}} of various colloidal structures in the nanometer range. This includes inorganic and metallic nanoparticles, polymers and peptide structural units, their micelles and organised phases, as well as emulsions and foams. Colloid chemistry is able to create materials with a structural hierarchy through appropriate functionalized colloids. This creates new characteristics through the [...] "teamwork" [...] of the functional groups. With appropriate architecture, these colloids can fulfill very specialized tasks. Single molecular systems cannot do this, due to their lack of complexity. An example for this is skin: There is no synthetic material which is as soft and simultaneously so <b>tear-resistant</b> and yet is made mainly of water. The secret of this also lies in the interaction between three components (collagen, hyaluronic acid, proteoglycan). This unusual combination of characteristics is only made possible by forming a superstructure [...] "in a team".|$|E
50|$|Another basic {{designation}} is organic or inorganic. Organic {{felt paper}} has a base material made with formerly living {{materials such as}} rag fibre, hessian (burlap), or cellulose fibres (wood, or jute). Organic felt papers are now considered obsolete, only comprising {{five percent of the}} market in 1987. Inorganic base products are polyester, glass fibre developed in the 1950s, and historically, asbestos mat. Polyester mat is weaker and less chemically stable than fibreglass but because it is cheap is gaining market share. Polyester mat is primarily used with the more flexible modified-bitumen felt products. Asbestos mat was the first inorganic base material but was outlawed in the 1980s for health reasons but is still in use on some buildings. Inorganic felts are lighter, more <b>tear-resistant,</b> more fire-resistant, and do not absorb water. Another type of felt paper is perforated for use in built-up roofing and is not for use as a water-resistant underlay.|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} aqueous coating compositions {{on the basis}} of polyurethane dispersions and their application for coating substrates. The coating compositions mainly consist of aqueous non-reactive physically drying polyurethane dispersions which are mixed with aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solutions. The coating compositions form highly elastic and largely <b>tear-resistant</b> protective films on substrates such as leather, wood, textile fabric or parts of the human body.

40|$|A {{description}} is given of aqueous coating compounds based on polyurethane dispersions {{together with their}} use for coating substrates. The coating compounds basically consist of aqueous, non-reactive, physically drying polyurethane dispersions mixed with casein and/or casein/ caprolactam copolymers or aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solutions. The coating compounds form highly elastic and largely <b>tear-resistant</b> protective films on substrates such as leather, wood, textile fabric or parts of the human body. The protective films exhibit high water vapour permeability and high abrasion resistance...|$|E
30|$|Because of {{possible}} difficulties arising from wearing gloves, touching accidentally or working with dirty hands, pen-based interaction should {{be supported by}} the system. Losing the pen might be an additional risk {{but it can be}} minimized by fastening it with a <b>tear-resistant</b> but flexible ribbon. Other input methods which are supported by state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf tablet PCs, e.g. speech or gestures, have to be judged critically. One the one hand, speech input usually demands high working memory resources of users and recognition rates could drastically decrease in noisy environments like MCI settings. On the other hand, gestures have to be remembered and performed correctly. This might be challenging with respect to weather or physical conditions.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} tests was carried out to {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} crash barrier designed to protect the occupants of an automobile from serious injury. The JPL barrier design is a configuration of empty aluminum beverage cans contained in a <b>tear-resistant</b> bag which, in turn, is encased in a collapsible container made of plywood and steel. Tests were conducted with a driven vehicle impacting the barrier. The basic requirements of NCHRP Report 153 were followed except that speeds of 30 mph rather than 60 mph were used. Accelerometer readings on the driver's helmet showed that the driver was never subjected to dangerous decelerations, and never experienced more than temporary discomfort. Also, all of the requirements of the cited report were met. An extrapolation of data indicated that the JPL barrier installed in front of a tree or telephone pole along a roadside would also have met the requirements at a speed of 40 mph...|$|E
40|$|Background: Spider silk is a <b>tear-resistant</b> and elastic {{biopolymer}} {{that has}} outstanding mechanical properties. Additionally, exiguous immunogenicity is anticipated for spider silks. Therefore, spider silk represents a potential ideal biomaterial for medical applications. All known spider silk proteins, so-called spidroins, reveal a composite nature of silk-specific units, allowing the recombinant production {{of individual and}} combined segments. Results: In this report, a miniaturized spidroin gene, named VSO 1 that contains repetitive motifs of MaSp 1 has been synthesized and combined to form multimers of distinct lengths, which were heterologously expressed as elastin-like peptide (ELP) fusion proteins in tobacco. The elastic penetration moduli of layered proteins were analyzed for different spidroin-based biopolymers. Moreover, we present the first immunological analysis of synthetic spidroin-based biopolymers. Characterization of the binding behavior of the sera after immunization by competitive ELISA suggested that the humoral immune response is mainly directed against the fusion partner ELP. In addition, cytocompatibility studies with murine embryonic fibroblasts indicated that recombinant spidroin-based biopolymers, in solution or as coated proteins, are well tolerated. Conclusion: The results show that spidroin-based biopolymers can induce humoral immune responses that are dependent on the fusion partner and the overall protein structure. Furthermore, cytocompatibility assays gave no indication of spidroin-derived cytotoxicity, suggesting that recombinant produced biopolymers composed of spider silk-like repetitive elements are suitable for biomedical applications...|$|E
40|$|Ligaments {{are unique}} wet {{biological}} tissues with high tensile modulus and fracture stress, combined with high bending flexibility. Developing synthetic materials with these properties {{is a significant}} challenge. Hydrogel composites made from high stiffness fabrics is a strategy to develop such unique materials; however, the ability to produce these materials has proven difficult, since common hydrogels swell in water and interact poorly with solid components, limiting the transfer of force from the fabric to the hydrogel matrix. In this work, for the first time, we successfully produce extraordinarily tough hydrogel composites by strategically selecting a recently developed tough hydrogel that de-swells in water. The new composites, consisting of polyampholyte hydrogels and glass fiber woven fabrics, exhibit extremely high effective toughness (250 000 J m(- 2)), high tear strength (similar to 65 N mm(- 1)), high tensile modulus (606 MPa), and low bending modulus (4. 7 MPa). Even though these composites are composed of water-containing, biocompatible materials, their mechanical properties are comparable to high toughness Kevlar/polyurethane blends and fiber-reinforced polymers. Importantly, the mechanical properties of these composites greatly outperform the properties of either individual component. A mechanism is proposed based on established fabric tearing theory, which will enable {{the development of a}} new generation of mechanically robust composites based on fabrics. These results will be important towards developing soft biological prosthetics, and more generally for commercial applications such as <b>tear-resistant</b> gloves and bulletproof vests...|$|E
40|$|Stinging {{cells or}} nematocytes are {{specialized}} {{cells that are}} unique to Cnidarians. They contain a highly sophisticated organelle, the nematocyst, used for locomotion, defence and capture of prey. The proteome of the nematocyst has provided unique insights into its molecular organisation. The goal of my thesis was to investigate novel molecular factors involved in aspects of nematocyst morphogenesis, structure and function. A critical part of nematocyst morphogenesis is the initiation of tubule formation by a constriction of the Golgi vesicle membrane. Nematomyosin, a newly identified non-muscle myosin type II, in the present thesis is shown to localize to a collar around the outgrowing tubule indicating {{an essential role in}} this process. Blocking of myosin II activity by Blebbistatin leads to malformed nematocyst vesicles. Tubule size control is probably facilitated by a PKD 2 channel, shown to be active at the point of maximal tubule outgrowth. The nematocyst structure has been characterized by stiff and <b>tear-resistant</b> minicollagens, although the discharge process is accompanied by extreme volume changes of the capsule. Here, I have characterized the novel elastic protein Cnidoin that shares structural homology with the spider silk protein Spidroin- 2. Cnidoin is expressed in developing nematocytes and locates to wall and tubule structures. Recombinant Cnidoin showed a high tendency to aggregate and to form linear fibres. Cnidoin thus behaves as a typical elastic protein. Being {{an integral part of the}} mature nematocyst it could provide the molecular basis for the energy stored that is released in the ultrafast discharge process. The discharge of nematocysts is triggered by chemical and mechanical stimuli that are detected by the cnidocil at the apical end of the nematocyte. The cnidocil is surrounded by a set of stereocilia, providing a similar arrangement as vertebrate hair cells. A newly identified calcium channel of the TrpA family is shown to locate to stereocilia of the Hydra cnidocil apparatus. The protein can be visualized by immunostainings during developmental stages as well as in mature capsules and thus represents a candidate for mechanosensation during discharge. Nematocalcin, a penta-EF-hand protein, was also located to the stereocilia, but at a more basal position than TrpA, where it might act as a modulatory factor associated with the mechanosensory apparatus...|$|E
