5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax has <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E
5|$|This is a semiautomatic version {{manufactured}} for {{the civilian}} sport shooting market. Derived from the fully automatic military firearm, this version shares {{most of the}} major components of the military models {{with the exception of the}} firing mechanism and the addition of welded internal components to prevent conversion to a fully automatic mode. Notably, this version retains <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> belt fed, an uncommon feature in civilian firearms.|$|E
5|$|Life {{with her}} {{grandmother}} was strict and, as Mambo felt depressed without her father, she became withdrawn, sticking to a daily routine of prayers and studying. However, she performed well at school, ranking amongst the top five in her class at Yapenka Elementary School in South Jakarta. She later became more outgoing and was known among {{her family and friends}} as a very feminine child, enjoying dresses and make-up. While in elementary school she began singing along with songs by her favourite singers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston in her bedroom. Her mother, believing that Mambo had <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a professional singer, convinced Mambo to try and sing in public while the latter was still in junior high school.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{communicate}} <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} important things that the Almighty God has given to human beings. People can express their ideas, feeling, and desires by communicating. Long time before the writing symbols were used, people had already communicated orally. Even the writing system had been found; the oral communication still takes more important role. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> communicate <b>is</b> not only needed for daily conversation, but also in other occasions, such as in parliament building, seminars, or conferences. Researchers have shown that about 75...|$|R
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced {{to pay taxes on}} it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E
5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{manufacturing}} enterprises {{should have}} <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> response quickly <b>to</b> {{the changes in}} product variety, mix and volume while minimizing material handling cost. For achieving this, enterprises have to adapt their production system to the new circumstance by adjusting facilities layout.

In this paper, an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) <b>is</b> proposed <b>to</b> optimize the above two objectives.
