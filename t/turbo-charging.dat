25|$|A {{turbocharger}} remedies {{this problem}} by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures (turbo-normalizing), or even much higher (<b>turbo-charging),</b> {{in order to produce}} rated power at high altitude. Since the size of the turbocharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the turbocharger is oversized for low altitude. The speed of the turbocharger is controlled by a wastegate. Early systems used a fixed wastegate, resulting in a turbocharger that functioned much like a supercharger. Later systems utilized an adjustable wastegate, controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or electric system. When the aircraft is at low altitude the wastegate is usually fully open, venting all the exhaust gases overboard. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the wastegate must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the wastegate fully closes and the engine still produces full power is the critical altitude. When the aircraft climbs above the critical altitude, engine power output decreases as altitude increases, just as it would in a naturally aspirated engine.|$|E
2500|$|... saw {{the end of}} <b>turbo-charging</b> in Formula One. From this date, {{the formula}} was for 3.5-litre {{normally}} aspirated engines of no greater than 12 cylinders, which was {{a direct consequence of}} lobbying by Ferrari for the previous few years. The team {{went so far as to}} construct an Indycar, the Ferrari 637, as a threat to the FIA that if they did not get what they wanted, namely the allowance of V12 engines under the revised formula, they could take part in another series. Due to the expected extreme high revs and consequent narrow power band expected of the new engines, technical director John Barnard insisted upon the development of a revolutionary new gear-shifting arrangement– the paddle-operated, semi-automatic gearbox. In pre season testing, the experimental system proved extremely troublesome, with newly arrived driver Nigel Mansell being unable to compete more than a handful of laps, but nonetheless they managed a debut win at the opening round in Brazil. Horrendous reliability led to Berger being unable to score a point until a run of podiums at Monza, Estoril and Jerez including a win at Estoril. Mansell scored a memorable win at Budapest where he overtook world champion Ayrton Senna for the win after qualifying far down the field in twelfth. He then dedicated the race to the memory of Enzo Ferrari as the win came a year after the latter's death.|$|E

50|$|In 1951 MAN {{presented}} a turbocharged version of their MK26 truck, {{although it was}} never put into mass production. Series production of turbocharged diesel trucks commenced in 1954, when both MAN 750TL1 and Volvo Titan Turbo {{were introduced to the}} markets. The building of the Interstate Highway System in the USA from 1956 made long-distance road transportation of goods more attractive. To keep up with general traffic, more powerful engines came in increasing demand. Cummins, Detroit, and CAT all had <b>turbo-charging</b> as an option by the late-1960s. In Europe, legislation was introduced in Germany mandating a minimum power-to-weight ratio for trucks; by the late 1960s, a 38-tonne consist had to have at least 304 hp. Most manufacturers met these requirement with large-displacement natural aspiration engines, some with the option of large-displacement or <b>turbo-charging,</b> while Scania and Volvo where among those that only provided turbocharged trucks that met the demands. <b>Turbo-charging</b> was not preferred initially as the engines were perceived to be less reliable, however the method won a decisive victory by the mid-1970s as the 1973 oil crisis increased fuel costs. The last market to see the absolute penetration of turbo diesels was Japan, where legislation on particle emissions effectively mandated natural aspiration engines until effective particle filters became available.|$|E

With {{the help of}} geometrically variable <b>turbo-charging</b> system this also increases the engines' torque at low engine speeds (1200-1800 RPM). Low speed diesel engine like the MAN S80ME-C7 have achieved an overall energy conversion efficiency of 54.4%, which is the highest conversion of fuel into power by any single-cycle internal or external combustion engine. Engines in large diesel trucks, buses, and newer diesel cars can achieve peak efficiencies around 45%.|$|E

5000|$|Diesel engines {{can accept}} super- or <b>turbo-charging</b> {{pressure}} without any natural limit, constrained {{only by the}} design and operating limits of engine components, such as pressure, speed and load. This is unlike petrol engines, which inevitably suffer detonation at higher pressure if engine tuning and/or fuel octane adjustments are not made to compensate. Diesel engines also require additional fuel and increased injection timing advance as cylinder pressures and temperatures increase, otherwise excessive heat and available oxygen will cause a [...] "lean" [...] condition {{that will result in}} combustible materials in the engine cylinders, such as the aluminum pistons, being burned as the engine starves for fuel. This is identical to what occurs in spark-ignition engines when a similar lean condition occurs.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the (naturally aspirated) N52, N53 and (turbocharged) N55, the N54 {{does not}} use {{variable}} valve lift (called valvetronic by BMW) or a magnesium alloy block. This is because the newer N52 aluminum-magnesium engine block was not deemed as suitable for <b>turbo-charging</b> with the above-mentioned engineering goals. Instead, the N54 engine {{is based on the}} older BMW M54 engine. It therefore features an aluminium construction and variable valve timing to both camshafts (called dual VANOS by BMW). Differences between the M54 and N54 include twin turbochargers, an intercooler, direct injection, a open-deck single-piece block and an electric water pump. As per the M54B30, the N54 has a capacity of [...] With a weight of 195 kg, the N54 is 34 kg heavier than the N52.|$|E
50|$|The {{reverse flow}} head was {{ideally suited to}} a {{production}} carbureted engine due to its low rpm performance and ease of manufacture. The design could be modified for high performance by porting (in particular siamese) and isolating the inlet manifold from the exhaust header. The configuration is also perfect for carbureted non-intercooled <b>turbo-charging.</b> However, the advent of fuel injection and electronic ignition has made most of the reverse-flow head's advantages redundant in a modern engine {{and as a result}} the design has lost its popularity. The reverse-flow head still enjoys immense popularity among enthusiasts including Leyland Mini, Chrysler Slant-6, Holden and Ford Inline 6 fans. In fact some Australian Ford enthusiasts consider the 250 2V reverse-flow head to be superior to the Honda designed cross-flow head that replaced it. The reverse-flow head is a great example of the progress of modern engineering and the influence of trends on engineering design.|$|E

In 1984, it was reworked for installation in high specification 2.0 L versions of the front wheel drive Austin Maestro and Austin Montego, where it was later optionally available with fuel injection or <b>turbo-charging.</b> This installation of the O-Series was adapted for use with the Honda PG-1 end-on manual gearbox, replacing the gearbox-in-sump design traditionally used on British Leyland front-wheel-drive products.

50|$|The {{conflicting}} design {{goals for}} economy cars - small size with maximum usable interior space, low cost and light weight with acceptable safety performance (light cars {{have a higher}} ratio of unsprung suspension mass to sprung mass, which affects ride quality) {{and the need for}} light materials with acceptable durability - continue to stimulate innovative development. Technology improvements such as electronic engine management, adoption of four valves per cylinder, variable valve timing, direct injection of petrol/Gasoline and diesel, hybrid power, and smoother, more powerful diesel engines with very high pressure electronic injection, have dramatically improved fuel economy and performance. The latest technologies to improve efficiency are engine downsizing and automatic engine stop-start. Automatic engine stop-start systems like VWs BlueMotion, shut the engine down when the car is stopped to reduce idling emissions and boost economy, and it is now mandatory not to idle unnecessarily in cities in Germany. It is an updated version of the 1980s VW 'Formel E' system that was developed into the 1990s VW 'Ecomatic' system. The application of <b>turbo-charging</b> to down-sized engines is one way to achieve efficiency benefits into fuel economy and emission benefits instead of for performance. The recent Fiat 'Multiair' system, is an electro-hydraulic development of variable valve timing that allows the engine management computer to control valve timing, improving engine efficiency, giving better torque, power, economy, and emissions. Safety design is a particular challenge in a small, lightweight car. This is an area where Renault has been particularly successful. Sport compacts and hot hatches have developed into their own competitive genre. Although their economy has been compromised, these models offer higher performance because of the lightness of the platforms that they are based upon.|$|E
