40|$|We {{consider}} the Pohlmeyer-type reduced theory found by explicitly solving the Virasoro constraints {{in the formulation}} of AdS 5 × S 5 superstring in terms of supercoset <b>currents.</b> <b>The</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>set</b> of classically equivalent, integrable Lagrangian equations of motion has the advantage of involving only a physical number of degrees of freedom and yet being 2 d Lorentz invariant. The corresponding reduced theory action may be written as a gauged WZW model coupled to fermions with further bosonic and fermionic potential terms. Since the AdS 5 × S 5 superstring sigma model is conformally invariant, its classical relation to the reduced theory may extend to the quantum level only if the latter is, in fact, UV finite. This theory is power counting renormalizable with the only possible divergences being of potential type. We explicitly verify its 1 -loop finiteness and show that the 2 -loop divergences are, in general, scheme dependent and vanish in dimensional reduction scheme. We expect that the reduced theory is finite to all orders in the loop expansion...|$|R
40|$|Reverse product flows are {{no longer}} seen as a threat but are {{perceived}} {{as an opportunity to}} gain additional benefits. This change of perception originates from multiple aspects. Against the background of scarce resources and increasing consumption worldwide, the materials and components included in products in use become valuable supplies for future new production. On the other hand, in the context of spreading popularity of e-commerce and shortened product life cycles, returned products have increasing inherent value. However, the known challenge of matching supply and demand is further complicated by the involvement of multiple, independent decision makers and to a great extent by the heterogeneity of supplies - the reverse product flows. Consequently, the consideration of decentralized Closed-Loop Supply Chains raises the interest of coordination in such a context. In this thesis we address coordination in Closed-Loop Supply Chains. In Chapter 1, we introduce a new business case, based on which we derive concrete research needs. In Chapter 3, the coordination of the reverse-Supply-Chain-specific process step “disposition" is addressed. To this end, we compare the introduced business case setting with our benchmark, a central decision maker. We see that <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>setting</b> <b>results</b> in a suboptimal Closed-Loop Supply Chain solution. To overcome this SC deficiency, we develop a coordinating mechanism. Beyond the analysis, we provide a numerical example to illustrate our insights. Closed-Loop Supply Chains are characterized by heterogeneous supplies with respect to quality, quantity, and timing. The increase in supply uncertainty originates from the customer's use phase, which in many cases is a kind of “black box" for the other actors in Closed-Loop Supply Chains. In Chapter 4, we address customer decisions and identify the coordination needs resulting from these decisions. Furthermore, we discuss the adaptability of existing mechanisms to the coordination requirements at the customer interface. ...|$|R

40|$|Background. Children {{growing up}} in poverty face {{multiple}} biological and psychosocial risks, {{some of which are}} primarily found in low to middle income countries. Unfavourable biological circumstances, such as inadequate nutrition and childhood illnesses put children at risk for compromised development. Early child development is a precursor for later cognitive functioning and may have lasting consequences for academic achievement and lifelong quality of life. There is a need to identify modifiable risk factors for poor development in order to break the vicious cycle of poverty and poor development. Objectives. The objectives of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> thesis are threefold. First, to examine the effect of two recommended daily allowances of vitamin B 12 and/or folic acid for six months on neurodevelopment. Second, to identify other relevant risk factors for poor neurodevelopment in young North Indian children; and, finally, to assess the feasibility of the screening tool Ages and Stages Questionnaire 3 rd ed. (ASQ- 3) administered by field supervisors to collect reliable data on neurodevelopment in this North Indian field setting. Methods. In a randomized double blind trial, children six to 30 months were given vitamin B 12 and/or folic acid or placebo daily for six months. At the end of the study, we measured neurodevelopment in 422 children by ASQ- 3 administered directly with the child. During the six months study period, we collected data on childhood illnesses bi-weekly. Information regarding socioeconomic status was collected at baseline, and information regarding stimulation and learning opportunities was collected at end study. Applying linear and logistic regression models, we measured the effect of vitamin B 12 and/or folic acid on neurodevelopment, and identified other predictors of developmental status. We also assessed the psychometric properties of the ASQ- 3 in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>setting.</b> <b>Results.</b> Compared to placebo, children who received both vitamin B 12 and folic acid had 0. 45 (95 % CI 0. 19, 0. 73) and 0. 28 (95 % CI 0. 02, 0. 54) higher SD-units in the domains of gross motor and problem solving functioning, respectively. The effect was highest in selected subgroups consisting of stunted children, those with evidenceof folate and vitamin B 12 deficiency and in those who were younger than 24 months {{at the end of the}} study. With the exception of a significant improvement in gross motor scores by vitamin B 12 alone, supplementation of either vitamin alone had no effect on any of the outcomes measures. In the multiple regression models, we were able to explain 30. 6 % of the variation in the total ASQ- 3 score. Height for age and weight for height z-scores were positively associated with the total ASQ- 3 score, while the number of days with diarrhea was negatively correlated. Variables defined as stimulation and learning opportunities explained most of the variation (25. 9 %). Our results also indicate that it is possible to collect reliable data on neurodevelopment in this field setting using ASQ- 3. Conclusion. Vitamin B 12 and folate deficiency, stunting and prolonged diarrhea illness may be important modifiable biological risks adverse neurodevelopment in young children in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> setting. Adequate stimulation and responsive care are crucial for healthy development. Interventions targeting young children {{growing up in}} poverty in LMIC should integrate various modifiable risk factors including nutrition, hygiene and early child stimulation to maximize developmental potential in children. </p...|$|R
