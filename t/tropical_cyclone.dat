5|$|As Tam was developing, {{residents}} {{attempted to}} evacuate the island by plane, with the primary target of Fiji. Only a few flights took off before officials closed the airport, stranding numerous passengers. Late on January 11, RSMC Nadi placed Tonga and Futuna under a <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> alert and also placed Tonga and Wallis under a strong wind warning. Early the next day RSMC Nadi placed northern Tonga under a <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> gale warning. Later that morning they canceled the <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> alert for Wallis and Futuna as Tam was not expected to directly affect Futuna anymore. During that afternoon RSMC Nadi placed Niue under a <b>Tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> alert, as they predicted that Niue {{would be affected by}} Tam within 24 hours. Early on January 13 RSMC Nadi cancelled the <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> warnings and alerts for Tonga, whilst at the same time placing Niue under a <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> gale warning, however this gale warning was canceled later that day as Tam moved into the southern ocean.|$|E

40|$|AbstractComposite mean {{synoptic}} {{analyses are}} presented for seven different meteorological variables {{to distinguish between}} landfalling <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> {{along the coast of}} the Gulf of Mexico that are substantially tornadic (<b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> that produce at least four tornadoes) and those that are not substantially tornadic (<b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> that produce no more than one tornado). From 1985 to 2006, 15 landfalling <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> were identified as being substantially tornadic, while an additional 15 were identified as being non-substantially tornadic. These 30 <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> are considered separately amongst three sectors along the Gulf Coast in computing mean synoptic variables. Some findings for substantially tornadic <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> were: (1) the southeastern United States was broadly located within the right entrance region of an upper-level jet streak centered over the northeastern United States; (2) organized, large, and directionally-symmetric 850 -hPa flow was maximized in the northeastern semicircle of the cyclonic envelope; (3) a distinct, organized, and symmetric mean sea level pressure pattern over the Gulf was associated with the tropical cyclones; (4) a strong 600 -hPa relative humidity gradient was present in the northeastern semicircle of the cyclone; and (5) a dry intrusion was found in the eastern semicircle in some cases of substantially tornadic <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones.</b> These commonalities associated with the substantially tornadic <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> were not found {{to be associated with the}} non-substantially tornadic <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones...</b>|$|R
5|$|Severe <b>Tropical</b> <b>Cyclone</b> Anne {{was one of}} {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclones within the South Pacific basin during the 1980s. The cyclone was first noted on January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the North-Western Pacific basin. Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward. Once it became a <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone,</b> it was named Anne on January 8. The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> to affect Vanuatu within four years. On January11, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category4 on the Australian <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> intensity scale. After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> to affect the French Overseas Territory. The system subsequently weakened as it started to interact with <b>Tropical</b> <b>Cyclone</b> Agi. Anne weakened into a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia.|$|E
5|$|Severe <b>Tropical</b> <b>Cyclone</b> Keli (NPMOC/JTWC Designation: 38P) was {{the first}} {{recorded}} post-season <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> to form in June within the South Pacific Ocean. The system formed on June 7, 1997, about 460 kilometers (285mi) {{to the north of}} Tokelau. The depression gradually developed {{over the next few days}} while moving southwestward. It was designated as <b>Tropical</b> <b>Cyclone</b> Keli early the next day. Cyclone Keli intensified, slowly reaching its 10-minute peak wind speeds of 150km/h, (90mph), which made it a Category 3 severe <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> on the Australian <b>Tropical</b> <b>Cyclone</b> Intensity Scale. As it came under the influence of strong mid latitude westerlies and moved into an area of strong vertical wind shear, the cyclone started to weaken and was declared as extratropical on June 15.|$|E
5|$|Severe <b>Tropical</b> <b>Cyclone</b> Magda was a {{relatively}} small <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> that brought minor damage to parts of Western Australia in January 2010.

40|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> may {{undergo a}} major {{transition}} in their structure when they encounter circumstances {{that do not}} support the tropical structure of such a cyclone. This is called extratropical transition (ET). However, ET can take place {{in a number of different}} ways. To gain insight in these different ways of phase transition, this study uses a relatively high-resolution reanalysis dataset called MERRA and categorizes all <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> between 1987 and 2003 based on their thermal symmetry and core nature. The study also review the trajectory these <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> follow throughout the mid-latitudes. Generally, <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> that enter mid-latitudes follow a curved path from different places in the tropics towards the East American Coast, along which they tend to turn eastward along the Gulf Stream and when the influence of the westerlies becomes important. The amount of <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> that enter the mid-latitudes correlates well with the amount of <b>tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> in general (r = 0. 77), although it does not correlate well with the amount of cyclones that enters Europe (r = 0. 46). Six different categories of phase cycles are found. 1) <b>Tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> that undergo almost no transition. Cyclones going through this phase cycle are generally weaker in pressure and winds and do not reach far north. 2) <b>Tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> that become thermally asymmetric while retaining their warm lower core. These are relatively strong and reach far north. 3) <b>Tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> that become thermally asymmetric and then grow cold. Their tracks are close to the East American coast and are relatively strong. 4) <b>Tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> whose core cools down and then start developing the asymmetric structure of an extratropical cyclone. These cyclones are highly variable in strength and track. 5) <b>Tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> that seclude a shallow warm core after having had the extratropical characteristics of asymmetry and a cold-core nature. These cyclones are relatively strong and generally come far north. 6) <b>Tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> that seclude a deep warm core after having had a shallow warm seclusion. These cyclones penetrate farthest north and are the strongest in pressure and winds...|$|R
