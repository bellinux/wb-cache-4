5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system. This direction is used when <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>is</b> {{the one that}} generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the audio output from the TV needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the above}} example the AV Receiver must report {{whether it has}} {{downstream}} devices or not using the REPEATER bit. E.g. when <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>is</b> turned on, the AV Receiver should set REPEATER=TRUE, and when TV is turned off it sets REPEATER=FALSE. Since there is no proper way to notify on REPEATER status change, the AV Receiver must reset the connection with the Source. In order to avoid this redundant reset cycles on the connections, which has annoying user-experience, HDCP v1.x allows devices that are potentially Repeater to set the REPEATER all the time, even when no downstream devices are connected (e.g. while <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>is</b> off). In HDCP v2.x that smart has been lost and the Repeater must not keep the REPEATER flag set once it has no downstream devices.|$|E

5000|$|As for modal logic, the {{inference}} rules modus ponens and necessitation suffice also for dynamic logic {{as the only}} primitive rules it needs, as noted above. However, as usual in logic, many more rules {{can be derived from}} these {{with the help of the}} axioms. An example instance of such a derived rule in dynamic logic is that if kicking a broken TV once can't possibly fix it, then repeatedly kicking it can't possibly fix it either. Writing [...] for the action of kicking the TV, and [...] for the proposition that <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>is</b> broken, dynamic logic expresses this inference as , having as premise [...] and as conclusion [...] The meaning of [...] is that it is guaranteed that after kicking the TV, it is broken. Hence the premise [...] means that if <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>is</b> broken, then after kicking it once it will still be broken. [...] denotes the action of kicking the TV zero or more times. Hence the conclusion [...] means that if <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>is</b> broken, then after kicking it zero or more times it will still be broken. For if not, then after the second-to-last kick the TV would be in a state where kicking it once more would fix it, which the premise claims can never happen under any circumstances.|$|E
