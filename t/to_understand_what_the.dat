Currently some scholars attribute an age of 11 thousand years, others 8 thousand, and some have suggested 5 thousand years old. This individual was originally identified as a male, but recent research confirms a female identity, although this is still a subject of discussion.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E

500|$|Strength of mind, {{by which}} Wollstonecraft meant [...] "the {{degree to which}} [...] can {{independently}} reach its own conclusions" [...] (emphasis in original), is central to her idea of the female genius. Merely imitating others is not enough, even if one imitates the [...] "correct" [...] actions and thoughts. Reason, for Wollstonecraft, is what controls the emotions; without reason, she contends, people would fail to understand their own feelings. Moreover, reason allows for the distinction between a useful sensibility and a harmful sensualism. She writes: [...] "sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these raptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by what strikes his gross senses." [...] Useful sensibility allows Mary to embark upon charity projects. Yet, this highly attuned sensibility separates the classes along emotional lines: only the middle-class Mary is able <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> poor around her require.|$|E

He also said it was possible Clinton was not [...] "technically sophisticated" [...] enough <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> three classified markings meant. The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it [...] "is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account." [...] Comey stated that although Clinton or her colleagues were [...] "extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information", the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that [...] "no charges are appropriate in this case." [...] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers while secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges.|$|E
500|$|If {{the player}} plays the game again, they start {{just after the}} five-year skip. They learn about Kainé's past, {{including}} that she is intersex, which along {{with the death of}} her parents resulted in her ostracism as a child, and that she is partially possessed by a Shade. The player gains the ability <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> shades are saying, including the one possessing Kainé, though in-game Nier, Weiss, and Emil are still unable to. Additional cutscenes are also shown, giving the motivations and backstory behind the Shade bosses that are fought and showing them as sentient people trying to defend their friends against Nier. The ending to the second playthrough shows that Emil survives his sacrifice, and that Gestalt Nier and Yonah are reunited in the afterlife. A third or further playthrough presents the player with a choice in the ending to save Kainé, who is seen to be dying in agony; Nier can either kill her to end her suffering (the third ending), or sacrifice his life for her (the fourth ending). The latter choice not only erases all memory of him from the other characters' minds, shown in a final cutscene, but also deletes all of the player's saved progress, as if the game had never been played. Moreover, if the player wants to start a new game, they will be unable to enter the same name chosen for the previous playthrough for the Nier character. The events of [...] take place after this ending.|$|E

2500|$|The art style from Disney Infinity, {{in which}} every {{character}} and object is designed {{to look like a}} toy and was co-designed by Pixar, was carried over to Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes.

[...] Each character goes through multiple stages of development, including how they will look in the game and what their figurine's pose will be.
