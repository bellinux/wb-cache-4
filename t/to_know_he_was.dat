5|$|During the journey, Pattle {{developed}} a fever and high temperature. Nevertheless, on 19 April {{he took to}} the skies in several missions. By this date, Pattle's fever had metamorphosed into influenza and his condition had worsened. He did not want his squadron <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unwell. Pattle feared the effect it would have on morale and vowed to continue flying. The officer commanding No. 80 Squadron, Tap Jones, visited Pattle {{the day before and}} noticed he was very gaunt, drawn and that he had lost weight. Jones helped the weakened Pattle change into his flying gear. Jones was acting wing commander, but did not ban Pattle from operations. Pattle claimed six victories this day — three Ju 88s and three Bf 109s — plus one Henschel Hs 126 shared and two probables (a Ju 88 and a Bf 109). The battle with the Bf 109s took place over Eleusis and Tanagra airfields. He engaged III./Jagdgeschwader 77 (Fighter Wing 77 or JG 77) in a head-on position and executed an Immelmann turn which took him behind and above the Messerschmitts and allowed him to claim three of them shot down. No. 33 Squadron claimed four Bf 109s (three were lost). Among the victims was the German ace, Kurt Ubben. Ubben landed in Allied territory and was picked up by a Fieseler Fi 156, escaping to his own lines.|$|E
25|$|Roommate {{conflicts}} {{inside the}} residential dorms {{can lead to}} active bullying. In fall 2012, a Rutgers University student committed suicide after his roommate had been filming him and his boyfriend engaging in sexual activities and posted the video online for all to see. The roommate {{said he did not}} want him dead, but wanted his friends <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> disgusted by his behavior.|$|E
500|$|When Stewie is {{fantasizing about}} murdering and harming Lois, he {{performs}} several karate and kung-fu moves. This is {{a reference to}} an individual whom Mark Hentemann, a writer for Family Guy, used <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> the boy who would come to school, car washes or other events and tell stories {{about the people who}} he had been in physical fights with. During the scene when Stewie describes Lois as being the female version of Bonnie Hunt, MacFarlane comments that he feels bad about that joke, as just before it was broadcast— Hunt telephoned him on his mobile phone and told him about how much she enjoyed the show, however the gag was not removed due to its expected airing date being so close to when the telephone call was made. On the uncut version of this episode, there is a scene where Peter sleepily mistakes Stewie's mouth for Lois's genitals, muttering, [...] "Oh, you are so ready!" [...] The edited TV version does not have this part, but leaves in the first half, in which Peter sleepily mistakes Stewie's nose for Lois's nipple.|$|E

2500|$|Released in 1976, the two-record set {{included}} Paul Jones as Juan Perón, Colm Wilkinson as Che, Barbara Dickson as Perón's mistress, and Tony Christie as Agustín Magaldi. The writers {{had originally}} considered Steve Marriott and John Fogerty {{but neither was}} interested. Murray Head, who had enormous success with the Superstar album, recorded some demos but Rice later admitted they [...] "didn't really reproduce the magic that his portrayal of Judas had." [...] Colm Wilkinson had recently played Judas in the London production of Superstar and agreed to audition: [...] "It only {{took a couple of}} verses <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> our man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kamal Hasan {{was close}} friend of Khanna and Kamal quoted in an {{interview}} [...] "He probably hadn’t been to a public theatre since he became a star. When we reached, things were okay. He enjoyed the mediocre film (The Swarm) thoroughly and refused to leave until the end titles. That’s when I panicked. This was Rajesh Khanna, {{the star of the}} millennium. If audiences got <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> present there would be a stampede and blood on my hands. But Mr Khanna refused to listen. He stayed on till the end. The inevitable happened after the show. All hell broke loose as audiences realised he was there. I became Rajesh Khanna’s bodyguard and security officer as I took him through the crowd. His shirt was torn, but he was enjoying himself thoroughly. He giggled and chuckled like a child." [...] Khanna starred in remakes of 3 films of Kamal and in return Kamal acted in 2 remakes of Khanna's films.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{keep away}} from me, or I'll lay you out," [...] Wilton Davis responded desperately, brandishing a short iron bar in his right hand. [...] "Besides, you just wait if you want to, and I'll lay you out afterward. But first of all I'm going to lay out that dog. Come on along and see--damn him! How was I <b>to</b> <b>know?</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a new one. He never peeped in rehearsal. How was I <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to yap when we {{arranged}} the set behind you?" ...|$|E
50|$|Later, Robert {{sees the}} package his mom Ellen had sent, and reads the note inside. She would <b>be</b> happy <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> making {{time for his}} family just as she wanted for Robert.|$|R
6000|$|... "The captain's {{a little}} musical, this morning--waal--if go I must, {{as there was}} two on us out, let us go to these savages together. I saw enough of that man, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> reliable; and if he'll go, I'll go." ...|$|R
50|$|Lew: A {{homeless}} man with serious mental instabilities. <b>He</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more than <b>he</b> should, things that both Zixx and Deeth want <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{constantly on the}} run from his past, but becomes a frequent source of help and advice for Zixx and the others.|$|R
60|$|Sammy's eyes sparkled with mischief. He {{had made}} Shadow angry, {{and he had}} found out what he wanted <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> sure that Shadow had not caught Chatterer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Farebrother {{has just}} sent up {{a message to}} say that he wants to speak to me. He is below. I thought you might like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> there, if you had {{anything}} to say to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur is ungrateful," [...] she {{declared}} {{with a little}} grimace. [...] "It is only that which I desire <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> such a beau garçon, that young Englishman. You will tell me that?" [...] she whispered.|$|E

6000|$|... "I should hope not, certainly, {{although}} it may be well to guard even against such a misfortune. But I am of opinion it is quite as important <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether <b>he</b> <b>is</b> worthy <b>to</b> be her husband as it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in a situation to become so." ...|$|R
50|$|Kick {{was also}} editor-at-large for The Disinformation Company, {{and has written}} three books and edited six anthologies for them, {{including}} You Are Being Lied To and 50 Things You're Not Supposed <b>to</b> <b>Know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> currently editing an anthology of classic and contemporary poems about death for Disinformation and Red Wheel/Weiser.|$|R
60|$|Deering hesitated. He {{was big and}} muscular, but he {{admitted}} that on the rocks Stannard was the better man. Moreover, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> accountable for Jimmy's plunge had shaken him, and he saw Stannard was very cool.|$|E
6000|$|... "In England. She seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at the Dayspring, and managed, I fancy, intentionally, {{to leave}} me with the {{impression}} that they were especial friends in the Old Country. I wonder if she knows he will be on board to-day?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was indeed}} {{at a loss}} what to say. She could not bring herself to ask him whether he had been {{influenced}} by Trixton Brent. If he had, she told herself, she did not wish <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> her husband, after all, {{and it would be}} too humiliating. And then he had taken the house.|$|E
60|$|It {{clung to}} me, that word he had used. For a man <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> weak; {{it sounds a}} paradox, but a man must be strong <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that. And {{dwelling}} upon this, and upon his patience and his gentleness, there came to me suddenly remembrance of that postscript, the significance of which I had not understood.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes--no--at {{least she}} {{has told me}} of her intentions. Highly proper in the old girl, isn't it? They will settle it to-night, of course. I'll have the grounds laid out, and make quite a pretty modern place of it. It has quite taken a weight off my mind <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> so well {{provided}} for.' ...|$|R

60|$|RIDGEON. That is {{what the}} public doctor always thinks of the private doctor. Well, Blenkinsop ought <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a private doctor long enough himself. Come! you have talked at me long enough. Talk to me. You have {{something}} to reproach me with. There is reproach in your face, in your voice: you are full of it. Out with it.|$|E
60|$|The {{poor old}} Frenchman fared worse. They seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> owner, and {{probably}} {{thought he could}} give the best account of the money. At any rate, he was unmercifully flogged, though he held out to the last, refusing to betray his doubloons. The boy was next attacked-with threats of throwing him overboard. This extracted the secret, and the doubloons were soon discovered.|$|E
60|$|Olivia was embarrassed, {{although}} her embarrassment was not obvious. She had begun by wanting to baffle Mrs. Austin, whose object for sending Kit on board Mossamedes was plain. This, however, was some time since, {{and now she}} did not know what she did want. She would not acknowledge Kit her lover, but she liked <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about. All the same, her efforts to separate him from Wolf were to some extent unselfish.|$|E
50|$|Deva disguises {{himself as}} Shiva and goes near Priya. Priya comes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Deva and escapes from him before {{shooting}} {{him with her}} revolver. Deva falls in pool and dies. Deva's soul talks about his inability to express his feeling as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mute. Shiva comes and she narrates the whole incident to him. Both of them hug each other tearfully.|$|R

Caption: "Modern, {{so-called}} "trick" houses with overhanging roofs and plenty of glass serve no useful purpose unless they let a builder provide more home for less money, says P. I.

60|$|She {{felt that}} she had shown her {{feelings}} with raw candor, and the worst was that Dick was right. Though he thought she had robbed him, and was somehow her father's enemy, she did like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> near. Then there had been something curious in his tone and he had asked her nothing about her father's voyage. Indeed, {{it looked as if}} he meant to avoid the subject, although politeness demanded some remark.|$|E
60|$|There {{they were}} {{for all the world}} like two little heaps of snow. Jumper didn't move so much as a hair. Whitey didn't move so much as a feather. Both were waiting and watching. Jumper didn't move because he knew that Whitey was there. Whitey didn't move because he didn't want any one <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> there, and didn't know that Jumper was there. Jumper was sitting still because he was afraid. Whitey was sitting still because he was hungry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he has," [...] she replied, shyly. [...] "But such a confession! He told {{it as if}} {{to explain}} {{what he thought was}} boldness on his part. He {{had fallen in love with}} me at first sight!... And then meeting me was too much for him. He wanted me <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> going away to war. He asked nothing.... He seemed to {{apologize}} for--for daring to love me. He asked nothing. And he has absolutely not the slightest idea I care for him." ...|$|E
50|$|Raja (Rajendra Prasad) & Aasa (Indraja) {{love each}} other and they get ready to engage. Just {{the day before the}} {{engagement}} Raja comes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> having blood cancer and going to die in few days. Even then Aasa insists him to marry her and forcibly makes him do so. Rest of story is how Aasa's hope & faith protects Raja from his death.|$|R
6000|$|... "There you are mistaken, serjeant Joyce," [...] {{the youth}} observed, firmly. [...] "I'm for my country, and I'd quit this {{house in a}} minute, did I believe captain Willoughby meant to help the crown.

60|$|Instead {{of wanting}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> she desired <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where <b>he</b> <b>was!</b> I {{pointed toward the}} back dining-room, which had been made into a bedroom for Philip. He had chosen it himself, {{when he first came}} to stay with us, because the window opened into the garden, and he could slip out and smoke at any hour of the day or night, when he pleased.|$|R
