Questions were raised about how Beyoncé agreed to be known as a bride of another celebrity person. During an interview with Vogue, Beyoncé described herself as a [...] "modern-day feminist" [...] and further spoke about her decision to reference her husband's name: [...] "I feel like Mrs. Carter is who I am, but more bold and more fearless than I've ever been..... It comes from knowing my purpose and really meeting myself once I saw my child. I was like, 'OK, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were born to do'. The purpose of my body became completely different." [...] After the second European leg was announced on December 11, 2013, a new poster was revealed and used for the promotion of all the newly added shows.|$|E

On 8 June 2009, media {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy revealed that Lister had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of the}} year. Speaking of her decision to quit, Lister stated: [...] "It's scary but also very, very exciting. I think three years in a soap is enough to do and you get to a point where you either make a decision that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do or you want to try something different." [...] She also revealed that she had been planning to leave the series one year prior to announcement. Lister's decision to quit matched that of co-star Loui Batley (Sarah Barnes). Hollyoaks officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Lister and Batley would leave towards the end of the year in a storyline that would see [...] "A tragic curtain call for one of them", later revealing that either Sarah or Zoe would be killed off in a dramatic storyline.

Streep began auditioning for film roles, and underwent an unsuccessful audition for the lead role in Dino De Laurentiis's King Kong. Laurentiis stated in Italian to his son: [...] "This is so ugly. Why did you bring me this". Unknown to Laurentiis, Streep understood Italian and she remarked, [...] "I'm very sorry that I'm not as beautiful as I should be but, you know—this is it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get". She continued to work on Broadway, appearing in the 1976 double bill of Tennessee Williams' 27 Wagons Full of Cotton and Arthur Miller's A Memory of Two Mondays. For the former, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Streep's other Broadway credits include Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical Happy End, in which she had originally appeared off-Broadway at the Chelsea Theater Center. She received Drama Desk Award nominations for both productions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "Staying Alive", {{was written}} and produced by Jay R Sillona and Keith Martin under Sillona's own recording label, Homeworkz Records. The song uses Auto-Tune, and features rap verses by Q-York and additional back-up vocals by beauty queen Krista Kleiner, who was Sillona's {{partner at the}} time. It marked {{the second time that}} Nina collaborated with Sillona, since their duet of [...] "Muli" [...] in early 2010. The song is described as [...] "another smoking track with bold and powerful lyrics: 'I shouldn't let them knock me down down down... I'm staying alive.'" [...] "However Much Love" [...] is an acoustic flute-driven song, considered as one of Nina's distinctly slow and sentimental ballads in the album. The lyrics speak of steadfast and unconditional love. Philippine Entertainment Portal called it a [...] "standout," [...] stating [...] "Nina's voice heightens the pain and vulnerability evoked by the lyrics and melody." [...] "Believe in the Dream" [...] is an inspirational power ballad, written by Jude Gitamondoc. Nina insisted the song's inclusion with the purpose of encouraging her listeners to pursue their goals despite adversities. Its message is about not giving up on your dreams.
