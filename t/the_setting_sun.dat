5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the {{dichotomy}} between <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun</b> and the crescent moon dominates {{more than a third}} of the painting. The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E
5|$|As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other {{structures}} dedicated to observing {{the movements of}} celestial bodies. Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations. The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark the position of <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun</b> at the equinoxes.|$|E

5|$|In 1836 {{architect}} John Harper {{arranged a}} small exhibition in York {{of works by}} modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did {{take the opportunity to}} buy Etty's A Family of the Forest (also known as Flowers of the Forest), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun</b> in the background and the man looking away from the woman and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|Lion was hit twice more, {{during what}} came to be called the 'Run to the North', after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty's ships {{maintained}} full speed to try to put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. At 5:40pm they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun</b> blinded the German gunners, and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 6:35 Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. At 6:44 Beatty turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast four minutes later searching for Hipper's ships. Beatty took this opportunity to recall the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of New Zealand and then slowed down to eighteen knots and altered course to the south to prevent himself from getting separated from the Grand Fleet. At this moment Lions gyrocompass failed, and she made a complete circle before her steering was brought under control again. At 6:55 Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course itself to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T, and they badly damaged his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} popular attractions in the town is sunset viewing. It is a special event every evening in Oia from the Sunset Seranade point.

25|$|The playing area used {{to feature}} pitches laid on an east–west axis.

He left the air force in 1972. The couple soon married and had a daughter, April.|$|E
50|$|<b>Set</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> {{was formed}} in 2009 by David Southern and Alex Summers at the ages of 17 in Dallas, Texas. Southern and Summers began playing music {{together}} before enlisting the help of Nate Anderson, Arturo Pina, Dakota Price and Brandon Daniels in early 2010. The bands style was a mix of Post-hardcore, metalcore and heavy metal incorporating Unclean Vocals from Anderson in the verses, clean vocals from Southern in the choruses, frequent breakdowns in the bridge segment and basic song structure. <b>Set</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> entered the studio in late 2010 before releasing their Debut EP <b>Set</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> in early 2011. <b>Set</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> continued this style into their second release Desolate recorded in early 2011 and released in late 2011.|$|R

25|$|The {{cover of}} the album {{was created by the}} Zurich artist Ernst Gamper, with whom Yello had been working since 1982. Gamper painted the picture of a face on a sheet of celluloid, which he then taped to the window of his studio {{overlooking}} Lake Zurich and photographed at sunset, with <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun</b> shining through the unpainted eye to create a 'glowing eye' effect. The CD inlay booklet featured a photograph of Blank and Meier standing by the same window, with the painting visible on the window between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{scale of}} the massive stone goblet {{contrasts}} {{with that of the}} traditional landscape scene around it, inviting comparisons with the large stone objects left by ancient races of giants in Greek mythology—a view endorsed by art historian Erwin Panofsky in the 1960s. The painting's title (given by Cole {{on the back of the}} canvas) seems to support this idea, as if much time had passed between the creation of this goblet and the current scene. <b>The</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun,</b> a romantic symbol, also evokes the passage of time.|$|E
25|$|Hamner and Dawson {{proposed}} that the difference is caused by evolutionary change driven by the jellyfish-eating anemones (Entacmaea medusivora) that inhabit the eastern regions of Jellyfish Lake and Clear Lake. The jellyfish instinctively avoid shadows {{and in the morning}} with the shadows on the eastern end the jellyfish also avoid the anemones. By moving east to west in the early afternoon the jellyfish avoid the time of day when <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun</b> would eliminate shadows on the lake in the eastern end and thereby avoid the anemones in the afternoon.|$|E

25|$|However, if a fielder {{takes up}} {{position}} at square leg or somewhere {{so as to}} block his view, or {{if there is an}} injured batsman with a runner, then the umpire must move somewhere else – typically either a short distance or to point {{on the opposite side of}} the batsman. If the square-leg umpire elects to stand at point, he is required to inform both the batsmen, the captain of the fielding team, and his colleague. He may also move to the point position later in the afternoon if <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun</b> prevents a clear view of the popping crease at his end.|$|E
25|$|Pagtatawas: A {{method of}} {{diagnosing}} illness wherein alum (called tawas) is ritualistically {{used by the}} albularyo or medicine man for diagnosis {{of a variety of}} health conditions. The tawas is used to 'cross' (sign of the cross) the forehead and other suspicious or ailing parts of the body as prayers are being whispered (bulong or oracion). It is then placed on glowing embers, removed when it starts to crack, then transferred to a small receptacle of water. As it cools, its softened form spreads on the water surface and assumes a shape that may suggest the cause of the illness, often one of several indigenous forces: dwarfs, devils or other evil spirits (na-nuno, na-kulam, na-demonyo). The water in the vehicle is then used to anoint the ailing part or parts of the body to counteract the evil forces or illness. The tawas is then discarded and thrown westward, preferably into <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|E
25|$|Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant is an oil {{painting}} on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 54 x 73cm (21.25 by 28.75 in), signed R Pinchon lower left. The composition painted en plein air (sur le motif, {{in the open}} air), {{is dominated by the}} Pont aux Anglais, Rouen, with receding perspective tending towards {{the right side of the}} canvas. A locomotive and train cars pass over the bridge leaving a trail of steam in the direction of the receding perspective, carrying the eye towards the right, where below, a boat passes carrying two people a short distance from Le Pont aux Anglais. The rhythmic arches of the bridge and the speeding train create a sense of dynamism and modernity not often found in Post-Impressionist works. The colors Pinchon has chosen to depict this late afternoon scene are both warm and cool. The golden yellow highlights generated by <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>sun,</b> off the canvas to the left, are juxtaposed against the grays, blues, violets and greens of the background hillside, the bridge and its massive base pillars, the poplar trees and the River Seine in the foreground.|$|E
