5|$|In 993, the Chola Emperor Rajaraja I invaded Sri Lanka, {{forcing the}} then Sri Lankan ruler Mahinda V {{to flee to}} the {{southern}} part of the country.

Taking advantage of this situation, Rajendra I son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken <b>to</b> <b>India,</b> <b>and</b> the Cholas sacked the city of Anuradhapura. They moved the capital to Polonnaruwa and subsequent Sri Lankan rulers who came into power after the Chola reign continued to use Polonnaruwa as the capital, thus ending the Anuradhapura Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Jatropha is {{native to}} Mexico and Central America and was likely transported <b>to</b> <b>India</b> <b>and</b> Africa in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors {{convinced}} it had medicinal uses. In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce jatropha. The Yucatán Peninsula, for instance, {{in addition to being}} a corn producing region, also contains abandoned sisal plantations, where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food.|$|E

Kartik returned <b>to</b> <b>India</b> <b>and</b> was ineffective in the zonal one-dayers, taking a total of 1/148 from 24 overs in three matches, conceding more than a run a ball. Combined with his results against the West Indies, the poor returns saw him left out of the 2003 Cricket World Cup squad, with Harbhajan and Kumble preferred.|$|E

The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E

Portugal's influence in East Africa grew throughout the 16th century; she established several colonies known collectively as Portuguese East Africa.
