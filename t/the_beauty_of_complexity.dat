However, review of his initial writings reveals that Darwin accepted some aspects of this view.

When Darwin discovered the dynamic process of natural selection, he rejected the old teleological argument as formulated byWilliam Paley. However, he {{was never able to}} ignore the powerful experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> and <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> an intelligently designed universe, as a whole.

A perfect correlation between large shape asymmetry and path instability is established. In regimes corresponding to peripheral breakup and toroid formation, the dynamics is unsteady. A new kind of breakup, into a bulb-shaped bubble and a few satellite drops is found at low Morton numbers. The findings are of fundamental and practical relevance.

This is the heart of generative approach. The Generative Art work for <b>the</b> <b>beauty,</b> in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> the humanistic approach of Renaissance, because the generative code, which is the project of generative design, is the real structure of the idea. It defines how to concert all the parts and the dynamic relationship among these parts in the evolution <b>of</b> <b>complexity.</b> The generative project defines which is the law of proportion and which logic the dynamic evolution will follow.

The generative art produces events that are unique and complex. The uniqueness and complexity are strongly related one each other. As in Nature, each event is generated through an artificial life, which, as in the natural life, produces uniqueness, identity and complexity during a identifiable time.   This complexity is a natural-like complexity.

40|$|The {{chorionic}} {{structures of}} mayfly eggs {{can be categorized}} into three main classes (micropyles, attachment structures and chorionic sculpturing), according to their physiological function. Each class of structure shows a great variability as regards morphology, arrangement and distribution on the eggshell, and {{the combination of these}} features is the result of very particular chorionic patterns. The study of chorionic variability in both patterns and structures is very interesting for systematic purposes, because these features may be specific at different taxonomic levels. In addition, eggshell morphology allows us to identify female imagoes at species level when they lack valid taxonomic features, since eggs are completely formed in mature female nymphs. Light microscopy has already showed the great variability of the chorion structures in mayfly eggs and even allowed their classification. At present, this classification continues to be used as the basic reference in the morphological description of mayfly eggs, although it can only be done with SEM. Our morphological study on mayfly eggs, with both microscopy techniques, has allowed us to appreciate <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> and <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eggshell in this group of insects, as well as to describe new structures and to re-describe several aspects of chorion structures already known...|$|R
40|$|The art of avian {{flight is}} {{incredibly}} complex and sophisticated.

I believe that in order to truly comprehend <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> and <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> avian flight, it is necessary to clearly visualize the anatomical adaptations found in birds.

The artwork and animations that I have created for this thesis are intended to visually portray the major aspects that are involved in avian flight. The majority of artwork created for this project is comprised of 3 D models created and animated Autodesk Maya, including a complete pigeon skeleton, the musculature involved in flight, and the anatomy of the avian respiratory system. These 3 D models present the viewer with a completely unique view of avian anatomy that provides a relatively complete overview of the various aspects involved in avian flight. The final movie is composed of three animations that focus on the following subject matter: general adaptations to the avian skeleton, the specialization of the avian wing, and the importance of the avian respiratory system...|$|R

His use of place is also significant from a thematic point of view. His experiences at his childhood home, Le PÃ¢tys, seem to have been particularly formative, inspiring the Rezeau trilogy. Throughout his writing career, Bazin would re-examine his most dominant place-based concerns in a variety of fictional contexts.;Bazin analysed the way in which some individuals identified themselves strongly with their homes, drawing their sense of identity and continuity from their environment. However, he was also interested in the effect of exile on such rooted people whose close relationship with a specific place was broken or interrupted.;Bazin's portrayal of interpersonal relationships also led to important place-based themes. He showed the tendency of individuals to turn their homes into personal fiefdoms or territories at the expense of others. He also considered the phenomenon of running away from home, examining the motives of those who took flight. Bazin's novels assert the particularly close association between women and the home but also seen to question the ability of men and women to live harmoniously under the same roof.;The outdoors tends to provide places of retreat for Bazin's characters and his novels suggest that <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> and <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural world is a source of solace of life. Indeed, Bazin's affection for the natural environment seems to have inspired much of the more philosophical writing of his later years in which he considers man's role and responsibilities in relation to the uniqueness of his planet.;Overall, by means of his novels and his non-fictional writing, Bazin affirms the importance of place in determining man's identity, relationships and ultimate significance...|$|R
40|$|Italian Sign Language, or LIS, is a {{language}} rich in lexical differences. One person might sign AUGUST by passing a thumb across their brow; someone else might articulate it as two hands fanning the signer. There is anecdotal evidence that lexical variation is especially {{rich in the}} month and color signs; this thesis seeks to record and catalog the variations collected from 12 signers during a reunion at the Tommaso Pendola School in Siena, Italy. The similarities and differences among variants for a single concept/sign (for instance, RED) are discussed. The background of LIS and Italian deaf education is important to this research. The trends in European Deaf education are explored, starting with the Spanish monk Pedro Ponce de Leon and the French Abbé de L’Epée. The influence of the Milan Congress’s decision that oralism, not the teaching of sign language, was the preferred method for teaching deaf students, {{and the state of}} deaf education in Italy are both described in order to give some sociological context to the data; the influence of oralism also accounts for the common practice of mouthing parts of Italian words as the LIS sign is being articulated. The historical changes in the morphology and phonology of LIS are also described in order to pick out trends in the data; specifically, the tendency for signs to move from having contact on the face or hands to being signed in neutral space is mentioned. All of these are preludes to the core of the work, which is contained in the variation charts for each month or color. Several signs are highlighted and discussed in particular because of their interesting behavior; some variants for the signs PURPLE and GREEN are mentioned because they are similar to each other. Both use initialization of the letter V as their iconic root. The influence of the Church and other sociolinguistic factors in variant form and choice is not to be ignored; there is strong evidence that cultural references factor into the iconic roots of several signs, notably the Christmas-themed variants of DECEMBER. The data is analyzed using several statistical methods to examine sociolinguistic trends, paying particular attention to how many times a pair of interviewees uses the same sign variants. The geographic origin of the interviewees is shown to have some statistically significant effect on their lexical choices, and Tuscan interviewees {{are the only ones who}} use certain signs, for example in the case of ORANGEB. Overall, this thesis is an exploration of the extent that LIS varies in this specific set <b>of</b> signs, celebrating <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> and <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language...|$|R
