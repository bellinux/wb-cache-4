5|$|Hamilton's Report on a National Bank was a {{projection}} {{from the first}} Report on the Public Credit. Although Hamilton had been forming ideas of a national bank as early as 1779, he gathered ideas in various ways over the past eleven years. These included theories from Adam Smith, extensive studies on the Bank of England, the blunders of the Bank of North America and his experience in establishing <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> He also used American records from James Wilson, Pelatiah Webster, Gouverneur Morris, and from his assistant Treasury secretary Tench Coxe.|$|E
5|$|Discontinuing {{his studies}} before graduating when the college closed its doors during British {{occupation}} of the city, Hamilton {{played a major role}} in the American Revolutionary War. At the start of the war in 1775, he joined a militia company. In early 1776, he raised a provincial artillery company, to which he was appointed captain. He soon became the senior aide to General Washington, the American forces' commander-in-chief. Hamilton was dispatched by Washington on numerous missions to convey plans to his generals. After the war, Hamilton was elected as a representative to the Congress of the Confederation from New York. He resigned to practice law, and founded <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1784, {{he founded}} <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> which {{became one of}} the longest {{operating}} banks in American history, it stayed in business for over 220 years before it merged with another bank in 2007. Hamilton was {{one of the men who}} restored King's College, which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War, as Columbia College. Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation, he played a major leadership role at the Annapolis Convention in 1786. He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention, and in doing so brought his longtime desire to have a more powerful, more financially independent federal government one step closer to reality.|$|E
