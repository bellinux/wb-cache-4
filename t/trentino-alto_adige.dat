5|$|The town {{voted in}} October 2007 {{to secede from}} the region of Veneto and join the {{neighbouring}} region, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. This was motivated by improved cultural ties with the small Ladin-speaking community in South Tyrol and the attraction of lower taxes. The referendum is not executive and a final decision on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and <b>Trentino-Alto</b> <b>Adige.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} unification, Italy started to create colonies in Africa, and under Benito Mussolini's fascism conquered Ethiopia founding in 1936 the Italian Empire. World War I completed {{the process of}} Italian unification, with the annexation of Trieste, Istria, <b>Trentino-Alto</b> <b>Adige</b> and Zara. The Italians grew to 45 millions in 1940 and the land, whose economy had been until that time based upon agriculture, started its industrial development, mainly in northern Italy. But World War II soon destroyed Italy and its colonial power.|$|E
25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} served with {{some type of}} sauce; the sauce {{and the type of}} pasta are usually matched based on consistency and ease of eating. Northern Italian cooking uses less tomato sauce, garlic and herbs. In Northern Italy white sauce is more common. However Italian cuisine is best identified by individual regions. Pasta dishes with lighter use of tomato are found in <b>Trentino-Alto</b> <b>Adige</b> and Emilia Romagna. In Bologna, the meat-based Bolognese sauce incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called pesto originates from Genoa. In Central Italy, there are sauces such as tomato sauce, amatriciana, arrabbiata and the egg-based carbonara.|$|E
25|$|The Gauls {{crossed the}} Alps and invaded {{northern}} Italy in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, settling {{in the area}} that became known as Cisalpine Gaul ("Gaul {{on this side of the}} Alps"). Although named after the Gauls, the region was mostly inhabited by indigenous tribes, namely the Ligures, Etruscans, Veneti and Euganei. Estimates by Beloch and Brunt suggest that in the 3rd century BC the Gaulish settlers of north Italy numbered between 130,000–140,000 out of a total population of about 1.4 million. According to Pliny and Livy, after the invasion of the Gauls, some of the Etruscans living in the Po Valley sought refuge in the Alps and became known as the Raeti. The Raeti inhabited the region of <b>Trentino-Alto</b> <b>Adige,</b> as well as eastern Switzerland and Tyrol in western Austria. The Ladins of north-eastern Italy and the Romansh people of Switzerland are said to be descended from the Raeti.|$|E
500|$|Cortina was the {{principal}} intermediate station on the narrow-gauge (950mm) Dolomites Railway from Calalzo to Toblach. When the line was electrified in 1929 [...] the only sub-station was established at Cortina. The line closed in 1964 but in February 2016 the regional governments of Veneto and <b>Trentino-Alto</b> <b>Adige</b> announced that they are to commission a feasibility study {{to build a new}} line between Calalzo, Cortina and Toblach.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{factors may}} {{contribute}} {{in keeping the}} economy less competitive or less flexible compared to Northern Italian and European regions, among them, a larger public administration sector (which accounted for 20.4% of the whole economy in 2013, while in Italy the figure is 13.6) suggesting a too large number of public employees or white collars. [...] The number of lawyers is 5.7 every 1000, by comparison in Northern region <b>Trentino-Alto</b> <b>Adige</b> the number is 1.7. Because of a less developed economy, Campania may have suffered less {{the negative effects of}} recent economic cycles.|$|E
2500|$|Saint Lucy's Day, {{also called}} the Feast of Saint Lucy, is a Christian feast day celebrated on 13 December in Advent, commemorating Saint Lucy, a 3rd-century martyr under the Diocletianic Persecution, who {{according}} to legend brought [...] "food and aid to Christians hiding in the catacombs" [...] using a candle-lit wreath to [...] "light her way and leave her hands free to carry as much food as possible". In Norway, Sweden and Swedish-speaking regions of Finland, as songs are sung, girls dressed as Saint Lucy carry cookies and saffron buns in procession, which [...] "symbolizes bringing the light of Christianity throughout world darkness." [...] In both Protestant and Catholic churches, boys participate in the procession as well, playing different roles associated with Christmas, {{such as that of}} Saint Stephen. It is said that to vividly celebrate Saint Lucy's Day will help one live the long winter days with enough light. A special devotion to Saint Lucy is practiced in the Italian regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, <b>Trentino-Alto</b> <b>Adige,</b> in the north of the country, and Sicily, in the south, as well as in Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia. In Hungary and Croatia, a popular tradition on Saint Lucy's Day involves planting wheat grains that will eventually be several centimetres high on Christmas, representing the Nativity.|$|E
