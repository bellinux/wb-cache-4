5|$|The color {{sequence}} of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, The Trinity. One reason for including this color final was, according to Tarkovsky, {{to give the}} viewer some rest and {{to allow him to}} detach himself from Rublev's life and to reflect. The film finally ends with the image of horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant <b>that</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> the source of all of Rublev's art.|$|E
5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him <b>that</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to the floor. In the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E
25|$|Lamarck {{stressed}} {{two main}} themes in his biological work. The first {{was that the}} environment gives rise to changes in animals. He cited examples of blindness in moles, the presence of teeth in mammals {{and the absence of}} teeth in birds as evidence of this principle. The second principle was <b>that</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> structured in an orderly manner and that many different parts of all bodies make it possible for the organic movements of animals.|$|E

25|$|The {{belief that}} self-ordering by {{spontaneous}} generation was impossible begged for an alternative. By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, the theory of biogenesis had accumulated so much evidential support, due to the work of Pasteur and others, that the alternative theory of spontaneous generation had been effectively disproven. John Desmond Bernal, a pioneer in X-ray crystallography, suggested that earlier theories such as spontaneous generation were based upon an explanation <b>that</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> continuously created as a result of chance events.|$|E
25|$|Dost {{was a man}} {{of wealth}} as well as {{standing}} when he died. He had left a written will bequeathing his assets to his children and Annie and designating his brother Jorak as executor. Annie left accounts that Jorak was withholding money from her and <b>that</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> very difficult. She finally agreed to Jorak's offer of financial security and a good education for the children on condition that she return to India with the children. But, she boarded ship in fear for her life.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} of the town was a single large walled building, called the Habitation. A similar Habitation was {{established}} in Port Royal in 1605, in Acadia. This arrangement was made for protection against perceived threats from the indigenous people. The difficulty of supplying the city of Quebec from France {{and the lack of}} knowledge of the area meant <b>that</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> hard. A significant fraction of the population died of hunger and diseases during the first winter. However, agriculture soon expanded and a continuous flow of immigrants, mostly men in search of adventure, increased the population.|$|E

25|$|In 1802, William Paley {{published}} Natural Theology {{in response}} to naturalists such as Hume, refining the ancient teleological argument (or argument from design) to argue {{for the existence of}} God. He argued <b>that</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> so intricately designed and interconnected as to be analogous to a watch. Just as when one finds a watch, one reasonable infers that it was designed and constructed by an intelligent being, although one has never seen the designer, when one observes the complexity and intricacy of life, one may reasonably infer that it was designed and constructed by God, although one has never seen God.|$|E
25|$|Saint Augustine of Hippo {{reminded}} Romans of otium philosophandi, {{a positive}} element, <b>that</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> happiest when one {{had time to}} philosophize. Augustine points out that otium was the prerequisite for contemplation. It was because of otium that Alypius of Thagaste steered Augustine away from marriage. He said {{that they could not}} live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine described Christianae vita otium as the Christian life of leisure. Many Christian writers of the time interpreted the Roman idea of otium as the deadly sin of acedia (sloth). Some Christian writers formulated otium as meaning to serve God through deep thought. Christian writers encouraged biblical studies to justify otium. These same Christian writers also showed otium ruris (secluded rural leisure) as a needed step to monastic propositum. Augustine describes the monastic life as otium sanctum (sanctified leisure or approved leisure). In Augustine's time the idea of philosophy had two poles of ambitions—one to be a worthy Christian (vacation - negotium) and the other to be a worthy friend of God (devotion - otium).|$|E

500|$|While {{the city}} became calmer after these events, and the {{government}} made great efforts to show <b>that</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> returning to normal, an armed police presence did remain.

[...] The tenth song, [...] "Fire Meet Gasoline", was compared to Beyoncé's [...] "Halo" [...] by Harriet Gibsone from The Guardian. [...] "Cellophane" [...] is an electropop track, where Sia likens herself to [...] "a basket filled with pain." [...] 1000 Forms of Fear concludes with [...] "Dressed in Black", which Heather Phares of AllMusic described as a ballad [...] "with more depth than the ones she writes for hire." ...|$|E
500|$|On 29 September 1930, Waugh was {{received}} into the Catholic Church. This shocked {{his family and}} surprised some of his friends, but he had contemplated the step for some time. He had lost his Anglicanism at Lancing and had led an irreligious life at Oxford, but there are references in his diaries from the mid-1920s to religious discussion and regular churchgoing. On 22 December 1925, Waugh wrote: [...] "Claud and I took Audrey to supper and sat up until 7 in the morning arguing about the Roman Church". The entry for 20 February 1927 includes, [...] "I am to visit a Father Underhill about being a parson". Throughout the period, Waugh was influenced by his friend Olivia Plunket-Greene, who had converted in 1925 and of whom Waugh later wrote, [...] "She bullied me into the Church". It was she who led him to Father Martin D'Arcy, a Jesuit, who persuaded Waugh [...] "on firm intellectual convictions but little emotion" [...] that [...] "the Christian revelation was genuine". In 1949, Waugh explained that his conversion followed his realisation <b>that</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> [...] "unintelligible and unendurable without God".|$|E
