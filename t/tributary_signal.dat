40|$|The {{advantage}} of designing high speed hybrid {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM) optical networks - in which a <b>tributary</b> <b>signal</b> may be switched over a sequence of (multi-hop) optical circuits - is manifold. The optical-electrical-optical signal conversion that takes place at a few selected (intermediate) nodes allows tributary signals to be efficiently multiplexed by the electronics before they are transmitted on the optical circuits. It also mitigates {{the negative impact of}} fiber transmission impairments through 3 R electronic regeneration of the signal. In addition, although limited, the transparency of the optical circuits enables multi-rate nodes to coexist in the same hybrid network architecture. The paper proposes an approach to designing cost-effective hybrid optical networks with arbitrary topology and multi-rate nodes, and demonstrates numerically the advantages of such a solution in the presence of both impairment-free and polarization mode dispersion (PMD) impaired fibers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{experimentally}} demonstrates flexible-bandwidth networking by splitting a 500 -GHz waveform {{generated by}} optical arbitrary waveform generation into its two tributary spectral slices using a liquid-crystal spatial light phase modulator as a wavelength selective switch. Rapid increases in Internet traffic coupled with dynamic traffic demands require efficient and scalable transport links to support future optical networks. Wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) technology [1] has had success {{in meeting the}} exponentially growing capacity requirements, but lacks the optimization for dynamically changing traffic demands. Flexible bandwidth networks, in which a broad spectrum is composed of arbitrarily assigned spectral slices, can replace fixed wavelength grids to support elastic traffic demands [2] ranging from extremely low capacity (sub-wavelength) to very high capacity (hyper-wavelength). Optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG) has proven its capability of creating arbitrary waveforms through line-by-line intensity and phase modulations of broad-bandwidth, coherent optical frequency combs (OFC). With an arbitrary wavelength selective switch (WSS), the transmitted spectrum {{can be divided into}} spectral slices of arbitrary sizes. In this summary, a terahertz OAWG-based transmitter [3] is used to generate a 500 -GHz waveform that is split into its two <b>tributary</b> <b>signals</b> using a liquid-crystal spatial light phase modulator (LC-SLPM) based WSS.

40|$|By {{means of}} optical {{transparency}} {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM) networks with multi-rate transmissions are becoming a reality. The potential advantages of individually selecting the transmission rate for each lightpath are however not yet fully understood. A recent work studied {{for the first time}} multi-rate and multi-hop (M&M) networks in which <b>tributary</b> <b>signals</b> are transmitted over a concatenation of lightpaths, each one operating at its own transmission rate. The study revealed that the problem of designing M&M networks is NP-complete and optimal solutions are practically available only for small networks. The paper presents a heuristic algorithm for designing M&M ring networks that yields efficient sub-optimal solutions in polynomial time. The algorithm determines the rate for each lightpath taking into account a number of factors including the node's interface, amount of multiplexed traffic and cost of the network components. The potential advantages provided by the M&M network when compared to first generation optical networks (i. e., SONET/SDH), single- and multi-hop (constant bit rate) optical networks, are discussed in the paper and documented with numerical results. Presented results show that the network cost reduction achieved by the M&M design {{is a function of the}} cost ratio between the optical bandwidth (wavelengths) and the optical terminals...|$|R

40|$|Future optical {{communication}} networks {{are likely to}} require a range of advanced OTDM channel processing functions if the full potential of the fibre transmission bandwidth is to be exploited. Critical processing functions include amongst others time-division demultiplexing, signal regeneration, channel add/drop, signal format conversion and packet compression. Ideally, these processes will be performed directly in the optical domain since this removes any bandwidth constraints {{associated with the use}} of electrical signals. In this presentation we describe various optical processing systems that exploit time-to-wavelength signal conversion. All of our systems are based on the nonlinear optical sampling of a linearly chirped pulse that is shaped and synchronised to temporally overlap with a given number of (relatively high-power) OTDM tributary channels in a fibre based switch. The individual tributary OTDM channels are mapped directly onto distinct WDM channels at the switch output by the nonlinear sampling process. Further processing of the OTDM channels can then be performed simply by passive filtering of the resulting WDM channels. If required, the filtered WDM signal can then be mapped back into the time domain onto an OTDM signal in a second nonlinear fibre switch. To highlight the power of the approach we shall present experimental demonstrations of simultaneous demultiplexing of each of the constituent tributary channels of an OTDM <b>signal,</b> <b>tributary</b> channel aggregation into compressed packets, and 10 Gbit/s multi-channel add/drop from a 40 Gbit/s TDM signal...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of optical communication systems has shown an incredibly thriving growth from their inception {{to the last}} several decades. From the observations in traffic demand, the objectives of this thesis are to develop some key functions for improving the flexibility and efficiency of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and optical division multiplexing (OTDM) networks by using wavelength multicasting technique. Practically, at a photonic gateway, for the interconnection between WDM and OTDM networks, an nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) -to-return-to-zero (RZ) waveform conversion is necessary due to the popular utilization of NRZ and RZ formats in WDM and OTDM networks, respectively. Moreover, if the waveform conversion combines with wavelength multicasting, multiple RZ signals will be generated, resulting in an increase of the throughput of network and the flexibility of wavelength assignment. A desirable stage after these conversions is to aggregate the higher bit-rates OTDM signals based on these lower bit-rates multicast RZ signals. The pulsewidth {{is one of the}} parameters to determine the bit-rates of OTDM signals. Therefore, to achieve the aggregate OTDM signals with flexible bit-rates adapting to specific network demand, it is necessary to manage the pulsewidth in a wide tuning range. In the first work, a NRZ data signal is injected into an highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) -based four-wave mixing (FWM) switch with four RZ clocks compressed by a Raman amplification-based multiwavelength pulse compressor (RA-MPC). The pulsewidth of four multicast RZ signals is adjusted in a continuously large range from 12. 17 to 4. 68 ps by changing Raman pump power of RA-MPC. In addition, the sampling of optical signal waveform is necessary to monitor signals in optical network. The signals can always be analyzed off-line by capture-and-process-later techniques. However, it is challenging that these techniques are not compatible with instantaneous amplitude changes of signals as well as capturing the details and singular manners such as transient events which need real-time processing. Therefore, in the second work, an effort to characterize the waveform of signal in real-time using wavelength multicasting technique with multiwavelength sampling short-width pulses which are on the order of a few picoseconds is implemented. Using the short pulsewidths of the sampling pulses, it is possible to sample the signal precisely because its waveform does not change significantly in the sampling time. An all-optical waveform sampling of NRZ and RZ on-off-keying (OOK) signals is focused. The 4 x 10 GHz WDM sampling pulses are compressed with the pulsewidth which are less than 3 ps by RA-MPC and then interact with the input signal under test using FWM effect in an HNLF. Four obtained sampled signals result in a sampling rate of 40 GSample/s, therefore, the reconstructed waveforms are well-matched with the input signal waveforms. Moving to the phase-modulated signals, especially RZ-differential phase shift keying (DPSK) signal, it is attractive for RZ-DPSK signal due to its robust tolerance to the effects of some fiber nonlinearities, and the support of high spectral efficiency. Moreover, all-optical pulse compression has been widely investigated as one of the key elements to enable high bit-rate signals overcoming electronics limits. So far, pulse compression has often used before data modulation at the transmitter to generate high bit-rate signals. Our work, on the other hand, implements the pulse compression for RZ-DPSK signal for inline applications. A useful inline application of the data pulse compression is to generate an aggregate high-speed data rate based on optical time multiplexing of many channels with lower-speed data rates. The higher bit-rates of aggregate signals depend on the pulsewidths of lower bit-rate signals. Therefore, the compression of an inline 10 Gb/s RZ-DPSK signal using a distributed Raman amplifier-based compressor (DRA-PC) is done. The RZ-DPSK signal with pulsewidth of 20 ps after 30 km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) transmission is compressed down to in picoseconds duration such as 12, 7. 0, and 3. 2 ps. The pulse compression of the inline signal is applied in two works. In the first work, a compressed signal with the pulsewidth of 3. 2 ps is multiplexed to a 40 Gb/s OTDM signal and then successfully de-multiplexed. The second application is wavelength multicasting of the inline compressed RZ-DPSK signal to get multicast signals with short-pulsewidths for increasing the throughput of network and wavelength resource. The DRA-PC compresses the inline RZ-DPSK signal with the obtained pulsewidths of 12, 7. 0, and 3. 2 ps which then interact with two continuous waves (CWs) in an HNLF-based FWM switch. Thus, the pulsewidths of the multicast signals were compressed down to 12. 5, 7. 89, and 4. 27 ps. Finally, for networking between OTDM and WDM networks, an OTDM-to-WDM conversion is crucially required. However, it is given that in some cases, different WDM channels are expected to be generated in order to connect to each <b>tributary</b> of OTDM <b>signal.</b> In this work, a 20 Gb/s OTDM RZ-DPSK signal is converted to 4 x 10 Gb/s WDM RZ channels. One <b>tributary</b> of OTDM <b>signal</b> is converted to 2 x 10 Gb/s WDM RZ signals at two FWM products. 電気通信大学 201...|$|R
