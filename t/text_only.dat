5|$|Originally, in Tolkien's {{writings}} {{from the}} 1910s and 1920s, Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë (their final names) were {{the eldest of}} the Elves. By 1959 or 1960, Tolkien wrote {{a detailed account of}} the awakening of the Elves, called Cuivienyarna, part of Quendi and Eldar. Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë now became the first ambassadors and the Kings of the Elves. This <b>text</b> <b>only</b> saw print in The War of the Jewels, part of the analytical The History of Middle-earth series, in 1994, but a similar version was included in The Silmarillion in 1977.|$|E

25|$|The early 2000s saw Hosono & Takahashi reunited in {{a project}} called Sketch Show. On a number of {{occasions}} Ryuichi Sakamoto has joined in on Sketch Show performances and recording sessions. He later proposed they rename the group Human Audio Sponge when he participates. Barcelona performance at Sonar festival and Wild Sketch Show DVDs chronicle these reunions, and include a tongue-in-cheek Japanese <b>text</b> <b>only</b> history of the group that spans to 2036.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 1974, a {{teletext}} system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using <b>text</b> <b>only</b> was launched. Engineers originally began developing {{such a system}} to bring news to deaf viewers, but the system was expanded. The Ceefax service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 October 2012: it not only had subtitling for all channels, it also gave information such as weather, flight times and film reviews.|$|E

50|$|The Poor Man of Nippur is an Akkadian story {{dating from}} around 1500 BC. It is attested by <b>only</b> three <b>texts,</b> <b>only</b> {{one of which}} is more than a small fragment.|$|R
25|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating techniques {{that are used}} on papyrus {{can be applied to}} parchment as well. They do not date the age of the writing but the preparation of the parchment itself. While it is feasibly possible also to radio carbon date certain kinds of ink, it is extremely difficult to do {{due to the fact that}} they are generally present on the <b>text</b> <b>only</b> in trace amounts, and it is hard to get a carbon sample of them without the carbon in the parchment contaminating it.|$|E
25|$|A Liberal-Party {{member of}} the Finnish Parliament, Arne Berner, {{happened}} to hear the broadcast, and started an interpellation, addressed to the Minister of Transport and Public Works. It was signed by him and 82 {{other members of the}} 200 members of parliament. It is unclear how many of the other signatories actually had heard the broadcast. The interpellation <b>text</b> <b>only</b> contained a short extract of six lines (considered to be offensive, and representative of the poem) of over seventy from the poem, and the debate was mainly based upon them.|$|E
25|$|A general {{technique}} {{to improve performance}} is to avoid work. A good example {{is the use of}} a fast path for common cases, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary work. For example, using a simple text layout algorithm for Latin <b>text,</b> <b>only</b> switching to a complex layout algorithm for complex scripts, such as Devanagari. Another important technique is caching, particularly memoization, which avoids redundant computations. Because of the importance of caching, there are often many levels of caching in a system, which can cause problems from memory use, and correctness issues from stale caches.|$|E
5000|$|The alphabets of the North Germanic languages, Catalan, Finnish, German, French, Portuguese and Spanish are all {{extensions}} of the Latin alphabet.

25|$|Ninety-five of 146 books {{known to}} have been written by Bīrūnī were devoted to astronomy, mathematics, and related {{subjects}} like mathematical geography. His religion contributed to his research of astronomy, as in Islam, Muslim customs require knowing the directions of certain sacred locations, which can actually be found through this type of scientific study. Biruni's major work on astrology is primarily an astronomical and mathematical <b>text,</b> <b>only</b> the last chapter concerns astrological prognostication. His endorsement of astrology is limited, in so far as he condemns horary astrology as 'sorcery'.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo da Vinci's {{illustrations}} of polyhedra in De divina proportione (On the Divine Proportion) and his views that some bodily proportions exhibit the golden ratio have led some scholars {{to speculate that}} he incorporated the golden ratio in his paintings. But the suggestion that his Mona Lisa, for example, employs golden ratio proportions, is not supported by anything in Leonardo's own writings. Similarly, although the Vitruvian Man is often shown {{in connection with the}} golden ratio, the proportions of the figure do not actually match it, and the <b>text</b> <b>only</b> mentions whole number ratios.|$|E
25|$|The {{machine was}} similar in {{power to the}} Apple II and {{included}} a small 9-inch black-and-white character display built into a small case with a floppy disk. It was <b>text</b> <b>only,</b> as Raskin disliked the computer mouse {{or anything else that}} could take his hands from the keyboard. A number of basic applications were built into the machine, selectable by pressing function keys. The machine also included logic that would understand user intentions and switch programs dynamically. For instance, if the user simply started typing text it would switch into editor mode, and if they typed numbers it would switch to calculator mode. In many cases these switches would be largely invisible to the user.|$|E
40|$|There are no <b>texts,</b> <b>only</b> {{readings}} of them. There are, perhaps, no 'authors' either, only Readers. We recall {{readings of}} texts, our own, of others; we don't recall texts which, if {{the enthusiasm of}} the foregoing 'heresy' is to be maintained, do not exist except in their realisation, their recuperation...|$|R
5000|$|As scholar Isabelle Onians explains: [...] "Yoginitantras {{are in the}} {{secondary}} literature often called Anuttarayoga. But {{this is based on}} a mistaken back translation of the Tibetan translation (rnal byor bla med kyi rgyud) of what appears in Sanskrit <b>texts</b> <b>only</b> as Yogānuttara or Yoganiruttara (cf. SANDERSON 1994: 97-98, fn.1)." ...|$|R

25|$|However, {{public opinion}} was not amiable with this solution, as it {{declared}} official a <b>text</b> <b>only</b> nominally {{approved by the}} Congress and had {{a great amount of}} misprints besides. This last problem was what the senator for Tucumán Benjamín Paz prepared to rectify, by means of a law project presented in 1878 that noticed 29 new errors. As this project passed through the commissions of the Chambers of Deputies and Senators, the number grew up as far as 285. This 285 errors are the ones that the Law No. 1196 corrects, sanctioned August 29, 1882, commonly known as the Law of Errata, though it was the second of its kind to be sanctioned.|$|E
25|$|Currently one of {{the most}} active areas of {{knowledge}} representation research are projects associated with the semantic web. The semantic web seeks to add a layer of semantics (meaning) on top of the current Internet. Rather than indexing web sites and pages via keywords, the semantic web creates large ontologies of concepts. Searching for a concept will be more effective than traditional <b>text</b> <b>only</b> searches. Frame languages and automatic classification play a big part in the vision for the future semantic web. The automatic classification gives developers technology to provide order on a constantly evolving network of knowledge. Defining ontologies that are static and incapable of evolving on the fly would be very limiting for Internet-based systems. The classifier technology provides the ability to deal with the dynamic environment of the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a review}} of 'national' signage in 1921 {{a limited number of}} warning and hazard {{information}} plates were enhanced by the use of symbols, rather than <b>text</b> <b>only.</b> Such symbols had been developed in continental Europe as early as 1909, but had been dismissed by the UK, which favoured the use of text. The symbols were simple silhouettes, easy to 'read' at a distance. Some were peculiarly British: 'SCHOOL' (and later 'CHILDREN') depicted by the flaming torch of knowledge. The government was to make increasing efforts to standardise road signs in the Road Traffic Act 1930 (RTA) and regulations of 1933, being finally consolidated with the publication of the 1934 Road Traffic Acts and Regulations handbook. These saw the end of the very individual black and yellow vitreous enamel AA signs (although the AA was still allowed to erect temporary direction signs, and still does). While the RSAC had ceased erecting signs, the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) had begun to do so to RTA specifications (save for the inclusion of the RAC badge) and was very active in this respect in the late-1930s.|$|E

50|$|Ultimately, Martin's 1914 {{etchings}} {{would not}} {{be seen by the}} public for many years. The long-delayed publication of Sports led the artist to replace them with an updated set of illustrations after World War I. As Satie's material remained unchanged, the new drawings are connected to the music and <b>texts</b> <b>only</b> by their titles.|$|R
50|$|Whilst the Christian {{right in}} the United States is making a tough stand against the {{progression}} of LGBT rights, other Christian movements have taken a more lenient approach towards the matter, arguing that the biblical <b>texts</b> <b>only</b> oppose specific types of divergent sexual behaviour, such as paederasty (i.e. the sodomising of young boys by older men).|$|R
25|$|In 1924, {{extracts}} from the play were broadcast on BBC Radio, {{performed by the}} Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the eight episode {{of a series of}} programs showcasing Shakespeare's plays, entitled Shakespeare Night. Extracts were also broadcast in 1925 as part of Shakespeare: Scene and Story, with Edna Godfrey-Turner and William Charles Macready, and in 1926 as part of Shakespeare's Heroines, with Madge Titheradge and Edmund Willard. In 1927, a forty-three-minute truncation of the play was broadcast on BBC National Programme, with Barbara Couper and Ian Fleming. In 1932, National Programme aired another truncated version, this one running eighty-five minutes, and again starring Couper, with Francis James as Petruchio. In 1935, Peter Creswell directed a broadcast of the relatively complete <b>text</b> (<b>only</b> the Bianca subplot was trimmed) on National Programme, starring Mary Hinton and Godfrey Tearle. This was the first non-theatrical version of the play to feature Sly, who was played by Stuart Robertson. In 1941, Creswell directed another adaptation for BBC Home Service, again starring Tearle, with Fay Compton as Katherina. In 1947, BBC Light Programme aired extracts for their Theatre Programme from John Burrell's Edinburgh Festival production, with Patricia Burke and Trevor Howard. In 1954, the full-length play aired on BBC Home Service, directed by Peter Watts, starring Mary Wimbush and Joseph O'Conor, with Norman Shelley as Sly. BBC Radio 4 aired another full-length broadcast (without the Induction) in 1973 as part of their Monday Night Theatre series, directed by Ian Cotterell, starring Fenella Fielding and Paul Daneman. In 1989, BBC Radio 3 aired the full play, directed by Jeremy Mortimer, starring Cheryl Campbell and Bob Peck, with William Simons as Sly. In 2000, BBC Radio 3 aired another full-length production (without the Induction) as part of their Shakespeare for the New Millennium series, directed by Melanie Harris, and starring Ruth Mitchell and Gerard McSorley.|$|E

500|$|Formerly in {{possession}} of the , rulers of the Tatebayashi Domain in Kōzuke Province, the extant Fujita scroll alternates five sections of text and five paintings.
