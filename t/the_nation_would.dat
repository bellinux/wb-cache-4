Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.|$|E

He met with a number of writers from the US, including novelists Ralph Ellison and Arthur Miller. In Brazil, he met with several other authors, with whom he discussed the complications of writing in Portuguese. Achebe worried that the vibrant literature of <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> be lost if left untranslated into a more widely spoken language.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Cromwell in 1658, Charles's chances of regaining the Crown at first seemed slim as Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son, Richard. However, the new Lord Protector had little {{experience}} of either military or civil administration. In 1659, the Rump Parliament was recalled and Richard resigned. During the civil and military unrest that followed, George Monck, the Governor of Scotland, was concerned that <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> descend into anarchy. Monck and his army marched into the City of London and forced the Rump Parliament to re-admit members of the Long Parliament who had been excluded in December 1648 during Pride's Purge. The Long Parliament dissolved itself {{and for the first}} time in almost 20 years, there was a general election. The outgoing Parliament defined the electoral qualifications so as to ensure, as they thought, the return of a Presbyterian majority.|$|E
5|$|The end of World War II was {{followed}} by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort had been enormous, and Truman was intent on decreasing government expenditures on the military as quickly as possible. Demobilizing the military and reducing {{the size of the}} various services was a cost-saving priority. The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown, but fears existed that <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> slide back into a depression. A great deal of work had to be done to plan how best to transition to peacetime production of goods while avoiding mass unemployment for returning veterans. Government officials did not have consensus as to what economic course the postwar U.S. should take. In addition, Roosevelt had not paid attention to Congress in his final years, and Truman faced a body where a combination of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc.|$|E

In Notes on the State of Virginia, he created controversy by calling slavery a moral evil for which <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> ultimately have to account to God. He therefore supported colonization plans that would transport freed slaves to another country, such as Liberia or Sierra Leone, though he recognized the impracticability of such proposals.|$|E

25|$|With {{these changes}} in place, the Senate {{ratified}} the treaty on March 10, 1848, {{by a vote of}} 38 to 14. The vote split along sectional, rather than party, lines, foreshadowing the Civil War. The treaty then had to be approved by the Mexican government. It received the greatest opposition from the Chamber of Deputies, which ultimately ratified it 51 to 35. In the end, the Mexican Congress ratified the treaty to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> be free of foreign rule, to prevent further loss of land, and to help the country begin to heal.|$|E

25|$|Teburoro Tito {{was elected}} {{president}} in 1994. In 1995, Kiribati unilaterally moved the international date line far to the east to encompass the Line Islands group, so that <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> no longer be divided by the date line. The move, which fulfilled one of President Tito's campaign promises, was intended to allow businesses across the expansive nation to keep the same business week. This also enabled Kiribati {{to become the first}} country to see the dawn of the third millennium, an event of significance for tourism. Tito was re-elected in 1998. Kiribati gained UN membership in 1999.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with Bill Steigerwald in Reason Magazine, Jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered not for her work concerning city planning, but for the discovery of import replacement. Critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of import substitution advanced earlier by scholars such as Andre Gunder Frank. Import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution. However, even this would lead to confusion since in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city.|$|E
25|$|The {{theology}} of Ezekiel is notable for {{its contribution to}} the emerging notion of individual responsibility to God â€“ each man would be held responsible only for his own sins. This is {{in marked contrast to}} the Deuteronomistic writers, who held that the sins of <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>would</b> be held against all, without regard for an individual's personal guilt. Nonetheless, Ezekiel shared many ideas in common with the Deuteronomists, notably the notion that God works according to the principle of retributive justice and an ambivalence towards kingship (although the Deuteronomists reserved their scorn for individual kings rather than for the office itself). As a priest, Ezekiel praises the Zadokites over the Levites (lower level temple functionaries), whom he largely blames for the destruction and exile. He is clearly connected with the Holiness Code and its vision of a future dependent on keeping the Laws of God and maintaining ritual purity. Notably, Ezekiel blames the Babylonian exile not on the people's failure to keep the Law, but on their worship of gods other than Yahweh and their injustice: these, says Ezekiel in chapters 8â€“11, are the reasons God's Shekhinah left his city and his people.|$|E

The government had stated that the lands of the Ojibwa were unsuitable for farming and white settlement. The Ojibwa did obtain annuity payments to be paid each year at La Pointe, and reserved the right to hunt, fish, gather, and move across any lands outlined in the treaties.
