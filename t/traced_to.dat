40|$|We {{evaluated}} Fusarium {{contamination and}} {{the levels of}} hexadepsipeptide mycotoxins in 13 wheat samples affected by head blight in Finland. Fusarium avenaceum was the dominant species (91 %) isolated from all samples, but isolates of F. culmorum (4 %), F. tricinctum (3 %), and F. poae (2 %) also were recovered. Beauvericin (0. 64 to 3. 5 μg/g) was detected in all 13 samples. Enniatin B (<b>trace</b> <b>to</b> 4. 8 μg/g) was detected in 12 samples, enniatin B 1 (<b>trace</b> <b>to</b> 1. 9 μg/g) was detected in 8 samples, and enniatin A 1 (<b>trace</b> <b>to</b> 6. 9 μg/g) was detected in 10 samples. Ten of 13 strains of F. avenaceum and 2 strains of F. poae and F. tricinctum produced beauvericin in culture on rice (<b>trace</b> <b>to</b> 70, 9. 4, and 33 μg/g, respectively). All strains also produced enniatins (<b>trace</b> <b>to</b> 2, 700 μg/g). This is the first report on the natural cooccurence of beauvericin and enniatins in wheat infected predominantly by F. avenaceum...|$|R
