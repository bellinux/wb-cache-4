5|$|By June President Habyarimana {{had come}} to view Hutu Power, rather than the {{mainstream}} opposition, as {{the biggest threat to}} his leadership. This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus it needed <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> a completion. According to Prunier, this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF, than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process. The RPF enjoyed much greater leverage following their successful February campaign, and the government eventually agreed to their power-sharing demands. The RPF were allocated up to 40% of the troops in the proposed unified national armed forces, and 50% of the officer corps. With all details agreed, the Arusha Accords were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.|$|E

500|$|In 1970 the Somerset Wildlife Trust {{bought the}} first part of the last [...] of acid raised bog {{vegetation}} left on the Somerset Moors undamaged by peat digging or agriculture. Since then SWT have bought or been given 100 hectares of former peatworkings. These were sculpted and restored to wetland as the experimental area for the Avalon Marshes. [...] This was the term given in the late 1980s to describe the wetland restored from peat workings in the Brue Valley. The wetland on the clay is dominated by Phragmites reed, catstail and open water. The wetland restoration has been a great success and was declared a National Nature Reserve in 1995. Peat working is now beginning <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> a close on Westhay Moor and the majority of the remaining peatworkings are now being restored to wetland as they are completed. In 2014 two land owners unsuccessfully appealed against changes in planning permission which removed their rights to dig peat from Westhay Moor.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the Great Irish Famine, {{which lasted}} from 1845 to 1852, {{thousands}} of people emigrated from Ireland every week on ships known as [...] "coffin ships". During these years Limerick port {{was the point of}} emigration for many people from Limerick, Clare and Tipperary. One of the ships that carried people across the Atlantic was the 3-masted barque Edmond. Normally based in London, the ship was chartered for the year by Limerick businessman, John McDonnell. As 1850 was beginning <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> a close, and as the weather became more and more dangerous, ships were still crossing due to the demand for passage to the New World.|$|E
2500|$|While the Americans {{that had}} {{previously}} held the area had undertaken a defensive campaign maintaining a series of standing patrols, the Australians decided to employ more aggressive tactics. The offensive began in mid-December and as the Australians advanced eastwards {{over the course of}} the following months, elements from the 2/6th found themselves involved in a number of roles, patrolling ahead of the rest of the 6th Division. Where necessary they were also used in a traditional infantry role to seize and hold ground, such as during the landings around Dove Bay in May, when the regiment was tasked with capturing the village of Sauri. This was achieved by the 2/7th Commando Squadron on 11 May when an attack was put in by two troops with artillery support, which resulted in two Australians and 16 Japanese killed and five Australians wounded. In June and July, the fighting began <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> a close, and the regiment was used mainly in [...] "mopping up" [...] operations in the Boiken area, where Japanese raiding parties continued to cause havoc amongst the Australian forces right up until the end of the war. The danger continued after the war had officially come to an end. The regiment's final fatality came on 18 August when a trooper triggered a booby trap while on a patrol.|$|E
