5|$|Before {{its release}} on 10 June 2005, one preview {{wondered}} how the film would fare at the box office. Citing comparisons with the 1953 version, the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film-making, the probable inability of debutant actress, Balan to portray Lalita's character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporary actors and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> adaptation.|$|E
5|$|David Bunnell joined MITS as a {{technical}} writer in the calculator heyday. In April 1975 he created a newsletter so the MITS staff could easily communicate with the customers. The newsletter, Computer Notes, was available to customers and other interested readers. It was a large format newsletter; 11.25 by 15.5inches (286 by 394mm), and each issue had 8 to 24 pages. In January 1977, it switched to a smaller magazine format and the last issue was produced in January 1978. Bunnell started Personal Computer magazine in October 1976 and went on <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> career as a magazine publisher.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} this success, it was clear the Blenheim was simply {{not going to work}} as a fighter. On several {{occasions}} the CH stations directed the fighters <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> radar capture, only to have the target slowly pull away from the fighter. In one case the Blenheim was able to see the target, but when it spotted them the aircraft increased power and disappeared. From 1 to 15 October 1940 Mk. III-equipped fighters from RAF Kenley made 92 flights, performed 28 radar interceptions, and made zero kills.|$|E
5|$|Macartney resumed Test cricket when Australia hosted England in 1920–21, {{and was one}} of {{only four}} players {{remaining}} from before the war. However, he only played in two of the Tests due to illness and injury. His early season form was ominous for the tourists. Macartney scored 161 in guiding New South Wales <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> run-chase of 4/335 over the Englishmen. He then scored 96 and 30 for an Australian XI against the tourists in a dress rehearsal for the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Peada's {{conversion}} {{and the introduction}} of priests into Middle Anglia could be seen as evidence of Penda's tolerance of Christianity, given the absence of evidence that he sought to interfere. On the other hand, an interpretation is also possible whereby the marriage and conversion could be seen as corresponding <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> attempt on Oswiu's part to expand Bernician influence at Penda's expense; Higham saw Peada's conversion more in terms of political manoeuvring on both sides than religious zeal.|$|E

5|$|During December 1914, O'Leary saw heavy {{fighting}} with the Irish Guards and was Mentioned in Despatches and subsequently promoted to Lance Corporal on 5 January 1915. Three weeks later, on 30 January, the Irish Guards were ordered to prepare for an attack on German positions near Cuinchy on the La Bassée Canal, a response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> German operation in the area five days before. The Germans attacked first however, and {{on the morning of}} 1 February seized a stretch of canal embankment on the western end of the 2nd Brigade line from a company of Coldstream Guards. This section, known as the Hollow, was tactically important as it defended a culvert that passed underneath a railway embankment. 4 Company of Irish Guards, originally in reserve, were tasked with joining the Coldstream Guards in retaking the position at 04:00, but the attack was met with heavy machine gun fire and most of the assault party, including all of the Irish Guards officers, were killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Edward sent assurances to the Pope {{that the}} {{conflict}} surrounding Gaveston's role was at an end. On {{the basis of these}} promises, and procedural concerns about the how the original decision had been taken, the Pope agreed to annul the Archbishop's threat to excommunicate Gaveston, thus opening the possibility of Gaveston's return. Gaveston arrived back in England in June, where he was met by Edward. At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions to placate those opposed to Gaveston, including agreeing to limit the powers of the royal steward and the marshal of the royal household, to regulate the Crown's unpopular powers of purveyance and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, the parliament agreed to fresh taxes for the war in Scotland. Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> compromise.|$|E
5|$|Following Greece, the {{headquarters}} of I Corps returned to Palestine. Wells was made General Staff Officer, 2nd Grade (GSO2), the {{deputy chief of staff}} in charge of planning operations. I Corps was alerted {{to take part in the}} Syria-Lebanon Campaign, in spite of the fact that since Blamey had been promoted to Deputy Commander in Chief Middle East Command, the corps lacked a commanding officer. General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson—the British commander in Palestine and Transjordan—believed that I Corps' loss of transport and signal equipment precluded it from participating in the campaign from the outset. Instead, Wilson attempted to exercise command from the King David Hotel. This proved to be a serious error, as his staff were preoccupied with political and administrative issues, and were too remote from the battlefields to exercise the close command required. Following a series of reverses, I Corps headquarters was sent for on 18 June, and Lieutenant General John Lavarack assumed command that day. The headquarters was confronted by a difficult situation, with almost all reserves committed. Lavarack began regrouping his force, concentrating the 7th Division for a decisive thrust towards Beirut. Hard fighting was required before the campaign was brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> conclusion.|$|E

5|$|General Atkinson, {{who learned}} in early July that Scott {{would be taking}} command, hoped to bring the war <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> {{conclusion}} before Scott's arrival. The Americans had difficulty locating the British Band, however, {{thanks in part to}} false intelligence given to them by area Native Americans. Potawatomis and Ho-Chunks in Illinois, many of whom had sought to remain neutral in the war, decided to cooperate with the Americans. Tribal leaders knew that some of their warriors had aided the British Band, and so they hoped that a highly visible show of support for the Americans would dissuade U.S. officials from punishing the tribes after the conflict was over. Wearing white headbands to distinguish themselves from hostile Natives, Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis served as guides for Atkinson's army. Ho-Chunks sympathetic to the plight of Black Hawk's people misled Atkinson into thinking that the British Band was still at Lake Koshkonong. While Atkinson's men were trudging through the swamps and running low on provisions, the British Band had in fact relocated miles to the north. Potawatomis under Billy Caldwell also managed to demonstrate support for the Americans while avoiding battle.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea towards the Philippines or northward towards the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of Europe first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely {{the reduction of the}} threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia. By agreement among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into the South West Pacific Area, under General Douglas MacArthur, and the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area but the initial operations in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction was more violent than anticipated and some months passed before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces—primarily Australian—fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track Campaign, Battle of Milne Bay, Battle of Buna-Gona, and the Battle of Wau.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Cedar Creek {{occurred}} on October 19, 1864. Jubal Early's Confederate Army {{appeared to have}} a victory until General Sheridan rallied his troops <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> counterattack. Although Union casualties were more than double those of the Confederates, this battle is considered a Union victory, and Confederate troops were driven from the battlefield. The Union troops recaptured all of their artillery lost earlier in the battle, and 22 additional cannons belonging to Early's army. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry {{did not participate in}} this battle until near the end. The regiment advanced toward Front Royal right before the final cavalry charge by Merritt's and Custer's divisions. This positioning prevented the Confederate cavalry under General Lunsford L. Lomax from flanking the Union force. The Union victory helped President Abraham Lincoln get re-elected a month later.|$|E

5|$|The mid-1980s {{also saw}} Gospel music see its {{popularity}} peak. A {{new form of}} gospel had evolved, called Contemporary Christian music (CCM). CCM had {{been around since the}} late 1960s, and consisted of a pop/rock sound with slight religious lyrics. CCM had become the most popular form of gospel by the mid-1980s, especially with artists like Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, and Kathy Troccoli. Amy Grant was the most popular CCM, and gospel, singer of the 1980s, and after experiencing unprecedented success in CCM, crossed over into mainstream pop in the 1980s and 1990s. Michael W. Smith also had considerable success in CCM before crossing over <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> career in pop music as well.

5|$|Wright {{was sacked}} by Arsenal in June 1966 {{and the board}} of {{directors}} hired the club's physiotherapist Bertie Mee as his successor. Mee insisted on an escape clause in his contract provided if the arrangement did not work, which the club duly obliged. The position became permanent eleven months later, even though Arsenal were 14th in the league table. The club's fortunes changed under Mee however, as he started to bed in youth players. He led Arsenal to successive League Cup final appearances in 1968 and 1969, and ended the club's 17-year wait for silverware when his side beat Anderlecht in the 1970 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final. Mee's greatest triumph was the club's league and cup double of 1970–71, but he struggled to better that achievement, having made radical changes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> team.|$|E
