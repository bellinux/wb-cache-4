2500|$|On <b>turned</b> <b>parts</b> an {{undercut}} {{is also known}} as a neck or [...] "relief groove". They are often used {{at the end of the}} threaded portion of a shaft or screw to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as thread relief in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least [...] smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. [...] Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter. [...] They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If {{an undercut}} is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on technical drawings by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.|$|E

50|$|Clissett made {{chairs in}} the West Midlands tradition, turning the parts from fresh, unseasoned ash (Fraxinus excelsior) with a pole lathe.

While rush-seated ladderback chairs are his most well-known output, he also made spindleback chairs which are often stamped with his initials.

50|$|Polygonally <b>turned</b> <b>parts</b> {{may have}} several points, teeth, {{or other forms}} at the ends or along their circumference. The {{technique}} requires synchronisation of {{the movement of the}} polygonal turning mill and the part being machined. Polygonal turning allows rapid production and clean machining of advanced geometries. The polygon turning unit has a multitude of inserts, and is synchronized so that when an insert cuts the turning bar stock, it cuts the bar at the same radial position each time the workpiece rotates. This enables geometries such as hexes, squares and flats to be machined at faster speeds than by milling.|$|E
50|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 1980s the Wimpy burger bar on the {{junction}} of Princes Street and Castle Street provided a suitable hang out for the perennial presence of the Hibs casuals on the main thoroughfare in the city. Mainly in attendance were the BBC, who were known to be there from mid-morning until midnight, and by the evening a mob of around 50-60 CCS could gather there.

5000|$|With the {{development}} and dissemination of CNC lathes, which themselves often have automated turrets, manual turret lathes began to lose their position {{as the key to}} mass production of <b>turned</b> <b>parts.</b> However, they did not become obsolete; the focus of their use simply shifted from the main turning operations of mass production, which are now usually done by CNCs, to small runs, for which they can still compete in unit cost with CNC use, and second operations, such as re-chucking a part turned out by a CNC {{in order to make a}} few simple cuts on the back. This transition in primary job description is reflected in the name [...] "second-operation lathe", which is often synonymous with [...] "manual turret lathe". Similarly, cam-operated screw machines and chuckers did not disappear; they simply shifted to a different niche. They still often compete with CNC machines in terms of unit cost per part produced, depending on the difference in overhead. A CNC lathe with hefty payments may translate to higher overall costs than a screw machine or chucker that is long since paid for.|$|E

40|$|<b>Turned</b> <b>parts</b> {{on turning}} centers {{are made up}} of {{features}} with profiles defined by arcs and lines. An error model for <b>turned</b> <b>parts</b> must take into account not only individual feature errors but also how errors carry over from one feature to another. In the case where there is a requirement of tangency between two features, such as a line tangent to an arc or two tangent arcs, any error model on one of the features must also satisfy a condition of tangency at a boundary point between the two features. Splines, or piecewise polynomials with differentiability conditions at intermediate or knot points, adequately model errors on features and provide the necessary degrees of freedom to match constraint conditions at boundary points. The problem of modeling errors on features becomes one of least squares fitting of splines to the measured feature errors subject to certain linear constraints at the boundaries. The solution of this problem can be formulated uniquely using the generalized or pseudo inverse of a matrix. This is defined and the algorithm for modeling errors on <b>turned</b> <b>parts</b> is formulated in terms of splines with specified boundary constraints.

40|$|In this paper, two {{different}} turning processes namely rotational turning and hard turning are compared {{to each other}} regarding surface generation aspects. By experiments it is shown that, with higher feed rates, rotational turning yields same surface quality as hard turning. Feed rates can be chosen six times higher in rotational turning than in conventional hard turning without losses in the surface roughness quality. Also experiments reveal that the tool wear in rotational turning has a beneficial effect on the surface roughness. A corresponding explanation model is thereby presented which takes the specific tool/work piece engagement in rotational turning into account. Furthermore, it is shown that rotational turning has negative effects on the surface integrity. The phase transformation zones (“white layers”) are thicker in rotational <b>turned</b> <b>parts</b> than in hard <b>turned</b> <b>parts.</b> Also the level of tensile residual stress in rotational turning is higher than in hard turning. Both effects are probably caused by high thermal material loads in rotational turning due to increased friction. However, {{the results of this}} paper show that rotational turning has a high potential to become an efficient alternative to hard turning, {{especially when it comes to}} large scale production of simple shaped parts...|$|E
