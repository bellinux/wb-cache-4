5|$|Chrysler Corporation {{approved}} {{the development of}} the model on the assumption that Chrysler Europe would sell 60,000 C9 models per year, which translated into a projected 5percent share of the executive car market. This estimate seemed achievable because Chrysler had a 7percent market share in Europe overall.

50|$|The {{economics}} of plastics processing {{is determined by}} the type of process. Plastics can be processed with the following methods: machining, compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, extrusion, rotational molding, blow molding, thermoforming, casting, forging, and foam molding. Processing methods are selected based on equipment <b>cost,</b> production rate, <b>tooling</b> <b>cost,</b> and build volume. High equipment and <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium equipment <b>cost</b> and <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> methods are used for low production volumes. Compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, forging, and foam molding has high equipment and <b>tooling</b> <b>cost.</b> Lower cost processes are machining, extruding, rotational molding, blow molding, thermoforming, and casting. A summary of each process and its cost is displayed figure 1.|$|R

25|$|In 1971 AMT issued {{models of}} at least three {{different}} pieces of American LaFrance fire-fighting apparatus, including a pumper, a rear-mount aerial ladder truck and a rear-mount articulating boom truck. The prototypes were selected allow part sharing among the kits to minimize <b>tooling</b> <b>costs.</b> All three kits have been reissued by AMT-Ertl in recent years.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{interference}} to receivers, licensing authorities will avoid assigning common IF frequencies to transmitting stations. Standard intermediate frequencies used are 455kHz for medium-wave AM radio, 10.7MHz for broadcast FM receivers, 38.9MHz (Europe) or 45MHz (US) for television, and 70MHz for satellite and terrestrial microwave equipment. To avoid <b>tooling</b> <b>costs</b> associated with these components, most manufacturers then tended to design their receivers around a fixed range of frequencies offered, {{which resulted in a}} worldwide de facto standardization of intermediate frequencies.|$|E
25|$|The AMC Cavalier {{was unique}} in that the vehicle was a study in symmetry. It was built to {{demonstrate}} the use of numerous interchangeable body panels. For example, the fenders were identical (the opposite ends, e.g. left front and right rear). The doors were similarly shared with opposite sides (an idea originated by Cord on its prototype 935 Saloon) since the rear doors were hinged in the back (suicide door). The hood and decklid were also interchangeable. The Nash Metropolitan, which was sold by AMC up to 1962, also had interchangeable inner panels, but their outer skins were different. In addition to reducing <b>tooling</b> <b>costs</b> by thirty percent, the design objective of the AMC Cavalier was also to demonstrate how to reduce the costs of production.|$|E

40|$|High speed turning (HST) is an {{approach}} {{that can be used}} to increase the material removal rate (MRR) by higher cutting speed. Increasing MRR will lead to shortening time to market. In contrast, increasing the cutting speed will lead to increasing the flank wear rate and then the <b>tooling</b> <b>cost.</b> Â  However, the main factor that will justify the best level of cutting speed is the <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> which merges all in one understandable measurable factor for manufacturer. The aim of this paper is to determine experimentally the optimum cutting levels that minimize the <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> in machining AISI 304 as a work piece machined by a coated carbide tool using one of the non-conventional methods: Genetic Algorithm (GA).

25|$|Originally, {{the car was}} {{designed}} for a Wankel rotary engine. In 1973, AMC signed a licensing agreement with Curtiss-Wright to build Wankels for cars and Jeep-type vehicles. (The agreement also permitted Curtiss-Wright to sell rotaries elsewhere.) Later, AMC decided instead to purchase the engines from General Motors (GM), who were developing them for use in their own cars. However, GM canceled development in 1974 for reasons that included durability issues, the fuel crisis, <b>tooling</b> <b>costs</b> (for the engines and also {{for a new product}} line designed {{to take advantage of the}} rotary's ultra-compact dimensions) and the upcoming (late 1970s) U.S. emissions legislation. It was also thought that the high-revving Wankel would not suit Americans accustomed to low revs and high torque.|$|E
2500|$|From the beginning, the Jet {{project was}} {{hampered}} by Hudson President A.E. Barit, 63 {{years old in}} 1953, who disregarded the suggestions of the company's stylists and other advisors. For example, Barit insisted that the compact-sized Jet offer full-size car amenities. While designers attempted to form a car that was lower, wider, and proportionally sleeker to the dimensions of a smaller compact car, Barit would not back away from features such as chair high seating for passengers, and a [...] "tall" [...] greenhouse with a ceiling that would allow riders to wear their hats while in the car. Barit also decided that the Jet's rear design would incorporate Oldsmobile-like high rear fender and small round tail light design. The design was further changed to accommodate the personal likes of Chicago, Illinois Hudson dealer Jim Moran, whose dealership became number one sales outlet for Hudson, accounting for about 5% of Hudson's total production. Moran fancied the 1952 Ford's wrap around rear window and roofline, and Barit ordered a similar design for the Jet. The final result was that the Jet's styling closely mimicked the larger 1952-1954 Ford in many respects. The strong unitized Monobuilt bodies for the Jet were produced by the Murray Corporation of Detroit. One {{of the reasons for}} outsourcing the production of bodies [...] "was that Murray agreed to amortize the <b>tooling</b> <b>costs</b> over the production run, reducing the upfront investment" [...] making the Jet possible because Hudson did not have enough resources to pay for the <b>tooling</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

50|$|Welded bellows (also called edge-welded, or {{diaphragm}} bellows) {{are manufactured}} by welding {{a number of}} individually formed diaphragms to each other. The comparison between the two bellows types generally centers on cost and performance. Hydroformed bellows generally have a high <b>tooling</b> <b>cost,</b> but, when mass-produced, may have a lower piece price. However, hydroformed bellows have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness. Welded metal bellows are produced with a lower initial <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> and maintain higher performance characteristics. The drawback of welded bellows is the reduced metal strength at weld joints, caused by the high temperature of welding.|$|R
