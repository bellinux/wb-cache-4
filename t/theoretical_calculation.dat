5|$|The undiscovered isotope 284Ds {{has been}} {{predicted}} {{to be the}} most stable towards beta decay; however, no known darmstadtium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>calculation</b> in a quantum tunneling model reproduces the experimental alpha decay half-life data for the known darmstadtium isotopes. It also predicts that the undiscovered isotope 294Ds, which has a magic number of neutrons (184), would have an alpha decay half-life on the order of 311years: exactly the same approach predicts a ~3500-year alpha half-life for the non-magic 293Ds isotope, however.|$|E

Argon fluorohydride (HArF), {{a compound of}} argon with fluorine and hydrogen that is stable below , has been demonstrated. [...] Although the neutral ground-state chemical compounds of argon are presently limited to HArF, argon can form clathrates with water when atoms of argon are trapped in a lattice of water molecules. Ions, such as , and excited-state complexes, such as ArF, have been demonstrated. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>calculation</b> predicts several more argon compounds that should be stable but {{have not yet been}} synthesized.|$|E
500|$|Newton {{also built}} the first {{practical}} reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. [...] Newton's work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, first published in 1704. [...] He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first <b>theoretical</b> <b>calculation</b> {{of the speed of}} sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. [...] In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difference}} between the g-factors of the muon and the electron is due to their difference in mass. [...] Because of the muon's larger mass, contributions to the <b>theoretical</b> <b>calculation</b> of its anomalous magnetic dipole moment from Standard Model weak interactions and from contributions involving hadrons are important at {{the current level of}} precision, whereas these effects are not important for the electron. [...] The muon's anomalous magnetic dipole moment is also sensitive to contributions from new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry. [...] For this reason, the muon's anomalous magnetic moment is normally used as a probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model rather than as a test of QED. A new experiment at Fermilab using the E821 magnet will improve the precision of this measurement.|$|E

2500|$|The photon propagator, {{which is}} the multiplicative factor {{corresponding}} to an internal photon in the Feynman diagram expansion of a QED calculation, contains a factor gμν corresponding to the Minkowski metric. [...] An expansion of this factor as a sum over photon polarizations involves terms containing all four possible polarizations. [...] Transversely polarized radiation can be expressed mathematically as a sum over either a linearly or circularly polarized basis. [...] Similarly, one can combine the longitudinal and time-like gauge polarizations to obtain [...] "forward" [...] and [...] "backward" [...] polarizations; these are a form of light cone coordinates in which the metric is off-diagonal. [...] An expansion of the gμν factor in terms of circularly polarized (spin ±1) and light cone coordinates is called a spin sum.
