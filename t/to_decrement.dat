40|$|Diagnostic {{classification}} {{systems are}} designed to identify clinical conditions that produce significant decrements in functional status. Historically, {{there has been a}} tendency to consider conditions that fall below threshold levels as temporary phenomena that do not interfere with daily functioning. However, dismissing subthreshold symptoms may be particularly problematic for older adults. The present study examined the relationship between depression, anxiety, and decrements in functional status among older adults using both continuous and categorical diagnostic approaches. One hundred veterans were recruited from the Veterans Health Study, a longitudinal investigation of male veterans 2 ̆ 7 health. Participants completed screening measures of depression, anxiety, functional status, medical comorbidity, and the SCID anxiety and mood modules. One-quarter of the sample met DSM-IV criteria for one of the targeted mood or anxiety disorders. Continuous and categorical measures of depression were significantly related <b>to</b> <b>decrements</b> in functional status above and beyond comorbid medical conditions. A significant association was found between anxiety symptoms (per continuous measure) and decrements in functional status. This finding suggests that anxious symptoms are related <b>to</b> <b>decrements</b> in work, self-care, and leisure activities. Moreover, the results indicate that continuous measures of anxiety that focus on severity of symptoms rather than {{the presence or absence of}} a disorder, may be a more appropriate for assessing late-life anxiety. Health care professionals who treat older adults should not dismiss anxious or depressive symptoms among frail older adults as merely a natural outcome of aging or disease. Efforts <b>to</b> reduce <b>decrements</b> in functional status experienced by older adults with anxious and depressive symptoms should focus on educating health care providers to recognize and treat the full spectrum of anxiety and depressive syndromes. ...|$|R

50|$|As before, {{one of the}} {{counters}} is used as scratchpad. The other holds an integer whose prime factorization is 2a3b5c7d. The exponents a, b, c, and d {{can be thought of}} as four virtual counters that are being packed (via Gödel numbering) into a single real counter. If the real counter is set to zero then incremented once, that is equivalent to setting all the virtual counters to zero. If the real counter is doubled, that is equivalent to incrementing a, and if it's halved, that's equivalent <b>to</b> <b>decrementing</b> a. By a similar procedure, it can be multiplied or divided by 3, which is equivalent <b>to</b> incrementing or <b>decrementing</b> b. Similarly, c and d can be incremented or <b>decremented.</b> <b>To</b> check if a virtual counter such as c is equal to zero, just divide the real counter by 5, see what the remainder is, then multiply by 5 and add back the remainder. That leaves the real counter unchanged. The remainder will have been nonzero if and only if c was zero.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of emotion on human memory {{is associated with}} two contradictory effects {{in the form of}} either emotion-induced enhancements or decrements in memory. In a series of experiments involving single word presentation, we show that enhanced memory for emotional words is strongly coupled <b>to</b> <b>decrements</b> in memory for items preceding the emotional stimulus, an effect that is more pronounced in women. These memory effects would appear to depend on a common neurobiological substrate, in that enhancements and decrements are reversed by propranolol, a β-adrenergic antagonist, and abolished by selective bilateral amygdala damage. Thus, our findings suggest that amygdala-dependent β-adrenergic modulation of episodic encoding has costs as well as benefits...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) and Valeriana officinalis (valerian) {{have been}} used both {{traditionally}} and contemporaneously as mild sedatives, anxiolytics and hypnotics. Recent {{research has suggested that}} both may attenuate laboratory induced stress. As the two herbs are most often sold in combination with each other the current study assessed the anxiolytic properties of such a combination during laboratory-induced stress. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, balanced cross-over experiment, 24 healthy volunteers received three separate single doses (600 mg, 1200 mg, 1800 mg) of a standardized product containing M. officinalis and V. officinalis extracts, plus a placebo, on separate days separated by a 7 day wash out period. Modulation of mood and anxiety were assessed during pre-dose and 1 h, 3 h and 6 h post-dose completions of a 20 min version of the Defined Intensity Stressor Simulation (DISS) battery. Cognitive performance on the four concurrent tasks of the battery was also assessed. Results: The results showed that the 600 mg dose of the combination ameliorated the negative effects of the DISS on ratings of anxiety. However, the highest dose (1800 mg) showed an increase in anxiety that was less marked but which reached significance during one testing session. In addition, all three doses led <b>to</b> <b>decrements</b> in performance on the Stroop task module within the battery, and the two lower doses led <b>to</b> <b>decrements</b> on the overall score generated on the DISS battery. Conclusions: These results suggest that a combination of Melissa officinalis and Valeriana officinalis possesses anxiolytic properties that deserve further investigation...|$|R

But when looking at a sphere, the integer radius of some adjacent circles is the same, but it is not expected to have the same exact circle adjacent to itself in the same hemisphere.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} mainly with hyperventilation as it affects aircrew. A literature survey {{has been carried}} out on the causes and effects of hyperventilation and on its investigation and incidence in flight. Measurements of end tidal carbon dioxide tensions (PETCO 2) were made during an anxiety-provoking experimental procedure. These measurements confirmed that anxiety can cause hyperventilation to such a level that the imposition of other stresses found in the flight environment could be expected to cause a performance decrement. Present methods for studying the incidence of hyperventilation in flight are unsatisfactory for various reasons. An attempt was made to develop a simple test for hyperventilation based on a rebreathing estimate of mixed venous carbon dioxide tension. However, examination of the results and a further examination of the basic physiology revealed that the procedure was unlikely to be fruitful. Further experiments were carried out to study the effects of hyperventilation on various respiratory variables and on the time course of the subsequent recovery. It was found that the carbon dioxide cost of hyperventilation was more than that found by other investigators, although estimates of other respiratory variables agreed with those found by further authors in similar circumstances; the possible reasons for this are discussed. Studies of psychomotor performance carried out at the same time failed to demonstrate a consistent decrement in performance with hypocapnia. Further experiments were carried out which suggest that the previously reported decrements in psychomotor performance during hypocapnia are related more <b>to</b> <b>decrements</b> in motor performance than <b>to</b> <b>decrements</b> in intellectual performance. Finally, suggestions are made for further work to be carried out in the same field...|$|R
