5|$|San Marco, which {{eventually}} gave {{its name to}} the former area of South Jacksonville, broke ground in 1925 as the city's most ambitious development. It was constructed over 80 acres of the former Villa Alexandria estate, which had deteriorated after Martha Reed Mitchell's death in 1902. The developer was Telfair Stockton, who had previously established the exclusive Avondale neighborhood {{on the other side of}} the river. San Marco, designed as a fashionable, upscale development in keeping with Villa Alexandria's reputation, comprised 250 lots and a commercial district. It was remarkably successful from the beginning; apparently driven by land speculation, San Marco shattered local records by selling every lot within three hours of putting <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> sale, even though very little work had begun.|$|E
5|$|The Great Powers occupying Paris {{demanded that}} Louis XVIII {{implement}} a constitution.

The constitution had 76 articles. Taxation was to be voted on by the chambers. Catholicism was to be the official religion of France. To be eligible for membership in the Chamber of Deputies, one had to pay over 1,000 francs per year in tax, and be over the age of forty. The king would appoint peers to the Chamber of Peers on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.|$|E

25|$|Bat Masterson {{became more}} widely {{known as a}} gunfighter {{as a result of}} a {{practical}} joke played on a gullible newspaper reporter in August 1881. Seeking copy in Gunnison, Colorado, the reporter asked Dr. W.S. Cockrell about mankillers. Dr. Cockrell pointed to a young man nearby and said it was Bat and that he had killed 26 men. Cockrell then regaled the reporter with several lurid tales about Bat's exploits, and the reporter wrote <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the New York Sun. The story was then widely reprinted in papers all over the country. Cockrell subsequently apologized to Bat, who insisted he was not even in Gunnison at the time.|$|E

25|$|Another {{research}} {{focus for}} EPI is {{the expansion of}} access to educational opportunities that {{are found to be}} of high quality, with the rationale that access is only relevant if it is to a quality learning experience. As the economy has become increasingly global, EPI supports the notion that students must be armed with skills that set <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> success in a competitive and technologically savvy market. Thus, EPI recognizes the rising need for students to attain postsecondary degrees, and focuses a great deal of its research on the ability of underserved student populations to matriculate through and graduate from higher education institutions, including the financial and social challenges that come along with this goal.|$|E
25|$|With Hammond ill Norman Yardley led {{the team}} in the return match against Victoria. He won the toss and batted with the MCC making 355.

Victoria were in trouble at 32/3, but captain Lindsay Hassett (126) added 120 runs in 120 minutes with the 18-year-old Neil Harvey (69).

25|$|The German {{planning}} {{was entirely}} different. Running out of strategic options, the Wehrmacht planned an all-out counteroffensive in the West, codenamed Wacht am Rhein. The {{first draft of}} the plan was already completed in secret in October 1944 and was aimed against the Ardennes, mirroring the successful campaign in 1940 against France. The plan required for the best divisions of the Wehrmacht to be held back from the autumn fighting, to gain time to build <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the planned offensive. For the successful execution of the plan, the holding of the Rur River line was deemed as absolutely important, to prevent the Allies from a flanking attack. The German plan for the November–December Campaign was therefore to hold the Rur River line {{with a minimum of}} available forces until the Ardennes Offensive could be launched.|$|E
