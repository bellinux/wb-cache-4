40|$|In {{fractured}} rock masses, large excavations have an unsupported stand-up times Jess {{than the}} minimum time required to support the roof after the excavation. Therefore, the principal objective {{in the design of}} a support system is to help the rock mass to support itself. The use of rock bolts is a very flexible supporting method that can be combined with wire mesh, shotcrete and concrete lining. During past years a wide variety of dowels and bolt types were developed but most of them failed within a short period and the cost were high. Advantages of cable strand supports have been well documented and include flexibility, strength, and ease of installation. Main objective of this project is to design rock bolts using discarded wire ropes 01 ' cables at a low cost. A detailed designing methodology was carried out to fabricate this bolt. The bolt consists of nearly 1. 6 m long cable and 16 em of anchored part and cable <b>tightening</b> <b>part.</b> Outer diameter of bolt is 33 mm and inner diameter is 12 mm and used cable diameter is Smm. Field data illustrated the amount of load measurements that the bolt can carry is 5 kN, Suggestions were made to improve the design, which will enhance bolt performance. Field tests carried out at Bogala Lanka Graphite Ltd proved that cable bolts are effective in Sri Lankan conditions...|$|E

Joins pair of perpendicular posts supporting laser, lens, reflector, or other optical component and enables posts to be rotated in perpendicular planes so orientation and position of component adjusted. Advantage of clamp conferred by its E-type retaining rings, which hold post-clamp collars to post-clamp body. Collar tightens around post to prevent movement along post while allowing clamp to turn around post. Quarter-turn screws on body and collars <b>tighten</b> <b>parts</b> on post.

It causes some paralysis (weakening) of the muscle by preventing muscle contractions (<b>tightening).</b> As <b>part</b> of the treatment for clubfoot, Botox is injected into the child’s calf muscle. In about one week, the Botox weakens the Achilles tendon. This allows the foot to be turned into a normal position over a period of 4-6 weeks, without surgery.|$|R

50|$|Simply {{twisting}} DNA can expose internal {{bases to}} the outside, {{without the aid}} of any proteins. Also, transcription itself contorts DNA in living human cells, <b>tightening</b> some <b>parts</b> of the coil and loosening it in others. That stress triggers changes in shape, most notably opening up the helix to be read. Unfortunately, these interactions are very difficult to study because biological molecules morph shapes so easily. In 2008 it was noted that transcription twists DNA, leaving a trail of undercoiled (or negatively supercoiled) DNA in its wake. Moreover, they discovered that the DNA sequence itself effects how the molecule responds to supercoiling. For example, the researchers identified a specific sequence of DNA that regulates transcription speed; as the amount of supercoil rises and falls, it slows or speeds the pace at which molecular machinery reads DNA. It is hypothesized that these structural changes might trigger stress elsewhere along its length, which in turn might provide trigger points for replication or gene expression. This implies that it is a very dynamic process in which both DNA and proteins each influences how the other acts and reacts.|$|R
25|$|The {{vocal folds}} are {{located within the}} larynx {{at the top of}} the trachea. They are {{attached}} posteriorly to the arytenoid cartilages, and anteriorly to the thyroid cartilage. They are part of the glottis which includes the rima glottidis. Their outer edges are attached to muscle in the larynx while their inner edges, or margins, are free forming the opening called the rima glottidis. They are constructed from epithelium, but they have a few muscle fibres in them, namely the vocalis muscle which <b>tightens</b> the front <b>part</b> of the ligament near to the thyroid cartilage. They are flat triangular bands and are pearly white in color. Above both sides of the glottis are the two vestibular folds or false vocal folds which have a small sac between them.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} empirically {{the relationship between}} inflation and inflation uncertainty in twelve EMU countries. We estimate a time-varying parameter model with a GARCH specification for the conditional volatility of inflation in order to distinguish between short-run (structural and impulse) and steady-state uncertainty. We then introduce a dummy variable to model the policy regime shift which occurred in 1999 {{with the introduction of}} the Euro, and its effects on the links between inflation and inflation uncertainty. We find that the EMU countries have had rather different experiences, and that in the post-Euro period monetary policy might have become less effective in lowering inflation uncertainty, in the sense that a monetary <b>tightening</b> on the <b>part</b> of the ECB might in result in higher uncertainty. This suggests the need for improvements in the ECB’s analytical framework. ...|$|R

40|$|Since her Certificates in General Education for Adults {{class had}} not {{achieved}} the required competencies at writing for self-expression, a teacher {{felt it would}} be an appropriate genre for her to model. She drafted, edited, and completed the text on a large-screen computer. When trying to decide whether each text achieved the competencies required at each level, the teacher became aware of difficulties experienced by the students as authors and herself as a marker.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} measure axial tension in bolted joint {{at the initial}} tightening and to evaluate {{the change in the}} axial tension in the joint, it is important to clarify the strain distribution of the cylindrical <b>part</b> <b>tightened</b> initially. As a first step, the effects of form accuracy of the nut bearing surface on tightening performance were investigated by FEM analysis and experiments. The obtained results were as follows. Peripheral strain distribution on the internal surface of hollow-type bolted joint is affected by the form accuracy of the nut bearing surface. The strain distribution depends on the height and number of asperities as a model of the height of summit and the number of waviness on the nut bearing surface. The trends of analytical results by FEM approximately agree with those of the experimental results. The effect of form accuracy on the range of strain distribution can be classified into three regions due to the height of asperities. It is found that as a guide for the design of bolted joints, the methods with FEM and with correlation coefficient are useful for the classification of the form accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{financial}} market imperfections do matter for a firm’s access to external finance. Prior studies {{of the importance of}} liquidity constraints faced by nonfinancial firms have suffered from a glaring weakness. They have been based on a sample of publicly traded firms, omitting precisely those small firms most likely to be liquidity constrained. We overcome this limitation by focusing on the banking sector. Unlike the nonfinancial sector, the banking sector has balance sheet and income data available for all firms, {{whether or not they are}} publicly traded. This allows the use of a superior measure of the degree of information asymmetry across firms by distinguishing between publicly traded and non-publicly traded firms. Furthermore, we focus on changes in monetary policy that represent exogenous (to the banks) changes in the financing constraints faced by banks. We find that publicly traded banks, which exhibit a lower degree of information asymmetry, are better able to overcome financial market frictions, compared to the relatively opaque non-publicly traded banks, when monetary policy is tightened. Lending by the more transparent publicly traded banks is less affected by a monetary policy <b>tightening</b> in large <b>part</b> due to their ability to issue uninsured large time deposits. These results are obtained controlling for firm (bank) size, a dimension commonly used in the literature as the measure of the degree of firm access to external finance...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the dissertation is to open new perspectives on the financing of R&D and innovation. In particular, this thesis examines the role of external debt finance for funding investments in R&D in the bank-based continental European country Belgium and how this relates to the receipt of public support. Previous literature has largely focused on investigating {{the extent to which}} R&D performing companies rely on their internal financial resources and the effectiveness of various types of public support programs such as the assignment of R&D subsidies or tax credits. However, academic research on the use of external debt finance for R&D and innovation remains scarce. The aim of this dissertation is to contribute to this underexplored research area. More specifically, the thesis starts with an analysis on what types of companies actually make use of debt finance for their internal R&D activities. Next, the real impact of the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis on R&D activities at the firm level is examined, an occurrence that was characterized by severe credit <b>tightening.</b> The last <b>part</b> of the dissertation investigates the link between the receipt of selective public support for R&D and the access to bank financing. In particular, the impact of an R&D grant receipt stemming from a reputable government agency on an R&D performing company’s cost of debt is examined. status: publishe...|$|R
2500|$|Ever {{since the}} first {{appearance}} of the Red, Gold and White colors of the Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf brand sponsorship livery at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix, teams, drivers and circuits of Formula One (F1) for years had been heavily dependent on the financial backing of sponsors and from the arrival of Gold Leaf for many decades the tobacco industry {{played a major role}} in sponsoring the sport. In 1976, West Germany began a trend in outlawing tobacco sponsorships in motor races, followed by the United Kingdom in 1984, starting with major races and outlawing the rest of the sponsorships in later years. In 1992 France did the same. As anti-smoking legislation began to <b>tighten</b> in many <b>parts</b> of the world F1 became an even more important opportunity for cigarette brand promotion. The negotiating skills of the F1 leadership (especially Bernie Ecclestone) were such that in many jurisdictions F1 achieved some exemptions from the rules. However, there is now a blanket ban on advertising in Europe, and the cars are not allowed to show any links with the tobacco companies. As a result, tobacco advertising started to exit F1. In , WilliamsF1 became the first major team to run without tobacco sponsorship, and McLaren later replaced the West brand and no longer have any tobacco sponsors. Renault ended the deal with Mild Seven after the [...] season, and in the same year British American Tobacco, owners of British American Racing team withdrew from F1, selling the team to Honda. Ferrari on the other hand renewed their arrangements with Philip Morris in 2005 and later in 2011.|$|R
