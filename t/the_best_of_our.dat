[...] Vedder said, [...] "It's easily the best stuff we've done but also some of the hardest stuff. It's very aggressive, because again, it's kind of a product of what it's like to be an American these days. It's pretty aggressive, especially when you turn it loud." [...] Gossard added that after many experimental albums, Pearl Jam was [...] "like a coming together again in terms of accepting our natural strengths and also incorporating <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> experiments".|$|E

In his excited response dated October 26, 1937, Disney wrote that he felt [...] "all steamed up over the idea of Stokowski working with us... The union of Stokowski and his music, together with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> medium, would be the means of a success and should lead to a new style of motion picture presentation."
