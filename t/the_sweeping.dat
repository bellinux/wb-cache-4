Between 2009 and 2011, an estimated 5,700 people were arrested in <b>the</b> <b>sweeping</b> campaign that ensnared not only criminals, but also businessmen, members of the police force, judges, government officials, and political adversaries. The campaign was overseen by Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun, whom Bo had worked with previously in Liaoning.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the street}} was mainly {{inhabited}} by merchants and craftspeople. Although they are long gone due to <b>the</b> <b>sweeping</b> demographic changes in Kiev during times of the late Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, the street is once again thriving thanks to its unique topology, architecture, rich history and also many gift shops and small art galleries showcasing various paintings and sculptures by Ukrainian artists. The descent {{is one of the}} favorite spots for tourists. It is also notable for the many festivals it holds, including various art festivals and the Kiev Day celebrations on the last weekend of May.|$|E
5|$|MD 10 {{continues}} {{north from}} MD 177 through {{the east side}} of Glen Burnie as a six-lane freeway. The highway crosses over Marley Creek and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 (BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard). MD 10 parallels MD 270 (Furnace Branch Road) north then meets the latter highway at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The highway crosses Furnace Branch and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 710 (Ordnance Road), where northbound MD 10 becomes two lanes wide. MD 10 reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). <b>The</b> <b>sweeping</b> ramp from MD 10 to westbound I-695 merges into a collector-distributor lane that allows access from MD 10 to northbound MD 2 in Brooklyn Park.|$|E

5|$|US40Scenic was {{assigned}} to old US40 from Fifteen Mile Creek Road over Town Hill to the Mann Road intersection when US40 was moved to its and I-68's present alignment over Town Hill in 1965. US40 was expanded to a divided highway {{and moved to a}} new alignment from High Germany Road to <b>the</b> <b>sweeping</b> curve that is now Exit74 in 1983. The section of old US40 from the 19491952 Sideling Hill relocation immediately around Sideling Hill Creek was dismantled. The upgraded US40 became a part of I-68 that passes through a cut in Sideling Hill around 1987. The old alignment over Sideling Hill was transferred to county maintenance and designated US40Scenic around 1989. However, US40Scenic temporarily followed the old McFarland Road alignment of US40 {{on the west side of}} Sideling Hill until the completion of Exit74 in 1991.|$|E
5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo {{had the authority to}} arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to <b>the</b> <b>sweeping</b> use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", a euphemism for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century the {{writings}} of Humphrey Repton (1752–1818) were highly influential in {{the return of the}} formal garden near to the house. His sons were directly involved in the restructuring of the landscape at Valleyfield, Fife. Walter Scott's dislike of <b>the</b> <b>sweeping</b> away of the old formal gardens was also influential in creating an emphasis on preservation and restoration. His ideas were taken up by John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843), the most prolific gardening author of the century in Britain, and were highly influential throughout the world. By 1850 ambitious formal gardens had been recreated at Drummond Castle, Dunrobin and Drumlandrig. New plants from around the world, often discovered and sampled by Scots, such as the rhododendron and monkey puzzle tree, meant that Victorian and Edwardian gardens were characterised by an eclectic mix of the formal, picturesque and gardenesque. By {{the end of the century}} the ideas of William Robinson (1838–1935), Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932) and the Edinburgh-based Frances Hope (d. 1880), arguing for informal flower-based gardens, had begun to dominate. They resulted in a revival of the seventeenth-century mixed flower and kitchen garden, as carried out at Kellie Castle, and Earlshall, Fife by Robert Lorimer.|$|E

People currently do not have ashes from sacrificed animals, dog carcasses, or waste blood in homes and apartments. Stubs from candles used in rituals, ashes from incense, and other previous offerings can find their way into the pile of “sweepings,” which is offered on the Deipnon, as this is a time when some Hellenic Polytheists clean off all home altars and shrines. Cleaning out a refrigerator or pantry is another common practice.|$|R

5|$|The initial {{shock of}} the Spanish conquest was {{followed}} by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike. Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples. The Spanish reducciones created new nucleated settlements {{laid out in a}} grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ayuntamiento. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area. The civil government was either run directly by the Spanish and their descendents (the criollos) or was tightly controlled by them. The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism. Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups, an example being the marimba, a musical instrument of African origin. The greatest change was <b>the</b> <b>sweeping</b> aside of the pre-Columbian economic order and its replacement by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens that largely replaced the consumption of game. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour. Sixty per cent of the modern population of Guatemala is estimated to be Maya, concentrated in the central and western highlands. The eastern portion of the country was the object of intense Spanish migration and hispanicization. Guatemalan society is divided into a class system largely based on race, with Maya peasants and artisans at the bottom, the mixed-race ladino salaried workers and bureaucrats forming the middle and lower class and above them the creole elite of pure European ancestry. Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period; a prominent Kaqchikel noble family, they chronicled the history of their region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. SiO 2 {{thin films}} were {{fabricated}} as resistive layers of Cu/SiO 2 /Pt devices to investigate resistive switching properties. A thermal annealing {{was performed to}} allow for the diffusion of Cu ions into the SiO 2 thin films, leading to the formation of Cu-doped SiO 2 layers. Occurrence probabilities of the resistive switching and initial resistance-states of the devices were influenced by SiO 2 thickness, which was dependent on the Cu diffusion status within the SiO 2 layer. The resistive switching behaviors were characterized by <b>the</b> voltage <b>sweeping</b> mode and <b>the</b> current <b>sweeping</b> mode. <b>The</b> current <b>sweeping</b> mode provided a desired compliance current to well control the resistive switching from the high resistance-state to the low resistance-state (SET). Therefore, the large RESET (from the low resistance-state to the high resistance-state) current was not inherent in the device, due to poor control of the compliance current by <b>the</b> voltage <b>sweeping</b> mode. <b>The</b> current <b>sweeping</b> mode is a simple method to characterize the RESET current...|$|R

In turn, many of the intendancy boundaries became Mexican state boundaries after independence.|$|E

25|$|Trollope's {{popularity}} and critical success diminished {{in his later}} years, but he continued to write prolifically, {{and some of his}} later novels have acquired a good reputation.
