5|$|Preserved {{images of}} Szczerbiec from various {{points in time}} {{indicate}} that the decorative plates were several times dismounted and placed again on <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> in variable configurations. The current composition, with the symbols of the Evangelists duplicated {{on each side of}} <b>the</b> <b>hilt,</b> matches that known from the earliest preserved depiction drafted by Johann Christoph Werner in 1794. It is possible, though, that the original placement of the golden plates was different, with the symbols of Saints John and Matthew on the obverse of the grip, so that each side of <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> displayed the symbols of all four of the Evangelists.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{mounting}} that became fashionable around the mid-Heian period is the kenukigata, or hair-tweezer style, {{named for the}} characteristically shaped hilt, which is pierced along the center. In this style, <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> is fitted with an ornamental border and did not contain any wooden covering. Like kazari-tachi, swords with this mounting were used for ceremonial purposes but also in warfare, as an example held at Ise Grand Shrine shows.|$|E
5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided to attach the straps; the scabbard between was covered by a (tube) fitting. <b>The</b> <b>hilt</b> was covered with ray skin and the scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> panabas' <b>hilt,</b> made of {{hardwood}} such as Narra {{and often}} wrapped in braided rattan, {{is perhaps the}} longest among Filipino swords, {{both in terms of}} overall length, and in terms of proportion relative to <b>the</b> blade. <b>The</b> <b>hilts</b> of some specimens are wrapped in metal bands rather than rattan.|$|R
50|$|In Nazi Germany, <b>the</b> <b>hilts</b> of some {{political}} and military daggers (worn by members of SS (pictured), SA, and NSKK formations) were modelled on the Swiss dagger.|$|R
5|$|During the Kamakura and Muromachi period, samurai wore a short sword {{known as}} koshigatana in {{addition}} to the long tachi. Koshigatana were stuck directly into the belt {{in the same way as}} later the katana and uchigatana. They had a mounting without a guard (tsuba). The corresponding style is known as aikuchi ("fitting mouth") as the mouth of the scabbard meets <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> directly without intervening guard.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Heian {{and into}} the Kamakura period, hyōgo-gusari were fashionable {{mountings}} for tachi. Along the edge of both the scabbard and <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> they were decorated with a long ornamental border. They were originally designed for use in battle and worn by high-ranking generals together with armour; but in the Kamakura period they were made due to their gorgeous appearance exclusively for the dedication at temples and Shinto shrines. The corresponding blades from that time are unusable.|$|E
5|$|PC Blakelock {{had been}} {{assigned}} {{on the night of}} his death to Serial 502, a unit of 10 constables and one sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters. When the rioters forced the officers back, Blakelock stumbled and fell. Surrounded by a mob of 30–50 people, he received over 40 injuries inflicted by machetes or similar, and was found with a six-inch-long knife in his neck, buried up to <b>the</b> <b>hilt.</b> He was the first constable to be killed in a riot in Britain since 1833, when PC Robert Culley was stabbed to death in Clerkenwell, London.|$|E
50|$|By the 17th century {{there were}} {{regional}} variations of basket-hilts: <b>the</b> Walloon <b>hilt,</b> <b>the</b> Sinclair <b>hilt,</b> schiavona, mortuary sword, Scottish broadsword, and {{some types of}} eastern European pallasches.The mortuary and claybeg variants were commonly used in the British isles, whether domestically produced or acquired through trade with Italy and Germany. They also influenced the 18th-century cavalry sabre.|$|R

5|$|Believed to {{have been}} {{introduced}} by Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud, although some sources, such as Abdel-Wahab, claim {{that it was in}} use three centuries earlier, the flag was rectangular in shape and divided into nine stripes, the middle one green and double the size of all other bands, while the others alternated between yellow and red. Featured {{in the center of the}} green stripe was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade in white and <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each stripe. These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star voided with a disk of a different color in the center—either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue disk—, and a large disk voided in its lower right by a small disk of different color, with the combination being either a small red disk within a larger blue disk or a small yellow disk within a larger red disk. The first yellow stripe contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second stripe, red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third stripe (second yellow one) is identical to the first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth stripe (second white one) is identical to the second stripe.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the period, {{the outline}} of <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> {{remained}} approximately the same. It was made with two layers of horn, wood or bone sandwiching the tang, each overlaid with a thin metal plate. Often <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> was decorated with inlaid silver. <b>The</b> <b>hilt</b> was 10–12cm long overall and the grip was quite narrow; which produced a very secure grip. An expansion or lump {{in the middle of}} the handle made the user's grip even more secure.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "balisword" [...] is a {{portmanteau}} of {{the words}} [...] "balisong" [...] and [...] "sword". It describes the unique design of both the sword and <b>the</b> <b>hilt(s).</b> Baliswords can reach from traditional 2 feet, to over 6 feet in length.|$|R

Swedes and Geats then rushed forward and killed Wigg.

50|$|Figures of the Bakunawas head {{decorate}} <b>the</b> <b>hilts</b> of many ancient Filipino swords.

25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} {{there is}} no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. <b>The</b> <b>hilt</b> should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the {{fragments}} of round-shaped shields had been attributed to archers, but later <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> of a sword and similarities of the shields geometrical patterns to those of some bronzetti, led to postulate the presence {{of one or more}} statues of warriors.|$|E
25|$|The part of {{the blade}} between the center of {{percussion}} (CoP) {{and the point is}} called the foible (weak) of the blade, and that between the center of balance (CoB) and <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> is the forte (strong). The section in between the CoP and the CoB is the middle.|$|E
25|$|Around 50 AD, a rod tang was introduced, and <b>the</b> <b>hilt</b> was {{no longer}} riveted through the {{shoulders}} of the blade.
