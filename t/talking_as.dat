5|$|Willis had {{his first}} lead role in a feature film in the 1987 Blake Edwards film Blind Date, with Kim Basinger and John Larroquette. Edwards cast him again to play the real-life cowboy actor Tom Mix in Sunset (1988). However, it was his then-unexpected turn in the film Die Hard (1988) as John McClane that catapulted him to movie star and action hero status. He {{performed}} most of his own stunts in the film, and the film grossed $138,708,852 worldwide. Following his success with Die Hard, he had {{a leading role in}} the drama In Country as Vietnam veteran Emmett Smith and also provided the voice for a talking baby in Look Who's <b>Talking,</b> <b>as</b> well as its sequel, Look Who's Talking Too.|$|E
5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} {{deep in a}} forest, but may also be in the clouds, in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the ala with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and feeds the ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and <b>talking</b> <b>as</b> if these things are quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the ala with a chest filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, she does the opposite, and the ala punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an ala for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But when a girl to whom an ala is the godmother visits the ala with her mother, the ala eats them both because the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E

500|$|Charlie Parish, a Hollywood screenwriter {{suffering}} from PTSD, is fronting for his blacklisted best friend, Gil. When Charlie wakes from a blackout {{in the same}} room as a murdered starlet, he and Gil set out to bring her killer to justice. As they follow leads trying to piece together the night leading up to the murder, cooperative witnesses are punished by the studio's fixer. Charlie is prepared to quit when Gil tries to blackmail the head of the studio by anonymously claiming he [...] "knows what happened" [...] with the starlet. Misunderstanding the threat, the studio head tries to destroy evidence that he had sexually abused her when she had been a child actor. Charlie and Gil are able to retrieve a folder of photographs and decide to keep fighting for justice. They plan to kidnap the other studio co-founder, who is now {{suffering from}} Alzheimer's disease and will freely admit to the past sins. They arrive at the co-founder's mansion {{at the same time the}} fixers are murdering him to prevent him from <b>talking.</b> <b>As</b> the two friends are escaping from the fixers, Gil is shot and killed. When Charlie resigns himself to working in the corrupt culture, the fixer reveals the actress was murdered by an undercover FBI agent who was looking for communists in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} onto eight track tape, which allowed various instruments to be overdubbed. Townshend used several guitars in the studio, but made particular {{use of the}} Gibson J-200 acoustic and the Gibson SG. As well as their usual instruments, Townshend played piano and organ and bassist John Entwistle doubled on french horn. Keith Moon used a new double bass drum kit owned by roadie Tony Haslam, after Premier had refused to loan him any more equipment due to continual abuse. Though Townshend wrote {{the majority of the}} material, the arrangements came from the entire band. Singer Roger Daltrey later said that Townshend often came in with a half-finished demo recording, adding [...] "we probably did as much <b>talking</b> <b>as</b> we did recording, sorting out arrangements and things." [...] Townshend asked Entwistle to write two songs ("Cousin Kevin" [...] and [...] "Fiddle About") that covered the darker themes of bullying and abuse. [...] "Tommy's Holiday Camp" [...] was Moon's suggestion of what religious movement Tommy could lead. Moon got the songwriting credit for suggesting the idea, though the music was composed and played by Townshend. [...] A significant amount of material had a lighter style than earlier recordings, with greater prominence put on the vocals. Moon later said, [...] "It was, at the time, very un-Wholike. A lot of the songs were soft. We never played like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{shown how}} to do science without using numbers, Field {{proceeded}} to rehabilitate mathematics {{as a kind of}} useful fiction. He showed that mathematical physics is a conservative extension of his non-mathematical physics (that is, every physical fact provable in mathematical physics is already provable from Field's system), so that mathematics is a reliable process whose physical applications are all true, even though its own statements are false. Thus, when doing mathematics, we can see ourselves as telling a sort of story, <b>talking</b> <b>as</b> if numbers existed. For Field, a statement like [...] is just as fictitious as [...] "Sherlock Holmes lived at 221B Baker Street"—but both are true according to the relevant fictions.|$|E
2500|$|In a later interview, Weymouth {{recalled}} how the group chose the name Talking Heads: [...] "A friend {{had found the}} name in the TV Guide, which explained the term used by TV studios to describe a head-and-shoulder shot of a person <b>talking</b> <b>as</b> 'all content, no action'. It fit." [...] Later that year, the trio recorded a series of demos for CBS, but the band was not signed to the label. They quickly drew a following and were signed to Sire Records in November 1976. The group released their first single in February that year, [...] "Love → Building on Fire". In March 1977, they added Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), formerly of Jonathan Richman's band The Modern Lovers.|$|E
