40|$|The surface {{distributions}} of dissolved silicic acid, chlorophyll and diatom abundance were {{measured in the}} plume of the Mississippi River and adjacent waters during spring (late April and early May 1993) and summer (July 1992). In spring, the time of maximum river flow, there was an intense diatom bloom with a mean diatom abundance of 1. 5 x 10 ** 7 cells/l, more than {{an order of magnitude}} higher than in summer. Mixing curves of silicic acid concentration ([Si(OH) 4]) versus salinity indicate that biological uptake within the river plume removed > 99 % of the Si(OH) 4 supplied by the river in spring and 80 to 95 % in summer. In spring [Si(OH) 4] was occasionally depleted to = 0. 5 µM over the shelf. In summer [Si(OH) 4] was less severely depleted; the lowest measured was 0. 93 µM and all others were >= 2. 4 µM. 30 Si kinetic experiments were performed during both spring and summer to measure {{the degree to which the}} rate of Si uptake by the natural diatom assemblages was limited in situ by substrate availability. In spring the dependence of the specific uptake rate (V) on extracellular [Si(OH) 4] conformed much more closely to the Michaelis-Menten saturation function than has been observed in past studies. Strong dependence of V on [Si(OH) 4] was observed throughout the most Si(OH) 4 -depleted (< 0. 5 µM) region, where V was limited to 12 to 45 % of the diatom assemblages' maximum uptake rate (Vmax). Half-saturation concentrations for Si uptake (Ks) averaged 0. 85 uM (range = 0. 48 to 1. 71; n = 7) in spring, with the lowest values equal to the lowest previously reported for natural diatom assemblages. There was only 1 station in summer where V was limited by [Si(OH) 4], and at that station Ks was 5. 3 µM-quite high in comparison with previous studies. At stations where V was limited by [Si(OH) 4], in both spring and summer, Chaetoceros spp. were numerically dominant; where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>Si</b> limitation other diatoms, usually Skeletonema costatum, dominated. The data thus indicate strong Si limitation in spring, with diatom assemblages well adapted to low [Si(OH) 4], but little or no Si limitation in summer. Historical data suggest that coastal Si(OH) 4 depletion and Si limitation may be recent phenomena in the northern Gulf of Mexico, resulting from increasing [NO 3 -] and decreasing [Si(OH) 4] in the Mississippi River during the past 30 to 50 yr...|$|E

40|$|We report silicon isotopic {{composition}} (d 30 Si vs. NBS 28) in Arctic sea ice, based on sampling of silicic acid from both brine and seawater {{in a small}} Greenlandic bay in March 2010. Our measurements show that just before the productive period, d 30 Si of sea-ice brine similar to d 30 Si of the underlying seawater.

This finding brings credit and support to the conclusions of previous work {{on the impact of}} biogenic processes on sea ice d 30 Si: any d 30 Si change results from a combination of biogenic silica production and dissolution. We use this insight to interpret data from an earlier study of sea-ice d 30 Si in Antarctic pack ice that show a large accumulation of biogenic silica. Based on these data, we estimate a significant contribution of biogenic silica dissolution (D) to production (P), with a D:P ratio between 0. 4 and 0. 9. This finding has significant implications for the understanding and parameterization of the sea ice Sibiogeochemical cycle, i. e. previous studies assumed little or no biogenic silica dissolution in sea ice.

Background: Practice nurses (PNs) differently integrate self-management support into their consultations. As a result, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a lack of insight into the {{provision of}} self-management support to patients with DM 2 in routine primary care. Although it is recommended to collect and record this information, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>SI</b> which can <b>be</b> used for this purpose. Aim: To develop and assess the validity and reliability of a disease-transcending (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and DM 2) SI. This paper exclusively reports on the results obtained for patients with DM 2. Method: This {{study was conducted in}} three phases. In the first phase a literature review was performed. In the second phase the face validity was assessed by nursing researchers. The content validity was assessed by two focus groups (one with patients with COPD, asthma and DM 2 and one with PNs) and one expert panel, using the Content Validity Index (CVI). The inter-rater reliability was assessed in the third phase. Results: The final SI consists of 10 themes and 15 items. The face validity was rated with an 8. 7 (themes) and 7. 7 (items). The focus groups added valuable information about the relevance of the themes and items from the participants’ perspectives. The scale-level CVI was 0. 99. A percent agreement and kappa of 83. 7 and 0. 72 were found for the themes and of 88. 1 and 0. 75 for the items. Conclusion: The SI has excellent validity and good of reliability. Recommendations: The SI can be used in practice and future research to obtain insight into the provision of self-management support to patients with DM 2 in routine primary care...|$|R
30|$|We {{found that}} the image quality yielded by PF with POCS {{was similar to that}} {{obtained}} without PF and that the scan time was reduced by 17  % without a reduction in SNR, and without an increase in artifacts. So we believe that shortening scan time yielded lightening of patient’s burden. In our phantom study <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> difference in <b>SI</b> on the peripheral phantom column on the subtraction images obtained by subtracting the image without PF from the image with PF with POCS. This suggests that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> minimal blurring on the PF with POCS image. In our clinical study, SNR was significantly higher on images acquired with the PF- than the conventional method, possibly because PF increases the effective slice thickness. Although POCS reduced SNR, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> significant difference between the SNR on images obtained using PF with the POCS algorithm and SNR on images acquired with the conventional method, because the increase in SNR by PF compensated for the SNR decrease by POCS. Our results showed that PF with POCS is useful not only with respect to the visualization of vascular structures but also at Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced hepatobiliary-phase hepatic MRI. Although we believe this method is useful for arterial-phase and portal-phase hepatic MRI, further studies need to be conducted to evaluate the usefulness of PF with POCS algorithm in arterial-phase and portal-phase hepatic MRI.|$|R

The following six feeding programs were compared using four replicate pens of IS or 16 poults each: ad libitum intake of conventional corn and soybean diets (Ad), skip 1 day per week (SI), skip 2 days per week (S 2), 95 % of ad libitum (95 %), 90 % of ad libitum (90 %), and 85 % of ad libitum (85 %). At 29 weeks of age, Ad birds were heavier than restricted birds (P<. 05); <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> differences among <b>SI,</b> S 2, and 95 % or between 90 % and 85 % treatments.

40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} value of {{magnetic}} resonance angiography (MRA) {{in the evaluation of}} vascular patency after intravascular endoprosthesis placement. Methods Three different metallic stents (Wallstent, Strecker, Palmaz) were studied in vitro, and in vivo in six patients with spin-echo (SE) and gradient-echo (GRE) MR imaging. Time-of-flight, two-dimensional (2 D) gadolinium-enhanced MRA was performed with GRE and flow-compensation technique, and reconstructed with a maximum-intensity projection (MIP) algorithm. MRA was compared to digital angiograms. Results In vitro studies demonstrated that the signal intensity (SI) within the stent differed according to the device employed, the lowest SI being observed within the Palmaz stent (p =. 001). <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> difference in <b>SI</b> or apparent diameter of the stent according to the sequence (SE vs GRE) or length of echo time (TE). In patients, the endoprostheses recorded as a well-defined area of signal void or drop-out (p = 0. 004), whereas vessels above and below the stent displayed high signal intensities. Conclusion MRA does not seem as yet to be well suited for evaluating vascular patency after endoprosthesis placement, even if the Strecker and Wallstent endoprostheses provide fewer artifacts than the Palmaz stent. © 1995, Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

The {{results indicate that the}} morphology of the primary Mg 2 Si phase apparently changes from coarse dendrites to fine dispersive polygonal particles and the mean size decreases from 276. 6 μm to 7. 1 μm, with combined modification of 0. 8 wt. % Yb and 2. 64 wt. % Na 3 PO 4. Such a morphological evolution results in improvement in the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the alloys as compared to the base alloy. This may be attributed to the formation of the YbP particles that acted as the heterogeneous nucleation substrates for the primary Mg 2 Si particles, resulting in a refined distribution of these precipitates. The results of XRD examination show that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> reaction between <b>Si</b> and Yb or Na 3 PO 4.

40|$|The {{structural}} stability {{of a commercial}} hydrous zirconia and a hydrous zirconia synthesized in our laboratory by the sol-gel method has been improved by a post-synthesis reflux treatment with aqueous NH 4 OH and NaOH solutions (100 degrees C for 9 h). Direct calcination of both materials at 700 degrees C for 3 h, rendered zirconium oxides {{with a mixture of}} monoclinic and tetragonal structures and specific areas of 36 and 27 m(2) /g, respectively. In contrast, if the materials were refluxed before calcination with NaOH or NH 4 OH solutions, zirconium oxides with tetragonal structure and specific areas between 90 and 200 m(2) /g were obtained after calcination at 700 degrees C. In the treatments with NaOH solution, addition of Si coming from dissolution of the flask glass walls or from an external Si source in a plastic flask is responsible for the stability of the final zirconium oxides. Nevertheless, the porous structure of these materials is determined by the treatment conditions in basic solution, thus allowing to control the physical properties of the final oxide. Short treatment times are sufficient to stabilize the hydrous zirconia.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the best predictive radiographic measurement method to identify the presence of osteoporosis and test the inter-observer and intra-observer reliability and validity of these methods in postmenopausal women. Materials and Methods: Ninety-two elderly female patients who presented with hip pain were included. Hip radiographs were used to determine the values of Singh index (SI), canal-to-calcar ratio (CCR), and cortical thickness index (CTI). All measurements were performed by two independent observers on two separate occasions, at least 4 weeks apart. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by DEXA. In the first part of the analysis, reliability of the all measurement methods was tested. In the second part, correlation coefficient (Pearson r) was used to determine the relationship between the measurement methods and BMD. Finally ROC curve analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and threshold values for each radiographic measurement method. Results: Intra-observer reliability analysis of SI revealed kappa coefficient of 0. 359 for observer A, and 0. 224 for observer B. Inter-observer reliability analysis of SI revealed kappa coefficient of 0. 070 for observer A and 0. 051 for observer B.

This study aimed to investigate the use of normal myometrium as an internal reference for endometrial and cervical cancer during multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MCE-MRI) and to explore whether this information regarding tumor enhancement relative to the myometrium could be used to discriminate between endometrial and cervical cancer. MRI images, before and after contrast enhancement, were analyzed in newly diagnosed cervical (n = 18) and endometrial cancer (n = 19) patients. Signal intensities (SIs) from tumor tissue and non-neoplastic myometrium were measured using imaging software. The relative signal for cervical cancer was approximately 30 % higher than that of endometrial cancer after contrast administration. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for SI, relative signal enhancement, and tumor to myometrium contrast ratio (as used to discriminate between cervical cancer and endometrial cancer) was 0. 7807, 0. 7456 and 0. 7895, respectively. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> difference in <b>SI</b> of the normal myometrium between endometrial and cervical cancer patients prior to and after contrast administration.

Some asthma medications (e. g., theophylline and beta- 2 adrenergic agonists) have been shown to provoke feelings of anxiety, fear, and irritability, but their link to SI among asthmatics has not been examined, which was {{the purpose of the present}} study. Methods 664 adult asthma outpatient (39 % male, M age =  49  ±  14. 3) underwent a sociodemographic, psychiatric, and medical history interview. Patients reported asthma medication use, which was verified by chart review. All patients underwent spirometry and completed questionnaires including the beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) which includes an item that assesses SI in the past two weeks. Results 11. 5 % of patients reported having SI in the past two weeks. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, asthma severity, and depressive disorders, analyses indicated that theophylline use was associated with an increased likelihood of SI (OR =  2. 67, 95 % CI =  1. 07 – 6. 65). Sensitivity analyses including asthma control levels and benzodiazepine use as additional covariates did not alter this association (respectively: OR =  2. 54, 95 % CI =  1. 04 – 6. 37; OR =  2. 71, 95 % CI =  1. 09 – 6. 78), though adding cohabitation rendered it no longer statistically significant (OR =  2. 34, 95 % CI =  0. 90 – 6. 09). <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> associations between <b>SI</b> and LABA use. ConclusionsFindings suggest that theophylline but not LABA use may be associated with an increased risk of SI among adult asthmatics independent of depressive disorders, asthma control levels, and asthma severity, but not cohabitation, suggesting that cohabitation may be important for SI in this population.

40|$|A {{sample of}} Sludge Batch 4 (SB 4) was pulled from Tank 40 {{in order to}} obtain {{radionuclide}} inventory analyses necessary for compliance with the Waste Acceptance Product Specifications (WAPS). This sample was also analyzed for elemental and chemical composition including noble metals. These analyses along with the WAPS analyses will help define the composition of the sludge currently in Tank 40 which is currently being fed to DWPF and will become part of Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5). At SRNL the 3 -L Tank 40 SB 4 sample was transferred from the shipping container into a 4 -L vessel and solids allowed to settle overnight. Supernate was then siphoned off and circulated through the shipping container to complete the transfer of the sample. Following thorough mixing of the 3 -L sample, a 280 g sub-sample was removed. This sub-sample was then utilized for all subsequent analytical samples. Eight separate aliquots of the slurry were digested, four with HNO{sub 3 }/HCl in sealed Teflon{reg_sign} vessels and four in Na{sub 2 }O{sub 2 } using Zr crucibles. Due to the use of Zr crucibles and Na in the peroxide fusions, Na and Zr cannot be determined from this preparation. Three glass standards were digested along with a blank for each preparation. Each aqua regia digestion and blank was diluted and submitted to Analytical Development (AD) for inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis, and cold vapor atomic absorption (CV-AA) analysis. Equivalent dilutions of the peroxide fusion digestions and blank were submitted to AD for ICP-AES analysis. Tank 40 SB 4 supernate was collected from a mixed slurry sample in the SRNL Shielded Cells and submitted to AD for ICP-AES and ICP-MS. Weighted dilutions of slurry were submitted for ion chromatography (IC), total inorganic carbon/total organic carbon (TIC/TOC), and total base analyses. A sample of Tank 40 SB 4 decant was collected by carefully removing the supernate phase from a settled sample. This decant was not filtered prior to performing a warm nitric acid digestion of the material in order to measure the Si content by ICP-AES. Three Si standards, a blank, and a matrix standard were prepared and submitted along with the Tank 40 samples.

Time from first complaints to first consideration of PTB was determined as suspicion interval (SI) and from first consideration to diagnosis as recognition interval (RI). Presumptive diagnosis was defined as positive staining for acid-fast bacilli or presence of granulomatous lesions in pulmonary specimens. In the elderly and in the younger patients, the mean SI was 111. 1 and 87. 8 days respectively (P=NS), and the mean RI was 5. 9 and 8. 3 days, respectively (P=NS). The mean RI was longer in uncharacteristic than in characteristic radiographic findings in both elderly (8. 2 and 4. 6 days; P= 0. 007) and younger patients (10. 6 and 3. 9 days; P= 0. 0001). A diagnosis was obtained in 89 / 113 elderly (79 %) and in 109 / 138 younger (79 %) patients (P=NS) and also in 59 / 80 (73 %) patients with uncharacteristic findings and in 139 / 170 (82 %) patients with characteristic findings (P=NS). In the latter, sputum contributed for 66 % of diagnosis, whereas it was only 31 % in patients with uncharacteristic findings (P< 0. 005). In elderly patients with uncharacteristic radiographic findings, diagnosis was obtained from sputum in 41 % and from other specimens in 35 % (P=NS); in the younger group diagnosis was obtained from sputum in 23 % and from other specimens in 48 % (P< 0. 05).

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} long-term treatment antihypertensive with the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine on insulin sensitivity, plasma insulin, and lipoprotein metabolism in obese hypertensive patients. We measured the insulin sensitivity index (SI), determined by the Minimal Model Method of Bergman, fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations, serum total triglyceride and lipoprotein cholesterol fractions, and blood pressure in 20 obese, non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension before and after 6 weeks of placebo and again after 6 months of amlodipine. Ten patients [mean body mass index (BMI) 30. 2 kg·m− 2] had been on prior treatment with a thiazide diuretic in low dosage and/or a β-adrenoceptor blocker (group A), and 10 matched patients [BMI 31. 8 kg·m− 2] had been previously untreated (group B). Amlodipine was started in a dose of 5 mg and was increased to 10 mg once daily in 14 patients who were hypertensive after 8 weeks on the lower dosage. At entry (before placebo), SI was slightly but not significantly lower in group A than B [2. 7 vs. 3. 6 × 10 − 4 ml·μU− 4 ·min− 1]; fasting plasma insulin was 13. 6 vs. 12. 9 μU·ml− 1. After 6 weeks on placebo, SI averaged 3. 7 in group A and 4. 4 × 10 − 4 μU·ml− 1 ·min− 1 in group B; fasting plasma insulin was 14. 6 vs. 15. 1 μU·ml− 1, and glucose 5. 5 vs. 5. 5 mmol·l− 1.

40|$|Bariatric {{surgery is}} an effective, rapid, and durable {{treatment}} for obesity and {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM). Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) resolves T 2 DM in 80 % of cases, while gastric banding (LAGB) resolves T 2 DM in only 45 %. One significant difference between RYGB and LAGB is the bypassing of the proximal small intestine in RYGB. Inadequate insulin secretion and insulin resistance are well known contributors to T 2 DM and both improve following RYGB. To determine if RYGB produces greater improvements in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity than LAGB in T 2 DM, we studied obese, T 2 DM, Caucasian women who underwent RYGB (N= 9) or LAGB (N= 3). Insulin secretion (AIRg) and insulin sensitivity (Si) were measured pre- and 1 -wk post-surgery by Minimal Model analysis following an insulin modified intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Post-surgery analysis at 1 -wk eliminates the potential contribution of differences in weight loss or food consumption as these are rigorously controlled for 1 wk following these surgical procedures. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> a trend (p = 0. 053) {{for an increase in}} Si from pre-surgery to 1 -wk post-surgery, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> difference in <b>Si</b> between surgical groups (RYGB, Pre: 0. 85 ± 0. 15 and 1 -wk: 2. 30 ± 0. 43) and (LAGB, Pre: 1. 32 ± 0. 26 and 1 -wk: 1. 67 ± 0. 60). <b>There</b> <b>was</b> a trend for an Interaction (p = 0. 056) in AIRg with an increase in RYGB (Pre: 42. 0 ± 23. 3 and 1 -wk: 94. 7 ± 52. 6), but decrease among LAGB (Pre: 519. 7 ± 392. 9 and 1 -wk: 391. 8 ± 291. 6) with surgery. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> also a trend (p = 0. 067) for a greater AIRg in LAGB compared to RYGB regardless of surgery status. These results in obese, T 2 DM, Caucasian women suggest that insulin sensitivity may be increased similarly in RYGB and LAGB questioning the role of the proximal small intestine bypass in the reversal of insulin sensitivity following bariatric surgery. In contrast, improvements in insulin secretion may be greater in RYGB than LAGB. Additional gastric banding patients are required to provide adequate power for statistical analysis.   M. S...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} whether a moderate supplementation of long-chain n- 3 fatty acids {{is able to}} modulate insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, beta-cell function and glucose tolerance in healthy individuals consuming a diet rich in either saturated or monounsaturated fat, also {{in relation to their}} habitual dietary intake of n- 6 and n- 3 fatty acid. Methods and results: One hundred and sixty-two healthy individuals were randomly assigned to follow either one of two isoenergetic diets for 3 months, one rich in monounsaturated fats and the other rich in saturated fats. Within each group <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a second randomisation to fish oil (n- 3 fatty acids 3. 6 g/day) or placebo. At the beginning {{and at the end of}} the treatment periods insulin sensitivity (SI), first phase insulin response (FPIR) and glucose tolerance (K-G-value) were evaluated by the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Fish oil did not have any effect on SI, FPIR, K-G-value and disposition index in either diet. Even after dividing subjects according to the median value of n- 6 /n- 3 ratio of serum phospholipids at baseline, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> change in <b>SI</b> (Delta SI 0. 42 +/- 0. 34 on fish oil vs 0. 14 +/- 0. 23 on placebo for those with n- 6 /n- 3 4. 85) (M +/- SE), FPIR (Delta FPIR 135. 9 +/- 78. 9 vs 157. 2 +/- 157. 5 pmol/L; 38. 8 +/- 181. 7 vs 357. 1 +/- 181. 7 pmol/L), K-G-value (Delta K-G 0. 14 +/- 0. 15 vs 0. 12 +/- 0. 11; - 0. 32 +/- 0. 16 vs 0. 15 +/- 0. 15) or disposition index (Delta disposition index 1465. 4 +/- 830. 4 vs 953. 8 +/- 690. 0; - 1641. 6 +/- 1034. 3 vs 446. 6 +/- 905. 1). Considering the 75 th percentile of n- 6 /n- 3 ratio (5. 82) the results on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and disposition index were confirmed, while, in this more extreme situation, n- 3 fatty acid supplementation induced a significant deterioration of KG-value (p = 0. 02). Conclusions: in healthy individuals a moderate supplementation of fish oil does not affect insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, beta-cell function or glucose tolerance. The same is true even when the habitual dietary intake of n- 6 and n- 3 fatty acids is taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the genetic basis of selectivity in invasion of the red blood cells by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Multiple invasions of a single host red blood cell by more than one merozoite, which can be described or assessed in terms of the selectivity index (SI), has been reported to be related to the severity of malaria disease. In this study, selectivity index, defined as the ratio of the number of multiply-infected red cells observed to that expected from random invasion, as modelled by a Poisson distribution was determined for certain clones of P. falciparum. SI was measured under static and shaking culturing conditions for P. falciparum clones 3 D 7 and HB 3 and 18 progeny clones derived from a genetic cross between these two parasite clones. P. falciparum clone 3 D 7 was found to have a significantly lower SI than HB 3 under both static and shaking culture conditions. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> relationship between <b>SI</b> and days in continuous culture for clone 3 D 7 under shaking and static conditions; the phenotype therefore appears to be stable over time. The genetic basis of the difference in selectivity index between P. falciparum clones 3 D 7 and HB 3 was investigated in progeny clones from a cross between these two clones, to ascertain the inheritance pattern of the phenotype. Under static conditions, ten progeny clones had a selectivity index lower than either parent, one progeny clone had higher selectivity index than both parent, and six progeny clones had selectivity index intermediate between the parents. Under shaking conditions, fifteen progeny clones were observed to have a selectivity index lower than either parent. These observations suggest the involvement of more than one parasite gene in selectivity index. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis was performed in order to identify genomic regions influencing SI in the progeny clones. The highest LOD score of 5. 06 was obtained for a QTL on chromosome 13 for SI measured in parasites cultured under shaking conditions. This QTL denoted, PF_SI_ 1, extends for approximately 100 kb on chromosome 13 and contains 19 open reading frames. This finding indicates the presence of a gene or genes on chromosome 13 that influence the parasite’s selection of erythrocytes for invasion...|$|R
