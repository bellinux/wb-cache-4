50|$|Modern {{automatic}} throwing machines {{can store}} hundreds of clay targets in a carousel and systematically self-load targets onto the throwing mechanism. Manual electric target throwers require {{a person in}} the traphouse with the <b>trap</b> <b>machine,</b> to set the target(s) by hand onto the machine arm. For both of these types, an electrical signal, from the push of a button or a sound activated device, causes the <b>trap</b> <b>machine</b> to throw its targets after the shooter calls for their bird(s).|$|E

5000|$|Although Compak Sporting is an {{international}} shooting game with defined rules, many other variations of Compact Sporting games have been devised. For a limited shooting area, Compact Sporting can provide a selection of various targets all shot from one [...] "station". Sometimes called [...] "Lazy man's Sporting Clays", a Compact Sporting layout can give {{a wide variety of}} target presentations without having to walk around a sporting clays course. Another feature of Compact Sporting is that the game can be played from under cover in poor weather conditions. Compak Sporting requires a minimum of 6 clay pigeon <b>trap</b> <b>machines,</b> but {{it is not unusual for}} Compact Sporting games to use up to 15 <b>trap</b> <b>machines.</b> With the correct design, a covered Compact Sporting deck or platform can be used to host Compak Sporting regulated shooting competitions.|$|R
5000|$|Trap {{shooting}} {{requires the}} use of a target throwing device(s). American Trap and DTL utilize a single <b>trap</b> <b>machine</b> which is typically enclosed within a traphouse, downrange from the shooters' shooting positions. The house provides protection of the machine (e.g. from weather and errant shots) and also acts to obscure the machine's oscillating throwing position. International or Olympic trap employs 15 trap machines housed within a large elongated traphouse which is recessed into the ground to form a [...] "bunker" [...] and/or resemble a trench. International or Olympic Trap may at times be referred to as Bunker Trap.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} {{standard}} trap is Wobble or Wobble trap. The main difference {{is a more}} variable target flight path than in standard trap shooting because the <b>trap</b> <b>machine</b> oscillates {{up and down as}} well as side to side. Shooters are allowed two shots per pull, and shooters at stations 1 and 5 stand at the 18 yard (16.5 m) mark while positions 2-4 stand at the 17 yard (15.5 m) mark. Although this version of trap is not sanctioned by the ATA, many shooters consider it to be both more challenging and engaging as well as a more realistic preparation for bird hunting.|$|E
50|$|Down-The-Line (DTL) {{is a form}} of trap {{popular in}} Great Britain, Australia, and South Africa. The <b>trap</b> <b>machine</b> oscillates left to right within a 45 degree arc and each {{competitor}} shoots in turn, then moves station after having attempted 5 targets from each station in each round of 25 targets. Two shots are permitted at each target, but second shots incur a points penalty. 3 points are awarded for each first-barrel hit, 2 points for a second-barrel hit, and 0 for a miss. A perfect score in a 100-target competition is written as 100/300. The points score, rather than the number of targets hit, determines the winner and is used to determine classifications (AA, A, B and C class).|$|E

5000|$|American Trap {{is broken}} down into three categories: singles, doubles, handicap. The targets are thrown by a machine located at {{approximately}} ground level and covered by a [...] "trap house." [...] For singles and doubles, there are five [...] "stations", each 16 yards (15.6 m) behind the trap house. In singles, each competitor shoots at five targets from each station. The <b>trap</b> <b>machine</b> oscillates left to right within a 54 degree arc (up to 27 degrees right and left of center), {{and at least a}} 34 degree arc (up to 17 degrees right and left of center)., and the competitor does not know where in that arc the target will emerge. In doubles, the machine does not oscillate, but throws two targets simultaneously with each competitor shooting at five (5) pairs (10 targets) from each station. In the handicap events, the machine operates the same as in singles, but the shooters stand farther away from the trap house.|$|E
5000|$|In 1880 [...] "Clay" [...] birds (disks) {{were invented}} {{by a man}} named Fred Kimble, but George Ligowsky takes {{the credit for the}} invention. [...] The Ligowsky target was used widely in the early trapshooting community, as a {{replacement}} for the glass ball targets. The downside of the Ligowsky targets were that they were too hard to break when hit. Fred Kimble made a more breakable target, unlike the Ligowsky target, which was made of hard baked clay, the Kimble target was made of coal-tar, pitch and other ingredients to make it more breakable. There were many different types of target throwers or also known as a “trap,” like one made by Bogardus, which was made to throw glass targets. This trap was able to throw the targets from 28 to 35 yards. It was operated by a person behind the shooter, who pulled a string and released an elastic spring resulting in the target to be launched. The first automatic <b>trap</b> <b>machine</b> (to launch clay targets) was used in 1909. Following the invention of the automatic trap machines, doubles trap was introduced. It was a big success in the competition community. In the 1912 Olympics, Jay Graham became the first American to win the gold medal in doubles trap.|$|E
40|$|Day by day, {{more and}} more people are using {{internet}} all over the world. It is becoming apart of everyone’s life. People are checking their e-mails, surfing over internet, purchasinggoods, playing online games, paying bills on the internet etc. However, while performingall these things, how many people know about security? Do they know the risk of beingattacked, infecting by malicious software? Even some of the malicious software arespreading over network to create more threats by users. How many users are aware of thattheir computer may be used as zombie computers to target other victim systems? Astechnology is growing rapidly, newer attacks are appearing. Security is a key point to getover all these problems. In this thesis, we will make a real life scenario, using honeypots. Honeypot is a well designed system that attracts hackers into it. By luring the hackerinto the system, it is possible to monitor the processes that are started and running on thesystem by hacker. In other words, honeypot is a <b>trap</b> <b>machine</b> which looks like a realsystem in order to attract the attacker. The aim of the honeypot is analyzing, understanding,watching and tracking hacker’s behaviours in order to create more secure systems. Honeypot is great way to improve network security administrators’ knowledge and learnhow to get information from a victim system using forensic tools. Honeypot is also veryuseful for future threats to keep track of new technology attacks. ...|$|E
50|$|The target area, a 40 x 25 meter rectangle, {{should be}} marked with four flags {{defining}} the four corners. Clay targets are thrown by clay pigeon <b>trap</b> <b>machines,</b> {{of which there}} must be a minimum of 6. Targets may be thrown from either inside or outside the area, and may land inside or outside it, but every target thrown must pass over at least one side of the target area. Shooters take turns shooting the various targets - these can be single targets or double targets (instant pair or report pair). Targets are released on a random time delay (0 - 3 seconds) after the shooter's call. There are numerous rules defining compulsory targets, traps, triggering systems, shooting stands, targets, trajectory-setting-tables, guns, ammunition etc.|$|R

40|$|In this work, 22 -pole {{ion trap}} {{machines}} {{have been applied}} to investigate protonated water clusters H+(H 2 O) n (n= 4 [...] 10) and ionic hydrocarbons CHn+ (n= 2 [...] 5) at low temperatures. Protonated water clusters H+(H 2 O) n {{play an important role}} in atmospheric chemistry and in interstellar space. The Taipei 22 -pole ion <b>trap</b> <b>machine</b> has been applied to kinetic and spectroscopic investigations of these clusters produced from a supersonic expansion in a corona discharge source. Using low-pressure He buffer gas for collisional thermalization, refrigeration of the ion trap by liquid nitrogen allows a good control of the cluster temperature over the range 80 K- 350 K. This method provides an accurate means of determining the dissociation energies of the cluster ions by measuring their dissociation rates as a function of temperature and calculating their internal energies from vibrational frequencies provided by density functional theory. Results of the thermochemical measurements at well-defined cluster temperatures have been given for H+(H 2 O) n, n= 4 [...] 10. The feasibility of using the ion trap to acquire temperature-dependent infrared spectra is presented. The deuteration and abstraction reactions of small ionic hydrocarbons CHn+ (n= 2 [...] 5) with H 2, HD and D 2 and the subsequent association processes have been explored at temperatures down to 15 K in the Chemnitz 22 -pole apparatus. The reactions of the investigated ionic species and their isotopic variants are important for understanding ion-molecule processes in the interstellar medium. One of the starting points of the research program was the question whether protonated methane, CH 5 +, is subject to H-D-exchange in collisions with HD at low temperatures. It turns out that the rate coefficient for this deuteration process is very small, whereas CH 3 + deuterates with HD by three subsequent fast exchange reactions to CD 3 + at a temperature of 15 K. The latter process is very efficient and happens close to the collision limit. The methane cation, CH 4 +, on the other hand, shows also some interesting features in collisions with H 2, HD and D 2. It exhibits an inverse temperature dependence with the rate coefficient increasing at least one order of magnitude going from 300 K to 15 K. Furthermore, reacting with HD at the temperature of 15 K, the reaction channel leading to CH 5 + is preferred over the D-atom abstraction channel (isotope effect). Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurden zwei Apparaturen mit 22 -Pol-Ionenfallen benutzt, um protonierte Wassercluster H+(H 2 O) n (n= 4 [...] 10) und kleine ionische Kohlenwasserstoffe CHn+ (n= 2 [...] 5) bei tiefen Temperaturen zu untersuchen. Die in einer Koronaentladungsquelle erzeugten Cluster H+(H 2 O) n wurden kinetisch und spektroskopisch untersucht. Dazu wurden sie in einem 22 -Pol-Speicher mithilfe eines He-Puffergases auf einer Temperatur zwischen 80 K und 350 K thermalisiert. Die Bestimmung der Bindungsenergien fuer Cluster der Groesse n= 4 [...] 10 wird ermoeglicht durch die Messung der temperaturabhaengigen Dissoziationsraten und durch die Ermittlung der inneren Energien mittels berechneter Schwingungsfrequenzen. Temperaturabhaengige IR-Spektren im Bereich der freien OH-Streckschwingung wurden aufgenommen. Die Austausch- und Abstreifreaktionen von ionischen Kohlenwasserstoffen CHn+ (n= 2 [...] 5) mit H 2, HD und D 2 und die darauffolgenden Assoziationsprozesse wurden im Temperaturbereich 15 K bis 300 K untersucht. Es stellt sich z. B. heraus, dass der H-D-Austauschprozess zwischen CH 5 + und HD bei 15 K sehr langsam ist, wogegen CH 3 + mit jeder Kollision einen Austausch ausfuehrt. In der Abstreifreaktion von CH 4 + mit Wasserstoffmolekuelen beobachtet man eine inverse Temperaturabhaengigkeit. Dies wird vorlaeufig mit einer laengeren Komplexlebensdauer bei tiefen Temperaturen erklaert...|$|E

40|$|Two gas-phase ion-molecule {{reaction}} {{systems are}} presented here based on measurements {{done in a}} temperature variable 22 -pole <b>trapping</b> <b>machine.</b> In the ﬁrst case, the proton afﬁnity of methane is determined based on a new technique for measuring the equilibrium constant of the HCO 2 + + CH 4 CH 5 + + CO 2 reaction. The second case reports to the (Ar + N 2) + reaction system, with reaction rate temperature dependencies measurements made both in the forward and reverse direction with different and complementary methods. The temperature variable 22 -pole <b>trapping</b> <b>machine</b> allows one to determine equilibrium constants and reaction rate coefﬁcients {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. The coupling of an effusive beam to the setup overcomes the problem of neutral gas wall condensation and extends the temperature range measurements beyond condensation point. The introduction (Chapter 1) gives a short overview about the rf technology and parallel experimental techniques developed in order to better characterize and understand the several mechanisms related to ion-molecule reactions. It also focuses some aspects of reaction rate temperature dependencies determination as well as thermodynamical equilibrium in laboratory environment. A short description of the setup and experimental methods are presented in Chapter 2. Based on equilibrium constant measurements, Chapter 3 is dedicated to the proton afﬁnity of methane. This concept has applications on several ﬁelds such as atmospheric and combustion modelling, or testing empirical and ab initio theories for electronic structures. The (Ar − N 2) + system presented in Chapter 4, is known for being a good case study for inferring the role of vibrational excitation in reaction dynamics and to the existence of non-adiabatic coupling. The experimental results here presented for the N 2 + + Ar reaction demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} avoid parallel reactions with ﬁrst vibrational excited state of nitrogen (N 2 (ν = 1)). On the other hand, the reverse reaction experiments conﬁrm the existence of a minimum of the reaction rate in the 30 to 300 K range, due to the existence of two reaction channels. The question of the high rate coefﬁcient towards lower temperatures being related to the N 2 rotational ground state population is raised. A summary and outlook are presented in Chapter 5, where some new possible paths of investigation are pointed out...|$|R

50|$|A typical course {{consists}} of 10 to 15 stations, with each station presenting targets from <b>trap</b> <b>machines.</b> Usually 6 to 10 targets are shot at each station by {{a squad of}} up to six shooters for a total outing of 50 to 100 targets per person. Targets are thrown in pairs. A pair of targets may be thrown as a true pair (or sim pair, i.e., thrown at the same time), as a following pair (thrown sequentially), or on report (the second clay launched on the firing of the shooter’s gun). Numerous hunting conditions can be simulated by combining various speeds and angles with different types of clay targets. Each station is unique. Throughout a course, the shooters might see targets crossing from either side, coming inward, going outward, flying straight up, rolling on the ground, arcing high in the air, or thrown from towers. The possible target presentations are limited only by safety considerations, the terrain, and {{the imagination of the}} course designer. The configuration of the stations is often changed to maintain interest for the shooters and for environmental preservation of the course.|$|R
