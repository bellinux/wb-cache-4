5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach <b>to</b> <b>problem</b> solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
5|$|First-person {{shooters}} may be structurally {{composed of}} levels, {{or use the}} technique of a continuous narrative in which the game never leaves the first-person perspective. Others feature large sandbox environments, which are not divided into levels and can be explored freely. In first-person shooters, protagonists interact with the environment to varying degrees, from basics such as using doors, <b>to</b> <b>problem</b> solving puzzles based {{on a variety of}} interactive objects. In some games, the player can damage the environment, also to varying degrees: one common device is the use of barrels containing explosive material which the player can shoot, destroying them and harming nearby enemies. Other games feature environments which are extensively destructible, allowing for additional visual effects. The game world will often make use of science fiction, historic (particularly World War II) or modern military themes, with such antagonists as aliens, monsters, terrorists and soldiers of various types. Games feature multiple difficulty settings; in harder modes, enemies are tougher, more aggressive and do more damage, and power-ups are limited. In easier modes, the player can succeed through reaction times alone; on more difficult settings, it is often necessary to memorize the levels through trial and error.|$|E

25|$|The {{strategic}} problem {{therefore is}} how {{to ensure that the}} appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response â€“ for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response <b>to</b> <b>problem</b> networks, in the light of values perceived {{in various parts of the}} social system.|$|E
25|$|For an {{organization}} {{to be focused}} on a democratic leadership style, traits, functions and relationships have to be obtained. Before you can classify someone to leadership position, certain qualities have to follow. The common assumptions of leaders are: leaders are born; however, this is not the case. Leaders are developed through different types of training and experience. Through the training and experience, the leader gains different traits to help make the organization functional. Leaders need to be interpersonal, cognitive, and motivational. An interpersonal leader allows for relationships to be built and to communicate messages to their followers. Cognitive leaders are able <b>to</b> <b>problem</b> solve more effective because of their intellectual ability to process information and come up with creative ideas to help eliminate the problem in the organization. Finally, having motivational leaders gets the organization excited about new tasks and this allows for positive productions to occur. Motivation has been associated with ratings of leadership potential, career achievement, and promotion. The three traits will help a leader become successful because others will look up to them, and create a positive organization to work in.|$|E

500|$|Various {{forms of}} group therapy or {{psychotherapy}} {{can be used}} to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide relapse prevention skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach {{is one of the most}} common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety. Alcoholics Anonymous was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest. Others include LifeRing Secular Recovery, SMART Recovery, Women For Sobriety, and Secular Organizations for Sobriety. Rationing and moderation programs such as Moderation Management and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 US study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking. This group, however, showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency. A follow-up study, using the same subjects that were judged to be in remission in 2001â€“2002, examined the rates of return <b>to</b> <b>problem</b> drinking in 2004â€“2005. The study found abstinence from alcohol was the most stable form of remission for recovering alcoholics.

The essay described how he had cured his criminal sexual behaviors and how that information {{could be used to}} assist in curing other sexual predators by: [...] "controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts." [...] On the same day, he went to a University of California, Berkeley police office with Dugard's two daughters, seeking permission to hold a special event on campus as a part of his [...] "God's Desire" [...] program.

[...] She asked him to make an appointment for the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. Officer Ally Jacobs discovered, through a background check, that Garrido was a registered sex offender on federal parole for kidnapping and rape. When he and the girls returned for their appointment at 2:00p.m. the following day, August 25, Jacobs made a point of sitting in during the meeting. The girls appeared to Jacobs to be pale, as if having not been exposed to sunlight, and their behavior unusual. Since Garrido's several parole violations were a basis for an arrest, Jacobs phoned the parole office to relay her concerns, leaving a report of the meeting on voicemail.|$|E

2500|$|Problem solving, {{according}} to prominent cognitive psychologists, {{is fundamental to}} learning. It resides as an important research topic in educational psychology. A student is thought to interpret a problem by assigning it to a schema retrieved from long-term memory. A problem students run into while reading is called [...] "activation." [...] This is when the student's representations of the text are present during working memory. This causes the student to read through the material without absorbing the information {{and being able to}} retain it. When working memory is absent from the readers representations of the working memory they experience something called [...] "deactivation." [...] When deactivation occurs, the student has an understanding of the material and is able to retain information. If deactivation occurs during the first reading, the reader does not need to undergo deactivation in the second reading. The reader will only need to reread to get a [...] "gist" [...] of the text to spark their memory. When the problem is assigned to the wrong schema, the student's attention is subsequently directed away from features of the problem that are inconsistent with the assigned schema. The critical step of finding a mapping between the problem and a pre-existing schema is often cited as supporting the centrality of analogical thinking <b>to</b> <b>problem</b> solving.|$|E
2500|$|Malevolent {{creativity}} (MC) {{focuses on}} the [...] "darker side" [...] of creativity. This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and {{is defined by the}} intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal. Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response <b>to</b> <b>problem</b> solving. [...] The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC. Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individualâ€™s expression of malevolent creativity.|$|E
