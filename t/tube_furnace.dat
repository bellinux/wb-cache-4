2500|$|Jason Wallach of Vice {{magazine}} commended {{the accuracy}} of the cooking methods presented in the series. In early episodes, a once common clandestine route, the Nagai red phosphorus/iodine method, is depicted, which uses pseudoephedrine as a precursor to d-(+)-methamphetamine. By the season 1 finale, Walt chooses to use a different synthetic route based on the difficulty of acquiring enough pseudoephedrine to produce on the larger scale required. The new method Walt chooses is a reductive amination reaction, relying on phenyl-2-propanone and methylamine. On the show, the phenyl-2-propanone (otherwise known as phenylacetone or P2P) is produced from phenylacetic acid and acetic acid using a <b>tube</b> <b>furnace</b> and thorium dioxide (ThO2) as a catalyst, as mentioned in episodes [...] "A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal" [...] and [...] "Más". P2P and methylamine form an imine intermediate; reduction of this P2P-methylamine imine intermediate is performed using mercury aluminium amalgam, as shown in several episodes including [...] "Hazard Pay".|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to use {{numerical}} analysis and fine element method-FEM to investigate the influence of <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> shape on the thermal strain of fire-tube boilers. Thermal stresses in corrugated <b>furnace</b> <b>tubes</b> of different shape, i. e. with different corrugation pitch and depth, were analysed first. It was demonstrated that the thermal stresses in corrugated <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> are significantly reduced with the increase of corrugation depth. Than deformations and stresses in the structure of a fire-tube boiler were analysed in a real operating condition, for the cases of installed plain <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> and corrugated <b>furnace</b> <b>tubes</b> with different shapes. It was concluded that in this fire-tube boiler, which is of larger steam capacity, the corrugated <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> must be installed, as well as that the maximal stress in the construction is reduced by the installation of the <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> with greater corrugation depth. The analysis of stresses due to pressure and thermal loads pointed out that thermal stresses are not lower-order stresses in comparison to stresses due to pressure loads, so they must be taken into consideration for boiler strength analysis.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the technical progress achieved {{during the first}} quarter of the ERIP project entitled, ``Laser Ultrasonic <b>Furnace</b> <b>Tube</b> Coke Monitor. `` The focus of work during this reporting period was the testing of a novel device for introducing a broad bandwidth ultrasonic pulse at the surface of a simulated <b>furnace</b> <b>tube.</b> The device employs a sacrificial stand-off composed of a fusible alloy that conforms to hot <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> surface upon contact. Conventional high-temperature couplants have a maximum operating temperature of about 550 {degrees}C, which limits their use for contact against ethylene cracker <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> surfaces that typically operate at about 1000 {degrees}C. In the absence of a couplant, insufficient ultrasonic energy can be transmitted from the transducer to the tube surface. By using a fusible alloy, the device efficiently couples the transducer to the hot <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> surface, even for rough and convex tube surfaces operating at temperatures of 1800 {degrees}F and above.

30|$|In {{this paper}} an {{external}} surface temperature measurement system for ethylene cracking <b>furnace</b> <b>tubes</b> was proposed. The system realizes both a dual-phase drive synchronization method and temperature processing algorithm. The dual-phase drive synchronization method enables the thermodetector to automatically measure tube temperatures in batches {{and measure the}} temperature of a single tube from multiple points and angles, thereby providing numerous data points for more accurate analysis and calculation of temperatures. Furthermore, the temperature processing algorithm allows the thermodetector to differentiate between temperatures of the <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> and <b>furnace</b> wall, filter out abnormal temperatures, select high-quality temperatures, and determine the final result. Comparing the results to actual temperature measurements of an ethylene cracking <b>furnace</b> <b>tube,</b> {{the effectiveness of the}} automatic temperature measurement system and measurement method was demonstrated. Moreover, measurements were shown to be more accurate and stable than traditional manual method, thus reducing costs and human resources. Moreover, successfully applying this system will provide a basis for tube temperature measurements in other petrochemical industry applications.|$|R

40|$|A ceramic {{cylinder}} {{has been}} developed as an accessory to a standard DuPont 951 Thermogravimetric Analyzer to study weight changes of solid samples in corrosive atmospheres. This device has two purposes to be fulfilled at higher temperatures (G 9 OOOC) and higher gas flow rates (G 14 cm s-l) : (1) preventing mixing of reactant and purge gases {{at the location of}} the sample; and (2) keeping the corrosive reactant gas from the balance sections. EXPERIMENTAL For corrosive atmospheres such as nitrogen mixtures with sulphur dioxide etc., the instruction manual of the DuPont 951 Thermogravimetric Analyzer [l] advises the installation of a gas inlet <b>tube</b> on the <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> between the <b>furnace</b> and the balance housing. A stopcock is sealed to the, Pyrex bell jar to purge the back end of the balance assembly. The normal gas inlet, located on the balance housing, is also flushed with the inert gas. The reactive gas is admitted through the side arm of the <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> so that it will flow to the sample along with the purge gas. The main disadvantage of this system is that the purge gas mixes with the reactant gas around the sample making it difficult to establish a constant and reproducible concentration of the latter. To avoid this, we worked with a different modification. This does not require a complicated double <b>furnace</b> <b>tube,</b> as described by Ruth et al. [2] and Ulerich et al. [3].
