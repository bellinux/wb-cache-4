500|$|The Empress {{remained}} strong-willed {{even after}} years of marriage. Pedro II revealed in a letter written to the Countess of Barral in early 1881 that: [...] "The [...] with the earrings which you mentioned, has been the cause for much recrimination {{on the part of}} someone [...] who thinks that I have been to blame for their disappearance." [...] Her son-in-law, Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, wrote a letter recounting how she had accidentally broken her arm in October 1885: [...] "On Monday 26 when crossing the library on the way to dinner with the emperor who as usual preceded her by a few steps (and with whom, I infer from what she <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>she</b> was arguing as she sometimes does), she caught her foot in a file under a table and fell down flat face forward." [...] Nonetheless, she continued to express undiminished love for her husband.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was with}} her when she died. She left this world {{literally}} screaming {{at the top of her}} lungs. I {{was with her}} constantly, she lived not even 3 miles from my house, we were together practically every day. She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [...] she was very funny. We didn't have to [...] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks.|$|E
2500|$|In her 2014 [...] "Selp Helf" [...] tour, she {{instructed}} her (mostly young, female) {{audience on}} how to get a boyfriend by being more Miranda-like. [...] "To break up the horrendous musical numbers, Miranda incorporated a series of segments that took the four daily concepts of porn, bullies, love and 'haters' and transformed the subject matter into ... comical banter that relied heavily on audience participation ... she worked off everything the volunteers said and did, improvising and creating punchlines on the spot. ... Ballinger, the genius behind Miranda, is so convincing in the role, you ... will likely forget that there is a normal person behind the red lips". Miranda's more risque stage business is performed [...] "in a way that will have parents laughing and children oblivious." [...] "There was some great physical comedy. Miranda's alternative to twerking has to be seen to be believed and her recreation of her own birth ... was a hoot. As she <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>she</b> was always famous, it's just that everyone else knows it now." [...] "But [...] is deeper than it initially appears. ... She is funny and a strong role model, with a healthy disdain for pop’s oversexualisation. .... The satire is not exactly mindblowing but the message is undeniably positive. Plenty of interaction keeps everyone interested and lends proceedings an inclusive feel ... when there was an appeal for volunteers almost every hand shot straight into the air." ...|$|E
6000|$|Our eyes met. Where was Alfred Inglethorp? His absence {{was strange}} and inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp's dying words. What lay beneath them? What more could <b>she</b> have <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> if <b>she</b> had had time? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know. I {{told you}} that None-so-pretty <b>told</b> <b>us</b> to. <b>She</b> did it after she saw that when we were bathing.' Tommy raised one of his little loose breeks that did not cover the knee.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might have}} <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> Mary," [...] <b>she</b> exclaimed, reproachfully. [...] "We should so much {{have liked to}} come, shouldn't we, Louise?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of September 15, CBS aired a segment that {{featured}} an interview with Marian Carr Knox, a secretary at Ellington Air Force Base from 1956–1979, and who was Killian's assistant on the dates shown in the documents. Dan Rather prefaced the segment on the recorded interview by stating [...] "She <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> believes what the documents actually say is, exactly, as we reported." [...] In the aired interview, Knox expressed her belief that the documents reflected Killian's [...] "sentiments" [...] about Bush's service, and that this belief motivated her decision {{to reach out to}} CBS to provide the interview. In response to a direct question from Rather about the authenticity of the memo on Bush's alleged insubordination, she stated that no such memo was ever written; she further emphasized that she would have known if such a memo existed, as she had sole responsibility to type Killian's memos in that time period. At this point, she also admitted she had no firsthand knowledge of Bush's time in the Guard. However, controversially, Knox said later in the interview, [...] "The information in here was correct, but it was picked up from the real ones." [...] She went on to say, [...] "I probably typed the information and somebody picked up the information some way or another." [...] The New York Times headline report on this interview, including the phrase [...] "Fake but Accurate," [...] created an immediate backlash from critics of CBS's broadcast. The conservative-leaning Weekly Standard proceeded to predict the end of CBS's news division.|$|E

6000|$|... "Like himself, of course. Tall, raw-boned, square-shouldered, red-haired (you know he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> was red-haired), square-jawed, Roman-nosed--a Macnab female {{could be}} nothing else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been your mother who warned you," [...] Annie said gravely. [...] "She <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>she</b> dreamt you were in some terrible danger, though she could not {{remember}} what it was, and she tried with all her might to warn you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "A {{woman who}} works at night <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>she</b> knew what {{happened}} to Marita. <b>She</b> gave <b>us</b> details of {{where she had been}} held captive, and that she was abducted for sexual exploitation in La Rioja. I could not believe these things existed," [...] Trimarco said.|$|R
6000|$|... "And the proofs of heresy are patent, {{beside the}} strong {{suspicion}} of enchantment, and the known {{character of the}} elder sorceress. You yourself, you must remember, senor, <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>she</b> had been a notorious witch in England, before the senora brought her hither as her attendant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will meet}} her soon. The {{sunshine}} <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> was near, {{and we are}} hurrying to be up and dressed to welcome her back," [...] answered a blue-eyed violet, dancing on her stem for joy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then she's a lying, {{deceitful}} hussy, and she's made {{a fool of}} all of us. I {{give you}} my word of honour that she <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> was married; I'll fetch you the letter.' Mrs Griffith rose from her chair, but Miss Reed put {{out a hand to}} stop her.|$|E
6000|$|... "What has happened, Nina?" [...] {{he exclaimed}} anxiously. [...] "I {{have had a}} great fright. We have been {{following}} a small party of the enemy who escaped us from Estrella, and just now a woman returning from {{work in the fields}} <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> had seen five strange soldiers ride up here and enter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{certainly}} {{your hopes}} will be frustrated, Mr. Eames. But undoubtedly when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>she</b> {{was going to}} take Dobbs Broughton, we were a little disappointed. Maria Clutterbuck had been used to a better kind of life. You understand what I mean, Mr. Eames?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's all stuff," [...] decidedly cried Adelaide. [...] "When Papa <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about you, <b>she</b> said, 'Poor child! I wish I had her here.'" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Poor Sophy!' said Lucy. 'Never mind her, mamma, {{but she is}} odder than ever, since {{baby has}} been born. When Eweretta came up and <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>she</b> hid her face and cried; and when grandmamma wanted to make us promise to love him with all our hearts, and not make any difference, she would only say, [...] "I wont!"' ...|$|E
60|$|The Cagliarese <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> came {{now from}} Naples, {{and her husband}} was {{following}} in a few days. He was doing business in Naples. I nearly {{asked if he was}} a little dog-fish--this being the Italian for profiteer, but refrained in time. So the two ladies retired to lie down, I went and sat under my tarpaulin.|$|E
6000|$|Ten {{minutes later}} Lady Agnes {{substituted}} a general, vague assent for all further particular ones, drawing off from Mrs. Rooth {{and from the}} rest of the company with her daughters. Peter had had very little talk with Biddy, but the girl kept her disappointment out of her pretty eyes and said to him: [...] "You <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> didn't know how--but she does!" [...] There was no suggestion of disappointment in this.|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} that there was a second door covered with a curtain. Hardly had the Baron {{vanished}} when there ran from behind it a woman, young and beautiful. So swiftly and noiselessly did she move that <b>she</b> was between <b>us</b> in an instant, and it was only the shaking curtains which <b>told</b> <b>us</b> whence <b>she</b> had come.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Curtis went on, [...] "this thing isn't {{quite so}} {{simple as it}} seems. To begin with, it's my idea that Miss Jernyngham hasn't <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>she</b> knows; you want to {{remember}} that Prescott's a good-looking fellow with a taking manner. I can see complications, though I can't get the right drift of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{wife has}} taken a fancy to Mrs. Fletcher," [...] he said. [...] "We just call her Minnie because there's no {{particular}} reason to handicap her with her husband's name. She's a mighty smart honest woman, {{and we knew that}} story about you was a lie from the beginning--did our best to keep it from her, but I think she knew. We were startled some when she lit out with the sleigh, but she came back half-dead, and we asked no questions until <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>us.</b> <b>She's</b> been sick and fretful since, but I guess there's nothing you can do. When we can't keep a sick woman who has done good work for us a while we'll give up the business. She'll be pert again directly." ...|$|R
60|$|Uncle Alec {{and aunts}} left on Monday morning. Poor Aunt Janet {{was full of}} dismal forebodings, and gave us so many charges and {{warnings}} {{that we did not}} try to remember any of them; Uncle Alec merely told us to be good and mind what Uncle Roger said. Aunt Olivia laughed at us out of her pansy-blue eyes, and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> knew exactly what we felt like and hoped we'd have a gorgeous time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Great-aunt Eliza? Nonsense," [...] said Aunt Janet. [...] "Aunt Eliza {{was in town}} today. She had {{tea with}} us at Aunt Louisa's. But wasn't Mrs. Governor Lesley here? We met her {{on her way back}} to Charlottetown and she <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> was. She said she was visiting a friend in Carlisle and thought she'd call to see father for old {{acquaintance}} sake. What in the world are all you children staring like that for? Your eyes are like saucers." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{day before}} she was to leave she <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> would not {{go out in the}} afternoon; so I {{determined}} to stroll down the river to Iffley by myself in a [...] "tub dingey"--a small boat with room in it for two, if occasion demands. When I reached the Iffley Lock, imagine my horror at seeing Ida {{in the middle of the}} stream, quietly engaged in paddling herself down the river in a canoe. I ran my dingey close beside her, drove her remorselessly against the bank, and handed her out on to the meadow, before she could imagine what I was driving at.|$|E
6000|$|... “‘I wished {{then that}} we had {{explained}} {{about the loss of}} the genuine secrets of a Master-Mason at the first go-off; but I said nothing. All that night there was a blowing of horns in a little dark temple half-way down the hill, and I heard a girl crying fit to die. One of the priests <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>she</b> was being prepared to marry the King.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure she}} is {{something}} not right!" [...] they cried, one and all. [...] "She <b>told</b> <b>us</b> such things! <b>She</b> {{knows all about}} us!" [...] and they sank breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he commented, [...] "in {{that case}} I guess it's quite a pity we didn't, but I begin to {{understand}} the thing. This is the young lady who <b>told</b> <b>us</b> the trail. <b>She</b> must have taken a shorter way." ...|$|R
60|$|We both ran up, {{and there}} we saw the lady laid on the sofa, with her face ghastly white, and her hands fast clenched, and her head drawn down to one side. She had been taken with a sudden fright, my {{mistress}} said, and master he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> was {{in a fit of}} convulsions. I ran out, knowing the neighbourhood a little better than the rest of them, to fetch the nearest doctor's help. The nearest help was at Goodricke's and Garth's, who worked together as partners, and had a good name and connection, as I have heard, all round St. John's Wood. Mr. Goodricke was in, and he came back with me directly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bessie Grainger. She had a {{devil in}} her, too, in those days, {{but she always}} kept her head, and I didn't." [...] He smiled. [...] "I'm willing to admit that I was {{madly in love with}} her, and she treated me outrageously. We were {{standing}} on the bridge--I remember it as though it were yesterday--and the water was about eight feet deep, with a clear sand bottom. She took off a gold bracelet and bet me I wouldn't get it if she threw it in. That night, {{right in the middle of}} dinner, when there was a pause in the conversation, she <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> was engaged to Cecil Grainger. It turned out, by the way, to have been his bracelet I rescued. I could have wrung his neck, and I didn't speak to her for a month." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{though we}} thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and {{sticking}} too fast for us to expect her getting off, {{we were in a}} dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our stern, just before the storm; but she was first staved by dashing against the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke away, and either sunk or was driven off to sea; so there was no hope from her. We had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing; however, there was no room to debate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>she</b> was actually broken already.|$|E

60|$|Our little dinner-party {{went off}} very pleasantly; and I felt quite {{relieved}} {{to find that}} when we were helped, the servants left the room; and Ada then <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>she</b> had suffered {{so much as a}} girl from the stony presence behind her mother's chair, that she had always determined, if she were {{at the head of a}} house of her own, never to have a servant in the room one moment longer than necessary.|$|R
