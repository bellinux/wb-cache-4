25|$|Ushikawa {{focuses on}} Tengo, Aomame, and the Dowager as {{suspects}} in his investigation. Since the Dowager's house is guarded well and since Aomame has disappeared without a trace, Ushikawa decides <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> Tengo's apartment {{to see if}} he can find any information related to Aomame. He rents out a room in Tengo's apartment building and sets up a camera to take pictures of the residents. He witnesses Fuka-Eri, who has been hiding out at Tengo's apartment, coming and going from the building. Fuka-Eri seems to realize Ushikawa's presence, as she leaves a note for Tengo and takes off. Ushikawa later sees Tengo return home after a visit to see his dying father. Finally, Ushikawa spots Aomame leaving the building after she herself followed Ushikawa there in order to find Tengo.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographic}} Broken Hill, {{for which}} the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch) formed the Broken Hill Company <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at {{the eve of the}} Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.|$|E
500|$|The less {{fortunate}} or less well funded prospectors rapidly found themselves destitute. Some chose {{to sell their}} equipment and return south. Others took jobs as manual workers, either in mines or in Dawson; the typical daily pay of $15 ($410) was high by external standards, but low compared {{to the cost of}} living in the Klondike. The possibility that a new creek might suddenly produce gold, however, continued to tempt poorer prospectors. Smaller stampedes around the Klondike continued throughout the gold rush, when rumours [...] of new strikes would cause a small mob to descend on fresh sites, hoping to be able <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> a high value claim.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike croquet, both balls must be <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> in {{the same}} turn in order to {{outright}} win the game. By necessity, this requires the first ball <b>to</b> be <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> on a roquet shot and the second ball <b>to</b> be <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> on the ensuing continuation shot. Thus, unlike croquet, one side cannot defensively [...] "stake-out" [...] an opponent's rover in roque.|$|R

In the preamble I turn <b>to</b> <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> basic terms. I am going to clarify the key conception connected with personal data, with their protection and the scope and standing of The office for personal data protection. The second part treats the scope of banking, public health, employment and municipal activity and touches the conflict of personal data protection and their monitoring. I will take several points of view of The office for personal data protection into parts for better comprehension...|$|R

Carrie, after losing her camera feeds, has resorted <b>to</b> <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> Brody's house; she follows him to the meeting. She walks into the meeting and pretends to bump into him. Brody recognizes her from the CIA debriefing. Carrie acts embarrassed and says she's not supposed to be there. She leaves, but Brody follows her outside. The two have a brief, flirtatious conversation. They form a connection over their mutual wartime experience in the Middle East, and lament {{how hard it is to}} talk about with people who weren't there.|$|R
500|$|Gender was a {{recurring}} theme in Rix Nicholas's career, for better and for worse. Praise from a French art critic for her abilities was expressed by saying [...] " [...] Rix paints like a man!". An Australian critic was unsure what to say, admiring her composition but declaring her technique [...] "strangely unfeminine". Pigot considered that, when Rix Nicholas sought <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> a woman's place in nationalist art in mid-twentieth century Australia, her career was ultimately penalised by her unwillingness {{to play by the}} male establishment's rules. Art historian Catherine Speck had a different perspective on Rix Nicholas's post-World War I work, suggesting that it never subsequently attained the quality of her Paris output, because her first husband's death in the Great War drove her to create nationalist images of inconsistent quality. In their reference work A Story of Australian Painting, Mary Eagle and John Jones considered Rix Nicholas, alongside Clarice Beckett, to be [...] "the best woman artist to emerge from the artistic milieu of Melbourne in the decade of the First World War".|$|E
500|$|Sil first {{tries to}} mate with a man she meets at a nightclub (Anthony Guidera), but after sensing that he is diabetic, she rejects him. Unsatisfied, he [...] tries to rape her, {{prompting}} her to kill him by puncturing his skull with her tongue. She then tries {{to mate with}} John Carey (Whip Hubley), a man she meets after a car accident. They swim in Carey's pool where Sil forces him to open his swimming trunks in order to mate, but he refuses. This act is interrupted by Preston and Laura. She kills Carey, morphing into her alien form, a bipedal mutant with tentacles on her shoulders and back, and flees naked into a forest without being seen by the team. She pretends to be a rape victim to kidnap a woman (Marliese K. Schneider) in order to assume her identity. Sitting in the car near Carey's home, she reads Fitch's lips, as she had done earlier, learning of their plan <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> the Nightclub for her return. There, she is seen by Dan, prompting a car chase. She fakes her death by crashing the car, which she has previously filled with gasoline containers, into a high-voltage transformer, using the kidnapped woman as a stand-in for her own body.|$|E
500|$|As Giuliani mulled {{over his}} medical options, on May 1 Hanover {{announced}} that she was postponing her appearance in The Vagina Monologues due to [...] "personal family circumstances." [...] On May 2 the New York Daily News published a brief item about Giuliani's other woman, without name or description. [...] On May 3 the New York Post finally published its photographs of Giuliani and the woman, now identified as Judith Nathan, leaving a restaurant together, under the front page headline [...] "Rudy's Mystery Brunch Pal is Upper East Side Divorcée". [...] (Some observers felt that Giuliani, known {{for his ability to}} manipulate the New York media, had been eager for news of the relationship to come out.) [...] Later that day, Giuliani responded to a barrage of questions on the subject at a news conference by acknowledging Judith Nathan publicly for the first time, calling her [...] "a very good friend" [...] and expressing his annoyance that her privacy was being invaded. [...] The next days were filled with New York media coverage on Nathan's background and on the relationship. [...] On May 6 Hanover held an unusually-located news conference at the back of St. Patrick's Cathedral before the funeral of Cardinal John O'Connor; visibly trembling, she said, [...] "I will be supportive of Rudy in his fight against his illness, as this marriage and this man have been very precious to me." [...] The following day half the press tried <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> Nathan's known locations while the rest pestered Nathan's hometown relatives in Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Giuliani looked weak in a public appearance.|$|E

2500|$|In 1891, F.C.S. Schiller {{made his}} first {{contribution}} to philosophy anonymously. Schiller feared that in his time of high naturalism, the metaphysical speculations of his Riddles of the Sphinx were likely to hurt his professional prospects (p. xi, Riddles). However, Schiller's fear of reprisal from his anti-metaphysical colleagues should not suggest that Schiller {{was a friend of}} metaphysics.

2500|$|In 1798, John Carlysle Stewart, a civil engineer, {{traveled}} to western Pennsylvania to resurvey the [...] "donation lands," [...] {{which had been}} reserved for veterans of the Revolutionary War. He discovered that the original survey had neglected <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> approximately [...] at {{the confluence of the}} Shenango River and the Neshannock Creek, at that time a part of Allegheny County. Claiming the land for himself, he laid out what was to become the town of New Castle. Stewart laid out the town of New Castle in April 1798. It comprised approximately that same , in what was then part of Allegheny County.|$|E
2500|$|Nehru {{had led the}} Congress to a {{major victory}} in the 1957 elections, but his {{government}} was facing rising problems and criticism. Disillusioned by alleged intra-party corruption and bickering, Nehru contemplated resigning but continued to serve. The election of his daughter Indira as Congress President in 1959 aroused criticism for alleged nepotism, although actually Nehru had disapproved of her election, partly because he considered it smacked of [...] "dynasticism"; he said, indeed it was [...] "wholly undemocratic and an undesirable thing", and refused her a position in his cabinet. Indira herself was at loggerheads with her father over policy; most notably, she used his oft-stated personal deference to the Congress Working Committee to push through the dismissal of the Communist Party of India government {{in the state of}} Kerala, over his own objections. Nehru began to be frequently embarrassed by her ruthlessness and disregard for parliamentary tradition, and was [...] "hurt" [...] by what he saw as an assertiveness with no purpose other than <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> an identity independent of her father.|$|E
50|$|As {{people began}} {{to move into the}} Black Hills, several cabins sprang up around Yellow Creek in the Black Hills. In 1894, the town began <b>to</b> be <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> but was not yet fully founded; when the area boomed around May 1896, a series of large {{buildings}} and small cabins, including a two-story boarding house, were built. Flatiron was first advertised on a billboard as Flat Iron City. Freshwater springs were located nearby, and a well was dug. Eventually, it became known as Yellow Creek, and then again as Flatiron.|$|R

2500|$|Two months later, {{criticism}} of the perp walk resumed when Strauss-Kahn's bail terms were reduced from house arrest to his own recognizance after the office of Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. found the housekeeper had been dishonest with them about other aspects of her story than the attack. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had earlier defended the perp walk, criticized it as [...] "outrageous". City Councilman David G. Greenfield introduced legislation that would ban perp walks. [...] "I honestly believe it's unconstitutional," [...] he said. [...] "If we banned it here we could {{send a message to}} the country." [...] Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the media was to blame, not his department. [...] "If they make a decision <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> a location when someone is walked out of the front of a precinct ... it's not a decision that the Police Department makes", he said. [...] "We have been walking prisoners out of the front doors of stationhouses for 150 years in the Police Department ... This is how we transport people to court ... I don't think the genie's ever gonna be put back inside the bottle. That's the way it is." [...] The legislation was seen as unlikely to pass.|$|E

A halt was made at the former camping-place in the grove of trees, and the next morning Pete and the miners went up with Harry and his friends to choose a spot for the fort, and to examine the lode. As soon as the earth was scraped away from the spot from which the rock had been taken, exclamations of astonishment broke from the miners. They had been told by Pete that Harry had struck it rich, but all were astonished at the numerous particles and flakes of gold that protruded from the rock. Pete had forwarded early in the spring to Harry the list of the claimants to the mine, and the latter and Tom had ridden over to Salt Lake City a few days before the waggons came up from there to register the claims at the mining-office, and the first step was <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> these claims upon the lode.|$|E
50|$|The title Fideicommissum {{refers to}} the former legal {{institution}} of the entail, under which estates and other family properties were passed down {{from one generation to}} the next, often benefitting the eldest son. In Sweden, a law abolishing entailed estates was implemented in 1964. The first edition of Fideicommissum was placed in the Wanås Sculpture Park, which is situated at Wanås Castle in Skåne. Sidén's sculpture is located on the shore of a pond, with a view of the castle, which was entailed until 1978. The title Fideicommissum and the placement of the sculpture emphasize that the work refers <b>to</b> a <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> of territory.|$|R

50|$|A stakeout is the coordinated {{surveillance}} of a location or person. Stakeouts are generally performed covertly {{and for the}} purpose of gathering evidence related to criminal activity.

60|$|Of {{the surplus}} capital goods {{accumulated}} by Europe {{a substantial part}} was exported abroad, where its investment made possible {{the development of the}} new resources of food, materials, and transport, {{and at the same time}} enabled the Old World <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> a claim in the natural wealth and virgin potentialities of the New. This last factor came to be of the vastest importance. The Old World employed with an immense prudence the annual tribute it was thus entitled to draw. The benefit of cheap and abundant supplies resulting from the new developments which its surplus capital had made possible, was, it is true, enjoyed and not postponed. But the greater part of the money interest accruing on these foreign investments was reinvested and allowed to accumulate, as a reserve (it was then hoped) against the less happy day when the industrial labor of Europe could no longer purchase on such easy terms the produce of other continents, and when the due balance would be threatened between its historical civilizations and the multiplying races of other climates and environments. Thus the whole of the European races tended to benefit alike from the development of new resources whether they pursued their culture at home or adventured it abroad.|$|E

Ronald Dworkin has argued that skepticism about these claims so understood is not tenable because it is impossible to step outside such practices. I show that externally skeptical metaethical theory can withstand his attacks, thereby defending the possibility of this kind of metatheoretical method and showing that the additional objectivity claims still make sense as external claims. Four interpretations of the additional objectivity claims can still be understood externally: as secondary properties, as arguing for some form of causal correspondence, as explaining error, and under Blackburn’s expressivism.
