5|$|In the {{campaign}} mode, {{the objective of}} each level is the acquisition of the Portal Gem, usually {{in the possession of}} the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is sometimes in the possession of a rival keeper. Whoever has the Portal Gem must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races against the clock to obtain the Portal Gem in the possession of a rival keeper before the heroes invade and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same. If the heroes recover the Portal Gem, the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and Skirmish. In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed to the next level on completion. Skirmish involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to Skirmish. A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.|$|E

25|$|Charlie and Itchy live in San Francisco as {{guardian}} angels. In each episode, {{they are}} given an assignment by Anabelle but, while they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> right thing, they become {{caught up in the}} middle of awkward situations. Charlie’s callous enemy Carface and his sidekick, Killer (from the first film), also appeared in the series, as did Charlie’s friends: the dog Sasha, the dog-angel Anabelle, and the human kid David. Finally, the series also featured two new characters named Bess, a pure bred award winning show dog and Itchy's love interest, and Belladonna, Anabelle's demonic cousin. The series makes several changes to the second film. For example, Charlie and Sasha were shown as being a couple at the end of the second film, however, in the series, they seem to have never had a first date together; also, Itchy decides to stay in Heaven, but he is alive in the series, although it is explained later in the series why he is on Earth instead of being in Heaven.|$|E

25|$|Females {{have their}} first {{ovulation}} at 13–14 {{months of age}} and have 20- to 26-day intervals between estrous cycles until they are fertilized. Males from traditional territories and leks have different courtship strategies. Males of traditional territories will herd females and keep them in their territories. Lek males <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same, but usually fail. They {{have to rely on}} advertising themselves. Kob courtship may last as short as two minutes, and copulation may only last a few seconds. At leks, a female may mate up to 20 times with {{at least one of the}} central males in a day. After an eight-month gestation period and giving birth, estrus may commence 21–64 days later. For their first month, calves hide in dense vegetation. Mother and calf can identify each other by their noses. As they get older, calves gather into crèches. When they are three to four months old, the young enter the females' herds and stay with mothers until six to seven months, by which time they are weaned. When they mature, males join bachelors groups.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} {{incursion}} of Tarik, who reached Toledo in 711, the Yemeni viceroy of Ifriqiya, Musa bin Nusayr, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar {{the following year}} and carried out a massive operation of conquest {{that would lead to}} the capture of Mérida, Toledo, Zaragoza and Lerida, among other cities. During the last phase of his military campaign, he reached the northwest of the Peninsula, where he gained control of the localities of Lugo and Gijón. In the latter city he placed a small Berber detachment under a governor, Munuza, whose mission was to consolidate Muslim control over Asturias. As guarantee of the submission of the region, some nobles – some argue that Pelayo was among them, had to surrender hostages from Asturias to Cordoba. The legend says that his sister was asked for, and a marriage alliance sought with the local Berber leader. Later on, Munuza would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same at another mountain post in the Pyrenees, where he rebelled against his Cordoban Arab superiors. The Berbers had been converted to Islam barely a generation earlier, and were considered second rank to Arabs and Syrians.|$|E

Naughty Dog's Jak & Daxter series and the Ratchet & Clank series are in similar genres; each game in both series' has been released at a similar time and both contain references to each other. Ryan Schneider, an employee of Insomniac, said, [...] "The analogy that I like to use is that at Insomniac we {{like to look at}} it as how Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant act {{when it comes to their}} professions.

Hondurans {{did not know what}} was going on. They clearly acted to create an information vacuum to keep people unaware of what was actually happening." [...] However, in an interview published on 9 July 2009 in the Washington Post, Ramón Custodio López, Honduras's human rights ombudsman, said he had received no official complaints from journalists: [...] "This is the first I have heard about an occupation or military raid of a station," [...] he said.

[...] With no good passer or runner and a lack of depth, Reserve's Red Cats performed poorly in Scarry's first season, but he was praised for making the most out of a thin squad. In his second year in 1949, the Red Cats improved to a 4–5–1 record, and Scarry was expected to stay on for a third season. The following year, however, he resigned to take an assistant coaching position at Santa Clara University in California under former Browns assistant Dick Gallagher.|$|E

2500|$|Although Paul {{supports}} {{the right of}} state and local school districts, under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, to implement education voucher plans, he rejects federal government-controlled school voucher plans, preferring federal education tax credits instead. He regards federal voucher programs as a form of [...] "taxpayer-funded welfare" [...] in which money is taken from middle-class families to unfairly provide private-school educations to a particular group of children favored by politicians and bureaucrats. He also worries that with federal school vouchers inevitably come further central government regulation and loss of local control over education. Private, religious schools, for instance, would feel pressured to conform to government dictates in order to become accredited by the Department of Education to qualify for participation in the voucher program. He points to how the federal government has used the threat of cutting off funding to dictate to universities which policies they must accept; he argues that the government would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same with private schools.|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Di Grassi was delighted with his victory, calling it [...] "the best day in my Formula E career" [...] and reserved praise for his team after they used much of their energy to understand their lack of competitiveness at the preceding New York City races. He felt the secret was to remain calm and exercise what the driver could do to motivate the people he/she is surrounded by for the season's remaining races, [...] "Formula E can go from heaven to hell in one lap or one decision or one problem. Today we did the job. Tomorrow is a completely different day, a completely different environment. We’re going to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same as we did here.” Vergne spoke of his happiness over his team's growing strength and their double podium finish. He said he was hit from both sides at the race's start, causing him to lose positions, but spoke highly of his car, [...] " [...] I thought the car was just perfect {{and was able to}} push really hard. I was catching everyone in front, using less energy than them, so I think the strategy was really nice.” Third-place finisher Sarrazin stated that he was down on pace and became aware of Buemi closing on him by glancing at his rear-view mirrors. However, he was aware Buemi was challenging for the championship.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reducing}} Buemi's lead by 22 {{points in}} the preceding New York City ePrix, di Grassi stated that his team had to improve vastly in gaining any hope of winning the championship in Montreal and was feeling more confident that he previously been: [...] "With the experience that I have with Formula E, {{you know that it}} can go from hell to heaven any weekend, any race. We just have to do our best, try and win both races and see how it goes." [...] Buemi, the pre-title favourite, missed the New York City races because of a World Endurance Championship commitment at the Nürburgring, but stated he would prepare for the Montreal events the same way as he would with any other ePrix: [...] "We will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> best possible. I hope we can finish this season in style and look forward to it." [...] He created controversy when he raised the issue of his crash with di Grassi at the 2016 London ePrix, saying: [...] "If [...] happens once more like this, what do you think people will think then? It will be very hard to explain for him. He can’t afford anything like that again for his reputation, can he?" [...] Di Grassi responded by noting Buemi lost the first season championship through a driver error and said Buemi had more pressure and another mistake would prevent him from reclaiming the championship: [...] "Everyone feels pressure in a different way of course. He has pressure big time this weekend, much more than me, this is because everyone will be waiting to see if those mistakes come again in Montreal." ...|$|E
