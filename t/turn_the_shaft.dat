50|$|The Twind Technology concept uses {{a pair of}} captive {{balloons}} at {{an altitude}} of 800 meters. The tether cables transmit force to a rotating platform on the ground. Each balloon has a sail connected to it. The two balloons move alternately, the balloon with the sail open moves downwind and draws the other balloon upwind, and then the motion reverses. The tether cable can be used to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> of a generator to produce electrical energy or perform other works (grinding, sawing, pumping).|$|E
50|$|On {{the outside}} of the upper hatch of the escape trunk is often a shaft {{connected}} to the wheel that operates the locking mechanism. The crew of the DSRV can attach a wheel to the shaft and <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> to unlock the hatch, thus providing access to the interior of the submarine. This is a risky operation, as when a submarine has been damaged enough to sink it is possible there was an ingress of water into the pressure hull raising the internal pressure above the normal 1 bar.|$|E
50|$|The field {{windings}} in the stator of an induction motor {{set up a}} rotating magnetic field through the rotor. The relative motion between this field and the rotor induces electric current in the conductive bars. In turn these currents lengthwise in the conductors react with the magnetic field of the motor to produce force acting at a tangent orthogonal to the rotor, resulting in torque to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> In effect the rotor is carried around with the magnetic field but at a slightly slower rate of rotation. The difference in speed is called slip and increases with load.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1650, Otto von Guericke built a crude {{electrostatic}} generator: a sulphur {{ball that}} rotated on a shaft. When Guericke {{held his hand}} against <b>the</b> ball and <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> quickly, a static electric charge built up. This experiment inspired the development of several forms of [...] "friction machines", that greatly helped {{in the study of}} electricity.|$|R

40|$|Case StudyThe {{purpose of}} this case study is to present an {{investigation}} of substantial damage to the rotor of a large centrifugal propane refrigeration compressor that is installed in an 800 MTPA Ethylene plant. After ten years of normal operation since its commissioning, the compressor was shut down during the plant?s scheduled turnaround to carry out peripheral inspection. As {{the speed of the}} compressor?steam turbine train was reduced; an abnormal sound was heard by the field operators. Instead of looking for the possible cause(s), the shutdown sequence was completed. Even twenty four hours after shutdown, the compressor?s casing remained unusually hot. This was a cause of concern. After deliberations, the train was isolated and released for external inspection. On decoupling the compressor, it was noticed that its rotor could not be moved axially and many attempts to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> to verify if there was binding proved to be unsuccessful. This case study outlines the sequence of events, the details of inspection, and the root cause analysis of the failure. It concludes with an understanding of thermal rub phenomenon and the primary causes which resulted in rotor-to-stator scuffing...|$|E
60|$|What I {{claim as}} my invention, {{and desire to}} secure by letters patent, is the {{combination}} of expansible buoyant chambers placed {{at the sides of}} a vessel with <b>the</b> main <b>shaft</b> or shafts by means of the sliding spars, which pass down through the buoyant chambers and are made fast to their bottoms and the series of ropes and pulleys or their equivalents in such a manner that by <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> main <b>shaft</b> or shafts in one direction the buoyant chambers will be forced downward into the water, {{and at the same time}} expanded and filled with air for buoying up the vessel by the displacement of water, and by <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> in an opposite direction the buoyant chambers will be contracted into a small space and secured against injury.|$|R
50|$|A simple type of {{anemometer}} {{was invented}} in 1845 by Dr. John Thomas Romney Robinson, of Armagh Observatory. It consisted of four hemispherical cups mounted on horizontal arms, which were mounted on a vertical <b>shaft.</b> <b>The</b> air flow past the cups in any horizontal direction <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> {{at a rate that}} was proportional to the wind speed. Therefore, counting <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> of <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> over a set time period produced a value proportional to the average wind speed {{for a wide range of}} speeds. On an anemometer with four cups, it is easy to see that since the cups are arranged symmetrically on the end of the arms, the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented to it and is blowing on the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross.|$|R
50|$|A {{camera with}} {{combined}} two-fixed focus panoramic camera in one mahogany-wooded box. The lenses were eight centimeters apart {{from each other}} with an indicator in between the lens to help the photographer set the camera level. A clock motor transported the nine-centimeter-wide film along with <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> that rotated <b>the</b> camera. The camera could make a 9 Ã— 80 cm pair that required a special viewer. These images were mostly used for mapping purposes.|$|R
50|$|A turbine {{is a set}} of blades {{that are}} forced to turn from an {{external}} force. When <b>the</b> blades start <b>turning,</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> which this is connected to starts to spin, and the connecting generator then creates electricity. Examples of external forces {{that can be used to}} get the turbines going include wind, water, steam and gas. Turbines can be used in creating a continual power system because as long as <b>the</b> turbine blades <b>turn,</b> electricity is being created.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{example is a}} screw. In most screws, {{applying}} torque to <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> can cause it to <b>turn,</b> moving <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> linearly to do work against a load, but no amount of axial load force against <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> will cause it to turn backwards.|$|R
5000|$|In the Granite Mountain/Speculator Mine {{disaster}} of June 8, 1917, {{an electric cable}} was being lowered into the Granite Mountain mine {{as part of a}} fire safety system. At this time, the Butte, Montana copper mines were at full wartime production. When the cable fell and was damaged, a foreman (approximately 2,500 feet below the surface) with a carbide lamp went to inspect the damage, and the oil-soaked cloth insulation on the cable was ignited by the flame from his lamp. The fire quickly climbed the cable, and then <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> into a chimney, igniting the timbers in <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Commander Earl Trosino (Guadalcanals chief engineer), {{joined the}} salvage party. He {{disconnected}} U-505s diesels from her electric driving motors, while leaving these motors clutched to <b>the</b> propeller <b>shafts.</b> With <b>the</b> U-boat moving under tow by Guadalcanal, the propellers [...] "windmilled" [...] {{as they passed}} through <b>the</b> water, <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> and <b>the</b> drive motors. This caused the motors to act as electrical generators charging U-505s batteries. With power from the batteries, U-505s pumps cleared out the water let in by the attempted scuttling, and her air compressors blew out the ballast tanks, bringing her up to full surface trim.|$|R
50|$|When {{current is}} removed from the clutch, the {{armature}} is free to <b>turn</b> with <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> In most designs, springs hold the armature away from the rotor surface when power is released, creating a small air gap.|$|R
50|$|When {{electricity}} {{is removed from}} the brake, the armature is free to <b>turn</b> with <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> Springs keep <b>the</b> friction disk and armature away from each other. There is no contact between braking surfaces and minimal drag.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{powering}} a cooling unit. The method including applying electromagnetic (EM) radiation to a complex, where the complex absorbs the EM radiation to generate heat, transforming, using the heat {{generated by the}} complex, a fluid to vapor, and sending the vapor from the vessel to a turbine coupled to a generator by a <b>shaft,</b> where <b>the</b> vapor causes the turbine to rotate, which <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> and causes <b>the</b> generator to generate the electric power, wherein the electric powers supplements the power needed to power the cooling unit...|$|R

2500|$|To use, {{one hand}} {{is placed on}} the hole board while <b>the</b> other <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> to wind <b>the</b> cord around its length, thus raising the hole board to near the top where the cord becomes taut. [...] Placing the tip against the {{material}} to be drilled and held upright, a smooth downward pressure is exerted on the board, causing the drill to rapidly spin. Once the bottom is reached, the weight is relieved and the drill allowed to rebound re-winding the cord around <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> and <b>the</b> process is repeated. It is a skill simple in concept, but takes some practice to master and greatly speeds up the process of making small holes.|$|R

50|$|The neGcon {{worked by}} means of gears <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> of potentiometers. This system greatly reduced the logic {{required}} in the controller (important at the time) compared to a quadrature encoder-based system by removing the need for self-calibration and converting relative position to absolute position. The center pivot of the neGcon utilized a ring-gear driving a pinion on <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> of <b>the</b> potentiometer, while the 3 analogue buttons each employed a rack driving similar pinions. These systems were large, with two potentiometers in the left half of the controller for the L shoulder button and center pivot and two potentiometers in the right half of the controller for the â…  and â…¡ buttons. Lack of space inside the unit precluded an analogue R shoulder button. However, extended use caused the swivel joint to wear.|$|R
