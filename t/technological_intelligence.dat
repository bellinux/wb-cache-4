5000|$|Early in 1945, foreseeing {{a vastly}} {{increased}} {{military and civilian}} interest after hostilities ended in Germany, Secretary of War Stimson had sent his scientific consultant, Dr. E. L. Bowles, to Europe to help set up a single high-level scientific and <b>technological</b> <b>intelligence</b> organization. Later, in April, among his other assignments, General Clay had acquired the job of working with Dr. Bowles in carrying out the mission from the Secretary of War. Since the new organization {{would have to be}} combined for as long as SHAEF existed, Clay had selected as its chief Brig. R. J. Maunsell (British), who was already chief of the Special Sections Subdivision, and as the deputy chief Col. Ralph M. Osborne (US). Clay also gave the organization a name, Field Information Agency, to which Maunsell added the word [...] "Technical" [...] to make a pronounceable acronym, FIAT. FIAT was from the first conceived as a post-hostilities agency. It would inherit from the Special Sections Subdivision a military mission and, in the search for information to use against Japan, also a wartime mission; {{but in the long run}} it would be oriented at least equally toward civilian interests. Chief among its interests would be [...] "the securing of the major, and perhaps only, material reward of victory, namely, the advancement of science and the improvement of production and standards of living in the United Nations by proper exploitation of German methods in these fields." [...] FIAT's scope was therewith extended to take in scientific and industrial processes and patents having civilian as well as military applications. Although Clay, Bowles, and Maunsell envisioned FIAT as having exclusive [...] "control and actual handling of operations concerning enemy personnel, documents, and equipment of scientific and industrial interest," [...] they discovered before long that to set up an agency with such sweeping authority in the bureaucratic thickets of SHAEF was not possible. Direct control of operations was already in the hands of various long-established SHAEF elements and would remain there-except for Operation DUSTBIN, which came under FIAT along with its parent agency, the Special Sections Subdivision, on 1 July, and the 6800 T Force, which by the time it passed to FIAT (on 1 August) had practically finished assessing its assigned and uncovered targets. The one new T Force operation in the FIAT period was conducted in Berlin in July and August. In its charter, issued at the end of May, FIAT was authorized to [...] "coordinate, integrate, and direct the activities of the various missions and agencies" [...] interested in scientific and technical intelligence but prohibited from collecting and exploiting such information on its own responsibility.|$|E

Enzyme engineering and its respective technology (within {{the context of}} biotechnology) {{is one of the}} areas of knowledge from which great expectations are constantly arising, such as providing competitive advantage in emergent economies like that of Colombia. However, several decades of research in this field have still not led to important results in terms of enzyme production and their application in industrial processes. This article proposes applying the components of a <b>technological</b> <b>intelligence</b> system to developing enzyme technology. Initial emphasis is placed on scientometrics, using exercises for mapping patents, technological monitoring and evaluating Colombian prolects forming part of Colciencias’ ScienTI network, carried out for the enzymes being used in both the food industry for obtaining hydrolysed products and in the textile industry. An example of Delphi study is documented within the context of industrial enzymes’ future within biotechnology in general. The learning which can arise from analysing a sector leader is stressed by using organisational benchmarking. The basis of a <b>technological</b> <b>intelligence</b> system is then discussed in terms of how it can provide productive and competitive strategies aimed at applying industrial enzymes...|$|E

However, X-Verfahren systems in use among the pathfinders {{and some of the}} German bomber units were not disrupted. For much of the war 80 Wing believed their counter-efforts had affected the German navigational aids. They did however, solve the basics of Y-Verfahren but it would take two more months to counter the former aid. Operations were reduced in January due to the British weather. All groups were involved in remaining operations to Bristol on 3/4 January 1941, Manchester on 9/10 January, Portsmouth on 10/11 January and London the following night. Attacks on Avonmouth on 16/17 and Swansea on 17/18 January were the first to these targets. Records show that in the Portsmouth operation 19 of II./KG 55's He 111s dropped 18 LC 50 flares, eight SC1800, seven SD1400 (Sprengbombe Dickwandig bombs which had some penetrative power for armour-piercing purposes) and seven SC1000 bombs.
