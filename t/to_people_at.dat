5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E

25|$|ResearchGate's {{competitors}} include Academia.edu, Google Scholar and Mendeley.

The fact that ResearchGate restricts its user accounts <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> recognized institutions and published researchers may explain the disparity in active usage, as {{a high percentage of}} the accounts on Academia.edu are lapsed or inactive.

He is portrayed as an eccentric who prefers the company of animals <b>to</b> <b>people,</b> <b>at</b> one point using his powers to heal a dying hedgehog. Radagast is shown to be able to communicate with birds, some of which nest in his hair. In the film, Radagast is the first wizard to visit Dol Guldur after he realizes that an evil power has infected the wood he lives in. He discovers that a Necromancer (Sauron) has taken residence in the ruined fortress. In Dol Guldur he encounters the spirit of the Witch-king of Angmar, as well as the shadow of the Necromancer himself, and escapes with the Morgul blade taken from the Witch-king.|$|E

500|$|Anglo-Saxons {{called the}} island Bradanreolice.

However, the island's current name of [...] "Holm" [...] comes from the Old Norse meaning [...] "island in an estuary". Records indicate that a Viking fleet from the south of Brittany led by two earls, Ottir (Oter) and Hroald (possibly Ottir's king Ragnall), took refuge on the island following their defeat by the Saxons at Watchet.|$|E

500|$|Andy Buckley, who portrayed David Wallace, former CFO of Dunder Mifflin, was {{originally}} {{billed as a}} guest star for this episode and his character {{was supposed to have}} a part in Michael's movie. When NBC first aired the episode, Wallace's scenes were not shown. It was revealed by Novak that, in the script, Wallace was Michael's first choice as Goldenface, but turned it down because [...] "it wouldn't look good <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> Corporate". Furthermore, Buckley filmed a talking head interview, which had his character exclaiming his regret in not taking the role. This scene was deleted due to time constraints. The scene does not appear on the Season 7 DVD. [...] The script also had a scene that brought back Amy Adams' character Katy, but it was cut because Adams was working on a movie during the time this episode was filmed. Ellie Kemper, who portrays Erin Hannon on the series, did not appear in the movie; Novak reasoned that Michael had finished his filming long before she arrived at the office, and had spent the remaining years [...] "editing and procrastinating".|$|E

In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the 60s and 70s were [...] "cultural reference points", saying, [...] "It’s striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> the same time.

500|$|An {{abnormally}} slow rupture at the Sunda Trench and {{a tsunami}} that was unusually strong {{relative to the}} size of the earthquake were both factors that led to it being categorized as a tsunami earthquake. Several thousand kilometers to the southeast, surges of several meters were observed in northwestern Australia, but in Java the tsunami runups (height above normal sea level) were typically [...] and resulted in the deaths of more than 600 people. Other factors may have contributed to exceptionally high peak runups of [...] on the small and mostly uninhabited island of Nusa Kambangan, just to the east of the resort town of Pangandaran, where damage was heavy and a large loss of life occurred. Since the shock was felt with only moderate intensity well inland, and even less so at the shore, the surge arrived with little or no warning. Other factors contributed to the tsunami being largely undetected until it was too late and, although a tsunami watch was posted by an American tsunami warning center and a Japanese meteorological center, no information was delivered <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> the coast.|$|E

2500|$|In 1906, {{because of}} Frank's {{literary}} successes and the profitable royalties from the 1902 Wizard of Oz musical, Maud and Frank were wealthy enough to travel around Egypt, Greece, Italy, North Africa, Switzerland, and France on a six-month expedition. During their traveling, Maud saw an Egyptian harem and enthusiastically climbed the Great Pyramid of Giza. A year later, her husband published In Other Lands Than Ours, which he compiled from Maud's letters <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> home.

He said in the 2011 {{documentary}} God Bless Ozzy Osbourne that [...] "as soon as [...] heard 'She Loves You' on the radio, [...] knew [...] wanted to be a rock star for the rest of [...] life". Osbourne left school at 15 and was employed as a construction site labourer, trainee plumber, apprentice toolmaker, car factory horn-tuner, and abattoir worker. He attempted to commit burglary, stealing a television (which fell on him during his getaway and had to be abandoned), a handful of baby clothes (originally thought to be adult clothes as it was too dark to see when he committed the burglary, and which were stolen to sell <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> a pub), and some T-shirts. He spent six weeks in Winson Green Prison when he was unable to pay a fine after being found guilty of robbing a clothes shop; to teach his son a lesson, his father refused to pay the fine.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} {{experiments}} using diamond anvils, {{the sample was}} placed on the flat tip of the diamond, the culet, and pressed between the diamond faces. As the diamond faces were pushed closer together, the sample would be pressed and extrude out from the center. Using a microscope to view the sample, it could be seen that a smooth pressure gradient existed across the sample with the outer most portions of the sample acting as a kind of gasket. The sample was not evenly distributed across the diamond culet but localized in the center due to the [...] "cupping" [...] of the diamond at higher pressures. This cupping phenomenon is the elastic stretching of the edges of the diamond culet, commonly referred to as the [...] "shoulder height". Many diamonds were broken during the first stages of producing a new cell or any time an experiment is pushed to higher pressure. The NBS group was in a unique position where almost endless supplies of diamonds were available to them. Custom officials occasionally confiscated diamonds from people attempting to smuggle them into the country. Disposing of such valuable confiscated materials could be problematic given rules and regulations. A solution was simply to make such materials available <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> other government agencies if they could make a convincing case for their use. This became an unrivaled resource as other teams at the University of Chicago, Harvard University and General Electric entered the high pressure field.|$|E
