5|$|Arctic Bulk Minerals bought <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> rights, and {{operated}} a train once to {{twice a year}} to keep the track and rolling stock maintained. This company filed for bankruptcy in 2002. <b>The</b> <b>mining</b> company was then bought by the local power company Varanger Kraft and Sør-Varanger Municipality. In 2006, they sold <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> company to Tschudi Group for 102million Norwegian krone (NOK). The Tschudi Group established Northern Iron, registered in Perth, Australia, as a holding company to own <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> company. Operations in the mine and on the line resumed in 2009, after the price of iron had risen dramatically since {{the closing of the}} mine. With the opening of the mine, production is estimated at 3million tonnes of export per year. The Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line was the northern-most railway in the world until 2010, when Russia's Obskaya–Bovanenkovo Line was opened.|$|E

5000|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> lands, it {{launches}} seven tripwires before arming itself. Any {{disturbance of}} the tripwires will trigger <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is entirely electrically detonated, if the battery level of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> drops below a pre-set level - <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> self-destructs. Even if <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> does not self-destruct, the battery will fully discharge after 14 days, rendering <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> inactive.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> larvae <b>mines</b> <b>the</b> {{stems of}} Phalaris arundiacea, Phragmites australis and other grasses on occasion. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> starts at <b>the</b> leaf tip and descends as an {{irregular}} blotch <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is flat and quite shallow. The frass is initially {{deposited in the}} oldest, upper part of <b>the</b> <b>mine,</b> but later in strings. The larva may leave <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> and restart elsewhere. Pupation takes place outside of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The MN-121 is a Polish scatterable {{anti-tank}} mine, externally {{similar to}} <b>the</b> German AT-2 <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is cylindrical with ten wire legs which fold outward to keep <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> upright. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> uses a magnetic influence fuze, which triggers <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> when a vehicle passes over it. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{also has an}} anti-handling device which triggers <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> if it is moved. <b>The</b> <b>mine's</b> warhead is a shaped charge design containing approximately 700 grams of RDX. The manufacturer claims that {{it is capable of}} penetrating 60 millimeters of armour at an offset of half a meter.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{its vast}} {{government}} revenue from <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> of petroleum, Nigeria faces {{a number of}} societal issues, owing primarily to a history of inefficiency in its governance.|$|E
5|$|Elcor was {{a mining}} location, built by <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> company {{to house the}} workers for its mines. People were allowed to own their homes, but the land on which the houses stood belonged to <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> company. After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the {{residents}} to vacate the property {{so that it could}} reclaim the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned. The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers and bankruptcies. In 1993 the Inland Steel Company began stripping the overburden from Elcor's former location for what is now the Minorca mine.|$|E
5|$|Emanations of {{hydrogen}} sulfide {{have been reported}} around the volcano, preventing <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> of underground sulfur deposits, and the gas is also present in the hot springs. The confirmed presence of sulfur dioxide would indicate hot magma beneath the volcano.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>mine</b> can be {{deployed}} either from aircraft, a specialised mine laying system or 122 mm artillery rockets. When required <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is ejected from a storage canister, and shortly afterwards a small parachute is opened, which both retards the descent and keeps <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> correctly oriented as it descends. Once <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> lands on <b>the</b> ground {{the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is ejected, along with the parachute and the spring-loaded legs bring <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> upright.|$|R
50|$|The MN-111 is a Polish air-dropped {{anti-tank}} landmine. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{is designed}} for use on soft ground. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is cylindrical with six spring-loaded fins attached to one end of <b>the</b> <b>mine,</b> with <b>the</b> cylinder drawn to a point {{at the opposite end}} which is topped with a small wind vane. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is stored with the fins wrapped round the outside of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is dropped from the aircraft the fins spring outward, acting as a drag parachute, slowing the rate of descent to a peak speed of about 60 meters per second. As <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> drops <b>the</b> wind vane spins, generating the power used to arm <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Climax Molybdenum Company re-opened <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> in 1924, and it {{operated}} <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> nearly continuously until <b>the</b> 1980s. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{was shut}} down between 1995 and 2012, awaiting higher molybdenum prices. <b>The</b> <b>mine's</b> current owner, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, continues to work on environmental cleanup of past operations while holding <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> ready in <b>the</b> event of market changes.|$|R
5|$|Even {{though the}} project was {{initially}} built for hydroelectric power generation to meet <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> requirements, it has over the years evolved into a multipurpose reservoir with benefits of power generation, drinking water and fisheries.|$|E
5|$|He also {{supported}} {{the development of}} industry and manufacturing, fields in which the Commonwealth lagged behind most of Western Europe. Among the endeavors in which he invested were the manufacture of cannons and firearms and <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency {{added the}} Basin mining {{area to the}} Superfund National Priorities List because of mining-waste {{problems}} in and near town. <b>The</b> <b>mining</b> area comprised the watersheds of Basin and Cataract Creek {{and part of the}} Boulder River. Contaminants included arsenic, copper, cadmium, lead and other metals. Cleanup of <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> wastes at the Buckeye-Enterprise, Crystal and Bullion mines in the Basin Creek and Cataract watersheds was completed in 2002, and the removal of mine waste from Basin was completed in 2004.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{continued}} to operate until November 1984, supplying coal to the Toowoomba Hospital. When <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> structures were bought by Kath and John Greenhalgh, {{the owners of}} the farm on which <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> was located. <b>The</b> Greenhalghs kept <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> intact and opened it as a museum. In 2000, when the Greenhalghs decided to retire from the land, they sold <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> to <b>the</b> Rosalie Shire Council. It ceased to operate as a museum from that time.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Artemisia campestris and Artemisia vulgaris. They <b>mine</b> <b>the</b> {{leaves of}} their host plant. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{consists}} of an upper surface blotch, with a conspicuous yellow-orange tinge. The larva lines the inside of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> with silk, causing <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> to pucker up strongly. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is preceded by a long lower-surface corridor, running along the midrib or the leaf margin. Older larvae start eating parts of the upper epidermis. The black frass is deposited in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> Pupation takes place outside of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>mines</b> {{operating}} in <b>the</b> area included <b>the</b> Gunnar <b>Mine,</b> <b>the</b> Lorado <b>Mine,</b> and <b>the</b> Fay-Ace-Verna <b>Mine</b> in Eldorado, Saskatchewan.|$|R
5|$|Just {{before the}} 1975 tournament, the common beige {{sand in the}} bunkers was {{replaced}} with the now-signature white feldspar. It is a quartz derivative of <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> of feldspar and is shipped in from North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Albertite, {{a type of}} asphalt, {{was first}} found in Albert County in 1849 by the Canadian {{geologist}} Abraham Gesner, inventor of kerosene. Over 200,000tonnes of the mineral were shipped to Boston within 30 years. Large deposits of gypsum found eight kilometres (five miles) from <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> site were shipped around the globe as well. The Petitcodiac River {{was used as the}} primary means for transporting the minerals at the time.|$|E
5|$|Alien Rage {{takes place}} on an {{asteroid}} which humans and an alien species known as Vorus were jointly mining for Promethium, a highly efficient source of energy. After the Vorus turn on the humans and wipe the miners out, Jack, the player character, is sent to <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> facility to kill the aliens and destroy the facility.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{has been}} blamed for {{dividing}} the people in local communities in the region into those that have found well-paying jobs in <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> and prospered, while those that have not remain poor. A strike at <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> in 2004 was aimed at countering this issue, resulting in a promise by <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> owners to invest into the local communities after <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> closure.|$|R
50|$|The PM-60 or K-1 is a German round plastic cased minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> case of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> {{consists of}} two halves joined together by sixteen plastic nuts, giving <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> a distinctive appearance. The top of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> has a large pressure plate which rests {{on top of the}} fuze assembly. Two fuzes are available for <b>the</b> <b>mine,</b> a conventional ball bearing retained striker and a chemical fuze, containing a glass ampule of acid over a flash composition. When <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is deployed with the chemical fuze {{it is very difficult to}} detect because the only metal in <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is <b>the</b> detonator capsule. There is a secondary fuze well on the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> that can accept a fuze allowing remote command detonation of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on {{sycamore}} (Acer pseudoplatanus) <b>mining</b> <b>the</b> leaves. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{starts as}} an inconspicuous lower surface epidermal corridor. This corridor is followed, and mostly replaced, by a relatively small, lower-surface, tentiform mine with many weak folds. If <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is {{located near the}} leaf margin, the leaf may fold downwards over <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> frass is deposited {{in a corner of}} <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> pupa is formed in <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> and is dark brownish black. It is made in a loosely spun cocoon.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{toxicity}} of mercury, both <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning. In China, prison labor was used by a private mining company {{as recently as the}} 1950s to develop new cinnabar mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi mining company to establish new tunnels. Worker health in functioning mines is at high risk.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{farming and}} its {{associated}} industries, including making cider, cheese and yoghurt, and peat extraction, the county has little industry. It {{has been involved in}} the manufacture of helicopters, some heavy industries related to defence, quarrying and <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> of gravels and sands, brick-making and tile-making, and the manufacture of slippers, boots and shoes, but many of these industries have declined. Tourism {{is one of the main}} sources of income.|$|E
5|$|Book XXXIV {{covers the}} base metals, their uses and their extraction. Copper mining is mentioned, {{using a variety}} of ores {{including}} copper pyrites and marcasite, some of <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> being underground, some on the surface. Iron mining is covered, followed by lead and tin.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mine</b> has a short tubular {{olive green}} or sand colored plastic body inside {{which is the}} steel {{bounding}} body of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> On top of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is a round fuze cap with five prongs. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is triggered when the fuze cap tilts, either because of pressure {{on one of the}} prongs or a pull on an attached tripwire. The tilting fuze mechanism is not affected by overpressure. When <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is triggered, a spring-loaded firing pin fires a percussion cap inside the fuze, which ignites a propelling charge at the base of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> propellant charge launches <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> up out of the ground and into the air.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Rumex lunaria. They <b>mine</b> <b>the</b> {{leaves of}} their host plant. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> has <b>the</b> {{form of a}} large, glassy blotch. All frass is ejected out of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> blotch is located next to the leaf margin, which {{slightly}} curls over <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> Larvae may also bore in young shoots. Pupation takes place outside of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{variants}} of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> differ in {{detail of the}} fuze and base section of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> early <b>mines</b> had a large thin flat circular base while later mines had a smaller thicker base. Later version of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> were also better waterproofed.|$|R
5|$|Boycott {{was born}} in <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> village of Fitzwilliam, near Wakefield and Pontefract in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the eldest of three sons of Jane (née Speight) and Thomas Wilfred Boycott, a {{colliery}} worker from Little Dawley in the midwestern county of Shropshire.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{currency}} is the CFA franc. In the 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>Mining</b> industry of Chad produced sodium carbonate, or natron. There {{have also been}} reports of gold-bearing quartz in the Biltine Prefecture. However, years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.|$|E
5|$|Christian Collett (1771–1833), a {{graduate}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mining</b> Academy at Kongsberg, designed the splendid Ulefoss manor, built between 1802 and 1807 by sawmill owner Niels Aall. This {{is one of the}} few brick houses in Norway, boasting a palladian layout, a central cupola, and a classical colonnade. Collett designed several other manors and town houses.|$|E
50|$|New access {{elevators}} to <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> {{were constructed}} in to convert <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> to a storage area. Parts of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> {{served as a}} Cold War fallout shelter.|$|R
50|$|The MATS/1.4 is a scatterable Italian circular, plastic-cased minimum metal blast-resistant {{anti-tank}} blast mine. It uses a pneumatic fuze {{which is}} resistant to shock and blast. <b>The</b> <b>mine's</b> plastic case is waterproof, and <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> can be scattered from a helicopter travelling {{at up to}} 200 km/h. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is normally tan-colored. <b>The</b> <b>mine's</b> main charge is relatively small, so when hand-emplaced <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> can be stacked, to increase its effect.|$|R
50|$|Both {{versions}} of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> are waterproof when new, {{and can be}} laid in shallow water, but <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> casing often splits and warps in hot climates, although small splits do not affect <b>the</b> <b>mine's</b> performance. <b>The</b> <b>mines</b> are prone to sympathetic detonation if laid closer together than 2 m. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is found in Angola, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, the Western Sahara, and Zambia.|$|R
