2500|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{challenge to}} Jackson and Baird's theory, which more closely resembles actual legal policy, came initially from Elizabeth Warren. Warren argued that Jackson and Baird's model is dangerously oversimplified, {{and based on}} untested hypothetical assertions about behaviour. First, every system of insolvency law must necessarily make choices about how losses are distributed among creditors with multiple interest. Among these diverse interests include weaker creditors, particularly employees, who are less capable than others at diversifying the risks of insolvency. There is a distinct community interest in companies that survive, and no good reason why only creditors with provable proprietary interests in a company's winding up {{should be taken into}} account. This means it is reasonable to give preference to more vulnerable creditors, and to expect secured creditors take on some additional risk to ensure businesses survive for the greater good. The Baird and Jackson view essentially amounts to [...] "single-value economic rationality, an excuse to impose a distributional scheme without justifying it, and, incidentally, a way to work in a damn good deal for secured creditors." [...] Additionally, Lucian Bebchuk has argued that the institution of security interests operates as a partially unjustified negative externality against unsecured creditors. It is not clear, argues Bebchuk, that security interests are in fact efficient, and they are capable of subsidising their activities by diverting wealth from unsecured creditors to themselves without any agreement. In the UK, Roy Goode argues that banks usually take security interests, not because they would otherwise charge a higher interest rate (and so increasing credit to businesses for the benefit of all creditors) but because they calculate the market will bear it. The <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> depends, not on efficiency, but on bargaining power. Riz Mokal, also deeply critical of the creditors' bargain model, suggests that if one were to follow Baird and Jackson's methodology but in a truly value neutral way, one would ask what creditors would hypothetically agree to if they did not know who they were at all (i.e. whether they were voluntary or involuntary creditors, secured or unsecured). This would likely lead to a result where secured credit was not inviolable, and insolvency law could take account of diverse interests, including corporate rescue.|$|E

40|$|The subject <b>of</b> <b>security</b> over movable {{property}} is rightly seen {{as belonging to}} the core of activities dealing with the harmonisation and unification of European private law. The current differences in the laws of Member States of the European Union inhibit the free movement of capital and delay the completion of the internal market. English law is widely considered as sympathetic to secured credit and has therefore facilitating the making of loans to industry and commerce. In this article, the author emphasises the ease and simplicity with which a creditor can take security, drawing attention to the celebrated floating charge. He points to the current failure of English law to subscribe to the functional policies underpinning article 9 of the American Uniform Commercial Code (so influential in the model law drafted for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development). Finally, he draws attention to the way English law focuses on freedom of contract between secured creditor and debtor, refusing to take account of distributional (or third party) considerations. Change, however, is in the air. The Privy Council has recently imposed controls over the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>security</b> and the creditor's self-help remedies are under threat from proposed legislative change...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. New {{technologies}} {{enable to}} perform standardized processes {{in a more}} efficient way. This applies also to the sector of meter reading, where the consumption data of gas, water and electricity had been read manually so far. This process can be dramatically optimized through the usage of new technol-ogy by upgrading installed meters with a non-invasive low-power/low-cost op-tical system using a digital retina 1. Data can be read through {{the glass of the}} meters and transmitted to the utility provider using a wireless network. So, the process of reading manually the meters and collecting the consumption data can be replaced by a more cost efficient solution. This new solution arises some is-sues on security aspects related to data confidentiality and integrity.

40|$|Abstract—The idea of {{building}} secure systems by plugging together “secure ” components is appealing, but this requires a definition <b>of</b> <b>security</b> which, {{in addition to}} <b>taking</b> care <b>of</b> toplevel <b>security</b> goals, is strengthened appropriately {{in order to be}} compositional. This approach has been previously studied for information-flow <b>security</b> <b>of</b> shared-variable concurrent programs, but the price for compositionality is very high: a thread must be extremely pessimistic about what an environment might do with shared resources. This pessimism leads to many intuitively secure threads being labelled as insecure. Since in practice it is only meaningful to compose threads which follow an agreed protocol for data access, we take advantage of this to develop a more liberal compositional security condition. The idea is to give the security definition access to the intended pattern of data usage, as expressed by assumption-guarantee style conditions associated with each thread. We illustrate the improved precision by developing the first flow-sensitive security type system that provably enforces a noninterference-like property for concurrent programs...|$|R
