5000|$|The EMS Viscometer {{measures}} the viscosity of liquids through {{observation of the}} rotation of a sphere which is driven by electromagnetic interaction: Two magnets attached to a rotor create a rotating magnetic field. The sample (3) to be measured is in a small test tube (2). Inside the tube is an aluminium sphere (4). The tube {{is located in a}} <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>chamber</b> (1) and set such that the sphere is situated in the centre of the two magnets.The rotating magnetic field induces eddy currents in the sphere. The resulting Lorentz interaction between the magnetic field and these eddy currents generate torque that rotates the sphere. The rotational speed of the sphere depends on the rotational velocity of the magnetic field, the magnitude of the magnetic field and the viscosity of the sample around the sphere. The motion of the sphere is monitored by a video camera (5) located below the cell. The torque applied to the sphere is proportional to the difference in the angular velocity of the magnetic field [...] and the one of the sphere [...] There is thus a linear relationship between [...] and the viscosity of the liquid.|$|E

HPLC analysis techniques were used to reduce analysis times and extend the technique's applicable range.The amount of protein required for an analysis decreased, from 10-100 nanomoles for Edman and Begg's protein sequencer, to the low picomole range, a revolutionary increase in the sensitivity of the technology. The new sequencer offered significant advantages in speed and sample size compared to commercial sequencers of the time, the most popular of which were built by Beckman Instruments.Commercialized as the Model 470A protein sequencer, it allowed scientists to determine partial amino acid sequences of proteins that had not previously been accessible, characterizing new proteins and better understanding their activity, function, and effects in therapeutics. These discoveries had significant ramifications in biology, medicine, and pharmacology.|$|E

One type of PSP utilizes platinum tetra(pentafluorophenyl) porphine (PtTFPP) dissolved in a fluoro-polymer film.

40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} such as temperature inevitably impact the long term performance, strength and deformation characteristics of most materials in infrastructure applications. The mechanical and durability properties of geosynthetic materials are strongly temperature dependent. The interfaces between geotextiles and geomembranes {{as well as between}} granular materials such as sands and geomembranes in landfill applications are subject to temperature changes due to seasonal temperature variations as well as exothermic reactions occurring in the waste body. This can be a critical factor governing the stability of modern waste containment lining systems. Historically, most laboratory geosynthetic interface testing has been performed at room temperature. Information today is emerging that shows how temperatures in the liner systems of landfills can be much higher. An extensive research study was undertaken in an effort to investigate temperature effects on interface shear behavior between (a) NPNW polypropylene geotextiles and both smooth PVC as well as smooth and textured HDPE geomembranes and (b) sands of different angularity and smooth PVC and HDPE geomembranes. A <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>chamber</b> was designed and developed to simulate elevated temperature field conditions and shear displacement-failure mechanisms at these higher temperatures. The physical laboratory testing program consisted of multiple series of interface shear tests between material combinations found in landfill applications under a range of normal stress levels from 10 to 400 kPa and at a range of test temperatures from 20 to 50 °C. Complementary geotextile single filament tensile tests were performed at different temperatures using a dynamic thermo-mechanical analyzer (DMA) to evaluate tensile strength properties of geotextile single filaments at elevated temperatures. The single filament studies are important since the interface strength between geotextiles and geomembranes is controlled by the fabric global matrix properties as well as the micro-scale characteristics of the geotextile and how it interacts with the geomembrane macro-topography. The peak interface strength for sand-geomembrane as well as geotextile-geomembrane interfaces depends on the geomembrane properties such as hardness and micro texture. To this end, the surface hardness of smooth HDPE and PVC geomembrane samples was measured at different temperatures in the <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>chamber</b> to evaluate how temperature changes affect the interface shear behavior and strength of geomembranes in combination with granular materials and/or geotextiles. The focus of this portion of the experimental work was to examine: i) the change in geomembrane hardness with temperature; ii) develop empirical relationships to predict shear strength properties of sand - geomembrane interfaces as a function of temperature; and iii) compare the results of empirically predicted frictional shear strength properties with the results of direct measurements from the interface shear tests performed at different elevated temperatures.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is a study}} of the effectiveness of the mechanical, hydroponic and software components of a biowall that improves indoor air quality through plant assisted phytoremediation. The research investigates the ability of the device to sustain plant health in a controlled environment over an extended period. This is because, the biowall has intermittent airflow through it. This airflow, has a detrimental effect on the health of the plants in the biowall. After studying the horticultural and mechanical aspects needed to operate a biowall, appropriate control algorithms were developed. These algorithms controlled the biowall’s lights, irrigation, and fan. ^ An experiment evaluating the effectiveness of the control algorithms in sustaining biowall plant health then began. A <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>chamber</b> served as the location for this experiment. In this experiment, the health of the experiment group, that is, the biowall’s plants, was compared with a control group of similar plants.

The control group however, did not have any air flowing through its substrate. ^ The conducted experiment sought to gauge the effectiveness of the control algorithms in maintaining biowall plant health. This was done by comparing experimental and control group health on a weekly basis. The subsequent analyses helped determine the impact of airflow as well the effectiveness of the control algorithms on plant health. This analysis served as the basis for recommendations that would improve future iterations of the biowall. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{new type}} of {{absolute}} measurement of the nitrogen ﬂuorescence yield in the air will be performed at LAL using 3 items which will yield an unprecedented precision in all conditions of pressure, temperature, and pollutants. A 5 MeV electron beam will be provided by the new electron accelerator PHIL at LAL. As the ﬂuorescence yield {{is proportional to the}} energy loss of the electrons, the contribution of secondary electrons (deltas) to the signal is much more important than the contribution of the primary electrons. It has therefore been chosen to use an integrating sphere, the basic property of which being that the probability to detect light is independent from where the light is produced inside the sphere. An output device on this sphere will be equipped with a set of optical ﬁbers driving the ﬂuorescence light to a Jobin-Yvon spectrometer equipped with an LN 2 cooled CCD. The ﬂuorescence spectrum in the 300 - 430 nm range will be accurately measured in steps of 0. 1 nm resolution. A PMT equipped with a BG 3 ﬁlter (the same as on JEM-EUSO) will be set on the sphere to measure the integrated yield. The sphere will be monitored by a NIST photo-diode, and will be surrounded by a spherical envelope to create a <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>chamber</b> (a Dewar). With this setup {{it will be possible to}} vary the temperature from 60 ◦ C to + 40 ◦ C and the pressure from 1 to 0. 01 atm. The expected precision of the yield should be better than 5 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{neutral beam}} {{injection}} system for ITER requires an ion source based on negative hydrogen and deuterium ions. The production of negative ions relies mainly on the conversion on a cesiated surface with a low work function. The influence of Cs on the work function and the optimal layer thickness is discussed. A list of Cs properties relevant for the ion source is compiled. The Cs oven used at IPP Garching is introduced and its modification with a valve is described, test results are presented. The standard of knowledge at IPP of the Cs dynamics in the plasma source is discussed. With respect to the surface bonding of Cs two methods to control the Cs are presented: the <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> source <b>chamber</b> and the heated plasma grid. The success of coating the inner source walls with molybdenum is mentioned. Further Cs diagnostics applied and explored at IPP are presented. Key word...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{and uniform}} seed {{germination}} and seedling emergence under diverse environmental conditions is a desirable characteristic for crops. Common bean genotypes (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{differ in their}} low temperature tolerance regarding growth and yield. Cultivars tolerant to low temperature during the germination and emergence stages and carriers of the grain quality standards demanded by consumers are needed {{for the success of}} the bean crop. The objectives of this study were (i) to screen the seedling emergence and the phenotypic response of bean germplasm under a range of <b>temperatures</b> in <b>controlled</b> <b>chamber</b> and field conditions to display stress-tolerant genotypes with good agronomic performances and yield potential, and (ii) to compare the emergence of bean seedlings under controlled environment and in open field conditions to assess the efficiency of genebanks standard germination tests for predicting the performance of the seeds in the field. Three trials were conducted with 28 dry bean genotypes in open field and in growth chamber under low, moderate, and warm temperature. Morpho-agronomic data were used to evaluate the phenotypic performance of the different genotypes. Cool temperatures resulted in a reduction of the rate of emergence in the bean genotypes, however, emergence and early growth of bean could be under different genetic control and these processes need further research to be suitably modeled. Nine groups arose from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) representing variation in emergence time and proportion of emergence in the <b>controlled</b> <b>chamber</b> and in the open field indicating a trend to lower emergence in large and extra-large seeded genotypes. Screening of seedling emergence and phenotypic response of the bean germplasm under a range of <b>temperatures</b> in <b>controlled</b> growth <b>chambers</b> and under field conditions showed several genotypes, as landraces 272, 501, 593, and the cultivar Borlotto, with stress-tolerance at emergence, and high yield potential that could be valuable genetic material for breeding programs. Additionally, the potential genetic erosion in genebanks was assessed. Regarding bean commercial traits, under low temperature at sowing time seed reached larger size, and crop yield was higher compared to warmer temperatures at the sowing time. Therefore, early sowing of bean is strongly recommended.

40|$|This first-level report {{describes}} {{the design and}} construction of a Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) test track {{that will be used}} to validate Caltrans overlay strategies for the rehabilitation of cracked asphalt concrete. The report also summarizes the first phase of HVS testing, carried out on six separate sections to crack the pavement, as well as design and construction of the overlays for the reflective cracking HVS experiments. The construction, preliminary field and laboratory data, and accelerated pavement tests reveal several issues regarding the performance of the asphalt concrete pavement cross section tested under the Heavy Vehicle Simulator. The test track was constructed in September 2001. HVS testing took place between December 21, 2001, and March 25, 2003. Each section was trafficked with a 60 kN (13, 500 lb) load using a bi-directional loading pattern with wander. Pavement temperature at 50 mm depth was maintained at 20 °C (68 °F) using a <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> <b>chamber.</b> Findings from the HVS testing include: • Analysis of deflection measurements revealed that the modulus of the asphalt concrete was significantly affected by the asphalt concrete temperature. • The performance of the HVS test sections appeared to be significantly influenced by the behavior of the aggregate base. Sections that were tested during the dry months lasted longer both in fatigue and surface rutting than the sections tested during the wet months. • Air-void contents and thicknesses were similar for the test sections; therefore, the effect of these variables could not be addressed. • Deflection results could not be satisfactorily used as an indicator of aggregate base performance. Aggregate base moduli were higher during the cold/wet months but decreased rapidly when tested under the HVS. The aggregate base moduli of the sections during the dry/warm months were lower than those during the cold/wet months, but the sections tested during the dry period had longer pavement lives. Deflections determined with the RSD during HVS testing and an FWD after testing were used to determine overlay thicknesses. A full-thickness design of 90 mm (3. 5 in) was selected for the AR 4000 -D control section and one of the modified binder mixes (MB-G). The remaining sections were designed as half-thickness (45 mm) (1. 7 in). The overlays were placed on June 14, 2003...|$|R
