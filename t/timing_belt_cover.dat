5000|$|The VG30i is a 3 L (2,960 cc) engine {{produced}} from 1986 through 1989. It features a throttle body fuel injection system. It {{has a long}} crank snout, a cylinder head temperature sensor positioned behind the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> <b>cover,</b> and a knock sensor in the cylinder valley (on California models only). It produces [...] at 4,800 rpm and 226 Nm at 2,800 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The 1.3 L 2A was {{produced}} from 1979 through 1989. 2A motors in 1982 onwards AL20 Tercels {{have a slightly}} different valve cover and <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> <b>cover</b> than early AL11 Tercels, {{as well as an}} automatic choke, and automatically controlled hot air intake (HAI) system. It also has higher compression ratio, and reformulated combustion chambers to improve the fuel economy and emissions. All variants used belt-driven SOHC eight-valve counter-flow cylinder heads with a single downdraft carburetor.|$|E
50|$|However, {{while the}} Volvo engine designs would {{externally}} {{appear to be}} a domestic Volvo, there are minor differences. The engine mounts are one example along with the oil filter mounting, power steering pump, ECU, <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> <b>cover</b> and probably the gearbox setup. The camshaft pulleys were inverted by Renault making the Volvo timing marks redundant. The engine must now utilise a specialist alignment tool to set up the timing however this tool can also be used on the same genuine volvo engines. The 2.5 engine is really a 2.4 being 2435cc but was rounded up by Renault.|$|E
5000|$|Timing <b>belts</b> are {{typically}} <b>covered</b> by metal or polymer <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> <b>covers</b> which require removal for inspection or replacement. Engine manufacturers recommend replacement at specific intervals. [...] The manufacturer may also recommend {{the replacement of}} other parts, such as the water pump, when the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> is replaced because the additional cost to replace the water pump is negligible compared {{to the cost of}} accessing the <b>timing</b> <b>belt.</b> In an interference engine, or one whose valves extend into the path of the piston, failure of the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> (or <b>timing</b> chain) invariably results in costly and, in some cases, irreparable engine damage, as some valves will be held open when they should not be and thus will be struck by the pistons.|$|R
5000|$|The first 2007 Hypermotard was {{available}} in two configurations: the base '1100' model and the higher specification '1100S' model. The more expensive 1100S featured a durable low friction diamond-like carbon (DLC) black coating to the front fork sliders, an Öhlins remote reservoir rear shock, the same Brembo Monobloc brake calipers used on the 1098, lighter forged aluminium Marchesini wheels with a red pin-stripe, Pirelli tires, plus carbon fibre fork protectors, <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> <b>covers,</b> front mudguard/ fender and tail/ exhaust side panels. These upgrades made for a 2 kg (4.5 lb) weight saving; 177 kg (390 lbs) versus 179 kg (395 lbs) for the base model.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{production}} automobile engines use a <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or {{chain to}} synchronize crankshaft and camshaft rotation; some engines instead use gears to directly drive the camshafts. The {{use of a}} <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or chain instead of direct gear drive enables engine designers to place the camshaft(s) further from the crankshaft, and in engines with multiple camshafts a <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or chain also enables the camshafts to be placed further from each other. Timing chains were common on production automobiles through the 1970s and 1980s, when <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> became the norm, but timing chains have seen a resurgence in recent years. Timing chains are generally more durable than <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> - though neither is as durable as direct gear drive - however, <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> are lighter, less expensive, and operate more quietly.|$|R
5000|$|Aftermarket <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> {{may be used}} {{to alter}} engine performance. OEM <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> may stretch at high rpm, {{retarding}} the cam and therefore the ignition. [...] Stronger, aftermarket belts, will not stretch and the timing is preserved. [...] In terms of engine design, [...] "shortening the width of the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> reduces weight and friction".|$|R
50|$|The SOHC EJ Subaru boxer engines were non-interference engines through 1995, run by {{a single}} <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> driving both cams (both sides of the engine) and the water pump. Because they are non-interference engines, if the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> fails, the engine of the models up to 1995 will not be damaged. The oil pump is driven {{directly}} from the crank shaft and the waterpump by the <b>timing</b> <b>belt.</b> All DOHC and 1998-up SOHC EJ engines are interference engines, if the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> fails the valves will likely be damaged.|$|R
40|$|The {{tension in}} <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> {{is subject to}} {{periodic}} fluctuation. This is brought about by factors such as an eccentric pulley and error of one pitch of the pulley, etc. This paper presents the regions of resonance of a <b>timing</b> <b>belt.</b> The equation of an axially moving <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> with tension of periodic variation is developed. For theoretical analysis, the perturbation method of multiple scales is used. A study is carried on the instability regions with subharmonic and summonic types of parametric resonance. The effects of various system parameters, such as the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> speed and the gyroscopic matrix, upon the instability regions have been studied...|$|R
40|$|The loss {{of energy}} in gear with <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> is a reason of belt destruction. The {{analysis}} of coupling between <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> and pulley lets us point out the most important cause for lost {{of energy in}} gears with <b>timing</b> <b>belt.</b> Due to circumferenial force and pre-tension friction forces and centrifugal forces as well as transverse and lonigitudinal forces in cords evoked by vibrations there are many complex stresses occurring in the gear...|$|R
50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>belt,</b> <b>timing</b> chain or cambelt {{is a part}} of an {{internal}} combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft(s) so that the engine's valves open and close at the proper times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes. In an interference engine the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or chain is also critical to preventing the piston from striking the valves. A <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> is usually a toothed belt -- a drive belt with teeth on the inside surface. A timing chain is a roller chain.|$|R
50|$|For the B230 engines 1993, piston cooling, oil {{squirting}} jets {{were added}} to help alleviate piston slap problems on the turbo motors. Another modification was to go from a square toothed <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> set up to a round toothed <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> setup which made for quieter belt running.|$|R
50|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine application the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or chain connects the crankshaft to the camshaft(s), which in turn control the opening and closing of the engine's valves. A four-stroke engine requires that the valves open and close once every other revolution of the crankshaft. The <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> does this. It has teeth to turn the camshaft(s) synchronised with the crankshaft, and is specifically designed for a particular engine. In some engine designs the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> may also be used to drive other engine components such as the water pump and oil pump.|$|R

50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> is {{typically}} rubber with high-tensile fibres (e.g. fiberglass or Twaron/Kevlar) running {{the length of}} the belt as tension members. The belt itself is constructed in sturdy materials such as molded polyurethane, neoprene or welded urethane with various standard, non-standard or metric pitches. The distance between the centers of two adjacent teeth on the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> {{is referred to as the}} pitch.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{features}} a cast iron block, an aluminium head, and a <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> driven valvetrain. The <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> also drives the water pump. It {{was first used}} in the Opel Kadett D, Ascona B, Corsa and their corresponding Vauxhall sister models, the Astra, Cavalier and Nova. Many General Motors subsidiaries, including Daewoo, GM do Brasil, GM Powertrain, and Holden have used this design.|$|R
50|$|One {{critical}} maintenance issue {{specific to}} the Yugo 55 qnd 65 (the 45 was a 903 cc pushrod engine, with a timing chain) was the need for regular replacement of the interference engine's <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> — every 40000 mi. In a non-interference engine, <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> failure does not cause further damage to the engine. However, in an interference engine, failure of the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> disrupts the synchronization between pistons and poppet valves, causing them to collide with one another (hence the name interference engine), thus potentially destroying the engine. Though this requirement was stressed in owners' manuals, it was frequently overlooked by owners. The factory also {{stressed the need for}} 89-octane fuels for the low-compression engines.|$|R
50|$|Timing belts must be {{replaced}} at the manufacturer's recommended distance and/or time periods. Failure to replace the belt can result in complete breakdown or catastrophic engine failure, especially in interference engines. The owner's manual maintenance schedule {{is the source of}} <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> replacement intervals, typically every 30,000 to 50,000 miles (50,000 to 80,000 km). It is common to replace the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> tensioner {{at the same time as}} the belt is replaced.|$|R
50|$|When an {{automotive}} <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> is replaced, {{care must}} be taken to ensure that the valve and piston movements are correctly synchronized. Failure to synchronize correctly can lead to problems with valve timing, and this in turn, in extremes, can cause collision between valves and pistons in interference engines. This is not a problem unique to <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> since the same issue exists with all other cam/crank timing methods such as gears or chains.|$|R

2500|$|Powertrain {{detail of}} the Audi V8 {{featured}} one of two all-new, all-aluminium alloy engines – both petrol engines, and both in V8 configuration with 32 valves (four valves per cylinder) with dual valve springs, and four overhead camshafts (DOHC). The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was grey cast iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar toothed <b>timing</b> <b>belt,</b> driven {{from the front of}} the crankshaft operated only the exhaust camshaft in each bank. [...] The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex roller chain from the exhaust camshaft – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the <b>timing</b> <b>belt.</b> This method reduced the complexity of the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and lead to easier and less costly maintenance of the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> and associated components. [...] The intervals for changing the <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> varied; the 3.6V8 (PT) required changing every , whereas the 4.2V8 (ABH) had a longer interval at [...] A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars. [...] This not only provided forced airflow for the engine coolant radiator, but also for the smaller engine oil cooler.|$|R
50|$|The block uses a {{bedplate}} {{featuring a}} perimeter wall with transverse webbings for durability and quiet operation at high engine speeds. The pistons {{are attached to}} fracture-split forged powdered metal connecting rods using semi-floating press-fit pins. A gerotor oil pump is driven directly from the crankshaft {{on the front of}} the engine. A <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> is used to drive the valvetrain. Early production 2.0 L engines used a hydraulic tensioner to tension the <b>timing</b> <b>belt.</b> 2000 and 2001 engines used a mechanical spring-loaded tensioner that tended to wear out prematurely, causing serious valve and piston damage upon belt failure due to the interference design of the engine. 2002+ engines utilized a different mechanical tensioner. The water pump is driven from the <b>timing</b> <b>belt,</b> with the water pump housing cast partially into the engine block itself.|$|R
