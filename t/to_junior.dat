5|$|After {{being sent}} back <b>to</b> <b>junior</b> from the Predators' {{training}} camp in September 2007, Blum was signed to an entry-level contract with Nashville on December 17, 2007.

One of the Giants' alternate captains along with forward Garet Hunt, he finished the season with career-highs of 18 goals and 63 points, finishing second among league defensemen (behind Ty Wishart's 67 points in 72 games). His offensive production also set a single-season franchise-record among Giants defensemen for goals (surpassed by Kevin Connauton in 2009–10) and points (surpassed by Brent Regner in 2008–09). At {{the end of the}} season, he was named to the WHL West Second All-Star Team, along with teammate Tyson Sexsmith.|$|E
5|$|Command, control, and {{coordination}} {{of the operation}} {{was going to be}} problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions. Lieutenant General Lê Nguyên Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General Lãm, who had the support of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority <b>to</b> <b>junior</b> officers rather than take orders from Lãm. This did not bode well for the success of the operation.|$|E

In the Second Polish Republic he was first a Zionist and later, a {{communist}} activist. He was arrested twice for his illegal activities. Conscripted in 1939, {{he served in the}} Polish Army (Polish 6th Infantry Division) during the Polish September Campaign that year. Taken prisoner by the Germans, he escaped, only to be taken prisoner by the Red Army, which invaded East Poland where his family lived and deported east along with hundred thousands of others. It was also in that period that, on 26 April 1943, he married Justyna Światło, taking her more Polish-sounding surname. He eventually joined the Polish Forces in the East (Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division, Berling's Army), becoming a political officer; he was also promoted <b>to</b> <b>junior</b> lieutenant (podporucznik) and became involved in organising state administration in areas taken from the Germans.|$|E

5|$|On 29 June 2005, Edler's major junior {{rights were}} {{obtained}} by the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League (WHL); he was chosen by Kelowna in the first round, 58th overall, of the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Import Draft. The Canucks encouraged Edler to move from Sweden to play junior in North America. After reporting to training camp with the Canucks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, in September 2005, he was assigned <b>to</b> <b>junior</b> with the Rockets. In his lone WHL season, Edler collected 13 goals and 53 points over 62 games in 2005–06, ranking fifth among WHL defencemen and fourth among total rookies in scoring.

5|$|Virginia Tech {{dominated}} {{the majority of}} the first half. In the first quarter, Virginia Tech's third-string kicker Justin Myer kicked a 37-yard field goal, which was the only scoring play of the quarter. Myer added a 43-yard field goal in the second quarter. At the end of the half, however, Denard Robinson threw a 45-yard touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>Junior</b> Hemingway to give Michigan a 7–6 lead and on the ensuing kickoff, Michigan's J.B. Fitzgerald forced a fumble, which Michigan recovered. Michigan's Brendan Gibbons kicked a 24-yard field goal as time expired. In the third quarter, Michigan scored another touchdown on a Denard Robinson <b>to</b> <b>Junior</b> Hemingway pass, this time from 18 yards out. This scoring drive followed an interception by linebacker Frank Clark. Virginia Tech responded with another Justin Myer field goal, this time from 36 yards away. In the fourth quarter, Virginia Tech's quarterback Logan Thomas trimmed Michigan's lead to two points, and then promptly tied the game throwing a successful two-point conversion to Marcus Davis. Michigan responded with a 39-yard Brendan Gibbons field goal, but Virginia Tech tied the game with two seconds remaining via a 25-yard field goal by Myer. In overtime, Virginia Tech seemingly scored the go-ahead touchdown on a Logan Thomas to Danny Coale pass, but video review overturned the play. The next play saw Myer miss a 37-yard field goal. Michigan received the ball and saw Gibbons kick the game-winning 37-yard field goal.|$|E
5|$|With the 1998–99 approaching, Malhotra {{had not yet}} {{signed an}} NHL {{contract}} with the Rangers by October.

The night before the deadline, Malhotra and the Rangers agreed to a three-year deal worth the rookie-maximum of $975,000 with performance-based incentives that could have increased his salary to $2 million. Making the immediate jump from junior to the NHL at the age of 18, he became the second player of Indian heritage to play in the NHL. Malhotra recorded eight goals and 16 points over 73 games as a rookie.|$|E

5|$|A top {{prospect}} for the 1991 NHL Entry Draft, Niedermayer was {{selected in the}} first round, third overall, by the New Jersey Devils. He began the 1991–92 season with New Jersey as the team wanted him to experience the NHL before being returned to Kamloops. After sitting out the Devils first five games, Niedermayer made his NHL debut on October 16, 1991, against the New York Rangers. He appeared in four games with the Devils, recording one assist, before he was sent back <b>to</b> <b>junior.</b> Though he appeared in only 35 games in the 1991–92 WHL season, Niedermayer's 39 points were enough to earn him a second berth on the West All-Star Team. After losing in the Western Conference Final the previous season, the Blazers rebounded to win their second WHL championship in three years in 1992. Niedermayer tied for third place in playoff scoring with 23 points. At the 1992 Memorial Cup, he scored seven points in five games to lead the Blazers to the national championship. He was voted {{the recipient of the}} Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player of the Memorial Cup.|$|E
5|$|Joining the Blue Jackets' {{training}} camp {{for a second}} year, Johansen made the opening line-up for the 2011–12 season. He made his NHL debut on October 7, 2011, registering 8 minutes and 46 seconds of ice time in a 3–2 loss to the Nashville Predators. He registered his first NHL point, an assist on a Kris Russell goal, in a 4–3 loss to the Ottawa Senators on October 22. Three days later, he scored his first NHL goal against Ty Conklin of the Detroit Red Wings. Banking the puck off of Conklin's skate from behind the goal line, the milestone came on the power play and was the game-winner. He also added an assist to help Columbus to their first win of the season, a 4–1 victory. After playing in his ninth game of the season, having recorded two goals and two assists in that span, Johansen was notified by Blue Jackets head coach Scott Arniel that he would remain with the team and not be returned <b>to</b> <b>junior.</b>|$|E

Demarlo Willis tied the game at 28–28 with his second touchdown on a 4-yard run at the 6:55 mark of the third quarter. Michigan once again took the lead {{less than a minute}} later with a 56-yard touchdown run by Vincent Smith. The score remained 35–28 until the closing minutes as the defensive units held the offenses without a score for more than 20 minutes. Late in the fourth quarter, Chappell led Indiana on a six-minute, 80-yard drive. On fourth down with 1:20 remaining in the game, Chappell completed a 19-yard touchdown to Darius Willis to tie the game at 35–35. The Wolverines got the ball back at their own 27-yard line with 1:15 remaining in the game. Robinson carried the ball three times to take the ball to the Indiana 46-yard line and then completed a 42-yard pass to Hemingway who was tackled at the Indiana 4-yard line. Robinson ran the ball into the endzone for the winning touchdown with 17 seconds left in the game. It was Michigan's 17th consecutive win against Indiana, dating back to 1987. The victory also gave Michigan its first 5–0 start since the 2006 season.|$|E
