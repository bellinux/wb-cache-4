5|$|In Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had {{recently}} been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed {{by the actions of}} the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he {{sent a letter to the}} colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the letter. The house refused to comply.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court {{ordered the}} appeals court to reconsider its {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the death penalty, with the same three-judge panel convening in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear oral argument. On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence {{on the grounds that}} the jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E

He {{was the first}} pope since the ninth century to visit the East, {{labeling}} the Eastern Churches as sister Churches. He {{was also the first}} pope in centuries to meet the heads of various Eastern Orthodox faiths. Notably, his meeting with Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I in 1964 in Jerusalem led <b>to</b> <b>rescinding</b> the excommunications of the Great Schism, which took place in 1054.|$|R
50|$|Finally on the 30 December 2010 {{he signed}} for Club Atletico Independiente {{arriving}} on loan {{for one year}} without purchase option. After 6 months full of individual glory, despite multiple injuries which did not allow him to play many minutes, Independiente decided <b>to</b> <b>rescinded</b> his loan 6 months ahead of schedule, if any club was interested. Colo-Colo was interested in hiring, but negotiations then cooled since Defederico once again came in the plans of Independiente coach Antonio Mohamed {{for the second half}} of the season.|$|R
5|$|Congressional {{candidate}} and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch)—whose campaign platform includes {{the elimination of}} funding for school arts programs—editorializes on television <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> {{the budget of the}} school's production of West Side Story. She succeeds after an angry mother throws a brick at Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba). Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) recruits the members to sell advertising space in the program book to raise money; when Kurt (Chris Colfer) asks his father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) to purchase an ad, he instead gathers a group of businessmen to fund the musical. He then announces that he is running for congress against Sue.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 1996, Apple {{developed}} a marketing strategy that promised free and unlimited live-telephone support on certain products {{for as long}} as the original purchaser owned those products; by 1997, however, changes in Apple's AppleCare support policy led Apple <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the offer, resulting in a consumer class action lawsuit for breach of contract. Apple denied wrongdoing but, in settlement of the claims, Apple ultimately reinstated the telephone support for the duration of original ownership of the otherwise obsolete products and customers affected by the change were given a limited reimbursement if they had been refused telephone support, had been charged per incident, or had incurred third party support charges.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was furious}} over {{the failure to}} destroy the convoy, and ordered that all {{remaining}} German major warships be broken up for scrap. In protest, Raeder resigned; Hitler replaced him with Admiral Karl Dönitz, who persuaded Hitler <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the order to dismantle the Kriegsmarine's surface ships. In March, Lützow moved to Altafjord, where she experienced problems with her diesel engines. The propulsion system proved to be so problematic that repairs in Germany were necessary. She briefly returned to Norway, {{but by the end}} of September 1943, a thorough overhaul was required. The work was completed in Kiel by January 1944, after which she remained in the Baltic Sea to conduct training cruises for new naval personnel.|$|E
50|$|Athenagoras's {{meeting with}} Pope Paul VI in 1964 in Jerusalem led <b>to</b> <b>rescinding</b> the excommunications of 1054 which {{historically}} mark the Great Schism, the schism between the churches of the East and West. This {{was a significant}} step towards restoring communion between Rome and Constantinople and the other patriarchates of Orthodoxy. It produced the Catholic-Orthodox Joint Declaration of 1965, which was read out on December 7, 1965, simultaneously at a public meeting of the Second Vatican Council in Rome and at a special ceremony in Constantinople.|$|R

5|$|In {{months prior}} to the settlement, Seattle {{publicly}} released email conversations that took place within Bennett's ownership group alleging they indicated that some members of the group had a desire to move the team to Oklahoma City prior to its purchase in 2006. The city used these conversations to argue that ownership failed to negotiate in good faith and as a result, Schultz filed a lawsuit seeking <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the sale of the team and transfer the ownership to a court-appointed receiver. The NBA claimed the lawsuit was void because Schultz signed a release forbidding himself to sue Bennett's group but also argued that the proposal would have violated league ownership rules. Schultz dropped the case {{before the start of the}} 2008–09 NBA season.|$|E
5|$|Becket excommunicated both de Brocs {{again on}} Christmas Day, 1170. On 28 December 1170, de Broc {{received}} at Saltwood Castle four knights– William de Tracy, Reginald fitzUrse, Hugh de Morville, and Richard le Breton– {{who had arrived}} from the continent. The five men conceived a plan to surround Canterbury Cathedral and force Becket <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> his excommunications. On 29 December 1170, the five men arrived at Canterbury, where it appears that de Broc {{was in charge of}} the soldiers surrounding the cathedral while the other four went inside to negotiate with the archbishop. The four did not succeed in persuading the archbishop and the situation degenerated into the four men murdering Becket at one of the altars of the cathedral. After this, the four rejoined de Broc and searched the archiepiscopal residence for papers and other documents that de Broc was to send to the king. The party then returned to Saltwood.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the new Constitution, the 2009 general election was called. The opposition sought to delay the election by demanding a new biometric registry system, hoping that it would give them time to form a united front against MAS. Many MAS activists reacted violently against the demands, and attempting to prevent this. Morales went on a five-day hunger strike in April 2009 to push the opposition <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> their demands. He also agreed to allow for the introduction of a new voter registry, but insisted that it was rushed through so as not to delay the election. Morales and the MAS won with a landslide majority, polling 64.2%, while voter participation had reached an all-time high of 90%. His primary opponent, Reyes Villa, gained 27% of the vote. The MAS won a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Morales notably increased his support in the east of the country, with MAS gaining a majority in Tarija.|$|E

5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Walker's Chief of Staff, Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), whom Frank {{recommended}} for the job. She reveals {{that she and}} Walker have decided <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> their promise to nominate him as Secretary of State because {{they want him to}} remain in Congress and use his political expertise to get the President-elect’s education reform agenda passed. Frank is initially incensed, but when Linda asks if he will continue to be an ally to the future President he says that he will. Linda reveals that Senator Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner) has been chosen for the position instead. Despite his statement to the contrary, Frank feels personally betrayed and, with Claire’s encouragement, begins to formulate a plot for revenge, which he shares with his Chief of Staff, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Mrs. Underwood, meanwhile, is forced to downsize the non-profit organization she manages, the Clean Water Initiative, which had been promised a large donation upon her husband’s confirmation as Secretary, without which the organization is forced to substantially curtail its budget.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority {{raised the}} {{toll on the}} Southern State Parkway from to 25cents, while the Loop Parkway {{retained}} its 25cent toll. The change faced immediate criticism from the New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in {{a deal with the}} State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
5|$|This decade also {{witnessed}} {{the emergence of}} a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, Transcendental Meditation, Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in Big Sur, California. It was from Esalen and other similar personal growth centers which had developed links to humanistic psychology that the human potential movement emerged, which would also come to exert a strong influence on the New Age.|$|E

Louisiana law distinguished between [...] "white", [...] "black" [...] and [...] "colored" [...] (that is, people of mixed European and African ancestry). The law had already specified that blacks could not ride with white people, but colored people could ride with whites before 1890. A group of concerned black, colored and white citizens in New Orleans formed an association dedicated <b>to</b> <b>rescinding</b> the law.

5|$|By June, four of {{the seven}} Watch Tower Society directors—Robert H. Hirsh, Alfred I. Ritchie, Isaac F. Hoskins and James D. Wright— had decided they had erred in {{endorsing}} Rutherford's expanded powers of management, claiming Rutherford had become autocratic. In June, Hirsch attempted <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the new by-laws and reclaim the board's authority from the president. Rutherford later claimed he had by then detected a conspiracy among the directors to seize control of the society. In July, Rutherford gained a legal opinion from a Philadelphia corporation lawyer that none of his opposers were legally directors of the society. The Watch Tower Society's official 1959 account of its history claimed the legal advice given to the ousted directors confirmed that given to Rutherford; however, the pamphlets produced by the expelled board members at the time indicated that their legal advice, acquired from several attorneys, disagreed with Rutherford's. On July 12, Rutherford filled what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, J. A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as directors. Between August and November the society and the four ousted directors published a series of pamphlets, with each side accusing the other of ambitious and reckless behavior. The former directors also claimed Rutherford had required all headquarters workers to sign a petition supporting him and threatened dismissal for any who refused to sign. The former directors left the Brooklyn headquarters on August 8. On January 5, 1918, shareholders returned Rutherford to office.|$|E
5|$|During a {{brainstorm}} session, Michael, Jim, and Dwight {{decide to}} set up a sting operation to observe Danny's sales techniques. They set up Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) as the CEO of the fictional company Solartech in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him. Dwight and Jim send in Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) to save the sting. When Meredith strong-arms both of them, Michael rushes in to call the whole thing off. Danny becomes infuriated and walks off. Michael catches up to him and offers him a job, pointing out that with Sabre's better pricing, he could make more sales as a traveling salesman for them. He accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff act disrespectful towards him, worrying that Danny will take their clients. Michael tells them how well sales numbers will go up with Danny {{as a part of the}} branch, and that he is not going <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> Danny's job offer just because it makes the other salespeople uncomfortable. Before Dwight leaves for the day, he viciously insults Danny about his alleged mistreatment of Pam and client-stealing past, then immediately welcomes him to the company.|$|E
5|$|In October 1200 Geoffrey {{refused to}} allow the {{collection}} of carucage, a tax on land, on his property, and his lands were confiscated in retaliation. He then excommunicated the new sheriff of Yorkshire, James of Poterne, who had ravaged Geoffrey's lands in revenge. In November 1200, Geoffrey and John were reconciled at Hugh of Lincoln's funeral, which allowed Geoffrey to regain his confiscated estates, but the archbishop's continued refusal to allow the collection of carucage led to the truce falling apart. In January 1201, John made peace with his half brother, {{but it did not}} last, as Geoffrey continued to refuse to allow the tax to be collected. John then renewed the demand for the payment for the office of sheriff due from Richard's reign, which forced Geoffrey <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> his excommunication and offer another payment in return for peace, which occurred in May 1201. But it was short-lived; disputes over the appointments in the diocese of York broke out, but with the support of Pope Innocent Geoffrey was able to secure the appointment of a few of his own candidates. Geoffrey also quarrelled with some of the monasteries in his diocese, with the usual claims and counterclaims going to the papacy for judgement. Among the religious houses Geoffrey had disagreements with were Guisborough Priory, Meaux Abbey, and Fountains Abbey. Most of these conflicts arose from disputed appointments to offices, but the quarrel with Meaux involved claims of tithe exemption by that house.|$|E

5|$|Under the Peerage Act 1963, all Scottish peers {{procured}} {{the right}} {{to sit in the}} House of Lords, and the system of electing representative peers was abolished. Scottish as well as British and English hereditary peers lost their automatic right to sit in the Upper House {{with the passage of the}} House of Lords Act 1999. During the debate on the House of Lords Bill, a question arose as to whether the proposal would violate the Treaty of Union. In suggesting that the Bill did indeed violate the Articles of Union, it was submitted that, prior to Union, the Estates of Parliament, Scotland's old, pre-Union parliament, was entitled to impose conditions, and that one fundamental condition was a guarantee of representation of Scotland in both Houses of Parliament at Westminster. It was implied, furthermore, that the Peerage Act of 1963 did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in the Article XXII of the Treaty of Union, by allowing all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld. It was further argued that the only way <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the requirement of Article XXII would be to dissolve the Union between England and Scotland, which the House of Lords Bill did not seek to do.|$|E
