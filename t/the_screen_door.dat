5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E
25|$|A {{screen door}} {{can refer to}} a hinged storm door (cold climates) or hinged screen door (warm climates) {{covering}} an exterior door; or a screened sliding door used with sliding glass doors. In any case, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> incorporates screen mesh to block flying insects from entering and pets and small children from exiting interior spaces, while allowing for air, light, and views. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> was invented in 1887 by Hannah Harger.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found {{at the scene of}} the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door.</b> Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation in her mouth and throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} of the {{above-ground}} stations built in the past along the East West Line, it was built without platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> that prevent commuters from falling onto the train tracks. Installation of <b>the</b> half-height <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> started on 20 June 2011 as the last station of the East West Line. On 31 August 2011, all of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> have been installed and began operating, marking the completion of the installation of all <b>the</b> Platform <b>Screen</b> <b>Doors</b> along <b>the</b> East West Line. However, on 1 February 2014, an elderly man was hit by a train and treated in hospital for multiple injuries - it is believed he gained access to the track by climbing over <b>the</b> platform <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> and therefore <b>the</b> half-height Platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors</b> may need upgrading it to full-height platform <b>screen</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R

500|$|In the {{south-west}} {{corner of}} the nave is a choir vestry, which was originally built as a baptistery. Its screen is made of carved oak, formed in 1883 {{from one part of}} the Fleetwood family box pew that was originally situated in the chancel where the choir stalls now sit. In 1883, this pew had been described as [...] "looking like a cross between a railway carriage and the centre piece of a gondola". The wood is carved with emblems of the family including a double-headed eagle, wheat sheaves and a griffin. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> comes from the box pew of another prominent local familyâ€”the Rigbys of Layton. It has a carving of a goat's head and is inscribed with [...] "AR 1636".|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{had married}} Sara Lownds in November 1965. By {{the time the}} {{basement}} sessions started in Big Pink around June 1967, he had two children: Maria (Sara's daughter from her first marriage) and Jesse Dylan. Anna Dylan was born on July 11, 1967. Both Heylin and biographer Sid Griffin suggest that recording had to move from Dylan's home to Big Pink {{when it became clear}} that the sessions were getting in the way of family life. Domesticity was the context of The Basement Tapes, as Hudson said in The Last Waltz: [...] "Chopping wood and hitting your thumb with a hammer, fixing the tape recorder or <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door,</b> wandering off into the woods with Hamlet ... it was relaxed and low-key, which was something we hadn't enjoyed since we were children." [...] Several Basement Tapes songs, such as [...] "Clothes Line Saga" [...] and [...] "Apple Suckling Tree", celebrate the domestic aspects of the rural lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|The film {{opens with}} an inter-title that reads [...] "Poor little rich girl has {{no one to}} play with" [...] and cuts to Baby Helen with her doll, looking out the window. A group of {{children}} play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party {{set up on the}} yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door,</b> barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E

2500|$|On August 11, 1972, Wanrow's son {{complained to}} Hooper {{that while he}} was at play in the {{neighborhood}} with Hooper's eldest daughter, a man later identified as William Wesler lured them into his house and locked <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> behind them. [...] The children saw a knife on the counter nearby and fled. [...] Wesler grabbed Wanrow's son and tried to drag him back into the house, but he managed to break free and run to safety. [...] Shortly after the boy made Wesler's actions known, Hooper called the police, who went to her home. [...] The accused arrived at the house, saying, [...] "I didn't touch the kid, I didn't touch the kid." [...] At that point, Hooper's daughter identified him as the man who had molested her the previous June. [...] Wesler left the premises, and the police told Hooper they could not arrest him [...] "until Monday morning", after she filed a formal complaint.|$|E

60|$|I knew {{it because}} I {{went in to}} see Jeff in his house one night. The house,--I think I said it,--stood out behind the barber shop.

You could see the light of the lamp behind the blind, and through <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door</b> as you came along.

60|$|Carley {{directed}} stumbling {{steps toward}} the light of her tent. Her eyes had not been used to such black shadow along the ground. She had, too, squeamish feminine fears of hydrophobia skunks, and nameless animals or reptiles that were imagined denizens of the darkness. She gained her tent and entered. The Mexican, Gino, as he called himself, had lighted her lamp and fire. Carley was chilled through, and the tent felt so warm and cozy that she could scarcely believe it. She fastened <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door,</b> laced the flaps across it, except at the top, and then gave herself up to the lulling and comforting heat.|$|E
60|$|If {{we listen}} to the still, small voice of realism, intense longing is always {{followed}} by disappointment. Nothing should have happened that summer, and Providence should not have come disguised as the postman. It was a sultry day in early September-which {{is to say that}} it was comparatively cool--a blue day, with occasional great drops of rain spattering on the brick walk. And Honora was reclining on the hall sofa, reading about Mr. Ibbetson and his duchess, when she perceived the postman's grey uniform and smiling face on the far side of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door.</b> He greeted her cordially, and gave her a single letter for Aunt Mary, and she carried it unsuspectingly upstairs.|$|E
6000|$|The {{windows of}} the deserted house stared at him; a {{splintered}} screen door banged in every breeze. Lichens leered from the cracks of the porch. The yard {{was filled with a}} litter of cottonwood twigs, and over the flower garden hulked ragged weeds. In the rank grass about the slimy green lip of the well, crickets piped derisively. The barn-door was open. Stray kernels of wheat had sprouted between the spokes of a rusty binder-wheel. A rat slipped across the edge of the shattered manger. As dusk came on, gray things seemed to slither past the upper {{windows of the}} house, and somewhere, under the roof, there was a moaning. Milt was sure that it was the wind in a knothole. He told himself that he was absolutely sure about it. And every time it came he stroked Vere de Vere carefully, and once, when the moaning ended in the slamming of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>door,</b> he said, [...] "Jiminy!" ...|$|E
