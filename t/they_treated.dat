5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. <b>They</b> <b>treated</b> him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E
5|$|Not all cyclists were {{competing}} for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was Henri Pépin. Pépin had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban, to ride with him. <b>They</b> <b>treated</b> the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending {{the night in the}} best hotels they could find. Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists {{in the history of the}} Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, Jean-Marie Teychenne, lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped Pépin.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of electronic {{computers in the}} 1940s, along {{with the development of}} mathematical information theory, led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems. This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics, and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience. The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that <b>they</b> <b>treated</b> the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in John von Neumann's 1958 book, The Computer and the Brain. Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.|$|E

5|$|The {{last time}} Riefenstahl saw Hitler {{was when she}} married Peter Jacob on 21 March 1944. Riefenstahl and Jacob {{divorced}} in 1946. As Germany's military situation became impossible by early 1945, Riefenstahl left Berlin and was hitchhiking {{with a group of}} men, trying to reach her mother, when she was taken into custody by American troops. She walked out of a holding camp, beginning a series of escapes and arrests across the chaotic landscape. At last making it back home on a bicycle, she found that American troops had seized her house. She was surprised by how kindly <b>they</b> <b>treated</b> her.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{provides}} {{lead poisoning}} treatment for California condors from the Grand Canyon area. These birds {{are one of}} the most endangered species on the planet, having at one time been reduced to 22 individuals in the wild. In February 2006, <b>they</b> <b>treated</b> a female (#149) who had been released in the 1990s and her son (#304) who survived a very rare birth in the wild. Both birds were captured in the Grand Canyon region and brought back to the zoo to be treated. A California condor (#133) was still being treated for lead poisoning at the zoo as of March 2010.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a glassy material known as faience, which <b>they</b> <b>treated</b> {{as a type of}} artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.|$|E

5|$|Roberts' riding {{style in}} which he forced the motorcycle's rear wheel to break {{traction}} to steer around a corner, essentially riding on paved surfaces {{as if they were}} dirt tracks, changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. From 1983 to 1999, every 500cc world championship was won by a rider with a dirt track racing background. Roberts' cornering method of hanging off the motorcycles with his knee extended forced him to use duct tape as knee pads, and eventually led to the introduction of purpose-built knee pucks used by all motorcycle road racers today. His battles with the Grand Prix establishment eventually led to the adoption of stricter safety standards for Grand Prix race organizers. He {{was one of the first}} riders to challenge the FIM over the way <b>they</b> <b>treated</b> competitors and helped improve prize money as well as the professionalism of the sport. It was not until Roberts planned his rival race series in 1980 that the FIM was forced to change the way in which they dealt with motorcycle racers.|$|E

Sometimes the Malaysian rail-babbler and blue-capped ifrit (Ifrita kowaldi) were {{also included in the}} family. In 1985, Sibley and Ahlquist found that the logrunners were not related to the others and included only the logrunners in the Orthonychidae. <b>They</b> <b>treated</b> the others as the subfamily Cinclosomatinae within their expanded family Corvidae.|$|E

25|$|The Ancient Greeks {{developed}} astronomy, which <b>they</b> <b>treated</b> as {{a branch}} of mathematics, to a highly sophisticated level. The first geometrical, three-dimensional models to explain the apparent motion of the planets were developed in the 4th century BC by Eudoxus of Cnidus and Callippus of Cyzicus. Their models were based on nested homocentric spheres centered upon the Earth. Their younger contemporary Heraclides Ponticus proposed that the Earth rotates around its axis.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s, both Bentham and Hooker (1883) and Boissier (1884) {{independently}} simplified this {{by reducing}} nine of these subgenera to five, which <b>they</b> <b>treated</b> as sections rather than subgenera. Bentham and Hooker, who recognized more than 50 species, transferred the tenth of Baker’s subgenera, Notholirion to Lilium. Boissier, by contrast, in his {{detailed account of}} oriental species, recognized Notholirion as a separate genus, whose status has been maintained since (see cladogram). He also divided Eufritillaria into subsections.|$|E
25|$|The overall Marxist {{criticism}} of the neo-Ricardian socialists was that <b>they</b> <b>treated</b> Marx {{as if he was}} a Sraffian. But, they claimed, Marx wasn't a Sraffian, because Marx's concepts were quite different. The Sraffians believed that if Marx's theory cannot be restated in a mathematically consistent and measurable way, it has no scientific validity. Since Marxists allegedly failed to formalize Marx's theory in a convincing way, the Sraffians dropped it, although they might still have socialist sympathies.|$|E
