40|$|Objective Schistosomiasis {{is known}} to occur in preschool-aged children, but {{achieving}} accurate dosing of praziquantel {{in its current form}} is challenging. While waiting for a paediatric formulation, {{there is a need to}} develop a means for using the available products to treat this age group. Current 600 -mg tablets are differently scored to give units of 150 mg (a quarter of a tablet) or 300 mg (half a tablet). Methods We examined several dosing schemes to dose accurately (40 - 60 mg/kg) children aged 3 – 72 months (weight range 4 – 25 kg, based on available weight-for-age growth references from sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil, n = 106, 230). Results Adequate dosing can be achieved with formulations that can be split into four 150 mg quarters for children weighing 5 kg or more, and with tablets than can be split into two 300 mg halves for children weighing 10 kg or more. Giving ½ <b>tablet</b> <b>for</b> 5 – 7 kg; ¾ <b>tablet</b> <b>for</b> 8 – 10 kg; 1 <b>tablet</b> <b>for</b> 11 – 15 kg; 1 ½ <b>tablet</b> <b>for</b> 16 – 21 kg; and two <b>tablets</b> <b>for</b> 22 – 25 kg will have 100...|$|R
