500|$|In {{the sports}} game Solipskier, the player draws {{the ground for}} the {{on-screen}} skier to pass through a level filled with gates, tunnels, and walls. Drawing an incline, for example, will launch the skier into the air to perform tricks, and a downhill section will accelerate the skier. Upcoming obstacles are indicated {{at the right of}} the screen along with the necessary altitude and distance. A streak of successful passes through gates will accrue a bonus score. The skier's speed also increases with time. As an endless runner (compared to Canabalt), the characters advance until they die, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>end.</b> If the skier travels fast enough, he loses his headphones, which cuts out the background music {{to the sound of the}} wind passing by. The player receives [...] "All Star Dunk Contest-like scorecards" [...] after landing big jumps. Solipskier also has an online leaderboard, and offers tips for new players to improve their scores. It focuses on style and emotion from the player-character's terminal speed rather than on jumps and tricks. It also has a hard rock guitar soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|Opening track [...] "The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)" [...] pays {{tribute to}} Joey Ramone, the Ramones' lead singer who was {{particularly}} influential on Bono. During their teenage years, U2 snuck into a Ramones concert, {{and the experience of}} watching Joey perform made Bono feel less self-conscious about his own singing. [...] "Every Breaking Wave" [...] is about the difficulty of [...] "giv yourself completely to another person", with lyrical characters who are [...] "addicted to sort of failure and rebirth". [...] "California (<b>There</b> <b>Is</b> <b>No</b> <b>End</b> to Love)" [...] recalls the group's first visit to Los Angeles and how the city contrasted with their native Dublin. [...] "Song for Someone" [...] is a love song Bono wrote for his wife Ali Hewson, who he met when they were teenagers. [...] "Iris (Hold Me Close)" [...] is written about Bono's mother, Iris, who died after suffering a cerebral aneurysm at her father's funeral when Bono was 14 years old. The lyrics liken her influence over her son to a star that died long ago but whose light is still reaching earth. Bono rewrote the song's lyrics after reading a letter that journalist James Foley wrote in captivity to his family prior to his being killed by ISIS; the letters made Bono realize that [...] "we will all be remembered by the least-profound moments. The simplest moments." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2010 Jack P. Shepherd, {{who plays}} fellow {{character}} David Platt, revealed {{his desire for}} more scenes with Lane as he thought that they worked well together. In January2011 {{it was announced that}} Kylie would marry David in a [...] "shock storyline". Revealing the news whilst interviewed on talk show Loose Women, Lane said that the pair would meet off-screen in Tenerife. Though she had not read the scripts, Lane thought they would be [...] "a really good combination". Coronation Street publicity said it would make [...] "exciting viewing" [...] for fans. They further stated: [...] "Kylie and David are trouble as individuals so the thought {{of the two of them}} getting together is a nightmare prospect for both their families [...] <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> to the trouble they will cause for everyone." [...] Lane also revealed that the storyline was implemented because there was no other plausible way for Kylie to return. They did not carry on with the scenario with Becky and Steve, because the viewers needed [...] "something new". Lane was happy with the direction of the storyline because it paved the way for more [...] "explosive" [...] material. Kylie was also tipped to be the one in control of the relationship. She also acknowledged that certain aspects of their relationship would mirror Becky and Steve's relationship, in the sense that when Kylie is with David, a [...] "loved up" [...] nicer side to Kylie surfaces.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to other women's war fiction of the period, Manning's works do not recount {{life on the}} home front. Instead, her Irish and Second World War fiction observe combatants and non-combatants at the front and behind the lines. Wars, in Manning's view, are battles for place and influence, and [...] "with her range of images and illusions, Manning reminds us that wars over land have been a constant." [...] Her books do not celebrate British heroism nor the innocence of civilians, emphasising instead that the causes and dangers of war come as much from within as from without, with the gravest threats coming from fellow Britons. Military men are far from heroic, and official British responses are presented as farcical. In the Fortunes of War, the conflict is viewed largely {{from the perspective of}} a civilian woman, an observer, though later books include Simon Boulderstone's soldier's view of battle. Views differ on her success in the Fortunes of War battlescenes; initial reviews by Auberon Waugh and Hugh Massie criticised them as implausible and not fully realised, but later commentators have describing her depiction of battle as vivid, poignant and largely convincing. Her books serve as an indictment of war and its horrors; William Gerhardie noted in 1954 of Artist among the Missing that [...] "it is war seen in a compass so narrowed down that the lens scorches and all but ignites the paper." [...] There is a strong focus of the impermanence of life; death and mortality are a constant presence and preoccupation for civilian and soldier alike, and repetition – of stories, events and deaths – used to give [...] "the impression of lives trapped in an endless war" [...] for which <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight.|$|E
