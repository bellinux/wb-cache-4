5|$|A {{council is}} held in <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> The Horseman {{seemingly}} kills Katrina's stepmother, Lady Van Tassel, and heads off to <b>the</b> <b>church</b> to get Baltus. Crane realizes the Horseman can't enter <b>the</b> <b>church</b> due to it being holy ground. A fight breaks out between the village elders in <b>the</b> <b>church</b> resulting {{in the deaths of}} Reverend Steenwyck and Doctor Lancaster, only ending when the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out and acquiring his head. The next day, Crane believes Katrina {{to be the one who}} controls the Headless Horsemen.|$|E
5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced its way into <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left <b>the</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> has no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> which left the maintaining of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E

5|$|Divorce was legalized by a {{law passed}} in 1987. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> opposed it, {{but it had}} huge popular support that {{included}} even Catholic factions, who reasoned that marital separation already existed, and divorce simply made it explicit. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> opposed Alfonsín after that point. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> successfully exerted pressure to prevent the abolition of religious education.

5|$|Maeser's primary {{responsibility}} was {{to head the}} Utah exhibit at the Mid-winter Fair in San Francisco in 1894, while he was serving as Superintendent of Church Schools.

In the San Francisco exhibit, Maeser chose {{to focus more on}} beliefs of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> and educational accomplishments of students in <b>the</b> <b>church</b> school systems. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> had an exhibit in the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building, and Maeser gave a series of lectures to bring more publicity to <b>the</b> <b>church</b> school exhibit.

5|$|Sale is {{a diverse}} {{community}} with a synagogue and Christian churches of various denominations. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> buildings were mostly constructed in the late 19th or early 20th century {{in the wake of}} the population boom created by the arrival of the railway in 1849, although records show that <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of St Martin in Ashton upon Mersey dates back to at least 1304. Before the English Reformation, the inhabitants of Sale were predominantly Catholic, but afterwards were members of <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of England. Roman Catholics returned to the area in the 19th century in the form of Irish immigrants. Two of the three Grade II* listed buildings in the town are churches. <b>The</b> <b>Church</b> of St Martin, which was probably originally an early 14th-century timber framed structure, was rebuilt in 1714 after <b>the</b> <b>church</b> had been destroyed in a storm. <b>The</b> <b>Church</b> of St John the Divine was built in 1868, to the design of Alfred Waterhouse.

It was recorded that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was built as a gift by Duncan, Earl of Fife. Alexander Kyninmund, Bishop of Aberdeen, rebuilt <b>the</b> <b>church</b> some time in the mid 14th century.
