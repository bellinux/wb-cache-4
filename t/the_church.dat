5|$|A {{council is}} held in <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> The Horseman {{seemingly}} kills Katrina's stepmother, Lady Van Tassel, and heads off to <b>the</b> <b>church</b> to get Baltus. Crane realizes the Horseman can't enter <b>the</b> <b>church</b> due to it being holy ground. A fight breaks out between the village elders in <b>the</b> <b>church</b> resulting {{in the deaths of}} Reverend Steenwyck and Doctor Lancaster, only ending when the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out and acquiring his head. The next day, Crane believes Katrina {{to be the one who}} controls the Headless Horsemen.|$|E
5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced its way into <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left <b>the</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> has no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> which left the maintaining of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E

5|$|Divorce was legalized by a {{law passed}} in 1987. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> opposed it, {{but it had}} huge popular support that {{included}} even Catholic factions, who reasoned that marital separation already existed, and divorce simply made it explicit. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> opposed Alfons√≠n after that point. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> successfully exerted pressure to prevent the abolition of religious education.

5|$|Maeser's primary {{responsibility}} was {{to head the}} Utah exhibit at the Mid-winter Fair in San Francisco in 1894, while he was serving as Superintendent of Church Schools.

5|$|Sale is {{a diverse}} {{community}} with a synagogue and Christian churches of various denominations. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> buildings were mostly constructed in the late 19th or early 20th century {{in the wake of}} the population boom created by the arrival of the railway in 1849, although records show that <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of St Martin in Ashton upon Mersey dates back to at least 1304.

Roman Catholics returned to the area in the 19th century in the form of Irish immigrants. Two of the three Grade II* listed buildings in the town are churches. <b>The</b> <b>Church</b> of St Martin, which was probably originally an early 14th-century timber framed structure, was rebuilt in 1714 after <b>the</b> <b>church</b> had been destroyed in a storm. <b>The</b> <b>Church</b> of St John the Divine was built in 1868, to the design of Alfred Waterhouse.
