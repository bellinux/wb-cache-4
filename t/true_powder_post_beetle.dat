40|$|Interest {{is growing}} daily on the {{utilization}} of bamboo as a reliable supplement to wood in furniture production to mitigate the scarcity of wood raw material supply. This study explored the viability of recycling bamboo recovered from scaffold into intermediate raw material for indoor furniture production. Strips were processed from the recovered Bambusa vulgaris Schrad and were subjected to conventional treatment methods with some modification to simplify the treatment. The durability of the treated strip was evaluated in accordance with ASTM D 2017. A storage shelf was designed and fabricated using laminates made from the bamboo strips. The diameter and wall thickness of the recovered bamboo culms ranges from 6. 00 cm- 10. 00 cm and 10. 00 mm- 12. 70 mm respectively. The result shows that ordinary soaking of the strips in water for 3 weeks could make the strips to be sufficiently resistant to termite attack but fairly resistant to <b>powder</b> <b>post</b> <b>beetle.</b> Application of kerosene as a secondary treatment will make {{the resistance of the}} bamboo strip effective to <b>powder</b> <b>post</b> <b>beetle.</b> A Complete-Knock-Down (CDK) Magazine shelf suitable for office use was fabricated using road side carpentry workshop tools.

5000|$|Frass is an {{informal}} term and accordingly it is variously used and variously defined. It {{is derived from}} the German Fraß, a past participle verbal noun of fressen, which means to gobble or to feed as an animal might. The English usage derives the idea of excrement from what larvae had eaten, and similarly also, the refuse left behind by insects. Such usage dates back to the mid nineteenth century. In modern technical English sources differ on the precise definition, though there is little actual direct contradiction. One glossary from the early 20th century speaks of [...] "...excrement; usually the excreted pellets of caterpillars." [...] In some contexts frass refers primarily to fine, masticated material, often powdery, that phytophagous insects pass as indigestible waste after they have processed plant tissues as well as their physiology would permit. Other common examples include the fecal material that insects such as the larvae of codling moths leave as they feed inside fruit, or that the likes of Terastia meticulosalis leave as they bore in the pith of Erythrina twigs, or the larvae of Cerambycidae or <b>powder</b> <b>post</b> <b>beetles</b> leave inside or below their tunnels when boring in solid or rotting wood.|$|R

40|$|Hylotrupes bajulus, attacks {{softwood}} utilising the cellulose {{contained in}} wood walls as food. The fibre is digested in variable percentages, {{depending on the}} type of analysis, 20 to 48 % and, according to some authors, without the assistance of intestinal symbiotic microorganisms. Furthermore, there is published work referring to Hylotrupes, concluding that "starch” … “plays no role in the nutrition of the larvae". Nevertheless, considering that attacks of this species decrease with wood seasoning increasing and having been demonstrated, and that “lignin degradation products of spruce wood do not influence larvae development”, it is possible to suppose that cell walls alone are not sufficient to feed this wood boring species. Furthermore, Hylotrupes larvae have chisel shaped mandibles, similar to those of <b>powder</b> <b>post</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae that feed on starch and need to pulverise the wood to access the cellular content. Preliminary research suggests an utilization of wood fibre as well as of starch by larvae of H. bajulus.

Larvae of H. bajulus were grown on synthetic diets made of purified wood fibre and/or starch as main components supplied with mineral and vitamin.

A {{couple of days later}} the house is vented, aired and the air is sampled {{to make sure that the}} gas has dissipated. M e t h y l b r o m i d e (MeBr) is an odorless, col-orless gas, widely used both as a soil-sterilant and to control wood-infest-ing insects such as dry-wood termites, carpenter ants, and powderpost beetles. Recent evidence has shown that MeBr is a direct-acting carcinogen in the rat, where it causes stomach cancer. In hu-mans and animals, death results from pulmonary irritation and edema; non-lethal exposures can produce muscle weak-ness, abnormal reflexes, visual disorders, head-ache and malaise. Vikane (sulfuryl fluoride) is another highly toxic and odorless structural fumigant. Very li�le is known about the toxic effects of Vikane, and even the polyethylene sheeting commonly used to protect articles in the home during applica-tions is permeable to the chemical. Residues, consisting of inorganic fluoride, have been found on such soft household goods as rubber, feathers, rayon and wool as long as 40 days a�er fumigation. Still, these residues are not likely to be toxic. When used as a structural fumi-gant, MeBr and Vikane are mixed with another fumigant, chloropicrin, which serves as a warning agent to those handling either gas by irritating the eyes and nose. (Chloropicrin is also registered as a pesticide used to fumigant grain).

We demonstrate the ability to obtain both field-oriented (single-crystal like) spectra and <b>true</b> <b>powder</b> pattern HFEPR spectra of solid samples. The latter are obtained by immobilizing the powder, either in an n-eicosane mull or KBr pellet. We can also obtain frozen solution HFEPR spectra with good signal-to-noise, and yielding the expected <b>true</b> <b>powder</b> pattern. Frozen solution spectra are described for MnTPPCl in 2 : 3 (v/v) toluene/CH 2 Cl 2 solution and for MnCor in neat pyridine (py) solution. All of the HFEPR spectra have been fully analyzed using spectral simulation software and a complete set of spin Hamiltonian parameters has been determined for each complex in each medium. Both porphyrinic complexes (MnTPPCl and MnPcCl) are rigorously axial systems, with similar axial zero-field splitting (zfs) : D approximate to - 2. 3 cm(- 1), and g values quite close to 2. 00. In contrast, the corrole complex, MnCor, exhibits slightly larger magnitude, rhombic zfs: D approximate to - 2. 6 cm(- 1), approximate to 0. 015 cm - 1, also with g values quite close to 2. 00. These results are discussed in terms of the molecular structures of these complexes and their electronic structure. We propose that there is a significant mixing of the triplet (S = 1) excited state with the quintet (S = 2) ground state in Mn(l 11) complexes with porphyrinic ligands, which is even more pronounced for corroles.

40|$|Pomegranate peels {{were studied}} {{for the effect}} of gamma {{irradiation}} on microbial decontamination along with its effect on total phenolic content and in vitro antioxidant activity. Gamma irradiation was applied at various dose levels (5. 0, 10. 0, 15. 0 and 25. 0 kGy) on pomegranate peel powder. Both the values of total phenolic content and in vitro antioxi- dant activity were positively correlated and showed a significant increase (p < 0. 05) for 10. 0 kGy irradiated dose level immediately after irradiation and 60 days of post irradiation storage. At 5. 0 kGy and above dose level, gamma irradia- tion has reduced microbial count of pomegranate peel <b>powder</b> to nil. <b>Post</b> irradiation storage studies also showed that, the irradiated peel powder was microbiologically safe even after 90 days of storage period...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The use of {{biomaterials}} as fillers/reinforcing {{agents in}} thermoplastics /thermosets materials is increasing nowadays due to economic reasons and environmental awareness. This work {{was aimed at}} characterising the powdered palm kernel shell for use in composite materials formulation. Properties such as powder porosity, hydration capacity, moisture sorption, particle size distribution, bulk density, tapped density, powder flow, pH of powder dispersion as well as differential scanning calorimetry thermal (DSC), X-ray diffraction (X-RD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were evaluated. The following results were obtained; pH {{was found to be}} 4 ± 0. 0, average <b>true</b> density, <b>powder</b> porosity and hydration capacity were; 1. 58 ± 0. 07 g/cm 3, 6. 76 ± 0. 42 %, and 150. 08 ± 76. 91 %, respectively. The average values of the moisture content and moisture sorption were; 11. 16 ± 016 % and 2 ± 0. 54 %, respectively. The average angle of repose for the palm kernel shell (PKS) was found to be 34. 09 ± 4. 77 o. The scanning electron microscopy showed that PKS powder had spherical shape. Based on EDX analysis PKS has a high carbon content of about 63 wt %. The XRD pattern for the PKS powder showed that the PKS powder was more of amorphous material with small amount of micro crystalline materials. PKS is therefore suggested as filler to be used in polymer composite production. Index Term [...] palm kernel shell powder, physico-chemical properties, thermal characterizations...|$|R
