5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place. Those supporting the release argued that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> should be considered public records, that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> are necessary to complete the journalistic record, and that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> would prove bin Laden's death and therefore prevent conspiracy theories that bin Laden is still alive. Those in opposition to a release of <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> expressed concern that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|The book on Lappland was {{published}} in 1908, with eleven watercolors by Bauer. They were painted in Stockholm, almost 18 months after his visit, using <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> and sketches he had collected during his journey. Many of <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> resulted in other drawings and paintings. Most of these were romanticized versions of <b>the</b> <b>photos,</b> but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance of the goahtis, and {{the richness of the}} Sami garments and crafts. Details from the Sami culture, such as the bent knives, shoes, spears, pots and belts, became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer's trolls. Bauer's eye for detail and his numerous notes also made the material an ethnographic documentation of the era.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} printed {{pictures of}} Arsenal fans {{alleged to have}} been part of the violence.

Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence.
