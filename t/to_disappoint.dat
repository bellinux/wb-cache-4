5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the passage}} of the Bland–Allison Act in 1878, there had been little {{discussion}} of gold versus silver coinage. Silver had been hardly mentioned in the 1888 campaign, and Harrison's exact position on the issue was initially unclear, but his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary, William Windom, encouraged the free silver supporters. Silver supporters' numbers had grown in Congress with the addition of new Western states. The drop in agricultural prices, which made farmers' debts harder to pay, broadened their cause's appeal. Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but at its own value, not at a fixed ratio to gold. This served only <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> both factions. Windom suggested keeping the Bland–Allison system, but doubling the amount of silver allowed to be coined. The intrinsic value of the silver dollar had fallen to 72.3 cents, but Windom believed (though gold supporters doubted) that coining more silver would increase demand and raise its value. Harrison was willing to sign whatever bill would satisfy the largest group of people, as long as it did not make the currency unsound.|$|E
5|$|Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) {{learns that}} Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), {{the head of}} William McKinley High School's glee club has been fired for {{inappropriate}} sexual behavior toward student Hank Saunders (Ben Bledsoe). The school principal, Figgins (Iqbal Theba), gives Will permission {{to take over the}} club, and he plans to revitalize it, naming the group New Directions. The club consists of fame-hungry Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), diva Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), flamboyant countertenor Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), paraplegic electric guitar player Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and stuttering goth Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz). Will's efforts are derided by Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), head of the school's successful cheerleading team, the Cheerios, who soon plans to abolish the Glee club to restore her money funded towards the spoiled Cheerios. His wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) is also unsupportive, suggesting that Will become an accountant to increase their income and give up teaching. Rachel threatens to leave the club if Will cannot find a male vocalist with talent comparable to hers. When the school's football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) allows Will to try to recruit football team members, in return that he put a good word for Emma for him (because Ken likes her), he discovers that quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is secretly a talented singer. He plants marijuana in Finn's locker, and blackmails him into joining New Directions. Finn, determined not <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> his widowed mother, complies.|$|E

25|$|Finding the French escort to be {{substantially}} larger than anticipated, {{and that it}} was manoeuvring to intercept them, Forrest called his captains together for a conference aboard his ship. The three captains met on the quarterdeck of Augusta, whereupon Forrest stated 'Well, gentlemen, you see that they have come out to engage us.' Suckling replied 'I {{think it would be a}} pity <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> them', to which Langdon agreed. Forrest then closed the discussion by saying 'very well, go onboard your ships again', which Langdon and Suckling proceeded to do, the conference having lasted just half a minute.|$|E
25|$|The 2005–06 season {{started as}} the {{previous}} one had ended, with Defoe being preferred to partner Mido in Tottenham's strikeforce. However, Defoe's strike-rate continued <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> and Keane's persistence paid off in November when manager Martin Jol eventually gave Keane a chance to replace Defoe and stake his claim. By March, he had overtaken Mido as the top goalscorer at the club. Keane went on to finish the season with 16 league goals — making him the Premier League's joint fourth-highest goalscorer that season. He had also been made the vice-captain, taking the captaincy on occasions when Ledley King was not available. Keane {{was involved in a}} training ground fight with teammate Edgar Davids in December 2005, but the pair subsequently made up publicly and were seen encouraging each other on the pitch.|$|E

He was nominated by Delta State branch of Ohanaeze as their consensus candidate in a resolution reached at the palace of the Asagba of Asaba after the position was zoned to Anioma, one of the seven units that make up Ohanaeze Ndigbo. But in his acceptance speech, Uwechue expressed gratitude to all and called for unity among Igbo, which is said to possess the talent to and wealth it would take to take to address national issues, while also noting that the position given to him has created confidence that the Igbo from Delta State are accepted as brothers and sisters in Ohanaeze. Finally, he promised not <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> Anioma people as the race is for Anioma home and abroad.|$|E
25|$|When {{war with}} France forced British Government {{attention}} on Ireland {{as a possible}} place of French invasion, the Irish Volunteers, seen as a potential source of disaffection, were disbanded by Dublin Castle, and a reorganised Militia was created in 1793. Stewart enrolled as an officer, {{a matter of course}} for a young Protestant aristocrat, and served as Lieutenant Colonel under the command of his wife's uncle, Thomas Conolly. Between Stewart's attendance to his militia duties, his pursuit of cultural, family and political interests in London, two trips to the Continent (in 1791, when he visited revolutionary Paris, and 1792), and the courtship of his wife whom he married in 1794, his life during this period was not centred on the activities of the Irish House of Commons, where he was listened to with respect but where he was not yet an important player. He was also beginning <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> some of his more radical original supporters in his constituency. As the French Revolution grew more bloody and Ireland more rebellious, Stewart increasingly worried about Ireland's future if the threats from France succeeded in breaking Ireland's links to Britain. He became further inclined to support not only Pitt personally but the British Government, even when he did not approve of a specific line taken in Irish policy.|$|E

During the break, Vig met Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters in a party, and casually asked if he would drum on a Garbage track, [...] "Bad Boyfriend", as Vig had been frustrated with the song's existing drum track.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{visitors}} entertained at Heiligenberg were Prince Alexander's relations, the Russian imperial family, and his cousin, Prince Louis of Hesse. Influenced by his cousin's wife, Princess Alice, {{a daughter of}} Queen Victoria, and by Prince Alfred, another of Queen Victoria's children, Battenberg joined the Royal Navy on 3 October 1868 {{at the age of}} fourteen and thus became a naturalised British subject. He was admitted by the Board of Admiralty without the production of a medical certificate, which was contrary to the usual regulation. He had been found medically unfit [...] "on account of small, flat chest, slight lateral curvature of the spine and defective vision", but was allowed to join so as not <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> the Queen. He was entered as a naval cadet aboard HMS Victory, Nelson's old flagship, then used as a permanently moored receiving ship.|$|E

500|$|Washington's {{difficulty}} in discerning Howe's motives {{was due to}} the presence of a British army moving south from Quebec toward Fort Ticonderoga under the command of General John Burgoyne. [...] Howe's departure was in part prompted by the successful capture of the fort by Burgoyne in early July. [...] Although there had been an expectation on Burgoyne's part that Howe would support his campaign to gain control of the Hudson, Howe was <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> Burgoyne, with disastrous consequences to the British. [...] When Washington learned of the abandonment of Ticonderoga (which he had been told by General Anthony Wayne [...] "can never be carried, without much loss of blood"), he was shocked. [...] Concerned that Howe was heading up the Hudson, he ordered Arnold, along with Daniel Morgan and his corps of riflemen, north to assist General Gates with the defense of the Hudson.|$|E
500|$|Baggio was {{expected}} {{to be one of the}} stars of the 1994 World Cup, and after a disappointing start, he led his team to the final with three match winning performances in the knockout rounds. In a disappointing first match against Republic of Ireland at Giants Stadium, New Jersey, Italy were defeated 1–0. In the second match against Norway, he appeared more inspired. However, Italy goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off for handling the ball outside the area. Luca Marchegiani was brought in to replace him, and Arrigo Sacchi decided to take off Baggio in what produced an outcry amidst the fans. Baggio later stated that Sacchi was [...] "crazy". Italy won the match 1–0. Italy continued <b>to</b> <b>disappoint,</b> as their final group match ended in a 1–1 draw against Mexico, and he again failed to influence the result. The Italians finished third in their group, drawing much criticism from the press; Gianni Agnelli famously called Baggio [...] "un coniglio bagnato" [...] ("a wet rabbit"), referring to his despondent demeanour, hoping the jab would spur him on to score.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole and was produced by Lifehouse and Jude Cole at Ironworks Studio in Los Angeles.

It was about letting the tape machine roll and getting the music down spontaneously." [...] When asked about {{the message of the}} song, Wade said, [...] "I think the main message of this song, at least for me personally when I was writing the lyrics, is just how difficult it can be to be in a relationship. Sometimes, you do things <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> the other person. Letting someone down and trying to repair a relationship that you feel is kind of slipping through your hands a bit." [...] "Whatever It Takes" [...] was originally released with the band's fourth studio album, Who We Are, on June 18, 2007 and was officially solicited as a single to mainstream radio on November 13, 2007.|$|E
