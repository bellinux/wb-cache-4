25|$|The {{library was}} a major {{reference}} and research resource, but there were detractors. An editorial in The New York Times complained, “Popular it certainly is not, and, so greatly is it lacking in the essentials of a public library, that its stores might almost as well be under lock and key, for any access the masses of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> get thereto.” An article in The Sun of March 4, 1873, reported problems with the mutilation {{of some of the}} library's volumes. This was apparently done mostly for convenience: Instead of writing down extracts, readers cut out the sections with the information they needed.|$|E
25|$|Early British popular music, in {{the sense}} of {{commercial}} music enjoyed by <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>can</b> be seen to originate in the 16th and 17th centuries {{with the arrival of the}} broadside ballad as a result of the print revolution, which were sold cheaply and in great numbers until the 19th century. Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the 19th century, including the brass band, which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts. In the 1930s, the influence of American Jazz led to the creation of British dance bands, who provided a social and popular music that began to dominate social occasions and the radio airwaves.|$|E
25|$|European {{constitutional}}/absolute monarchies. Liechtenstein and Monaco are constitutional monarchies {{in which}} the Prince theoretically retains many powers of an absolute monarch. In reality, he is a figurehead who is expected not to use that power. For example, the 2003 Constitution referendum which gives the Prince of Liechtenstein the power to veto any law that the Landtag (parliament) proposes and the Landtag can veto any law that the Prince tries to pass. The Prince can hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee {{from his or her}} post. However, what makes him not an absolute monarch is that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> call for a referendum to end the monarchy's reign. When Crown Prince Alois threatened to veto a referendum to legalize abortion in 2011 (which didn't actually happen), voters were surprised because the Prince hasn't vetoed any law for over 3 decades. The Prince of Monaco has simpler powers but cannot hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post, but he can elect the minister of state, government council and judges. Both Albert II and Hans-Adam II are theoretically very powerful, but in practice even they have very limited power compared to the Islamic monarchs (see below). They also own huge tracts of land and are shareholders in many companies.|$|E

500|$|William Grimes, {{writing in}} the New York Times, {{described}} The Utility of Force as [...] "a closely argued, searching textbook on strategy and the efficient use of military power in the post-Cold War era". Grimes also {{described it as a}} [...] "difficult, challenging book", saying [...] "you can almost hear the pointer hit the blackboard as he works his way rigorously through each argument and sub-arguments A, B and C, before proceeding to the next step. At times the history lecture becomes a forced march over very familiar terrain, but patient readers will discover that there is indeed a final destination". In a second review for the New York Times in 2007, Niall Ferguson, a history professor at Harvard University, described The Utility of Force as an update of Clausewitz's On War [...] "for our times". Ferguson went on to criticise Smith for drawing too clear a distinction between [...] "war amongst the people" [...] and [...] "war between peoples", pointing out that in several conflicts there was no single, homogeneous [...] "people" [...] and that wars amongst <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> easily transform into wars between people, citing Bosnia as an example. Ferguson was underwhelmed by Smith's recommendations for the future—Smith believes that new equipment and strategies are required in order for armies to be effective in the new paradigm, but does not offer any suggestions. Ferguson's final criticism was what he described as the book's [...] "limited historical perspective"; Smith argues that [...] "war amongst the people" [...] emerged {{in the second half of}} the 20th century during the proxy wars and de-colonisation campaigns of the Cold War era, but Ferguson gave examples of similar campaigns which pre-dated the Cold War, including the First Boer War (1880–81) and campaigns fought in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. Nonetheless, Ferguson concludes that The Utility of Force is [...] "an impressive and absorbing work", and described Smith as [...] "the Clausewitz of low-intensity conflict and peacekeeping operations".|$|E

2500|$|Without {{requiring}} {{priests to}} face the people throughout the Mass, the Roman Missal calls for the facing-the-people orientation to be made possible. The 2002 edition of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 299 says, in the official English translation: [...] "The altar should be built separate from the wall, {{in such a way}} that it is possible to walk around it easily and that Mass can be celebrated at it facing the people, which is desirable wherever possible.". Father John Zuhlsdorf says this translation is inaccurate and that the Latin original text should be translated as: [...] "The main altar should be built separated from the wall, which is useful wherever it is possible, so that it can be easily walked around and a celebration toward <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be carried out", a translation that includes the word [...] "main" [...] (in Latin, maius), which, although found in the 1969 edition of the General Instruction, does not appear in the 2002 edition.

Similarly, another candidate, Tan Jee Say, promised to be the [...] "conscience of the people" [...] and commented that for controversial issues such as the building of casinos the President's views should be taken into consideration and that he should be allowed to air them in public. Candidate Tan Cheng Bock expressed his opinion in a Facebook posting that read: [...] "he president must be seen not as a figurehead but as somebody <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> look to for support for some of the issues, national problems and so on.... I would like to play a much bigger role to engage Singaporeans and have them come to talk to the president". Tony Tan Keng Yam, who was eventually elected President, took a more conservative view and stated that the President ought to work within the Constitution.|$|E

[...] Because of this, Stone said the director {{was able to get}} the best out of the cast, saying [...] " [...] creates this sort of fury in you, and then you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didn't even know you had". Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere [...] "felt emblematic of how it feels onstageat least my long-time memories from long ago".

2500|$|Ranbir Singh's {{grandson}} Hari Singh, who had {{ascended the}} throne of Kashmir in 1925, was the reigning monarch in 1947 {{at the conclusion of}} British rule of the subcontinent and the subsequent partition of the British Indian Empire into the newly independent Union of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. An internal revolt began in the Poonch region against oppressive taxation by the Maharaja. In August, Maharaja's forces fired upon demonstrations in favour of Kashmir joining Pakistan, burned whole villages and massacred innocent people. The Poonch rebels declared an independent government of [...] "Azad" [...] Kashmir on 24 October. Rulers of Princely States were encouraged to accede their States to either Dominion – India or Pakistan, taking into account factors such as geographical contiguity and the wishes of their people. [...] In 1947, Kashmir's population was [...] "77% Muslim and 20% Hindu". [...] To postpone making a hurried decision, the Maharaja signed a standstill agreement with Pakistan, which ensured continuity of trade, travel, communication, and similar services between the two. Such an agreement was pending with India. Following huge riots in Jammu, in October 1947, Pashtuns from Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province recruited by the Poonch rebels, invaded Kashmir, along with the Poonch rebels, allegedly incensed by the atrocities against fellow Muslims in Poonch and Jammu. The tribesmen engaged in looting and killing along the way. The ostensible aim of the guerilla campaign was to frighten Hari Singh into submission. [...] Instead the Maharaja appealed to the Government of India for assistance, and the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Once the Maharaja signed the Instrument of Accession, Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. India accepted the accession, regarding it provisional until such time as the will of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be ascertained. [...] Kashmir leader Sheikh Abdullah endorsed the accession as ad-hoc which would be ultimately decided by the people of the State. He was appointed the head of the emergency administration by the Maharaja. The Pakistani government immediately contested the accession, suggesting that it was fraudulent, that the Maharaja acted under duress and that he had no right to sign an agreement with India when the standstill agreement with Pakistan was still in force.|$|E
