60|$|Hardwick {{glanced toward}} the iron box. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> faced Hal.|$|E
60|$|Presently she {{saw some}} one walking over {{the open space}} towards the cabin, {{and she could not}} fail to {{recognize}} the figure with the long stride, the folded arms, and the bowed head.

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{indicated}} the ruddy-faced, red-haired man {{who held the}} helm.|$|E
6000|$|... "The old gent murmurs {{something}} to himself about a stone which the builders wouldn't have at any price; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> puts it straight: ...|$|R
60|$|Alf {{winked at}} 'im, {{but the old}} man drew hisself up and stared at 'im, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> walked away with his 'ead in the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't rightly know, sir, if the {{two gentlemen}} said {{anything}} about that, but the visitor 'e went out first, and Mr. de Mountford followed 'im into the outer lobby. <b>Then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> spoke to me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{moved down}} the track, {{vanishing}} into the growing darkness.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{commanded}} his men {{to charge}} the crowd ahead of them.|$|E
60|$|Fenn {{caught his}} eye, and smiled painfully. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{went into the}} house.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> away, <b>and</b> {{walked with}} long {{swinging}} steps {{back to the}} hotel.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> round, <b>and</b> {{leaning against}} the gate-post, looked at the {{opposite}} buildings.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> quickly, <b>and</b> with rapid strides {{made his}} way back to the station.|$|R
60|$|He {{dropped her}} arm and walked half-way across the room. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> faced her.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{regarded}} him in wonder; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> looked {{all about him}} at the empty hall.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} Norris hesitated. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> {{without a word}} of reply hurried down the stairs.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> did <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> {{walked back}} to London with a trusting heart.|$|R
60|$|At {{this the}} great chief gave Dave another close look. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> away <b>and</b> said no more.|$|R
60|$|He made {{no answer}} for some seconds. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>and</b> sat looking at her. Their eyes met....|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{went away}} from the King's {{presence}} with the dwarf Axatalese following close after him.|$|E
60|$|He stood {{facing her}} for a moment without movement. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> walked slowly out of the house.|$|E
60|$|At {{this act}} the chief stood an instant in amazed uncertainty. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> rushed from the hut.|$|E
60|$|Smith {{rolled out}} the paper, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>turned</b> pale <b>and</b> 'is {{eyes seemed to}} stick right out of his 'ead.|$|R

60|$|Frank Muller paused {{awhile to}} think, {{stroking}} his golden beard, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> again <b>and</b> addressed {{the two other}} men who stood behind him.|$|R

6000|$|... "You fool! It's {{all right}} It's here still." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> again <b>and</b> {{looked at the}} dead Chinaman, and then again at the hole.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few minutes}} longer he {{continued}} to meditate in silence. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> quickly <b>and</b> picked up the axe which lay {{at the entrance of}} the hut.|$|R
60|$|With care {{he raised}} the {{unconscious}} form up and placed it over his shoulder. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> around, <b>and,</b> inch by inch, felt his way out on the sapling.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> made a {{proposal}} to Mavovo, explaining that his stature was much better suited to the job.|$|E
60|$|Ugh-lomi stood {{watching}} for a space, and snarled {{at the sight}} of Uya. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> plunged into the thicket.|$|E

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> round, <b>and,</b> {{whatever}} {{might have}} been the struggle within his breast, all traces of it had left his countenance, which presented its wonted appearance of good-humoured frankness.|$|R
60|$|Jonas {{then went}} to Mr. Woodman, and transacted his {{business}} successfully, according to the farmer's directions. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> around, <b>and</b> began to walk back, {{as fast as he}} could go.|$|R
