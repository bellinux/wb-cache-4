5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of <b>the</b> <b>roasted</b> mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue. Cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate), cerulean blue (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability. Aureolin (cobalt yellow) is now largely replaced by more lightfast yellow pigments.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Brown {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with recording artist Kenny Rogers, co-founding and serving as CEO of Kenny Rogers Roasters, an international chain of wood-roasted chicken restaurants. The founding of Kenny Rogers Roasters {{was part of a}} larger movement in the restaurant industry toward healthier, take-home offerings. Roasters immediately found itself in competition with Boston Chicken (later known as Boston Market) and several smaller roasted chicken chains. Kentucky Fried Chicken also introduced a roasted chicken line of products called Rotisserie Gold to compete with Roasters and Boston Chicken. In December 1992, Clucker's, a smaller player in <b>the</b> <b>roasted</b> chicken market, sued Kenny Rogers Roasters, claiming the chain had copied its recipes and menus. The lawsuit continued until Roasters purchased a majority stake in Cluckers in August 1994. Brown then took Roasters public and grew it to a chain of more than 1,000 restaurants before selling his interest in the franchise to the Malaysia-based Berjaya Group in 1996.|$|E

40|$|We {{constructed}} and instrumented a fluidised-bed coffee roaster. This {{work has been}} carried out as part of a search for the “ideal point”, which is the point in time when an expert roaster would terminate <b>the</b> <b>roast</b> in order to yield beans that produce the optimal brew. We roasted Costa Rican Arabica beans whilst controlling <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> temperature to follow a linear ramp. We measured and recorded the input, output, and coffee bean surface temperatures. We introduce the idea of “bean load”, an uncalibrated measure of the heat load presented by <b>the</b> material being <b>roasted.</b> <b>The</b> bean load under constantly-ramping bean surface temperature shows <b>the</b> <b>roast</b> is increasingly endothermic. Toward the end of <b>the</b> <b>roast</b> <b>the</b> endothermic phenomena decrease, or are assisted by exothermic activity. The bean load also has a repeatable dip around first crack. Due to limitations with the roaster {{we were not able to}} make reliable measurements at and beyond second crack.

25|$|Trigonelline (N-methyl-nicotinate) is a {{derivative}} of vitamin B6 {{that is not}} as bitter as caffeine. In green coffee beans, the content is between 0.6% and 1.0%.

25|$|Processing {{of coffee}} in India is {{accomplished}} using two methods, dry processing and wet processing. Dry processing is the traditional method of drying in the sun which is favoured for its flavour producing characteristics. In the wet processing method, coffee beans are fermented and washed, which is the preferred method for improved yields. As to the wet processing, the beans are subject to cleaning to segregate defective seeds. The beans of different varieties and sizes are then blended to derive the best flavour. The next procedure is to roast either through roasters or individual roasters. Then <b>the</b> <b>roasted</b> coffee is ground to appropriate sizes.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} coffee {{noted by the}} literary coffee merchant Philippe Sylvestre Dufour is a reference to bunchum {{in the works of}} the 10th century CE Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, known as Rhazes in the West, but more definite information on the preparation of a beverage from <b>the</b> <b>roasted</b> coffee berries dates from several centuries later.

He reported that one Sheikh, Jamal-al-Din al-Dhabhani (d. 1470), mufti of Aden, was the first to adopt the use of coffee (circa 1454).|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} model of <b>the</b> coffee <b>roasting</b> process under operating conditions is proposed. This numerical tool {{is able to}} simulate the behaviour of all the components of a batch roaster as well as <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> process of <b>the</b> coffee beans within the drum. The model evaluates the heat and mass transfer between a hot air flow and the coffee beans during <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> process on <b>the</b> basis of the physical properties of the coffee and the operation of <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> machine. Different submodels {{are included in the}} modelling in order to address particular thermo-physical processes, such as the evaporation of coffee moisture and the heat released or absorbed by the beans due to <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> reactions. <b>The</b> proposed {{numerical model}} is thus able to predict the performance of the coffee roaster in terms of pressure, temperature and mass flow rate in the main sections of the system, as well as fuel consumption. In addition, the temperature profile of the coffee beans within <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> drum is evaluated {{as a function of the}} system’s working conditions. Different roasting machine control strategies can therefore be compared and the effects on <b>the</b> coffee <b>roasting</b> profile can be analyzed.

25|$|Another account {{involves}} a 9th-century Ethiopian goat-herder, Kaldi, who, noticing the energizing effects when his flock nibbled {{on the bright}} red berries of a certain bush, chewed on the fruit himself. His exhilaration prompted him to bring the berries to a monk in a nearby monastery. But the monk disapproved of their use and threw them into the fire, from which an enticing aroma billowed, causing other monks to come and investigate. <b>The</b> <b>roasted</b> beans were quickly raked from the embers, ground up, and dissolved in hot water, yielding the world's first cup of coffee.

25|$|Chlorogenic acids {{belong to}} a group of {{compounds}} known as phenolic acids, which are antioxidants. The content of chlorogenic acids in dried green coffee beans of robusta is 65mg/g and of arabica 140mg/g, depending on the timing of harvesting. At roasting temperature, more than 70% of chlorogenic acids are destroyed, leaving a residue less than 30mg/g in <b>the</b> <b>roasted</b> coffee bean. In contrast to green coffee, green tea contains an average of 85mg/g polyphenols. These chlorogenic acids could be a valuable, inexpensive source of antioxidants. Chlorogenic acids are homologous compounds comprising caffeic acid, ferulic acid and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid, which are connected by an ester bond to the hydroxyl groups of quinic acid. The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acid is more potent than of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or mannitol, which is a selective hydroxy-radical scavenger. Chlorogenic acids have a bitter taste in low concentrations such as 50mg/l water. At higher concentrations of 1g/l water, they have a sour taste. Chlorogenic acids increase the solubility of caffeine and are important modulators of taste.|$|E

2500|$|On Christmas Eve, {{the men of}} {{the family}} build a fire in their house yard, and roast a pig, or a sheep in some areas, on a long wooden spit.

People who raise their own swine dedicate one for the pečenica a month or two before, and feed it with better fodder. It is traditionally killed on Tucindan, the day before Christmas Eve, by hitting on the head with a lump of salt. Its throat was then cut, the blood being collected and mixed with fodder.
