5|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spring Creek Dam was {{to collect}} acid mine {{drainage}} {{from the old}} Iron Mountain Mine, which was heavily polluting Spring Creek and its tributaries.

Although the watershed is small in comparison to that of the Sacramento River, the stream is among the most polluted and acidic in the world.|$|E

The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too soft to support even tracked vehicles.|$|E

In 1950 Du Bois became chairman of the newly created Peace Information Center (PIC), which worked to publicize the Stockholm Peace Appeal in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appeal was to gather signatures on a petition, asking governments around the world to ban all nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|Arnold, whose {{business}} activities {{before the war}} had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site {{where he wanted to}} meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains wanted to fight in open waters where {{they might be able to}} retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.|$|E

5|$|Trinity River Division is {{the second}} large CVP {{department}} for the northern Sacramento Valley. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam {{in order to provide}} more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair. A Hill Whiskeytown Dam) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel, which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek, a stream that flows into Keswick Reservoir, generating another 180 MW of electricity. From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. In 1963, the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.|$|E
