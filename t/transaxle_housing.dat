5000|$|Suspension: Front {{suspension}} was conventional coil-spring/wishbone layout with an {{anti-roll bar}} and rack-and-pinion steering, on a detachable front cross member. Rear suspension was a high-pivot swing axle with concentric coil-spring/telescopic dampers sitting atop the swing tubes which Renault called trumpet casings. With {{the exception of}} the trunnion arms in the <b>transaxle</b> <b>housing,</b> there was no fore-aft 'location' of the rear suspension. The pressed engine/transaxle/suspension mounting member was detachable from the main body structure. 61 percent of the Dauphine's weight was carried by the rear wheels.|$|E
5000|$|An HSD {{transaxle}} {{contains a}} {{planetary gear set}} that adjusts and blends the amount of torque from the engine and motor(s) as itâ€™s needed by the front wheels. It is a sophisticated and complicated combination of gearing, electrical motor-generators, and computer-controlled electronic controls. One of the motor-generators, MG2, {{is connected to the}} output shaft, and thus couples torque into or out of the drive shafts; feeding electricity into MG2 adds torque at the wheels. The engine end of the drive shaft has a second differential; one leg of this differential is attached to the internal combustion engine and the other leg is attached to a second motor-generator, MG1. The differential relates the rotation speed of the wheels to the rotation speeds of the engine and MG1, with MG1 used to absorb the difference between wheel and engine speed. The differential is an epicyclic gear set (also called a [...] "power split device"); that and the two motor-generators are all contained in a single <b>transaxle</b> <b>housing</b> that is bolted to the engine. Special couplings and sensors monitor rotation speed of each shaft and the total torque on the drive shafts, for feedback to the control computer.|$|E
5000|$|Overall {{the design}} {{was smaller than}} the M113, and {{considerably}} less [...] "boxy," [...] more in keeping with contemporary European designs like the FV432. The small size meant {{there was no room}} for a transverse transmission in the front of the vehicle, so a rear-drive was used with a drive shaft and <b>transaxle</b> <b>housed</b> under the cargo section. These required boxy protrusions into the cargo area, and the transaxle in particular, mounted just in front of the doors, was a major tripping hazard. Additionally, the drive shaft was extremely noisy in operation.|$|R
50|$|Hewland Mk.III of 1962 {{became the}} first product for the public, which {{utilised}} the magnesium alloy case of the Beetle <b>transaxle</b> to <b>house</b> 5 pairs of bespoke straight-cut constant mesh spur gears with dog rings operated by custom-made brass shift forks. Gear selector shaft was located in the nose housing, unmodified as in the Beetle set up, facing rear-ward {{at the tail end}} of the box in the front-side-back position on a midship engine racing cars. The elimination of synchromesh parts provided the space for an additional pair of gears for the 5th speed.|$|R
