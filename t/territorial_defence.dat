5|$|By late June and {{throughout}} July, northern Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but no actual combat. Nonetheless, the increasing {{intensity of the}} conflict in the region and elsewhere in Croatia led to the preparation of bomb shelters in Zadar by city officials. Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (SAO Krajina) authorities called up three <b>Territorial</b> <b>Defence</b> units in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July, one day after another fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area, while the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps conscripted the local Serb population in Benkovac to strengthen its ranks {{by the end of the}} month. In late July, a paramilitary group, led by Miro Barešić and formally subordinated to the Croatian Ministry of Defence, conducted several sabotages in the Benkovac area. On 1 August, Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG 4th Guards Brigade to Kruševo near Obrovac. Two days later they engaged in combat against the SAO Krajina <b>Territorial</b> <b>Defence</b> and police forces, marking the first such engagement of the Croatian War of Independence in the region. On 26 August, the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps openly sided with the SAO Krajina forces as they jointly attacked Kijevo, expelling all Croats from the village. Another significant setback for Croatia in the region was JNA capture of the Maslenica Bridge on 11 September. That severed the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia. On 1113 September, an attack in the area of Skradin cut water and power supply to Šibenik.|$|E

5|$|The JNA's planned {{campaign}} {{included an}} {{advance in the}} Šibenik area by the 9th (Knin) Corps, which was tasked with isolating Dalmatia {{from the rest of}} Croatia. As it was fully mobilised and prepared for deployment, the corps began operations against the ZNG on 16 September. Its main axis of attack was directed at Vodice, with supporting advances towards Zadar, Drniš and Sinj. The push was designed to create favourable circumstances to attack Zadar, Šibenik and Split. With support from a corps-level battalion of M-84 tanks and the SAO Krajina <b>Territorial</b> <b>Defence,</b> the JNA 221st Mechanised Brigade (without its battalion of T-34 tanks), was committed to the main axis of the attack.

The 221st Brigade was commanded by Colonel Borislav Đukić. Elements the 46th Partisan Division, drawn from the 24th (Kragujevac) Corps, also provuded support for the corps.

Therefore, the Országos Légvédelmi Parancsnokság (<b>Territorial</b> Air <b>Defence</b> Command) decided to concentrate all existing fighters into a single fighter unit. The 101.
