500|$|Michele bases Rachel {{on herself}} {{when she was}} younger, and also draws {{inspiration}} from the film Election, and the Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester). She has explained, [...] " [...] is shady, but you still love her. She's still vulnerable. That's what I try to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't considered beautiful, and when I {{was in high school}} it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of <b>that</b> <b>crap</b> won't matter anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|American {{environmentalist}} {{and writer}} Bill McKibben lamented the {{film on the}} Climate Progress website, where he wrote [...] "The climate skeptics can crow. It's the kind of stupidity that hurts our side, reinforcing in people's minds a series of preconceived notions, {{not the least of}} which is that we're out-of-control and out of touch—not to mention off the wall, and also with completely misplaced sense of humor". McKibben added [...] "There's no question <b>that</b> <b>crap</b> like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10. When The Daily Caller asked about the film, environmental organisation Greenpeace spokeswoman Jane Kochersperger stated that [...] "as an organisation committed to non-violence, I think you can imagine how Greenpeace views this material. At this time, the only people promoting the material are climate skeptics and think tanks funded by corporations known for lobbying against climate change legislation". Five other environmental groups contacted by The Daily Caller did not comment on the film.|$|E
2500|$|The group (MacKaye in particular) {{also made}} a point of {{discouraging}} violent, unwanted slam dancing and fistfights, which it saw as relics of the late 1970s/early 1980s hardcore punk era. Michael Azerrad quotes Mackaye, [...] "See, [...] have one form of communication: violence ... So to disorient them, you don't give them violence. I'd say, 'Excuse me, sir...'- I mean, it freaks them out – 'Excuse me, sir, would you please cut <b>that</b> <b>crap</b> out?'" [...] Azerrad writes, [...] " [...] admonitions seemed preachy to some. And by and large, people would obey – it wasn't cool to disrespect Ian MacKaye." [...] Occasionally, Fugazi would have an unrepentant slam-dancer escorted from the concert, and give them an envelope containing a $5 refund (the group kept a stock of such envelopes in their tour van for these occasions).|$|E
5000|$|John Meriwether {{has been}} an owner of Thoroughbred horses {{for a number of}} years and is a member of the Board of Directors of the New York Racing Association (NYRA). He is best known for once saying [...] "bet on a horse <b>that</b> <b>craps</b> just before the race". He notably campaigned Buckhan, winner of the 1993 Washington, D.C. International Stakes.|$|R
5000|$|The kids wake {{up on the}} ship, {{and meet}} Najix, an alien who looks like Stan's dad, and {{explains}} that he chose an appearance that would be most pleasing to them. They hate this as it is too reminiscent of the movie Contact, which they hated. He shows his true form, a grotesque, terrifying monster, with yellow and green skin, four legs, and sharp teeth. So the children have him go {{through a series of}} transformations, mostly of celebrities or famous television characters, until Cartman suggests [...] "a taco <b>that</b> <b>craps</b> ice cream". Najix then explains he and the other aliens make a reality show called Earth, and all of Earth's species, such as Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer and Hispanics, are taken from their respective home planets {{for the purposes of the}} show, and everyone around the world is unknowingly being filmed and watched.|$|R
2500|$|Some of {{the lower}} scores were {{reactions}} to {{the large amount of}} bugs and glitches in the initial release, including crash to desktop bugs and network problems. For example, Gaming Nexus (who awarded the game an 8.7 out of 10) reported, [...] "I’ve had many cool experiences playing it and a lot of 'did I just see that' moments but all of <b>that</b> is <b>crapped</b> on by the bugs and quirks in the game." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Friends" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{rock band}} Led Zeppelin. [...] It was written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant in 1970 at Bron-Yr-Aur, a small cottage in Wales where they stayed after {{completing}} a concert tour of the United States. [...] The song was released on Led Zeppelin III (1970), where it appears as the second track. [...] Biographer Stephen Davis called the piece [...] "Jimmy's [...] last stab at psychedelia". Singer Robert Plant has acknowledged {{the influence of the}} Indian and Caribbean music he first heard during his childhood in the Black Country on this track, [...] "There's something really splendid and otherworldly about trying to even touch those bigger ideas as a British rock group, to go past singing about bars and chicks and all <b>that</b> <b>crap.</b> There are other dynamics of life and we started to recognise that here." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked how}} he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, [...] "It was {{a long period of}} coming to the {{realization}} that this way (sober) is better. Going through rehab, honestly, did help... it got me away from just the daily drudgery of depression and either trying to not drink or do drugs or doing them and you know, they give you such a simple message that any idiot can get and it's just over and over, {{but the bottom line is}} really, and this is the part that is scary for everyone, the individual kinda has to want it... not kinda, you have to want it and to not do <b>that</b> <b>crap</b> anymore or you will never stop and it will just kill you. There’s nothing you can do...if your best friend has a problem and it's very serious, there's nothing you're going to be able to do about it and it was sad for me and the people around me. Sad for me when friends of mine died because of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, {{he played}} {{co-pilot}} Roger Murdock in Airplane!. Abdul-Jabbar has {{a scene in}} which a little boy looks at him and remarks that he is in fact Abdul-Jabbar—spoofing the appearance of football star Elroy [...] "Crazylegs" [...] Hirsch as an airplane pilot in the 1957 drama that served as the inspiration for Airplane!, Zero Hour!. Staying in character, Abdul-Jabbar states that he is merely Roger Murdock, an airline co-pilot, but the boy continues to insist that Abdul-Jabbar is [...] "the greatest", but that, according to his father, he doesn't [...] "work hard on defense" [...] and [...] "never really tries, except during the playoffs". This causes Abdul-Jabbar's character to snap, [...] "The hell I don't!", then grab the boy and snarl he has [...] " [...] <b>that</b> <b>crap</b> ever since ... UCLA", he [...] "busts his buns every night" [...] and the boy should tell his [...] "old man to drag [...] Walton and [...] Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes". When Murdock loses consciousness later in the film, he collapses at the controls wearing Abdul-Jabbar's goggles and yellow Lakers' shorts.|$|E
5000|$|Writing in The Guardian, James Campbell explains, [...] "The book expresses Styron's {{dislike of}} the {{military}} experience and must originally have appeared as a reproof to more bullish colleagues such as Norman Mailer and James Jones who, while exposing the brutality of battle, did so {{in such a way}} as to aggrandise it. [...] "None of <b>that</b> Hemingway <b>crap</b> for me," [...] says the hero of The Long March, Captain Mannix, with whom Styron has identified himself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Star Trek is {{mentioned}} by Lister following the crews decision to {{stick up for}} Kryten when the replacement arrives, Kryten regards this as true friendship, but Lister replies with [...] "dont give me <b>that</b> Star Trek <b>crap,</b> its {{too early in the}} morning".|$|R
50|$|Other systems {{depend on}} the gambler's fallacy, which in craps terms {{is the belief that}} past dice rolls {{influence}} the probabilities of future dice rolls. For example, the gambler's fallacy indicates <b>that</b> a <b>craps</b> player should bet on eleven if an eleven has not appeared or has appeared too often in the last 20 rolls. In practice this can be observed as players respond to a roll such as a Hard Six with an immediate wager on the Hard Six.|$|R

5000|$|The single also {{features}} a cover of [...] "I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You" [...] from the musical Evita, chosen according to Thomas Leer, because [...] "we both dislike Andrew Lloyd Webber intensely. We {{wanted to do something}} from a musical, something <b>that</b> was <b>crap</b> and <b>that</b> we could make great. It also fitted the idea of the package." [...] An additional instrumental mix of the track entitled [...] "I'd be Surprisingly Instrumental for You" [...] surfaced on the band's box set in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|Crosby {{attended}} LeConte Junior High School, {{followed by}} Hollywood High School and Cabrillo College, where she studied theater. She {{dropped out of}} college after she was interviewed by a local paper and revealed her famous family background: [...] "One of the drama teachers used the story to illustrate to the class <b>that</b> this <b>crap</b> is what Hollywood's all about, using people's names to get somewhere. I was very, very hurt by it. So I just checked out." [...] She started modeling and in 1979 posed nude for Playboy magazine, which she called [...] "some kind of rebellion on my part, some way of saying screw you to the family image".|$|R

5000|$|In 2012, Hoppa and Mine-Us {{produced}} {{their third}} collaboration album, Everything Is A-Okay; its title track was commended as [...] "an uplifting track telling the listeners to {{not give up}} and to look forward, amongst all the <b>crap</b> <b>that</b> might be coming upon them.

5000|$|The song has {{resulted}} in much misunderstanding; the lyrics are an ironic take on hipster culture. In August 2009, frontman Brandon Flowers told Time Out Chicago: [...] "There's so much snobbery. You go through high school and all the paranoia and <b>crap</b> <b>that</b> goes with that. It's bullshit. I just didn't {{want to be like}} that. We like big songs and we're going to embrace it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Cosby also {{attacked}} black naming conventions, saying: [...] "We are not Africans. Those {{people are}} not Africans; they don’t know a damned thing about Africa. With names like Shaniqua, Shaligua, Mohammed and all <b>that</b> <b>crap</b> {{and all of them}} are in jail." ...|$|E
5000|$|The final {{track on}} the album, [...] "Stop Forwarding <b>That</b> <b>Crap</b> to Me", is a style {{parody of the}} work of Jim Steinman.

5000|$|Esther interviewed famous {{bands like}} The Replacements, They Might Be Giants, Minor Threat, Social Distortion, Sham 69, Laurie Anderson, and Das Damen.

5000|$|Lars and Kirk {{were very}} into {{abstract}} art, pretending they were gay. I think {{they knew it}} bugged me. It was a statement around all that.
