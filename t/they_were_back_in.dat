5|$|On July 3, Pemberton sent {{a note to}} Grant {{regarding}} the possibility of negotiations for peace. Grant, {{as he had done}} at Fort Donelson, first demanded unconditional surrender. But Grant reconsidered, not wanting to feed 30,000 hungry Confederates in Union prison camps, and offered to parole all prisoners. Considering their destitute state, dejected and starving, he never expected them to fight again; he hoped they would carry home the stigma of defeat {{to the rest of the}} Confederacy. In any event, it would have occupied his army and taken months to ship that many prisoners north. Pemberton officially surrendered his army on July 4. Most of the men who were paroled on July 6 were exchanged and received back into the Confederate Army on August 4, 1863, at Mobile Harbor, Alabama. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Chattanooga, Tennessee, by September and some fought in the Battles for Chattanooga in November and against Sherman's invasion of Georgia in May 1864. The Confederate government protested the validity of the paroles on technical grounds and the issue was referred to Grant who, in April 1864, was general in chief of the Army. The dispute effectively ended all further prisoner exchanges during the war except for hardship cases.|$|E

25|$|McLain was {{suspended}} indefinitely by baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn; the suspension was then {{set for the}} first three months of the 1970 season. He returned in mid-season, but struggled to pitch well. McLain then received a seven-day suspension (from the Detroit club) in September for dousing sportswriters Jim Hawkins of the Detroit Free Press and Watson Spoelstra of the Detroit News with buckets of water. Just as the seven-day suspension was about to end, he received another suspension from Kuhn, this time for carrying a gun on a team flight; the punishment would last for at least the rest of the season. McLain's 1970 season ended with a won-loss record of only 3–5. Later that year, he was forced into bankruptcy despite being the first $100,000 player in Tigers history. Meanwhile, McLain and his friend Jim Northrup co-schemed to make more money; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Detroit furthering a plan that they shared to generate a nude baseball model calendar.

25|$|After the {{breakout}} {{from the}} Pusan Perimeter in November 1950, the 8th flew daily strike missions out of Iwakuni {{and at times}} recovering at Taegu AB (K-2), which forced the crews to fly long, arduous missions that sometimes lasted more than six hours. When the Chinese Communists attacked in the Spring of 1951, FEAF requested that the light bomber wings increase their nightly sortie rate. The {{only way to do}} this was to double up some of the missions. For several months, the crews flew from Iwakuni to their patrol sectors in North Korea, completed their mission, and then flew to the K-2 Airfield. Landing a B-26 at night at Taegu was no easy feat because the Pierced Steel Planking on the runway had begun to deteriorate. The B-26s landing there tore up dozens of tires, {{and more than a few}} accidents resulted. Also, the tires were in short supply, so each one lost at K-2 was hard to replace. If the B-26 crews got down at Taegu without incident, they could find a place to grab a quick catnap as their planes were readied for the next mission. About an hour later, they were airborne and heading north to their next target area. Four hours later, utterly exhausted, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Japan, after up to ten hours of flight and combat.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s saw five {{different}} clubs reach the First Division {{for the first}} time. In 1981, Swansea City reached the First Division after climbing from the Fourth Division in just four seasons – the fastest rise of any club throughout the league at the time. They topped the First Division more than once during the 1981–82 season before finishing sixth. However, Swansea's successive story was short-lived, and their second season among the elite ended in relegation, and by 1986 <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the Fourth Division, having narrowly avoided going out of business. In 1982, Watford reached the First Division under the chairmanship of Elton John, management of Graham Taylor, and with the scoring prowess of Luther Blissett and John Barnes in attack. They finished runners-up {{in the league in}} their first top division season and were FA Cup runners-up in their second, and survived in the First Division until 1988. Taylor later managed the England team, while Barnes went on to help Liverpool win five major trophies and was a regular member of the England side for {{the second half of the}} 1980s and into the 1990s. 1985 saw the promotion of Oxford United to the First Division, 23 years after being elected to the Football League. They survived for three seasons in the First Division and won the League Cup in their first season among the elite. An even bigger success story emerged soon after Oxford's First Division arrival, when Wimbledon won promotion to the First Division in 1986, a mere nine years after being elected to the Football League. They quickly established themselves in the First Division, finishing sixth in their first season at this level, and even more impressively won the FA Cup a year later, beating league champions Liverpool 1–0 in the Wembley final. Wimbledon would enjoy the longest stay in the top flight of any of the First Division's new arrivals of the 1980s, retaining their tenancy at this level for 14 years. 1988 saw Millwall reach the First Division for the first time. Tipped by many to go straight back down, they actually topped the First Division briefly in its early stages before finishing 10th – the lowest position they occupied all season. They briefly went top of the league again during the second month of the following season, but finished the season relegated after just two seasons in the First Division.|$|E
