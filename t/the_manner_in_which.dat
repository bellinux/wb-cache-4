5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that this flight crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. <b>The</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Baptism {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an important rite {{throughout the history of}} the Christian Church, but Christian groups differ over <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> baptism is administered, the meaning and significance of baptism, its role in salvation, and who is a candidate for baptism.|$|E
5|$|More {{than one}} {{waterspout}} {{can occur in}} the same vicinity at the same time. As many as nine simultaneous waterspouts have been reported on Lake Michigan.

5|$|The {{current rate}} of ocean {{chemistry}} change appears to be without precedent in Earth's geological history, making it unclear how well marine ecosystems {{will be able to}} adapt to the shifting conditions of the near future.

5|$|The films' {{subject matter}} were often as {{disturbing}} as <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they were played; {{with images of}} accidents, nuclear explosions, meat processing, spiders and scorpions stalking prey, gory drivers education films, and penis reconstruction surgery. Not all of the movies were horrific, and they often included nature, wildlife, and aquatic footage; {{as well as a}} color negative of a Charlie's Angels episode.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{certain aspects}} of the case were {{reported}} by the British media led to television broadcaster ITN being temporarily banned from attending press conferences, and the instigation of legal proceedings against several newspapers by both Yeates' former landlord, and the Attorney General.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difference}} is <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles {{occur on the}} world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots {{may result in a}} random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main {{offensive}} into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the American dead.|$|E
5|$|Fairman {{writes that}} legal {{precedent}} regarding {{use of the}} word is unclear because of contradictory court decisions. He presents case studies of these contradictory applications of the law, and uses them to analyze public perceptions surrounding freedom of speech. He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment, such as speech intended to cause violent acts, and discusses <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> federal and state governments sanction these exceptions. Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely. He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words {{that can be used in}} speech, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E

5|$|Former McKinsey senior executives, Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, {{were among}} those convicted in a {{government}} investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself for integrity and client confidentiality. Following the initial allegations McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner, though <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it severed ties attracted controversy.|$|E
5|$|His admissions {{were not}} {{produced}} by oppression or coercive conduct {{on the part}} of the Gardaí.

However, Dean Lyons was able to provide accurate details of murders it is now accepted that he did not commit, due to <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he was interviewed by gardaí. He wished to associate himself with the murders and readily agreed to leading questions which were asked by interviewing gardaí.|$|E

Texas issued a medical license to him in 1998. The year before Arafiles came to Winkler County, the TMB restricted his ability to supervise nurse practitioners and physician assistants for three years and fined him $1,000. In that case, the TMB expressed concerns about <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he oversaw a physician assistant at a weight loss clinic and the way that he applied the clinic's patient care protocols.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. <b>The</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece {{during his}} visit to the Netherlands and seems to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{extension}} {{bill was}} debated.
