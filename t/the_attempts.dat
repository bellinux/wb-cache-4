5|$|The pre-Socratic {{philosophers}} asked {{many questions}} about life but produced little systematic knowledge of specifically biological interest—though <b>the</b> <b>attempts</b> of the atomists to explain life in purely physical terms would recur periodically through the history of biology.

40|$|Solving the {{stochastic}} Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically, {{we investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> frequency of magnetization in synthetic antiferromagnet (SyAF). <b>The</b> <b>attempt</b> frequency is estimated while varying the uniaxial anisotropy constant, the energy barrier and {{the geometry of}} a magnetic layer. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> frequency is decreased for the same magnetic volume by increasing the asymmetry of the geometry in the high damping region.

5|$|After {{six years}} with no buyers, in late 1986 Northrop {{canceled}} the $1.2billion project. Northrop {{was reluctant to}} protest perceived favoritism of the F-16 in fear of losing support for the project for the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Ongoing negotiations with the Royal Moroccan Air Force for 20 F-20s were canceled; along with the small order by Bahrain. Later on, a bribery scandal would emerge from <b>the</b> <b>attempts</b> to market the F-20 to South Korea, leading to several Northrop managers resigning and the reprimanding of chief executive Thomas V. Jones, who retired in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1140, Theobald consecrated Uhtred as Bishop of Llandaff, with Uhtred also {{swearing}} to obey Theobald. Likewise, when Theobald consecrated Gilbert as Bishop of St Asaph in 1142, {{a similar}} profession of obedience was made. Along with these consecrations, Theobald's legal efforts {{enabled him to}} withstand <b>the</b> <b>attempts</b> of Bernard to turn St David's into an archbishopric, and when Bernard was succeeded by David fitzGerald in 1148, Theobald secured the new bishop's profession of obedience to Canterbury, thus ending the efforts to remove Wales from Canterbury's jurisdiction. Also in 1148, Pope Eugene decided in favour of Canterbury and against the claims of St David's, securing Canterbury's jurisdiction over Wales.|$|E
