40|$|A {{systematic}} {{sequence of}} prompt and probe trials {{was used to}} teach picture names to three severely retarded children. On prompt trials the experimenter presented a picture and said the picture name for the child <b>to</b> imitate; on <b>probe</b> trials the experimenter did not name the picture. A procedure whereby correct responses <b>to</b> prompts and <b>probes</b> were nondifferentially reinforced was compared with procedures whereby correct responses <b>to</b> prompts and <b>probes</b> were differentially reinforced according to separate and independent schedules of primary reinforcement. In Phase 1, correct responses <b>to</b> prompts and <b>probes</b> were reinforced nondifferentially on a fixed ratio (FR) 6 or 8 schedule; in Phase 2, correct responses to prompts were reinforced on the FR schedule and correct responses <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> were reinforced on an FR schedule of the same value; in Phase 3, correct responses to prompts were reinforced on the FR schedule and correct responses <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> were reinforced on a continuous reinforcement (CRF; every correct response reinforced) schedule; in Phase 4, correct responses to prompts were reinforced on a CRF schedule and correct responses <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> were reinforced on the FR schedule; in Phase 5, a reversal to the conditions of Phase 3 was conducted. For all three children, the FR schedule for correct responses to prompts combined with the CRF schedule for correct responses <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> (Phases 3 and 5) generated {{the highest number of}} correct responses <b>to</b> <b>probes,</b> the highest accuracy (correct responses relative to correct responses plus errors) on probe trials, and the highest rate of learning to name pictures...|$|R

40|$|Background. Previous studies {{investigating}} attentional biases {{in social}} anxiety disorder (SAD) have yielded mixed results. Recent event-related potential (ERP) studies using the dot-probe paradigm in non-anxious participants {{have shown that the}} P 1 component is sensitive to visuospatial attention towards emotional faces. We used a dot-probe task in conjunction with high-density ERPs and source localization to investigate attentional biases in SAD. Method. Twelve SAD and 15 control participants performed a modified dot-probe task using angry–neutral and happy–neutral face pairs. The P 1 component elicited by face pairs was analyzed to test the hypothesis that SAD participants would display early hypervigilance to threat-related cues. The P 1 component <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> replacing angry, happy or neutral faces was used to evaluate whether SAD participants show either sustained hypervigilance or decreased visual processing of threat-related cues at later processing stages. Results. Compared to controls, SAD participants showed relatively (a) potentiated P 1 amplitudes and fusiform gyrus (FG) activation to angry–neutral versus happy–neutral face pairs; (b) decreased P 1 amplitudes <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> replacing emotional (angry and happy) versus neutral faces; and (c) higher sensitivity (dk) <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> following angry– neutral versus happy–neutral face pairs.

40|$|Biological motion (BM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} social cues for detecting conspecifics, prey, and predators. We show that unconscious BM processing can reflexively direct spatial attention, and that this effect has a biphasic temporal profile. Participants responded <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> that were preceded by intact or scrambled BM cues rendered invisible through continuous flash suppression. With a short inter-stimulus interval (ISI, 100 ms) between the invisible BM cues and the <b>probe,</b> responses <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> at the same location as the invisible, nonpredictive BM cue were faster than <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> at the location of the scrambled BM cue. With a longer ISI (800 ms) this effect reversed, with slower responses <b>to</b> <b>probes</b> at the location of the invisible, nonpredictive BM. These effects were absent when BM and its scrambled control were made visible with both short and long cue durations across variable length of ISIs, indicating that the saliency of BM itself cannot account for the dynamic orienting effects from invisible social cues. Moreover, this dynamic attentional shifts were specific to upright BM cues and not obtained for inverted stimuli. Thus, this reflexive and dynamic attentional modulation triggered by invisible BM, with initial facilitation followed by inhibition, demonstrates that in the complete absence of conscious awareness, cue predictiveness, and saliency differences, attentional systems promote exploration of our visual environment for social signals...|$|R
