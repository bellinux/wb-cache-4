All these issues are a matter of concern for the European Community and, in fact, the last European Directives concerning education and social development, are trying to redirect and enforce educational programmes towards a “knowledge-based society and economy” that will support the societal challenges of the 21 st century and the growing demand of scientific expertise in all sectors (necessary for boosting European economic development). The most interesting strategies for implementing these directives are all those activities that see a wide partnership of schools with public institutions, enterprises and research centres (e. g. science festivals, competitions and internships for high school students). Recent studies, and the same recommendations of the European Community, have also shown that these activities, when included since the earliest years of primary schools, have a deeper impact in the long term as they match with the evolutive period in which intrinsic motivation is strongly present.

A pesquisa de campo teve duração de 10 meses. No primeiro momento realizamos contato com as coordenadoras municipais dos grupos de convivência para idosos. Neste, realizamos entrevistas semi-estruturadas e coletamos documentos oficiais. Num segundo momento, participamos de 8 bailes na região. Realizamos entrevistas semi-estruturadas com coordenadores dos bailes, com idosos participantes e registrando observações em diário de campo. A triangulação das informações obtidas pelas entrevistas, documentos, diário de campo e referencial teórico, permitiram analisar, categorizar e descrever os grupos de convivência e bailes.

Due to a variety of reasons the area under traditional crops is declining very fast in the region but undoubtedly many of the crop varieties are still conserved in the region because of their socio-cultural and religious values.

Aplicou-se um questionário com 20 questões objetivas abordando a vivência e repercussões dessa prática. Do total de alunos pesquisados, 61 (38, 9 %) afirmaram ter participado de estágio extracurricular. Desses, 55 (90, 2 %) foram motivados pela necessidade de adquirir experiência; 53 (86, 9 %) realizaram intervenções nos pacientes; e 13 (21, 3 %) com carga horária de 15 a 20 horas/semanais. Porém, 36 acadêmicos (59, 0 %) o fizeram em desacordo com as normas do Conselho Federal de Fisioterapia e Terapia Ocupacional.

The method used in this research is etnomethodology, a method {{that is used to}} investigate indexical expressions and other practical actions as a unified settlement that is being done (the organized Tax Avoidance) and how to apprehed their everyday world. It is mentioned in the beginning {{that there are a number}} of factors which cause tax avoidance, that is a drive to "enrich" themselves faster, gluttony, stingy, and a number of lust rage. It is also revealed that the practice of trailing attitude is driven by a fact that there are companies which do not pay taxes but they are safe. The presence of the National Land Agency (Badan Pertanahan Nasional), local governments and tax officials who must be "serviced", in fact also trigger the occurrence of tax avoidance. <b>These</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> were uncovered due to the fictitious reports. There were no data and report books, the bank account is mixed between the personal and company affairs. They create their own cheating reports which are set up by themselves. They even wish that the tax officials do not need to check the tax affairs in the company if it is possible. Thus, the data reported are all fictitious and the bank flux does not appear. They are all manipulative reports. The impacts of this situation are very much felt by the employees, such as the emergence of envy, suspicion among them, being tensed when they have to manipulate data, blaming on each other, and throwing out reponsibilities to each other. Psychologically, the impact to employees leads to being depressed and stressed due to the unclear payroll, resentmented, and hurt because of unfair treatments. Lastly, it is revealed that the solution to some of these problems are by apologizing and doing permissive attitude, such as “we apologize for any error, please help us, thank you profusely”, and any kinds of apologies which will get prevalent from others. Those attitudes are also followed by permissive attitudes, for instance stating that “what we are doing is an emergency, and that the condition is very much stangling making the company havino other better choice, so please understand”. As a practical implication, this Tax Avoidance practices can bring collusion, nepotism, and even corruptions to various stakeholders, such as National Land Agency (Badan Pertanahan Nasional), the local government, tax officers and tax consultants due to the susceptible of informal negotiation...|$|E

30|$|As {{outlined}} earlier, socialist precepts {{are closed}} official epistemological frameworks that bind society, although the recent reforms have transformed Vietnam into a market-driven economy. Indeed, {{during the period}} of changing social stratification order, there is evidence that the party-state still attempts to govern business practices in line with its official ideology (Edwards & Phan, 2008). Despite the increasing diminution of state ownership, the government retains prerogative powers through dominant shareholder right and the ability to appoint key positions in joint stock companies operating in key industrial sectors (Vuong, 2014). This suggests that the government can influence business decisions in SOEs to follow the Party line to achieve social harmony. For example, many SOEs are found to represent the government and invest in community projects to provide more favourable conditions in infrastructure, healthcare, and education in remote areas (Phuc & Crase, 2011). <b>These</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> demonstrate that socially responsible projects of SOEs, generally speaking, could be considered as a means to maintain the regime’s legitimacy while also sustaining economic growth.|$|R

The second track involves what he calls [...] "de facto decriminalization" [...] of indoor prostitution, that is, the non-enforcement by police departments of laws against various forms of indoor prostitution, such as escort services, massage parlors, and brothels, even while such laws stay on the books. Weitzer holds that <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> typically have little effect on the surrounding community and that enforcing laws against such practices involves time-consuming sting operations that waste police resources. Weitzer argues that this two track approach reflects public preferences regarding the proper focus of law enforcement, is a more efficient use of law enforcement resources, and is guided by the principle of harm reduction.|$|R

Basically, Turner {{argued that there}} is a dialectic between the mediacy of social structure (characterised as a 'closed society' or 'status system') and the immediacy of communitas (an 'open society'). This article argues for a more fluid understanding <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> social processes, drawing from Arjun Appadurai's char acterisation of a 'locality'as a 'complex phenomenological quality, constituted by a series of links between the sense of social immediacy, the technologies of interactivity and the relativity of contexts'. This is illustrated through the ethnographic description and analy sis of a local annual Hindu festival in an urban squatter settlement in Malaysia. While the mythic territoriality of the female deity primarily engenders symbolic boundary-making and life-sustaining activities, it also constitutes other layers of social spaces for organ isers and participants alike. Individual and corporate agendas overlap and criss-cross one another. Local knowledge is both parochial and constituted within the wider religious, social and political landscapes. Altogether, <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> contribute towards a 'public culture' of Hinduism in Malaysia, characterised both by differentiation and the semblance of communitas...|$|R
