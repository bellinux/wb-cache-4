The aim of our study was to verify the long-term results of silicone tracheal stents in such a clinical setting. Methods: Clinical data of 45 patients treated by tracheal silicone stents, between 1987 and 1999, were reviewed. All patients had highly symptomatic cicatricial stenoses; they were selected for stenting rather than for surgery because of local and general conditions. This series has been divided in two groups according {{to the purpose of}} stenting: bridge to surgery or definitive treatment. Follow-up ranged between 12 and 83 months. Twenty-seven patients received a Montgomery T <b>tube</b> (<b>Hood</b> Laboratories, Pembroke, Mass), 16 a Dumon stent (Novatech, Plan de Gras, France), and 2 a Dynamic stent (Rusch, Kernen, Germany). Results: No procedure-related mortality was observed. Nine patients underwent curative resection and reconstruction after a variable stenting period; one had a recurrent stenosis and was treated for palliation with a T tube. Tracheal stenting was performed for palliation as a definitive treatment in 37 patients. Among this group, 11 patients died of unrelated causes at a median of 10 months after the endoscopic treatment. The stent was permanently removed in 10 after a median interval of 32 months (range 9 - 70 months); in 4 others, symptomatic recurrence of the stenosis was observed within 6 weeks of stent removal. None of the patients successfully decannulated had a completely normal tracheal lumen but all remained asymptomatic because the residual stenosis was mild or well tolerated for concomitant limitation of physical activity. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with a silicone stent was safe and well tolerated in cicatricial tracheal stenoses. This procedure can be considered as a bridge to curative surgery or as a definitive treatment. The latter, generally performed for palliation, may provide satisfactory therapeutic results in selected patients, even in the presence of severe circumferential stenoses.

40|$|Active region {{eruption}} of 1 June 2011. Ejective eruption. GOES class C 4. 1 flare. SDO/AIA, various filters (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, 335 Ang.) High time cadence (24 s) and high spatial resolution (0. 6 pixels). SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetograms. Hinode observed the onset, and the later decay phase. There are two filament eruptions (filament 1 and filament 2). Filament 1 has slow rise with steps, as in several previous cases. GOES "episodes" play role of "microflares" in other events; that is, filament jumps intensity peaks. Episode 1 brightening: Accompanied by filament 1 s initial motions. (Rest of talk.) Filament 1 becomes unstable, and [...] Episode 2 brightening: Flare ribbons following filament 1 s fast liftoff. This destabilizes neighboring filament 2, and [...] . Episode 3 brightening: Flare ribbons of whole system following filament 2 s eruption. Something leads to reconnection; not totally clear what. Reconnection -> twisted flux rope in approx. 20 min; episode 1 microflare (flare ribbons; TC) and filament jump. Twist -> writhe, via kink instability; filament-trajectory plateau, approx. 20 min. Writhe -> jump and {{eruption of}} filament 1, via instability; episode 2 microflare (flare ribbons; TC). (E. g., Williams et al.) First eruption -> second filament eruption (episode 3 flare ribbons; TC). (E. g., Sterling, Moore; Liu et al.; Torok et al.; Schrijver & Title.). Estimate amount of free energy in newly-twisted field (cf. Moore 1988) : {{where we have}} taken L and r = 50, 3 arcsec. Energy of the total system is likely 1030 ergs or more. So "no" is answer to question. Additional energy comes from remainder of sheared large loop, shear (free energy) of second filament, etc. (Normally assumed situation.) Some history of twist-induced instability in filament eruptions: e. g., Sakurai, Torok & Kliem, Fan & Gibson, Gilbert et al., van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. Criterion : Kink instability for line-tied <b>tube</b> (<b>Hood</b> & Priest) : 2. 5 pi; for Titov & Demoulin loop (Torok et al) : approx. 3. 5 pi We observe here: approx. 1. 5 turns (3. 0 pi) over ~ 50. => consistent with kink instability acting. (Cf. Srivastava et al. (2010) : Small flare seen in TRACE and Hinode: approx. 6. 0 pi...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose that {{additive}} self helicity, introduced by Longcope & Malanushenko (2008), {{plays a role in}} the kink instability for complex equilibria, similar to twist helicity for thin flux <b>tubes</b> (<b>Hood</b> & Priest 1979; Berger & Field 1984). We support this hypothesis by a calculation of additive self helicity of a twisted flux tube from the simulation of Fan & Gibson (2003). As more twist gets introduced, the additive self helicity increases, and the kink instability of the tube coincides with the drop of additive self helicity, after the latter reaches the value of HA/Φ 2 ≈ 1. 5 (where Φ is the flux of the tube and HA is additive self helicity). We compare additive self helicity to twist for a thin sub-portion of the tube to illustrate that HA/Φ 2 is equal to the twist number, studied by Berger & Field (1984), when the thin flux tube approximation is applicable. We suggest, that the quantity HA/Φ 2 could be treated as a generalization of a twist number, when thin flux tube approximation is not applicable. A threshold on a generalized twist number might prove extremely useful studying complex equilibria, just as twist number itself has proven useful studying idealized thin flux tubes. We explicitly describe a numerical method for calculating additive self helicity, which includes an algorithm for identifying a domain occupied by a flux bundle and a method of calculating potential magnetic field confined to this domain. We also describe a numerical method to calculate twist of a thin flux tube, using a frame parallelly transported along the axis of the tube. – 2 – 1...|$|R
