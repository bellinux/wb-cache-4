5|$|Later, in 2001, the Campagne-sur-Aude {{site was}} {{explored}} again, {{this time by}} Gerard Chauvet, Jean-Luc Le Douarec, Colette Rives and Yvonne Vidoux. After 13 years of searching, they had uncovered a mostly complete skeleton that contained much more material, including bones unknown from the holotype. The material all went to the Musee des Dinosaures, and together <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 10 years to assemble.|$|E
5|$|The lead boat of the class, U-10, {{was built}} by Germaniawerft of Kiel, while the other four were {{constructed}} by AG Weser of Bremen. All five were transported by rail in sections to Pola, where they only needed riveting together to be complete, a process that typically <b>took</b> <b>about</b> two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The public {{beta version}} {{received}} several reviews, citing its low resource usage, straightforward user interface and price point. Brian Krebs of The Washington Post {{reported that a}} quick scan on a Windows 7 computer <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 10 minutes and a full scan about 45 minutes. Ars Technica reviewed it positively, citing its organized interface, low resource usage, and its status as freeware.|$|E

50|$|There is no regular {{transportation}} to the island. However, one can rent a speedboat from Bagansiapiapi (<b>takes</b> <b>about</b> 1.5-2 hours) or Panipahan (<b>takes</b> <b>about</b> 1 hour).|$|R
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} the three were {{grounded}} on July 14, Strindberg's highly specialized cartographic camera, which {{had been brought to}} map the region from the air, became instead a means of recording daily life in the icescape and the constant danger and drudgery of the trek. Strindberg <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 200 photos with his seven-kilogram (15lb) camera {{over the course of the}} three months they spent on the pack ice, one of the most famous being his picture of Andrée and Frænkel contemplating the fallen Eagle (see image above).|$|E
5|$|Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art & Design {{served as}} the project's {{production}} manager. She created a pattern against the wall using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed the paint, completed the mural, and added a clear coating for protection. Painting the mural <b>took</b> <b>about</b> six weeks, and it was mostly finished by November 2013. Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14. The mural took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected.|$|E

5|$|No American {{official}} casualty {{return from}} December 5 to 8 {{is known to}} exist. Some information, however, can be pieced together from various sources. For December 5, David Martin says that General Irvine's force <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 40 casualties, while a Loyalist officer with the British Army wrote that Irvine was captured along with 23 of his men. For December 6, Howard Peckham says that the Americans lost 30 killed, 40 wounded and 15 captured. The figure of 15 prisoners taken was confirmed by John André in his journal.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1863, Longstreet {{abandoned}} the siege and began moving his forces north {{to rejoin the}} Army of Northern Virginia. The next day, the 6th Massachusetts was among the units sent {{in pursuit of the}} retreating Confederate force. Only minor skirmishing took place as the bulk of the Confederate force had already escaped beyond reach of the Union infantry. The 6th Massachusetts <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 80 Confederate stragglers prisoner and burned every building they came across along the Somerton Road to deny shelter to any additional Confederate stragglers or deserters.|$|E
5|$|Pioneers 10 and 11 {{and both}} Voyager probes carry {{messages}} from the Earth to extraterrestrial life. Communication can be difficult with deep space travel. For instance, it <b>took</b> <b>about</b> three hours for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft when {{it was more than}} halfway to Pluto. Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.|$|E
5000|$|TESTU01 {{offers several}} {{batteries}} of tests including [...] "Small Crush" [...] (which consists of 10 tests), [...] "Crush" [...] (96 tests), and [...] "Big Crush" [...] (160 tests). The specific tests applied by each battery are detailed in the user's guide. On a 1.7 GHz Pentium 4 running Red Hat Linux 9.0, {{for a simple}} RNG, Small Crush <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> 2 minutes. Crush <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> 1.7 hours. Big Crush <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> 4 hours. For a more complex RNG, all these timesincrease {{by a factor of}} two or more. For comparison, the Diehard tests <b>take</b> <b>about</b> 15 seconds to run.|$|R
50|$|Basic spearheads (including javelinheads) <b>take</b> <b>about</b> 3 {{hours of}} forging time, while swords can <b>take</b> <b>about</b> 37 hours without pattern welding, or about 110 hours with pattern welding (divided over several {{days or weeks}} of labor).|$|R
50|$|Trains departing eastward {{from this}} station <b>take</b> <b>about</b> 25 minutes (with stops) {{to reach the}} central Châtelet - Les Halles station in Paris. Westbound trains <b>take</b> <b>about</b> 6 minutes to reach the {{terminus}} station St. Germain-en-Laye.|$|R
5|$|The North Koreans were {{apparently}} {{unaware of the}} 1st Battalion withdrawal, because the next morning, July 25, two North Korean battalions in a double envelopment came in behind the positions 1st Battalion held the night before, but in front of Major Gordon E. Murch's 2nd Battalion. There the North Koreans {{were caught in the}} open by the combined fire of American tanks, artillery, and mortar, and the 2nd Battalion's automatic and small arms fire. The North Koreans suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack. Surviving remnants of the two North Koreans battalions withdrew in confusion. The 2nd Battalion <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 30 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The first {{train to}} use the new line was pulled by the Victoria. It left Manchester at 8:00am, and arrived in Bolton 26minutes 30seconds later. The second train was pulled by the Fairfield. The trains {{originally}} ran on the right hand set of rails, an unusual practice in England, however the railway later changed to left-hand running with the connection of the MB at Clifton. Ten trains ran in each direction per weekday, and two on Sundays. The journey from Salford to Bolton <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 35minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Ireland collapsed dramatically {{during the second}} half of the 19th century. A {{population of}} over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was due to death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852, which <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 1 million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.|$|E

30|$|Eval-IX: Index {{construction}} We {{report the}} running time of index construction algorithm for all datasets. The result {{is shown in}} Fig.  10. CCO-Construct <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> 231  s in the Gowalla dataset, and <b>takes</b> <b>about</b> only 14  s in CiaoDVD dataset.|$|R
5|$|The researching, planning, {{design and}} {{programming}} {{of the game}} <b>took</b> <b>about</b> six months and between 200 and 300 hours of work. All the footage and pictures in the game {{were taken from the}} internet. Final Fantasy VI influenced the sprite-based design. Many of the songs in the game are MIDI versions of 1990s grunge and alternative bands such as Radiohead, Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins. Ledonne paid meticulous attention to detail, including giving players access to the exact inventory the gunmen used on their rampage. He watched videos, read newspaper articles and pored over 11,000 pages of documents released by the county government regarding the massacre and the killers.|$|E
5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who walked on the towpaths pulling the barge with a harness over their shoulder. It <b>took</b> <b>about</b> 18 hours to pull a barge through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the barge {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped manoeuver the barges using a boat hook. Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. The process normally <b>took</b> <b>about</b> an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, the first six of Sōryūs CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:30.|$|E
