50|$|The land {{forfeited}} to the Conqueror was re-granted by {{him to be}} held by knight-service due to the king, not to the {{mesne lord}} as in European continental feudalism. In 1086 at the council of Salisbury all the landholders swore fealty to the crown. In the full vigour of feudalism the inhabitants of England were either free or not free. The free inhabitants held their lands either by free tenure or by a tenure which was originally that of a non-free inhabitant, but attached to land {{in the possession of}} a free man. Free tenure was either military tenure, called also <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> <b>chivalry,</b> or socage (including burgage and petit serjeanty), or frankalmoin, by which ecclesiastical corporations generally held their land. The non-free inhabitants were called in the Domesday Book servi, cotarii, or bordarii, and later nativi or villani, the last name being applied to both free men and serfs. All these were in a more or less dependent condition. The free tenures all exist at the present day, though, as will appear later, the military tenures have shrunk into the unimportant and exceptional tenure of grand serjeanty. The non-free tenures are to a certain extent represented by copyhold.|$|E

50|$|These {{three areas}} {{obviously}} overlap quite frequently <b>in</b> <b>chivalry</b> {{and are often}} indistinguishable. Another classification of chivalry divides it into warrior, religious and courtly love strands. One particular similarity between {{all three of these}} categories is honour.
