They analyze the impact of increases in only one tax rate in order to assess the revenue-raising abilities of each <b>taxation</b> <b>method.</b> They also analyze the impact of equal-yield changes in the tax mix to measure and compare the effects of favouring one <b>taxation</b> <b>method</b> over another. Results from the {{general equilibrium model}} suggest that direct taxation is preferable to indirect taxation when a government is concerned with limiting informal economic activity. A more important finding, perhaps, is that, in light of the existence of an informal sector, the poor prefer indirect taxation while the rich prefer direct. As a corollary, the authors estimate government revenue lost as a result of informal economic activity to be about $ 13. 6 billion...|$|E

In this problem (unlike most work in implementation theory), the feasible set is unknown to the designer. We first show that feasibility out of equilibrium imposes that the mechanism depend on the environment. Next we present two game forms. In the first one, which requires complete information among the tax payers, each agent reports the incomes of all players to a central agency, and implementation of every <b>taxation</b> <b>method</b> is obtained in Nash, strong and coalition-proof equilibrium. In the second, informational requirements may be somewhat relaxed. One of the agents makes a tax proposal, the others bargain with him, and {{the services of a}} central agency are used only to solve disputes between pairs of agents. This game form implements a large class of consistent and monotone taxation methods in subgame perfect equilibrium. Neither mechanism employs the off-equilibrium devices used by the general theory.

Expatriates cost corporations three to five times more than local employees and the costs of expatriate failure can be high. It is therefore important for multinational corporations to attract and retain a competent and motivated cadre of expatriates. Since compensation {{plays an important role in}} employee motivation and retention, it is necessary to identify those remuneration aspects perceived to be important by expatriates. Experts in expatriate remuneration were interviewed to identify the variables that are important in expatriate remuneration. From these interviews, a questionnaire was designed, piloted and sent to expatriates in seven South African multinational companies. Conjoint analysis was used to examine the relative importance of the identified variables. The relative importance of these variables was also examined according to different demographic characteristics of the sample. The results show that of the compensation package variables, base salary is perceived to be the most important followed by benefits, currency in which the expatriate is paid, equity, <b>taxation</b> <b>method,</b> and lastly the cost of living adjustment.

This {{gave rise to}} a great deal of protest by road users and a court battle between the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) and the Opposition to Urban Tolling Alliance, a body representing road users. The e-tolling system was criticised at various levels and on numerous grounds, some financial and others appearing to be emotional. This thesis attempted to analyse the various grounds for objection against the system, the main goal of the research being to analyse e-tolling in Gauteng to ascertain whether or not the introduction of e-tolling was justified or whether an alternative method of taxation to pay for the upgrading of Gauteng roads would have been more cost-effective. Secondary data in the form of documents from multiple sources was used in the analysis, including an Economic Impact Assessment {{that was one of the}} key inputs into the decision to introduce e-tolling.

40|$|Thesis (MCom (South African and International Taxation)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Multinational {{enterprises}} {{have been}} widely accused of using aggressive tax planning schemes to avoid paying tax all over the world. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyse the methods used by multinational enterprises in the context of business restructurings to shift profits from high to low tax jurisdictions. Transactions between associated entities have generally been manipulated by applying non-arm’s length prices to these transactions, as well as devising agreements where the economic substance varies from the form of the transaction. The study aims to investigate some of the practical challenges faced by tax administrators in the application of the arm’s length principle. The study was conducted based on a literature review, as well as analysing specific examples reported in newspapers where multinational enterprises have used aggressive tax planning schemes to shift profits. International case law was also analysed to evaluate some of the factors considered by the courts in the determination of the arm’s length price. It was found that multinational enterprises definitely use aggressive tax planning schemes to shift profits. The practical challenges in the determination of arm’s length prices, complexity of the transactions involved, as well as a lack of resources, especially in the developing nations, are some of the factors that cause tax administrators to battle to find a solution to deter and detect these schemes. Other methods such as the unitary <b>taxation</b> <b>method</b> and the country by country reporting concept have been brought forward as alternatives to the arm’s length principle. These alternatives have been proposed in an effort to find a solution to the challenges posed by the arm’s length principle. Specific measures have also been recommended for developing nations’ tax administrators to resolve the issues that they currently experience in this context. Master...|$|E

On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, Container Corporation of America contested the application of California 2 ̆ 7 s <b>taxation</b> <b>method</b> on three grounds. First, it disputed the finding of a unitary-business consisting of itself and its foreign subsidiaries; second, it claimed that even if a unitary-business did exist, differences in international economic conditions caused a distortion of income when the apportionment method was applied, which warranted rejection of the worldwide income apportionment; and third, it claimed that states 2 ̆ 7 use of the unitary-business concept across national boundaries and the apportionment of worldwide income violated the foreign commerce clause because the method resulted in double taxation and violated federal uniformity in the international sphere. This article examines the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s holding {{on each of these}} three contested issues.

40|$|The {{importance}} of considering Taxation 1 a specialised {{field of study}} is often ignored because people assume that taxation is already adequately dealt with in other disciplines. It is therefore imperative to identify or construct the Fundamental Principles of Taxation to establish Taxation as a specialised field of study {{for the purposes of}} research and education, and to inform the practice. The theory of the discipline of Taxation encompasses the most basic principles required to comprehend Taxation. By contrast, taxation policy addresses the practical arena of taxation, including the collection and spending of tax revenue, as well as citizens contributions. Bearing in mind the many nuances of taxation, their possible roots and their relevance in practice, education and research, this study asked the following question: What are the Fundamental Principles in Taxation that are essential to Taxation internationally both in the present, and as Taxation evolves into the future? The aim {{of the study was to}} construct Fundamental Principles for Taxation. A multi-method qualitative research design was chosen, allowing the triangulation of three sets of findings. This multi-method design allowed the limitations of every data collection method to be offset by the strengths of other methods. The research design provided depth to the picture of the phenomenon of interest, namely the Fundamental Principles of Taxation. The first data collection strategy was an extensive historical review (Method 1). This method was supported by a thematic analysis using Atlas ti of the aspects of taxation history that were identified. The second method was an Interactive Qualitative Analysis, a systematically executed focus group activity conducted with international experts on <b>Taxation</b> (<b>Method</b> 2). The third method was the presentation of a single question to international Taxation experts to elicit written responses (Method 3). A thematic analysis of their responses was conducted using Atlas ti. Three sets of taxation principles emerged from these discrete analyses. These sets of principles were then triangulated to achieve a synthesis to answer the research question: What are the Fundamental Principles in Taxation? The process of triangulation led to the construction of six Fundamental Principles of Taxation. Each was supported by a rich description, compiled as an outcome of the analysis. The six principles are achieving (i) Efficient and effective administration and communication, (ii) Certain, neutral, understandable legislation, (iii) Equity influencing different levels of society, (iv) Taxpayers duty to contribute to society versus the government s duty to find a balance between taking too little and taking too much, (v) Benefits to the public through taxation, and (vi) Changes to unwanted social behaviour. The application of Taxation is still evolving in terms of Taxation s interdisciplinary role in the international economic and socio-political arena, where tax policies are made and tax systems are implemented in the unique circumstances of every country. Future research will draw more countries into the discussion and include more disciplines in an attempt to adhere to the true interdisciplinary nature of Taxation. Against this background, a tentative universal set of Fundamental Principles of Taxation was constructed and proposed.

States that rely on higher percentages of aid for government revenue are less accountable to their citizens by avoiding the state-citizen relationships that taxation builds and face fewer incentives to develop public institutions.

They find that both <b>taxation</b> <b>methods</b> can be implemented without distorting the incentives of the compensation contract, as long as the tax rate does not exceed a certain cut-off value. The range of tax rates that do not affect the incentives is greater for the penalty tax on paid bonuses than for the bonus tax on the variable salary. In this range, the bonus increases with the bonus tax rate to maintain the agent’s incentive to provide high effort if the agent bears the tax burden. In the case of a penalty tax on paid bonuses, the variable compensation component is not affected by the penalty tax. If the tax rate exceeds the cut-off value, the principal refrains from incentivizing a high effort level and does not offer a bonus to the agent.|$|R
