5|$|Additionally, some {{patients}} may develop PPE, characterized by skin eruptions on {{the palms of}} the hand or soles of <b>the</b> <b>feet,</b> swelling, pain, and erythema.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} dachshund {{on a leash}} and <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of a lady walking it, both in rapid motion {{as indicated by the}} blurring and multiplication of their parts.|$|E
5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in {{blood vessels in the}} skin of <b>the</b> <b>feet,</b> which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} episodes, <b>the</b> human <b>Foot</b> Ninjas are used. <b>The</b> <b>Foot</b> Soldiers wear black suits and masks. The masks {{appear to have}} bug-like eyes and have <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> Clan logo on it (similar to the outfits worn by <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> Ninjas from <b>the</b> 90's films). <b>The</b> <b>Foot</b> Ninjas seem to never talk. Each of <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> Ninjas fight with staffs, shurikens, katanas, Naginata, Tonfa, and nunchucks. <b>The</b> <b>Foot</b> Ninja {{recruits}} are trained at Chris Bradford's dojos.|$|R
25|$|There are lobes on {{each side}} of the frontal part of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and there is also a lobe with {{operculum}} on <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> There is a groove on <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> dividing <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> into frontal and back part. While moving, it will put the tip of its snout on the ground and then it will drag itself while it is moving each part of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> separately like a leech.|$|R
25|$|The broken toes {{were held}} tightly against {{the sole of}} <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> while <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> was then drawn down {{straight}} with the leg and the arch of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> at <b>the</b> instep, then carried over the toes, under <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> and around <b>the</b> heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the sole of <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> At each pass around <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> <b>the</b> binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and <b>the</b> heel together, causing <b>the</b> broken <b>foot</b> to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and {{the ends of the}} binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.|$|R
5|$|Banks {{missed the}} first nine games of the 1965–66 season after {{breaking}} his wrist when diving at <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of Northampton Town's Joe Kiernan in a pre-season friendly. Leicester finished the season in seventh spot, and exited both cup competitions {{at the hands of}} Manchester City.|$|E
5|$|By all accounts, Kanhopatra then died at <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of the Vithoba image, but the {{circumstances}} were unclear. According to popular tradition, Kanhopatra {{merged with the}} image of Vithoba in a form of marriage—something that Kanhopatra longed for. Other theories suggest that she killed herself, or that she was killed for her rebelliousness.|$|E
5|$|Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now {{an escaped}} {{political}} prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left {{a key to the}} chapel hidden at <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds.|$|E
50|$|The final {{possible}} {{variation is}} in <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> itself. One may either strike with the instep of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> (with <b>the</b> ankle and toes extended), {{or with the}} ball of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> (ankle and toes bent back). Alternately, one could forgo the use of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> entirely, and strike with the shin instead.|$|R
50|$|Those who overpronate tend to {{push off}} almost {{completely}} {{from the big}} toe and second toe. As a result, the shock from <b>the</b> <b>foot’s</b> impact doesn’t spread evenly throughout <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and <b>the</b> ankle has trouble stabilizing {{the rest of the}} body. Additionally, an unnatural angle forms between <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and ankle and <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> splays out abnormally. It is common even for people who pronate normally to have some angle between <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and <b>the</b> ankle, but not to the extent seen in those who overpronate. In normal pronation the weight distributes evenly throughout <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
30|$|The results {{obtained}} {{from the present study}} indicate that foot length is more reliable for stature estimation than <b>foot</b> breadth, as <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> length exhibited higher correlation coefficient values and lower SEE values than <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> breadth in <b>the</b> males, females, and the pooled sample. Therefore, it is noteworthy that once <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> is recovered in forensic contexts in Nigeria, it is advised that <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> length is preferred for stature prediction than <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> breadth.|$|R
5|$|Common defects of the forelegs include base-wide and base-narrow, {{where the}} legs are farther apart or closer {{together}} on the ground then they are when they originate in the chest; toeing-in and toeing-out, where the hooves point inwards or outwards; knee deviations to the front (buck knees), rear (calf knees), inside (knock knees) or outside (bowleg); short or long pasterns; and many problems with <b>the</b> <b>feet.</b> Common defects of the hind limbs include the same base-wide and base-narrow stances and problems with <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> as the fore limbs, as well as multiple issues with the angle formed by the hock joint being too angled (sickle-hocked), too straight (straight behind) or having an inward deviation (cow-hocked). Feral horses are seldom found with serious conformation problems in the leg, as foals with these defects are generally easy prey for predators. Foals raised by humans {{have a better chance}} for survival, as there are therapeutic treatments that can improve even major conformation problems. However, some of these conformation problems can be transmitted to offspring, and so these horses are a poor choice for breeding stock.|$|E
5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between <b>the</b> <b>feet,</b> behind the buttocks or away from the body. This act {{was seen as a}} way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus macropus, {{described}} by Swainson in 1837, is the Australian peregrine falcon. It {{is found in}} Australia in all regions except the southwest. It is non-migratory. It is similar to brookei in appearance, but is slightly smaller and the ear region is entirely black. <b>The</b> <b>feet</b> are proportionally large.|$|E
50|$|Swing phase (SW): The {{period of}} time when <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> is not in contact with the ground. In those cases where <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> never leaves <b>the</b> ground (<b>foot</b> drag), it can be defined as the phase when all {{portions}} of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> are in forward motion.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{scenarios}} {{in which}} the use of TCC is appropriate for managing neuropathic arthropathy (Charcot <b>foot),</b> according to <b>the</b> American Orthopaedic <b>Foot</b> and Ankle Society. First, during the initial treatment, when the breakdown is occurring, and <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> is exhibiting edema and erythema; the patient should not bear weight on <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> and TCC {{can be used to}} control and support <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> Second, when <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> has become deformed and ulceration has occurred; TCC can be used to stabilize and support <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> and to help move the wound toward healing.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Foot</b> Clan's logo is {{a drawing}} of a right <b>foot,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> Soldiers wear purple and black uniforms {{featuring}} the logo on their foreheads. <b>The</b> <b>Foot</b> logo {{can also be seen}} on the Technodrome.|$|R
5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of <b>the</b> <b>feet,</b> {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{the weapon}} may be {{depicted}} as in both anthropomorphic and their true form. While the central icon of Vishnu {{may hold the}} weapons, the ayudhapurushas of the same weapon may stand at <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of the central icon.|$|E
5|$|It is {{typically}} thought {{to affect the}} big toe, but it affects other parts of <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> as well, including {{the bottom of the}} foot (plantar surface). The occurrence of purple toe syndrome may require discontinuation of warfarin.|$|E
40|$|The {{punching}} shear failure often governs {{the strength of}} the footing-to-column connection. The {{punching shear}} failure is an undesirable failure mode, since it results in a brittle failure of <b>the</b> <b>footing.</b> In this study, a new method to increase the strength and ductility of <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> was proposed by inserting the punching shear preventers (PSPs) into <b>the</b> <b>footing.</b> <b>The</b> validation and effectiveness of PSP were verified through a series of experimental studies. The nonlinear finite element analysis was then performed to demonstrate the failure mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> with PSPs in depth and to investigate the key parameters that affect the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> with PSPs. Finally, the design recommendations for <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> with PSPs were suggested...|$|R
50|$|In Volume 4 <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> {{were given}} a {{security}} contract by the Utroms for their base because the Utroms have a no weapons policy and <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> are skilled at hand-to-hand combat. At some point mysterious Aztec warriors started to attack <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> all over <b>the</b> world. Karai informed Leonardo that the New York Branch of <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> {{was all that was}} left.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>foot</b> sleeve is {{attached}} to the front portion of the base and is usually made of sturdy fabric or elastic. The purpose of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> sleeve is to hold <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> in place during the stretching process.|$|R
5|$|John lacks {{scenes from}} the synoptics such as Jesus' baptism, the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, the Transfiguration, and the Last Supper. Conversely, it {{includes}} scenes {{not found in the}} synoptics, including Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus washing <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of his disciples, and multiple visits to Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Kathak, a {{classical}} dance form, owes its origin {{to the state}} of Uttar Pradesh. The dance form is connected to classical Hindustani music where the rhythmic nimbleness of <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> is accompanied by either Tabla or Pakhawaj. Four of the six schools of this dance form, Lucknow gharana, Ajrara gharana, Farukhabad gharana and Benares gharana, are situated in Uttar Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, the hindlimbs were stocky {{and short}} {{compared}} to body length. The tibia (lower leg bone) of Majungasaurus was even stockier {{than that of}} its relative Carnotaurus, with a prominent crest on the knee. The astragalus and calcaneum (ankle bones) were fused together, and <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> bore three functional digits, with a smaller first digit that did not contact the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Increased tibialis {{anterior}} {{activity to}} cause dorsiflexion and inversion (turning <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> inward) of <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Foot</b> Ninjas - <b>The</b> <b>Foot</b> Soldiers of <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> Clan, who all wear {{identical}} {{black and}} grew uniforms emblazoned with <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> emblem. They wield various weapons, but are generally depicted as being inferior ninjas {{in comparison to}} the Turtles.|$|R
50|$|In theory, however, {{rotation}} on {{the ball}} of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> is much faster. The main problem is the danger of either falling backwards or of not keeping up the pose, falling back {{on the ball}}s of <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> Twists done on the heel of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> are often quick twists, done leaning backwards while bringing <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> upwards in an arc, so that it is more of a controlled fall that <b>the</b> other <b>foot</b> can come out and stabilize.|$|R
5|$|On {{arrival at}} Seringapatam the Christian captives {{were forced to}} embrace Islam. All those who {{complied}} were freed. Those who refused were tied to <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> of the elephants to be dragged and trampled on Tipu's orders.|$|E
5|$|On some vinyl {{pressings}} of the album, {{the cover}} does not crop off their feet. On the Deluxe Edition case <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> are presented {{on the back}} cover, and the band sold an official T-shirt with {{a shot of the}} band's feet after the deluxe edition release.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys peninsulae is a {{medium-sized}} {{member of the}} genus, smaller than O.albiventer but larger than O.couesi mexicanus. Its fur is grayish-brown on the forequarters, but reddish-brown on the hindquarters; this coloration pattern is unique among western Mexican Oryzomys. The underparts are a dirty white, <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> white above, and the tail dark or brownish above and dirty white below.|$|E
50|$|Khan {{must have}} {{lost control of}} <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> after Cyber Shredder's defeat because Karai was in control of <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> once more in the movie Turtles Forever. At this point, the Utrom Shredder {{returned}} by means of his counterpart, the Shredder of the 1987 series. The Technodrome became the headquarters for <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> Clan of <b>the</b> 2003 series and <b>the</b> robotic <b>foot</b> soldiers were added to <b>the</b> <b>Foot's</b> fighting force after an upgrade with Utrom technology. Using Krang's mutagen following Hun's mutation, they also added mutated soldiers to <b>the</b> <b>Foot's</b> soldiers (two of which resembled Tokka and Rahzar) where they were classified as Mutant <b>Foot</b> Soldiers. <b>The</b> Utrom Shredder kept the 1987 Shredder and Krang on, as well as Bebop and Rocksteady to help lead <b>the</b> <b>Foot.</b> However <b>the</b> Utrom Shredder turned on his counterpart and Krang later in the movie. The Utrom Shredder was eventually destroyed by the Technodrome's weapons. Karai most likely retook control of <b>the</b> <b>Foot</b> at this point.|$|R
50|$|A {{less common}} type of ankle sprain is called an {{eversion}} injury, affecting the medial side of <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> This happens when <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> instead of <b>the</b> ankle rotating medially resulting in an inversion (<b>the</b> <b>foot</b> being rolling to the inside), the ankle rotates laterally resulting in an eversion (when <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> rolls to <b>the</b> outside). When this occurs, the medial, or deltoid, ligament is stretched too much.|$|R
30|$|N.B: To {{facilitate}} accurate measurement, the caliper {{scale was}} aligned {{parallel to the}} long axis of <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> long axis of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> runs through <b>the</b> second digit. <b>Foot</b> breadth was measured perpendicular to the long axis with vernier calipers as a straight distance between the metatarsal fibulare and metatarsal tibiale, with <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> in a fully stretched position.|$|R
