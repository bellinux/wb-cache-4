It is always a bit of a shock to hear of someone who exercises regularly having heart troubles. So, why exercise? I know enough about atherosclerosis to know that it is an insidious disease often without symptoms. Most coronary atherosclerosis even when severely advanced often has few symptoms. It is often missed on routine screening treadmill stress tests and even with coronary angiography the extent of the disease can be underestimated. Also, there is a strong component of genetics in coronary atherosclerosis and it is definitely more common as we age. Is it inevitable if we live long enough?
