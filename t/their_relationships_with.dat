5|$|A {{consequence}} of his perfectionism {{is that some}} artists who initially sign deals with Dr.Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash, featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> the label and Dr.Dre.

Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal societies in Ghana among the Akan people. In Lesotho, females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in cunnilingus, and maintain <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> other females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis, however, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.|$|E

TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011. Golf Digest suspended Woods' monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue. In contrast, Nike continued to support Woods, as did Electronic Arts, which was working with Woods on the game Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online. A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods' affairs to be between $5 billion and $12 billion.|$|E

5|$|Iowa is {{the second}} studio album by the American heavy metal band Slipknot. Released by Roadrunner Records on August 28, 2001, it was {{produced}} by Ross Robinson and Slipknot. The title derives from the band's home state, Iowa, which members have stated {{is one of their}} greatest sources of inspiration. With much anticipation for the band's second album following on the success of their 1999 self-titled debut, pressures on the band were high. <b>Their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> each other suffered and was later described as the darkest time of their career. It was also the first time that guitarist Jim Root had been significantly involved in a Slipknot album as Root was only featured on two songs from their debut album, due to his joining very late in recording of that release. Despite troubles within the band and with Iowas development, Slipknot promoted it for almost a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{accentors}} are {{a family}} of small ground-living insectivorous birds, {{most of which are}} found in mountainous habitats in Eurasia, although the dunnock is a lowland species. <b>Their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> other bird families are uncertain. All accentors are placed in a single genus, Prunella, but within that genus, the Siberian accentor is most similar in appearance to the black-throated, brown, Kozlov's, Radde's and Arabian accentors. These are of comparable in size and typically have a pale supercilium and dark markings on the head or throat. However, a 2013 phylogenetic study indicates that the closest relative of the Siberian accentor is actually the physically dissimilar Japanese accentor.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{confidently}} identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs {{found in}} a Permian shark coprolite, but helminth hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles. The oldest known free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber {{and placed in the}} monotypic species Micropalaeosoma balticus, while the oldest subfossil specimens are schistosome eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies. The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies, distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes and no other animals have. This makes it difficult to work out both <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> other groups of animals and the relationships between different groups that are described as members of the Platyhelminthes.|$|E

5|$|These early stelae {{depicted}} rulers as warriors or {{wearing the}} masks and headdresses of Maya deities, accompanied by texts that recorded dates and achievements during their reigns, {{as well as}} recording <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> their ancestors. Stelae came to be displayed in large ceremonial plazas designed to display these monuments to maximum effect. The raising of stelae spread from the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands throughout the Maya area. The development of Maya stelae coincides {{with the development of}} divine kingship among the Classic Maya. In the southern Maya area, the Late Preclassic stelae impressed upon the viewer the achievements of the king and his right to rule, thus reinforcing both his political and religious power.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{continues}} in Lima {{with a new}} generation of students but also follows some of the McKinley graduates from the third season, notably to the fictional New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts (NYADA) in New York City. The season follows the club through a loss at the Sectionals competition (episode 9) and subsequent reinstatement when the winning Dalton Academy Warblers were found to have used banned substances (human growth hormone) (episode 12) before winning at the Regionals competition (episode 22), which meant they would be attending their third consecutive National show choir competition. In the meantime, Rachel Berry and Kurt Hummel navigate NYADA and their lives as aspiring performers, plus <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> Finn and Blaine. Issues during the season include sex, bulimia, gender identity, child molestation, dyslexia, school violence, and pregnancy scares. Former main cast members Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) were credited as guest stars, while previously recurring glee club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) was promoted to the main cast.|$|E
5|$|The first civilization {{known to}} have a {{functional}} theory of the planets were the Babylonians, who lived in Mesopotamia {{in the first and}} second millennia BC. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus, that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC. The MUL.APIN is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets {{over the course of the}} year. The Babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become Western astrology. The Enuma anu enlil, written during the Neo-Assyrian period in the 7th century BC, comprises a list of omens and <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets. Venus, Mercury, and the outer planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were all identified by Babylonian astronomers.

On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make a pact to make a promise if they survive the event. Imran vows to publish his poetry (which he has penned down in his private diary), Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha that {{he does not want to}} marry her. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> each other, with others they know, and with themselves.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Aztecs and the Inca, the Maya {{political}} system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area {{into a single}} state or empire. Rather, throughout its history, the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both states and chiefdoms. These polities fluctuated greatly in <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> each other and {{were engaged in a}} complex web of rivalries, periods of dominance or submission, vassalage, and alliances. At times, different polities achieved regional dominance, such as Calakmul, Caracol, Mayapan, and Tikal. The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC. During the Late Preclassic, the Maya {{political system}} coalesced into a theopolitical form, where elite ideology justified the ruler's authority, and was reinforced by public display, ritual, and religion. The divine king was the centre of political power, exercising ultimate control over the administrative, economic, judicial, and military functions of the polity. The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilize both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects, apparently with no police force or standing army. Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration, and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives. Within a polity, mid-ranking population centres would have {{played a key role in}} managing resources and internal conflict.|$|E
