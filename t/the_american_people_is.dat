Some have criticized Coolidge as an adherent of the laissez-faire ideology, which they claim led to the Great Depression. On the other hand, historian Robert Sobel offers some context based on Coolidge's sense of federalism: [...] "As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards. Did he support these measures while president? No, because in the 1920s, such matters were considered the responsibilities {{of state and local}} governments." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Alyona Show, {{hosted by}} Alyona Minkovski, ran from 2009 to 2012 (when Minkovski left RT to join The Huffington Post).

The New Republic columnist Jesse Zwick wrote that one journalist {{told him that}} Minkovski is [...] "probably the best interviewer on cable news." [...] Benjamin R. Freed wrote in the avant-garde culture magazine SOMA that [...] "The Alyona Show does political talk with razor-sharp wit." [...] David Weigel called the show [...] "an in-house attempt at a newsy cult hit" [...] and noted that [...] "her meatiest segments were about government spying, and the Federal Reserve, and America's undeclared wars". Minkovski had complained about being characterized {{as if she was}} [...] "Putin's girl in Washington" [...] or as being [...] "anti-American". After Minkovski argued that Glenn Beck was [...] "not on the side of America.

5000|$|Coolidge {{could not}} have been a more {{different}} personality than his predecessor. Dour, puritanical, and spotlessly honest, his White House stood {{in sharp contrast to the}} drinking, gambling, and womanizing that went on under Harding. In 1924, he was easily elected in his own right with the slogan [...] "Keep Cool With Coolidge". Overall, the Harding and Coolidge administrations marked a return to the hands-off style of 19th-century presidents in contrast to the activism of Roosevelt and Wilson. Coolidge, who spent the entire summer on vacation during his years in office, famously said [...] "The business of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> business." ...|$|E

5000|$|We want {{above all}} things to {{preserve}} America. But [...] "America," [...] as we have already seen, is not a mere geographical expression; it is a nation, whose foundations were laid over three hundred years ago by Anglo-Saxon Nordics, and whose nationhood is due almost exclusively to people of North European stockâ€”not only the old colonists and their descendants but also many millions of North Europeans who have entered the country since colonial times and who have {{for the most part}} been thoroughly assimilated. Despite the recent influx of alien elements, therefore, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> still predominantly a blend of closely related North European strains, and the fabric of American life is fundamentally their creation.|$|E

5000|$|Though Steffens' {{reporting}} did {{expose the}} broader public to examples {{of corruption in}} some major American cities, Steffens points out in The Shame of the Cities that exposing corruption was not his purpose. He writes {{in the introduction to}} the book that, to him, the most important new information in his work was not the evidence of corruption, but the evidence of the publicâ€™s complicity in it: [...] "The people are not innocent. That is the only 'news' in all the journalism of these articles". He tries to debunk popular explanations for city corruption. He notes that immigrants, who frequently received blame for spurring corruption, could not be responsible for Philadelphiaâ€™s corruption, since [...] "Philadelphia, with 47 per cent. of its population native-born of native-born parents, is the most American of our greater cities". Steffens makes the point more forcefully in the introduction to the book. [...] "But not one class is at fault, nor any one breed, not any particular interest or group of interests", he writes. [...] "The misgovernment of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> misgovernment by the American people".|$|E

5000|$|While {{mainstream}} Jewish {{leaders and}} pro-Israel organizations on American campuses often try {{to present the}} State of Israel as a democratic Western country with numerous security challenges, the Zionist Freedom Alliance speaks of Israel as a Middle Eastern nation with a legitimate moral and historic right to its entire country. In a July 2008 interview, ZFA leader Yehuda HaKohen told Israel National News that: [...] "We must make the world understand that the Jewish nation, like any other nation on the planet, {{has a right to}} self-determination in our country. Not in half of our country, but in our whole country. We have nothing against any other peoples, but the world today has no shortage of Arab states. 77% of Palestine territory east of the Jordan River was made into an Arab state, and we are at least entitled to the remaining 23% that was left us by international law to be a Jewish state. No power on earth has the moral authority to rob us of our land." [...] In that same interview, HaKohen angered American neo-conservative groups by stating that: [...] "There is nothing right-wing or conservative about wanting to keep our Jewish homeland free from foreign rule. If we are truly the indigenous natives in the conflict, then our cause should really be championed by liberal students everywhere. Especially since the Bush administration that occupies Iraq and imposes a Patriot Act on <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> the very same administration pushing to ethnically cleanse the Jewish people from portions of our homeland." [...] ZFA views the Jewish people as indigenous to the Middle East and the victims of Western imperialism. Leading activists of the movement have often pointed out that Great Britain, the United Nations and even the United States government did everything in their power to prevent a Jewish state from coming into existence. The Zionist struggle, according to ZFA, is therefore an anti-imperialist struggle aimed at liberating the land of Israel from foreign rule and securing the Jewish peopleâ€™s right to self determination in their country.|$|E
