However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see Production and availability). Thus, the availability of indium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount.

5|$|Although {{the debate}} at large traces its roots {{back to the}} end of World War II, <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>debate</b> began in 1992 with the {{retirement}} of the last active Iowa-class battleship, , {{as a result of the}} reduced demand for naval artillery, the rise of ship and submarine-launched missiles and aircraft-launched precision guided munitions (such as laser-guided bombs, which can accurately strike and destroy an enemy target with a single strike). The most striking point of the debate in the United States centers on battleships: owing to the longtime maintenance and upkeep that the four completed Iowa-class battleships have undergone during their time in the navy's active and mothball fleets, many still view battleships as viable solutions for gunfire support, and these members have questioned if the navy can adequately replace the gunfire support provided by a battleship's main guns with the smaller guns on its current fleet of cruisers and destroyers.|$|E

2500|$|Much of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>debate</b> {{focuses on}} two {{particular}} types of mechanisms. One of these assumes energy or resource transport across the external {{surface area of}} three-dimensional organisms is the key factor driving the relationship between metabolic rate and body size. The surface area in question may be skin, lungs, intestines, or, {{in the case of}} unicellular organisms, cell membranes. In general, the surface area (SA) of a three dimensional object scales with its volume (V) as SA = cV⅔, where c is a proportionality constant. [...] The Dynamic Energy Budget model is currently the most promising version of these, and it predicts exponents that vary between ⅔ – 1, depending on the organism's developmental stage, basic body plan and resource density ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{incubation}} {{effect can}} be observed in TOT states, where the passage of time alone can influence the resolution of the state and result in successful recall. Also, the presence of a TOT state is a good predictor that the problem can be resolved correctly, although this has been shown to occur more frequently with older-young-adults than young-adults or seniors. This is evidence for both the metacognitive perspective as well as the psycholinguistic perspective. [...] It demonstrates the devotion of resources to searching memory, a source of cumulative information, for the desired correct information, and it also shows that we are aware of what information we know or do not know. This is why <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>debate</b> between the psycholinguistic view of TOTs as retrieval failure and the metacognitive view of TOTs as a tool for learning continues.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>debates</b> on geoengineering, here considered as an illustrative metaphor of particular technoscientific promises and ‘techno-fix’ narratives that are emerging in our society. After a brief introduction, where we provide the necessary background to understand the complex issues surrounding geoengineering, we discuss the relevance of this investigation. We then proceed to explore the controversies behind geoengineering, which start with its own definition. The analysis of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>debates</b> around geoengineering experimentation, regulation and deployment reveal some of the dominant narratives of technoscientific progress and highlight important tensions and frictions {{in the relationship between}} science, policy and society. A reflection on these issues suggests the relevance of developing alternative approaches to furthering the ‘democratisation and de alienation’ of geoengineering debates, thus responding to a perceived need for more careful consideration of the normative assumptions that lie behind the idea of deliberately manipulating Earth's climate to offset anthropogenic climate change.

2500|$|There {{have been}} a number of Supreme Court cases {{concerning}} what constitutes valid congressional consent to an interstate compact. [...] In Virginia v. Tennessee, , the Court found that some agreements among states stand even when lacking the explicit consent of Congress. (One example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself, it would not require Congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport.) According to the Court, the Compact Clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is [...] "directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States". The congressional consent issue is at the center of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>debate</b> over the constitutionality of the not yet effective National Popular Vote Interstate Compact entered into by several states plus the District of Columbia.|$|E
2500|$|To illustrate: {{one might}} be tempted to give as {{examples}} of qualia [...] "the pain of a headache, the taste of wine, or the redness of an evening sky". But this list of examples already prejudges a central issue in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>debate</b> on qualia. An analogy might make this clearer. Suppose someone wants to know the nature of the liquid crystal pixels on a television screen, those tiny elements that provide all the distributions of color that go to make up the picture. It would not suffice as an answer to say that they are the [...] "redness of an evening sky" [...] as it appears on the screen. We would protest that their real character was being ignored. One can see that relying on the list above assumes that we must tie sensations not only to the notion of given objects in the world (the [...] "head", [...] "wine", [...] "an evening sky"), but also to the properties with which we characterize the experiences themselves ("redness", for example).|$|E
2500|$|Tel Rehov is an [...] {{important}} Bronze and Iron Age {{archaeological site}} approximately five kilometers south of Beit She'an and three kilometers {{west of the}} Jordan River.

Archaeological excavations have been conducted at Rehov since 1997, under the directorship of Amihai Mazar. The first eight seasons of excavations revealed successive occupational layers from the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age I (12th - 11th centuries BCE). The Iron Age II levels of the site have emerged as a vitally important component in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>debate</b> regarding the chronology of the United Monarchy of Israel. In September 2007, 30 intact beehives dated to the mid-10th to early 9th century BCE were found. The beehives are evidence of an advanced honey-producing beekeeping (apiculture) industry 3,000 years ago in the city, then thought to have a population of about 2,000. The beehives, made of straw and unbaked clay, were found in orderly rows of 100 hives. Organic material (wheat found next to the beehives) was dated using carbon-14 radiocarbon dating at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Also found alongside the hives was an altar decorated with fertility figurines.|$|E

I pursue it through a close reading of Quine’s original text. I will reveal some misunderstandings of Quine’s naturalized epistemology by shedding light on some of the relevant concepts including ‘purely descriptive epistemology’, ‘circularity’, ‘natural science’ and ‘normativity’.
