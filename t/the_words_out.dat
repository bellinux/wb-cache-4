2500|$|The {{episode was}} part of the {{official}} torch relay, and Fenwick ran with the real torch protection team dressed as an official torch bearer. The torch made a special detour from London to the EastEnders set in BBC Elstree, Borehamwood. Fenwick's route saw him carry the torch from the fictional location of Bridge Street, past The Queen Victoria public house and around Albert Square. His part of the relay was 300 metres long, but he had to run across the set for the next scene. He explained that at one point, there are only 12 or 13 seconds between two of his scenes, so would have to run quickly between sets, saying that producers had been timing him. He said: [...] "What the viewers won't see is the running around that I'm doing off screen. I've got to do sprints all the way through, they're actually timing me, and every day I'm beating my personal best. Because it's all about me getting from one set to another and getting all <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>out</b> in the right order and not falling over and not putting the torch out." ...|$|E

[...] He {{thought it was a good}} place to make name for himself, I suppose, for he told Big Bat that he was going to have one of the Indians’ scalps. [...] He had no more than got <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>out</b> of his mouth before he yelled, [...] "My God, I am shot." [...] I heard this cry and looked around, Buffalo Chips was falling over into the hole where the Indians were hiding. [...] Bat was looking into the cave where the Indians were, and about five seconds afterwards jumped out with an Indian’s scalp in his hand, telling me that he had scalped one of the redskins alive, which I found out to be true. [...] He had seen the Indian that killed Buffalo Chips, and he jumped down onto him as the Indian was reaching to get White’s six-shooter. [...] Bat had jumped right down on top of him and scalped him and got out of the cave before anybody knew what he was doing." [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] White was a boyhood friend of Col. Cody and also a scout. He wanted to be like Buffalo Bill and acquired the sobriquet [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] when Gen. Phillip Sheridan said he was more like Buffalo Chips than Buffalo Bill.

2500|$|Reading [...] "For this commandment that I command {{you this}} day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth, {{and in your}} heart," [...] a Midrash related the commandments to the human body.

[...] Rabbi Hiyya taught {{that the law is}} a salve for the eye, an {{emollient}} for a wound, and a root-drink for the bowels. The law is a salve for the eye, as [...] says, [...] "The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes." [...] The law is an emollient for a wound, as [...] says, [...] "It shall be health to your navel."

[...] Another Midrash read [...] "For this commandment that I command you this day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth," [...] together with [...] "For they are life to those who find them," [...] to teach that the commandments are life for those who speak them aloud. The Midrash related that a disciple of Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob used to run through all of his study in a single hour, and when once when he fell ill, he forgot all that he had learned, because he did not speak <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>out</b> loud. When, however, Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob prayed for him, all his learning came back to him. Another Midrash read [...] together with [...] to teach that the commandments are life to those who tell them to others. Another Midrash read [...] together with [...] "For they are life to those who find them," [...] to teach that the commandments are life to those who carry out the commandments completely, for Deuteronomy repeatedly says, [...] "all the commandment" [...] ( [...] , kol ha-mitzvah), which the Midrash taught means until one completely carries out all the precepts. And the Midrash taught that the conclusion of [...] "health to all their flesh," [...] refers to all the parts of the body, demonstrating the force of [...] "For this commandment that I command you this day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart." ...|$|E
