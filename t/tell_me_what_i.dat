The song's lyrics contain sarcastic backing vocals with Madonna asking rhetorical questions based on her real-life actions, such as [...] "Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. I must have been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?" [...] Madonna explained that the lyrics were about [...] "basically saying don't put me in a box, don't pin me down, don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can and can't say. It's about breaking out of the restraints." [...] With the Los Angeles Times she further clarified that there was a defensiveness with the lyrics for [...] "Human Nature": ...|$|E
500|$|Sawyer and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) {{were the}} least-liked {{characters}} by viewers {{during the first}} few episodes, because, according to Lindelof, [...] "they were just really obnoxious, bad guys". In later episodes, however, Sawyer and Jin changed to be more likable. Towards the beginning of [...] "Confidence Man", Sawyer is seen reading the novel Watership Down by Richard Adams (this is the book that caused Boone to think that Sawyer took Shannon's inhaler). The novel has numerous similarities to Lost, including [...] "letting go", and building a society. Furthermore, the protagonists of Watership Down are rabbits – a recurring motif in Lost. The episode ends with a montage of various characters performing different activities, featuring the song [...] "I Shall Not Walk Alone", written by Ben Harper and performed by The Blind Boys of Alabama. One lyric from the song is, [...] "I just reach for mother Mary"; Sawyer's mother's name is Mary, and, according to reviewer Therese Odell from the Houston Chronicle, the lyric may be alluding to this. Also, percussionist Ryan McKinnie of The Blind Boys of Alabama said of many members of the group's blindness, [...] "Our disability doesn’t have to be a handicap. It's not about what you can't do. It's about what you do. And what we do is sing good gospel music." [...] This quotation is very similar to the oft-repeated quotation by many characters (especially Locke), [...] "Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can't do." ...|$|E
