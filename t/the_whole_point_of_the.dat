It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another.

500|$|Having {{not been}} in a proper studio since [...] "Deadweight", Beck felt anxious to [...] "go in and just do some stuff real quick", and {{compiled}} several songs he had had for years. Beck and his bandmates hammered out fourteen songs in fourteen days, although just twelve made it onto the album, 1998's Mutations. Beck decided on Nigel Godrich, producer for Radiohead's OK Computer the previous year, to be behind the boards for the project. Godrich was leaving the United States for England in a short time, {{which led to the}} album's quick production schedule—"No looking back, no doctoring anything". <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record was to capture the performance of the musicians live, an uncharacteristic far-cry from the cut-and-paste aesthetic of Odelay. Though the album was originally slated for release by Bong Load Records, Geffen intervened and issued the record against Beck's wishes. The artist then sought to void his contracts with both record labels, and in turn the labels sued him for breach of contract. The litigation went on for years and it remains unclear to this day if it has ever been completely resolved. Beck was later awarded Best Alternative Music Performance for Mutations at the 42nd Grammy Awards.|$|E
500|$|Blackburn {{directed}} the 2008 film Donkey Punch, which he co-wrote with David Bloom. His total {{budget for the}} film was £1 million. Blackburn's production team went through a casting process which took seven months; the film stars Nichola Burley, Tom Burke, Jaime Winstone and Julian Morris. He shot the film in South Africa, over 24 days. Film shooting for Donkey Punch began in March 2007; during production Blackburn dealt with actors afflicted by hypothermia and tidal surges on location. In an interview with Total Film, Blackburn commented, [...] "I think Donkey Punch is an extreme thriller or an extreme reality-based thriller. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film is it's grounded in reality." [...] Blackburn wrote that he made [...] Donkey Punch, [...] "to try to push the genre." [...] Donkey Punch received mixed reviews; the film obtained a rating of 50% based on 51 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes, and a score of 43 out of 100 at Metacritic. The Philadelphia Inquirer compared Blackburn's work to films including filmmaker Peter Berg's Very Bad Things and director Philip Noyce's Dead Calm, and wrote, [...] "Donkey Punch offers a gripping mix of sexual heat and nasty menace." [...] The Los Angeles Times additionally compared Blackburn's work to Dead Calm as well as director Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water, and concluded, Donkey Punch isn't without a certain power as it gleefully turns its careless hedonists into caged, paranoid rats." [...] The film was Blackburn's first work to be shown at the Sundance Film Festival, where it received a positive reception from the audience in attendance.|$|E
500|$|Pollock {{returned}} to office as Mint Director in 1869. Although Pollock opposed redemption, Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell did not, and a bill allowing for redemption of base-metal coins {{in lots of}} at least $20 {{was signed into law}} by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 3, 1871. By then, early versions of what became the Coinage Act of 1873 were being considered by Congress. This was a major piece of legislation that reformed the laws relating to the Mint. As introduced by Ohio Senator John Sherman on April 28, 1870, it included Linderman's proposal for the use of copper-nickel in the minor coins. The debate over the bill stretched over the next three years. The use of nickel was a sticking point for the legislation; some congressmen alleged that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill was to benefit Wharton. Between 1870 and 1872, different versions of the bill, with a larger three-cent piece, twice passed the House and once the Senate, but differences between the houses could not be reconciled. After the second House passage, in May 1872, the Senate Finance Committee struck the provisions for copper-nickel coinage. After a conference committee met, both houses passed a version that left the cent, three-cent nickel piece, and nickel unaltered, and it was signed by President Grant on February 12, 1873. The act eliminated the two-cent piece, silver three-cent piece, silver half dime and the standard silver dollar (the last denomination was reinstated in 1878). The three-cent piece was made legal tender to twenty-five cents, as were the other two base-metal coins, the cent and nickel (the surviving silver coins were legal tender to five dollars). Numismatic writer Breen deemed the decision to eliminate the silver three-cent piece and the half dime, which might directly compete with the two copper-nickel coins, a favor to Wharton. Carothers called the abolition of the silver three- and five-cent pieces [...] "a necessity if the 3 cent and 5 cent nickel pieces were to be continued after the revival of silver coinage".|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{original}} suggestion by Scaliger, san-pi means [...] "written like a san and a pi together". Here, [...] "san" [...] refers not to the archaic letter san (i.e. Ϻ) itself, but to [...] "san" [...] as a mere synonym of [...] "sigma", referring to the outer curve of the modern ϡ as resembling an inverted lunate sigma. This reading is problematic because it fits the shape only of the modern (late Byzantine) sampi but presupposes active use of an archaic nomenclature that had long since lost currency {{by the time that}} shape emerged. According to a second hypothesis, san-pi would originally have meant [...] "the san that stands next to pi in the alphabet". This proposal thus presupposes the historical identity between sampi and ancient san (Ϻ), which indeed stood behind Π. However, this account too is problematic as it implies a very early date of the emergence of the name, since after the archaic period {{the original}} position of san was apparently no longer remembered, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of sampi in the numeral system is that it stands somewhere else. Yet a different hypothesis interprets san-pi in the sense of [...] "the san that resembles pi". This is usually taken as referring to the modern ϡ shape, presupposing that the name san alone had persisted from antiquity until the time the sign took that modern shape. None of these hypotheses has wide support today. The most commonly accepted explanation of the name today is that san pi (...) simply means [...] "like a pi", where the word san is unrelated to any letter name but simply the modern Greek preposition [...] ("like", from ancient Greek [...] ).|$|E

Besides, this explanation involves the sacrifice of the whole significance of the allegory, and the reduction of The Ring to the plane of a child's conception of The Sleeping Beauty.
