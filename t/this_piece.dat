5|$|The Scottish Symphony (Symphony No. 3 in A minor) {{was written}} and revised {{intermittently}} between 1829 (when Mendelssohn noted down the opening theme {{during a visit}} to Holyrood Palace) and 1842, when it was given its premiere in Leipzig, the last of his symphonies to be performed in public. <b>This</b> <b>piece</b> evokes Scotland's atmosphere in the ethos of Romanticism, but does not employ any identified Scottish folk melodies.|$|E
5|$|A {{preoccupation with}} his own {{mortality}} permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based {{on a number of}} poems on the theme of death). <b>This</b> <b>piece</b> also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony used throughout. Shostakovich dedicated this score to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Bresnahan also {{developed}} the first batting helmet. He {{was hit in}} the head with a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907. Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet, though <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s. Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching.|$|E

The Société des Amis du Louvre donated the Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, and in 1863 an expedition uncovered the sculpture Winged Victory of Samothrace in the Aegean Sea. <b>This</b> <b>piece,</b> though heavily damaged, has been prominently displayed since 1884. The 583-item Collection La Caze donated in 1869, included works by Chardin; Fragonard; Rembrandt – such as Bathsheba at Her Bath – and Gilles by Watteau.|$|E

The camera then follows {{the members of the}} family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The original opening was created by David Silverman, and was the first task he did when production began on the show. The series' distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. <b>This</b> <b>piece</b> has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.|$|E

The target of <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> of biomimicry is the structure of the mounds of termites such as Macrotermes michaelseni which effectively cool the nests of these social insects. The properties of the Namib desert beetle's exoskeleton, in particular its wing-cases (elytra) which have bumps with hydrophilic (water-attracting) tips and hydrophobic (water-shedding) sides, have been mimicked in a film coating designed for the British Ministry of Defence, to capture water in arid regions.|$|E
5|$|One proof Bicentennial coin {{in silver}} clad and lacking a mint mark, {{similar to the}} dollar in the {{prototype}} set given to President Ford, is known. <b>This</b> <b>piece</b> supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the Woodward & Lothrop department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for Coin World, spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and lost to the numismatic community. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Other {{variants}} {{were designed}} by Viquesney to depict different doughboy poses, but very few got past the drawing stage and none were ever realized at full scale. The largest variant actually known to be by Viquesney is a unique three-foot memorial in Lakemore, Ohio, also listed as The Spirit of the Doughboy by the Smithsonian. It was copyrighted in 1930 and dedicated in 1938. No full-sized Viquesney doughboys in any pose other than the original have been confirmed to exist. New information and photographs confirm <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> is actually titled Resting Doughboy and was copyrighted in 1936.|$|E

5|$|Two of Alkan's {{substantial}} {{works from}} this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op.45 (1856), follows {{a section of the}} poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op.52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 ("By the waters of Babylon..."). <b>This</b> <b>piece</b> is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which {{is believed to be the}} sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} {{pieces were}} stolen {{at an estimated}} loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. One of the paintings, The Concert, was Gardner's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It {{is thought to be}} the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting, with a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, is Rembrandt's only known seascape. The bronze finial was taken from the top of a Napoleonic flag, possibly appearing like gold to the thieves. The museum is offering a $100,000 reward for <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> alone.|$|E

5|$|Thaïs (1894), {{composed}} for Sanderson, was moderately received. Like Werther, it did {{not gain}} widespread popularity among French opera-goers until its first revival, which was {{four years after the}} premiere, by when the composer's association with Sanderson was over. In the same year he had a modest success in Paris with the one-act Le portrait de Manon at the Opéra-Comique, and a much greater one in London with La Navarraise at Covent Garden. The Times commented that in <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> Massenet had adopted the verismo style of such works as Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana to great effect. The audience clamoured for the composer to acknowledge the applause, but Massenet, always a shy man, declined to take even a single curtain call.|$|E
5|$|The westernmost {{portion of}} what is now NY251 between NY383 in Scottsville and the {{junction}} of River and Quaker Roads south of the village was once part of Route15, an unsigned legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature. Route15 was extended northward from its original terminus in Caledonia to Scottsville via River Road on July24, 1911; however, it was realigned on March1, 1921, to enter Scottsville on modern NY383 instead. When the first set of posted routes were assigned in New York in 1924, <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> of modern NY251 did not receive a designation. Another section did, however, as the portion extending from Mendon east to Victor was designated as part of NY15. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY15 was rerouted between Victor and Pittsford to follow current NY96. The former routing of NY15 from Victor to Mendon became part of NY251, a new highway extending from NY15 in Victor to NY33 in Gates via Chili and Scottsville. West of Scottsville, NY251 was routed on modern NY383 and NY386.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the medieval}} common law, {{there was only}} one way to resolve a dispute seeking the {{repayment}} of money or other contract matters; a writ of debt, which only the Court of Common Pleas could hear. This was archaic, did not work against the executors of a will and involved precise pleading; a minor flaw in the documents put to the court could see the case thrown out. By the middle of the 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using the action of assumpsit, which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit. The argument was based on the idea that there was an inherent promise in a contract to pay the money, and that by failing to pay the defendant had deceived the plaintiff. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded, with the Court of King's Bench agreeing to hear cases under <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> of legal fiction. The judges of the Common Pleas, however, a more traditional group, rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise had been made in addition to the contract.|$|E
