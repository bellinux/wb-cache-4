5|$|Washington's {{introduction}} to surveying began {{at an early}} age through school exercises that taught him the basics of the profession, followed by practical experience in the field. His first experiences at surveying occurred in the territory surrounding Mount Vernon. His first opportunity as a surveyor occurred in 1748 when he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax organized a professional surveying party <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> large tracts of land along the border of western Virginia, where the young Washington gained invaluable experience in the field.|$|E

Cornwallis had his forces occupy the {{earthworks}} immediately surrounding the town because he had received a letter from Clinton that promised relief force of 5,000 men within a week and he wished to tighten his lines. The Americans and the French occupied the abandoned defenses and began to establish their own batteries there. With the British outer defenses in their hands, allied engineers began <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> positions for the artillery. The men improved their works and deepened their trenches. The British also worked on improving their defenses.|$|E

5|$|Malmö FF left Malmö Stadion {{at the end}} of the 2008 Allsvenskan season. The last Allsvenskan match {{played at}} the stadium was the team's final game of the season, against GIF Sundsvall on 9 November 2008. The match was won 6–0 by Malmö FF, who wore a special kit {{designed}} to honour the legacy of the stadium. Malmö FF still uses the stadium for training purposes and youth matches. IFK Malmö returned to Malmö Stadion for the 2009 season. The move was done in protest against Malmö Stad's decision <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> an artificial turf at Malmö IP. Since returning to Malmö Stadion, IFK Malmö's average attendance has been around 100–200 spectators per match. The team currently plays in Division 4, the sixth tier of Swedish football.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} hear two sermons {{before the}} election: one before actually entering the conclave, and one {{once they are}} settled in the Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> {{the current state of}} the Church, and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time. The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household and a member of the Capuchin Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the conclave.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea came}} to him after {{attending}} the first Jubilee {{in the city of}} Rome, in 1300, where he realized that Rome's many historical achievements were well-known, and he desired <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> a history of the origins of his own city of Florence. In his Cronica, Villani described in detail the many building projects of the city, statistical information on population, ordinances, commerce and trade, education, and religious facilities. He also described several disasters such as famines, floods, fires, and the pandemic of the Black Death in 1348, which would take his own life. Villani's work on the Cronica was continued by his brother and nephew after his death. It has been described as the first introduction of statistics as a positive element in history.|$|E

5|$|From {{a handful}} of company designs, Saville {{selected}} Hughes Aircraft to make the FCS. Saville worked closely with Dr. Ruben F. Mettler of Hughes, <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> the desired strategy of the weapons system and to describe the expected fighter tactics. This weapon would eventually be developed as the AIM-4 Falcon after much urging by Saville. The Falcon was used successfully {{for more than a}} decade, beginning in 1956. Designing an aircraft around a weapons system was something Saville had witnessed in the development of Bell's P-39 Airacobra around a large autocannon, but he further refined the concept and made it a requirement for government contractors, a practice that is continued to this day. Saville put an end to specific design goals in aircraft requests for proposal (RFPs); instead, he briefed potential designers on general requirements and discussed with them the defense problems the aircraft was to solve.|$|E
5|$|Penn sent three commissioners to {{supervise}} the settlement and to set aside 10,000 acres (40km²) for the city. The commissioners bought land from Swedes at the settlement of Wicaco, and from there began <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> the city toward the north. The area went about a mile along the Delaware River between modern South and Vine Streets. Penn's ship anchored {{off the coast of}} New Castle, Delaware, on October 27, 1682, and he arrived in Philadelphia a few days after that. He expanded the city west to the bank of the Schuylkill River, for a total of 1,200 acres (4.8km²). Streets were laid out in a gridiron system. Except for the two widest streets, High (now Market) and Broad, the streets were named after prominent landowners who owned adjacent lots. The streets were renamed in 1684; the ones running east-west were named after local trees (Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, Cherry, Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, Lombard, and Cedar) and the north-south streets were numbered. Within the area, four squares (now named Rittenhouse, Logan, Washington and Franklin) were set aside as parks open for everyone. Penn designed a central square at the intersection of Broad and what is now Market Street to be surrounded by public buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle Ages cruck timber {{construction}} {{was used in}} cottages, but the most common building material was stone. From the twelfth century, burghs contained the houses of significant inhabitants, but little has survived of the urban housing of the poor. In the early modern era most {{of the population was}} housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. Most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets, with temporary sheilings becoming permanent settlements. The standard layout of a house was a byre-dwelling or long house, with humans and livestock sharing a common roof. Cottages in the Highlands tended to be cruder while those from the Lowlands had distinct rooms and were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. In towns, traditional thatched half-timbered houses occurred beside the larger, stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. In the eighteenth century new farm buildings replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. The Industrial Revolution transformed the scale of Scottish towns. Gridiron plans were used <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> new towns in Edinburgh, Glasgow and smaller burghs. In Glasgow the growing workforce was lived in squalid sub-urban tenements like those of the Gorbals. New towns aimed at improving society through the foundation of architecturally designed communities, were an important part of Scottish thinking from the mid-eighteenth century.|$|E
