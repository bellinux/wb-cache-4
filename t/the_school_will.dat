5|$|The University of Colorado's School of Pharmacy (SOP) {{began in}} 1911 as a {{division}} of the School of Medicine in Boulder. It became an independent college in 1913 and a school in 1957. It received its accreditation in 1938–1939 and awarded a B.S. in Pharmacy degree in 1995–1996 when it received a full accreditation status awarding the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree by the ACPE.

As Principal Skinner considers a ramp for the school, mafia boss Fat Tony emerges and suggests that his construction company would be a good choice of company to build it. Although the new ramp system almost immediately collapses, Fat Tony informs Skinner that the construction supposedly cost US$200,000 and that <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>will</b> still have to pay.

Principal Victoria asks Cartman to stick to the script during announcements, but he accuses her of trying to silence him, and brings in the American Civil Liberties Union to ensure his freedom of speech. Cartman's announcements are soon broadcast as the politically themed [...] "EC" [...] show on televisions placed in each classroom.
