2500|$|Following {{the death}} of Charles XII in 1718, and the defeat in the Great Northern War (1700–1721) the Swedish capital was a city in despair, {{preparing}} for a Russian attack and encamped by impoverished, refugees, and idle soldiers. [...] The southern lock {{of the city was}} approaching a century in age, a bottleneck in a state of decay, inadequate for both the larger shipping vessels of the era and the increasing traffic load. [...] While Göran Josuæ Adelcrantz (1668–1739), the pupil and successor of Tessin the Younger, was mostly occupied by the construction works of the new Royal Palace, in 1622 he accomplished an emergency repair of the old lock; workers wading between the temporary embankments filling cracks with clay, straw, and muck, while loose and missing planks were put back in place. These measure not only ended much more expensive than intended but also proved completely insufficient, and as the decay had obviously made the old lock impossible to repair properly, Christopher Polhem (1661–1751), [...] "the father of Swedish mechanics", was consulted for a new construction. The proposal of Adelcrantz for a new construction, estimated to cost 32,741 riksdaler in silver coins, was passed over by a suggested repair of the old lock by Johan Eberhard Carlberg (1683–1773) in 1726, limited in cost to 30,000 rikdaler while implying widening the canal from 6,5 to 8,2 meters, a proposal to the taste of the city's building board which subsequently had Adelcrantz replaced by Carlberg. [...] The latter, however, was a daring man and he quickly produced a proposal for a new lock south of the old, a proposal which implied not only the demolition of the city's brewery, but also the discontinuation of the bar iron deposit next to the lock (the biggest in Europe, representing about 40% of the global market at the time). By 1728, however, the city had accepted the need for a new construction, and, as Carlberg was busy with other undertakings, finally assigned Polhem for the project in 1729. [...] The proposal for a wooden construction he produced the following year didn't please the board which had anticipated a more lasting construction in stone, and as the whole affair failed <b>to</b> <b>conclude,</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> wasn't signed until 1744. [...] At the age of 93 years, only days before his death, Polhem was reward the knighthood of the Royal Order of the Polar Star, {{at the bottom of the}} lock. [...] Finally inaugurated on May 2, 1755, Polhems sluss ("Lock of Polhem"), was 3,9 meters deep, 12,5 meters wide, and 59 meters long; in the western end overpassed by a drawbridge flanked by two brick towers on either side and therefore called Röda Slussen ("The Red Lock"). [...] With the new lock the surrounding area changed considerably in character; on the square south of the lock a triangular block was built, named Strykjärnet ("The [...] Iron"); several old wooden buildings were replaced by new in stone; and an eastern bridge was added over the canal named Blå Slussen ("The Blue Lock") after the blue hoisting device.|$|E

40|$|This Master's thesis {{focuses on}} the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), {{better known as the}} Vienna Convention. The main purpose of this thesis is to {{evaluate}} conditions for application of this international treaty and to assess the contracting process under the CISG including the similarities and differences with the Czech national legislation. Finally, it seeks an answer to the question, which of these rules (international or national) are more advantageous for a Czech contractual party with respect <b>to</b> <b>concluding</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract.</b> The thesis is divided into five parts. The first one represents an introduction to the CISG, its origin and the Czech Republic's attitude to it. The second part identifies the conditions for application of the CISG and therefore defines a subject and an object of <b>an</b> international <b>contract</b> of sale under the CISG. Both third and fourth parts gradually introduce two phases of the contracting process (offer and acceptance) including the relevant case-law. The last chapter strives to complete the <b>contracting</b> process with <b>an</b> analysis of the exact moment, when <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> is <b>concluded,</b> as well as with an analysis of a potential battle of the forms and its impact on <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> conclusion...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a new pricing strategy, {{which leads}} to a certain variability of prices as the supplier offers to fix prices to performance parameters of long-lasting industrial goods. The underlying idea is to give a signal of the supplier's competence and/or <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract,</b> which contains additional value for both parties to the market. Some theoretical findings are applied to this concept and lead to 13 hypotheses, especially dealing with the perceptions of the buyer. Empirical research covered 131 German mechanical engineering companies. The data were used to evaluate the use of performance-based pricing and test the hypotheses. The results show a mixed picture. Uncertainty-reducing effects are well perceived while other assumptions could not be confirmed. Based on the results recommendations are developed on how and when to apply performance-based pricing.

40|$|The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies has {{recently}} published a paper which concludes that agreement between Russia and China for pipeline gas exports {{may not be}} reached this year or even in 2012.

On {{the other side of the}} border Gazprom does not want to compromise on the principle of oil-linked pricing on which it is insisting in its European export contracts. Both sides believe themselves to be in a powerful position without the need for compromise, but the paper suggests that if the first pipeline project could be located in Eastern Siberia – instead of the Altai line from Western Siberia which is Gazprom’s priority – then it would be easier to agree a price acceptable to both parties...|$|E
40|$|Examines the {{assumptions}} and beliefs {{on the part}} of contracting parties when deciding whether to enter into a proposed transaction. Explores the question of whether, on ordinary legal principles, an unknown and unsuspected adverse change in the facts between the time when the facts were originally represented and the moment when they induced the representee <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> on the strength of them is tantamount to innocent misrepresentation {{on the part of}} the ignorant representor who, quite truthfully at the time, asserted the subsequently falsified facts.

Asserts that the answers to both questions are interesting and important not merely because they appear not yet to have been unambiguously determined in the courts of major Anglo-Common Law legal systems, but also because the Contractual Remedies Act 1979, which governs the jural effects of causative pre-contractual misrepresentations in NZ, assumes and absorbs the ruling common law conception of 2 ̆ 7 actionable misrepresentation 2 ̆ 7...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to define the cathegory of {{peremptory}} rules in private international law and to describe their specific use in the commercial domain compared to business to consumer contractual relations. The reason for my research was my concern for {{the conflict between the}} formal possibility <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> and the actual enforceability of the contractual claims before a court or before alternative dispute resolution bodies in the domain of private international law. A major part of the thesis uses an analytical approach and a grammatical, teleological and logical interpretation of the mentioned legal instruments. The final part is grounded on the legal comparation of several laws across different countries and thus demonstrating how different approaches to peremtory rules may influence the actual interpetation of various legal relations and the contractual liberty in general. The thesis is composed of four chapters and a conclusion. To begin with, the first chapter focuses on the peremptory rules in international commercial relations as a whole. It aims to define the core notion of the peremptory rules. It also reals with a personal and material scope of the thesis - the particularities of commercial relations.

This thesis is divided into six parts, which are further systematically divied into chapters. First part gives basic historical review of development of legal regulation of advocacy since ancient Rome. Second part gives definitions of the most important terms of this thesis - attorney and client, with evident orientation on legal regulation of conditions which must fulfil a person in orded to become an attorney. Third part deals with possible methods of constitution of legal relationship between attorney and client (<b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> or to be appointed by court or to be designated by Czech bar assosiation) and related attorney's obligation to refuse to plead client in certain situations as well as termination of this relationship.

40|$|When {{proceeding}} <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> {{trading partners}} usually hope that their Joint agreement will be executed without any major disturbances {{and both sides}} will be - fully satisfied. In practice, however, disputes between the sides to a contract often arise. It is only a relatively small group of causes that contains an elenent of forco majeure in it, {{that is to say}} their occurrence does not depend on man's will to any extent whatsoever, while all the others result generally from negligence, recklessness, or human fallibility. This group of causes was submitted to a more detailed analysis. Thus, for example, at the stage of preparing and negotiating a contract it may happen that an incomplete offer has been submitted, the quality of goods has not been negotiated precisely, or an error has been made in the content of a contract or {{in the form of an}} arbitration clause contained in it. More various errors could be distinguished at the stage of a direct execution of a trade agreement, e. g. a failure to send a shipping Instruction on time, typing errors, unpunctual payments, wrong packaging of goods and others. This article does not list, of course, all causes of disputes in foreign trade, still it is based on an analysis of a number of controversial situations, which made their way to the Board of Arbitrators attached to the Polish Chamber of Foreign Trade in the 70 s and the 80 s.
