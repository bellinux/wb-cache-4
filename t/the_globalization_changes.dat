The question the project wants to answer is: How does {{the advent of}} the globalization erode the solidarity in Denmark, and does it put a mark on our universal welfare model? The project looks at trends in the society in the period after 1864 and considers the solidarity, political parties and unions as a great importance to the society. In this period the basis for the solidarity and today's welfare model, is helped by growth periods and incipient industrialization. The welfare state is based on solidarity, which was based on the workers fight, but also that solidarity did not last, but changes. From a sociological approach the project uses Anthony Giddens, Émile Durkheim and Jodi Dean focused on issues of solidarity and follows its development. You will also see echoes of the concept of solidarity throughout the project. In the political angle Bent Greve explains three different welfare models as it is today. Abraham Maslow psychological theory develops a hierarchical pyramid of human needs showing that some needs are more important than others as a basis for something more important than another. With light and flashlight the project tries and indentifies possible answers and solutions to the challenges of solidarity and universal that the welfare model faces. Globalization's entry into the Danish society is clearly marked and includes challenges against the welfare model and solidarity in the Danish society...|$|E

Balkan countries as developing nations are in the realization process of <b>the</b> <b>globalization</b> <b>changes</b> of the world economy. Being in the process for entry into the EU, many changes are being done to integrate with the global economic trends. The research has shown that after the fall of communism in the 1990 s the Balkan Region brought significant political and economic changes. The change in attitude led to a removal of direct blockage for FDI. As a result, continued deregulation and privatization has been widespread. However, history of FDI is relatively short for Balkan Region in comparison with other countries. The economy opened up capital inflows only at the beginning of 1990 s, and is still showing low shares in the total of Central and Eastern European flow. Despite Balkan’s competitive advantage due to its geographical location and its resources, it is still far from other Central European countries in achieving the same level of FDI. This situation came as a result of: political instability, low intraregional trade, the small size of national markets, huge institutional corruption and weak judiciary system. Among the more successful Balkan recipients of FDI has been Bulgaria and Romania, while Greece has been a major source of FDI for the transition economies of the Balkan region. Greek investment is driven in part by the availability of low cost labor in the nearby transition economies. The focus {{of this article is to}} analyze and evaluate the current performance of FDI in Balkan Region and how the governments can improve this performance...|$|E

The management of an IVWT whose members are geographically dispersed represents a real challenge. Some argue that within those teams the cultural factor has no implications, since the contact of the members themselves is being achieved only within the virtual space. Our opinion is that the situation is quite opposite. We should be able to find elements of the cultural national dimensions which are influencing IVWT. If they are ignored, by non implementing a intercultural management, they could become an obstacle to achieving the desired IVWT performance. A such example of a company which, by its specific activities, uses extensively IVWT, is Delamode Group BV.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to model costly international trade, which includes the standard approach, the "iceberg" transport cost, as a special case. The key idea is to make the technologies of supplying the good depend on the destination of the good. To demonstrate our approach, we extend the Ricardian model with a continuum of goods, due to Dornbusch, Fischer and Samuelson (1977), by introducing multiple factors of production and by making each industry consist of the domestic division, which supplies the good at home, and the export division, which supplies the good abroad. If the two divisions differ only in the total factor productivity, our model becomes isomorphic to the DFS model with the iceberg transport cost. When the two divisions differ also in <b>the</b> factor intensity, <b>globalization</b> <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> relative factor prices in the same direction across the countries, {{in sharp contrast to the}} usual Stolper-Samuelson effect, which suggests that the relative factor prices move in different irections in different countries. ...|$|R

Following this, we examine socially just pedagogical strategies that might be used to serve diverse student bodies.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>the</b> <b>globalization</b> - disinflation hypothesis {{from the}} perspective of a open economy neo keynesian framework. This hypothesis proposes that <b>globalization</b> has <b>changed</b> <b>the</b> long-run inflation process, resulting in a global disinflation. If true, it makes us wonder about the merit of central banks in this phenomenon. Even more, challenges our knowledge that long-run inflation is ultimately a monetary issue. This paper explicitly addresses this hyphotesis, analyzing how different degrees of <b>globalization</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> response of output and inflation to supply shocks. To accomplish this, the use of a general equilibrium approach in which we can identify shocks and openness is a must. Globalization is however, a complex process. In this paper I explicitly model globalization just as an openness process. Simulation results suggest that as long as there is one distortion - free market for assets, the discussion about the changed values of price stickiness measures which would affect the long-run inflation process is of reduced importance. It is also suggested that financial integration, and not trade or competition, is the key to understanding <b>the</b> link between <b>globalization</b> and inflation. ...|$|R
