50|$|Versions of Scotch Roman were {{subsequently}} released {{by a number}} of other <b>typefoundries,</b> including both Linotype and Monotype, in the early twentieth century. These were generally derived from the A.D. Farmer design, and shared with it a number of modifications such as a flat-topped lowercase t.|$|R
50|$|In Britain and the U.S.A., many {{proposals}} for type size standardization {{had been made}} by the end of 19th century (such as Bruce <b>Typefoundry's</b> mathematical system that was based on a precise geometric progression). However, no nationwide standard was created until the American Point System was decided in 1886.|$|R

50|$|Sabon was {{designed}} to be a typeface that would give the same reproduction on both Monotype and Linotype systems and therewere also matrices made for <b>typefoundries.</b> All type produced could be interchanged. It was used early after its release by Bradbury Thompson to set the Washburn College Bible. A “Sabon Next” was later released by Linotype as an ‘interpretation’ of Tschichold's original Sabon.|$|R
50|$|After Jan van Krimpen died − De Does' {{predecessor}} at Enschedé − {{the production}} of quality books stopped being a top priority at Enschedé, and De Does decided to leave, {{to work for the}} Querido publishing house. He was asked to come back to Enschedé a year later, which he did. He designed annual reports, commemorative volumes and type specimens. He also designed and printed his own books at his private press, Spectatorpers. Around 1970, Enschedé developed a renewed interest in publishing, and Bram de Does could design several beautiful books. One of the most perfected is the book <b>Typefoundries</b> in the Netherlands. It was published in 1978, and {{is a prime example of}} fine Dutch printing and publishing. Incidentally, it was also the last book Enschedé published that was printed entirely by letterpress. De Does is known for his attention for detail and perfectionism; for the <b>Typefoundries</b> in the Netherlands, he personally supervised {{the production of}} the paper (produced with his own recipe) and he insisted that the book should be printed by one person in a specially equipped room.|$|R

5000|$|... “The {{range of}} work and types shown in My Study of Letterpress Typography, a beautifully {{designed}} and printed (in Japan) large octavo, is truly extraordinary. How did this man from the 1930s onwards collect together the gems of the European <b>typefoundries</b> and put them to such good use {{that they could have}} come from the hands of any of the most able European typographers? His list of typefaces reads like a roll-call of the great and the good [...] [...] [...] [...]Juzo has achieved all this with little or no knowledge of English. And still going strong, now inspiring another generation of young Japanese typographers.” ...|$|R
50|$|John Fry's other son, Joseph Fry (1728-1787), was apprenticed to Henry Portsmouth of Basingstoke as an apothecary and doctor. He married Portsmouth's daughter, Anna (1719/20-1803). Joseph Fry {{founded a}} {{chocolate}} company called Fry, Vaughan & Co. in Bristol. He also founded Fry and Pine later Joseph Fry & Co., a <b>typefoundry.</b>|$|E
5000|$|He {{first used}} {{the process in}} his edition of Callet’s Tables of Logarithms (1795), in which he secured an {{accuracy}} till then unattainable. He published stereotyped editions of French, English and Italian classics at a very low price. [...] Didot was appointed by Napoleon {{as the director of}} the Imprimerie Impériale <b>typefoundry.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Joseph Fry & Co., the <b>typefoundry,</b> was {{continued}} by Joseph Fry's middle son, Edmund Fry (1757-1835) and renamed Edmund Fry & Co. Edmund Fry had {{two sons}} who survived to adulthood: Windover Fry (1797-1835) and Arthur Fry (1809-1878). Windover joined {{him in the}} business.

50|$|Since 2001, Arion Press {{has been}} a {{cultural}} tenant at the Presidio, where it shares an industrial building with its typecasting division, M & H Type—the oldest and largest hot metal type foundry in the U.S. for letterpress printers. The Arion Press gallery is open daily, and tours of the letterpress print shop, <b>typefoundry,</b> and book bindery are also available to visitors on a weekly schedule.|$|E
5000|$|Arion Press has {{a nonprofit}} branch, the Grabhorn Institute, founded to help {{preserve}} and continue {{the use of}} one of the last integrated <b>typefoundry,</b> letterpress printing, and bookbinding facilities in the world.

5000|$|Nobel is a {{geometric}} sans-serif typeface {{designed by}} Sjoerd Henrik de Roos (1877-1962) and [...] (1909-1998) {{in the period}} 1929-1935 for the Amsterdam Type foundry). Capitalizing upon Lettergieterij Amsterdam's substantial financial interest in the Berlin <b>typefoundry</b> H. Berthold AG, de Roos decided as a Dutch competitor to Futura to license the Berthold foundry's geometric Berthold Grotesk, change some characters and sell it in the Netherlands under this name. The resulting face became very popular in Dutch printing.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Wagener contributed {{abstract}} color wood engravings {{to accompany}} The Fragments of Parmenides, Editions Koch, Berkeley. This book, some {{ten years in}} the making, features a new translation of the Parmenides fragments by Robert Bringhurst, Canadian poet, typographer and author, and uses two new Greek typefaces commissioned for this project by Peter Koch. The first typeface was designed by Christopher Stinehour in a digital format. The second typeface was cut in steel and cast in metal by Dan Carr at the Golgonooza <b>Typefoundry</b> in Ashuelot, New Hampshire.|$|E
5000|$|De Vinne either {{commissioned}} Linn Boyd Benton, or co-designed {{in conjunction}} with Benton, the hugely popular Century Roman typeface for use by The Century Magazine, which his firm printed. [...] For use at his own press, he also commissioned Linotype to produce De Vinne, an updated Elzevir (or French Oldstyle) type, and the Bruce <b>Typefoundry</b> to produce Renner, a Venetian face. However, his biographer Irene Tichenor notes that De Vinne's private correspondence shows he was not closely involved with the design of [...] "De Vinne" [...] and he ultimately was somewhat unhappy with the type.|$|E
50|$|Among these best books was ‘Adieu Aesthetics & Beautiful Pages!’ (Adieu æsthetica & mooie pagina’s!’), {{published}} in 1995 as the catalogue {{for the exhibition}} ‘The Aesthetic World of Jan van Krimpen, Book Designer and Typographer’ in the Museum of the Book/Museum Meermanno-Westreenianum in The Hague and in the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) in New York (1995). For this book Majoor {{was the first to}} use the digital version of Jan van Krimpen’s typeface Romanée (originally cut in 1928 for the Joh. Enschedé <b>typefoundry),</b> which in 1991 had been digitized by Peter Mattias Noordzij and Fred Smeijers for incorporation into the Enschedé Font Foundry (TEFF).|$|E
50|$|From the 1960s, Letterpress {{printing}} {{started to}} decline {{in favor of}} Offset printing. New procedures of text composition appeared—first photocomposition and then desktop publishing from digital sources—which were more rational than those using lead types. But, despite the odds, the Neufville <b>Typefoundry</b> managed to maintain a strong production of lead types through acquisitions of prominent foundries: Fundición Tipográfica Nacional in 1971, the Bauer Type Foundry in 1972, Fonderie Typographique Française in 1974, matrices of the Lettergieterij Amsterdam in 1984, Ludwig & Mayer in 1985, and Fonderies Tyographiques Réunies del Líbano (United Type Foundries of Lebanon) in 1988. In 1974, it opened a branch near Paris, Neufville France, to supply lead types to France, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, an activity that lasted until 1995.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989 Hoyem led Arion {{to acquire}} Mackenzie & Harris, {{the oldest and}} largest {{remaining}} type foundry in the United States, started with equipment displayed at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915. In 2000 {{the future of the}} type foundry and letterpress operations was threatened by eviction, requiring the logistical challenge and expense of moving over 140 tons of equipment and metal type to a suitable new facility. In response, Hoyem founded the nonprofit Grabhorn Institute to help preserve and continue the use of one of the last integrated <b>typefoundry,</b> letterpress printing, and bookbinding facilities, developing it as a living museum and educational and cultural center, open to the public with a gallery and tours as well as an apprenticeship program. The press and foundry relocated to The Presidio of San Francisco as a cultural tenant. In 2000 the hot-metal typecasting and letterpress printing operation was designated by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as part of [...] "the nation's irreplaceable historical and cultural legacy" [...] under its Save America's Treasures program.|$|E
50|$|The Corvinus Press was {{a private}} press {{established}} by George Lionel Seymour Dawson-Damer, Viscount Carlow (1907-1944) in Red Lion Court, off Fleet Street, London in early 1936. Carlow was a keen book-collector, amateur linguist and typographer, and ran the Press purely as a hobby, {{with the help of}} a press-man (latterly Arthur Harry Cardew) and secretary. He was friendly with many of the leading literary figures of the age, some of whom allowed him to print their works at his Press. Corvinus published new work by T. E. Lawrence, James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, Edmund Blunden, Stefan Zweig, Walter de la Mare and H. E. Bates. Carlow was interested in contemporary European typography, and bought new types from the Bauer <b>typefoundry</b> at Frankfurt am Main and other European founders, which he often used in an experimental way at the Corvinus Press. His taste in binding was also individual, and he generally produced a few special copies of each book which he had bound by one of the leading craft bookbinders of the age.|$|E
5000|$|William Caslon {{founded the}} Caslon Foundry in 1739 (previously Godfrey Head's 1685-1700). The other half was {{purchased}} by John James, son of Thomas James. John James also purchased at around 1716-1764, which became the leading English <b>typefoundry</b> of the 18th and early 19th centuries. He acquired moiety of half of Robert Mitch Jacob Ilive in 1840 and later an important purchase was the foundry of Thomas Grover in 1758 - ultimately combining under his direction nine old English Foundries (according to Talbot Reed's [...] "The Old English letter Foundries"). John James, William Caslon I and Baskerville as the only three representatives of the trade in the country. William Caslon I had two apprentices in his Sheffield Foundry, Thomas Cottrell and Joseph Jackson. They started a foundry of their own in direct competition to their employer in 1757. In 1759 Jackson entered the Navy leaving Cottrell to carry on alone. Jackson left the navy in 1763 and continued to be employed in Thomas Cottrell, Neveil's court 1759-1785 Foundry for a short time. He commenced business in a separate Foundry with two fellow workman who helped to find the capital 1764 [...] - [...] 1792. When Jackson died in 1792 it was William Caslon I's grandson, William Caslon III who purchased the foundry in Salisbury Square.|$|E
40|$|Arts et Metiers graphiques (AMG) was a {{prominent}} French graphic arts magazine that was published in 68 issues from 1927 to 1939. Charles Peignot, head of the French <b>typefoundry</b> Deberny et Peignot, created the publication. Deberny et Peignot was the leading company {{of its kind in}} France. It manufactured not only thousands of metal type designs, but also machinery, furniture, and accessories for sale to the typesetting and printing industries. Charles Peignot, a young visionary with presses, metal type, and personal connections at his disposal secured his legacy in graphic arts history with the publication of Arts et Metiers graphiques. In it, he wanted to cover 2 ̆ 2 all the subjects near or far from printing, of its history, and its diverse contemporary manifestations. 2 ̆ 2 In over ten years of publication Peignot 2 ̆ 7 s wide editorial goal encompassed subjects ranging from illustration, the history of the book and printing techniques and the then-expanding disciplines of advertising design and modern art photography. The magazine also featured regular reviews of fine limited-edition books and reprints of classical literature excerpts in typographically innovative layouts. Each edition was printed on high-quality papers with frequent tipped-in plates and inserts. Until the Second World War forced the magazine to cease production, Arts et Metiers graphiques was one of the highest standards for graphic arts magazines of its time. This thesis describes the creation and implementation of a web-based database providing access to the digitzed content of Arts et Metiers graphiques...|$|E
