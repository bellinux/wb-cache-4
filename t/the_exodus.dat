5|$|One of the Old Bay Line's steamers, {{the former}} President Warfield, later became famous as <b>the</b> <b>Exodus</b> ship of book and movie fame, when Jewish {{refugees}} from war-torn Europe sailed aboard her in 1947 in an unsuccessful attempt to emigrate to Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The old President Warfield was {{eventually}} acquired in early 1947 by Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, a Jewish organization helping Holocaust survivors illegally reach Palestine, then under British mandate. The former Baltimore Steam Packet and U.S. Navy steamship was renamed Exodus when she embarked from France for Palestine on July 11, 1947, carrying 4,515passengers. Two Royal Navy destroyers rammed <b>the</b> <b>Exodus</b> {{as she entered}} Palestinian waters near Haifa on July18. British forces boarded the damaged ship and eventually deported the passengers. <b>The</b> <b>Exodus</b> remained in Haifa harbor until 1952, when the derelict caught fire and burned completely. The 1960 film Exodus depicted the refugees' odyssey aboard the former President Warfield.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1894 that Stroma gained its first {{artificial}} landing point, a pier built from Portland cement near Nethertown {{at a cost of}} £800. In 1955, Caithness County Council constructed a new harbour on the south coast of the island at the then great cost of £28,500. Although it was intended to help stem <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> of people from the island, Stroma was abandoned only a few years after the harbour's completion.|$|E
5|$|The Clal Center {{enjoyed a}} high {{occupancy}} rate from government offices, businesses, and private companies until the mid-1980s. The construction of Malha Mall and government facilities at Givat Ram precipitated <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> of many private and government {{firms in the}} 1990s, leaving entire floors of the office tower unoccupied.

40|$|For some time, biblical {{scholars}} have beenintrigued by <b>the</b> recurrence of <b>Exodus</b> lan-guage in Scripture. The theme of “New Exo-dus ” {{has been the}} subject of a number of scholarly works (Holland, 2004; Watts, 1997; Wright, 1992). A scholarly consensus exists around the idea that <b>the</b> first <b>Exodus</b> was paradigmatic for God-followers of future generations. Throughout Scripture, one can hear the echoes of <b>the</b> first <b>Exodus</b> in recurrent ideas, themes, and thought patterns. It is difficult, in fact, to read the Bible without seeing this language on every page. Of course, <b>the</b> original <b>Exodus</b> might have been <b>the</b> only <b>Exodus</b> if it were not for the painfully stub-born hearts of the rescued Israelites.

5|$|To African Americans, {{the story}} of <b>the</b> <b>Exodus</b> was perhaps the central story, the most {{powerful}} image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity – a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today. For me, personally, growing up in far-flung {{parts of the world}} and without firm roots, the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home.|$|E
5|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, many Tutsi left Rwanda to escape Hutu purges. <b>The</b> <b>exodus,</b> which began during the November 1959 arson attacks, continued steadily throughout {{the revolution}}. An official, late-1964 total of 336,000 Tutsi settled {{primarily in the}} four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanganyika (later Tanzania) and Congo-Léopoldville. The exiles, unlike the ethnic Rwandans who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial eras, were seen as refugees by their host countries and began almost immediately to agitate {{for a return to}} Rwanda. Their aims differed; some sought reconciliation with Kayibanda and the new regime, some affiliated with the exiled King Kigeli and others wished to oust the new PARMEHUTU regime from power and establish a socialist republic.|$|E
5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|Czechoslovakia's {{hardline}} {{communist government}} agreed {{to close its}} border with East Germany to choke off <b>the</b> <b>exodus.</b> The closure produced uproar across East Germany and the GDR government's bid to humiliate refugees by expelling them from the country in sealed trains backfired disastrously. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw {{them out of the}} windows. When the trains passed through Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station in an attempt to board. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{alliance}} contracted in 1912, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia {{declared war on}} the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their goal was to definitely expel Turks from Europe. The First Balkan War started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October. The Turkish forces had left the city the day before. The Serbian annexation led to <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> of many Turks: 725 Turkish families left the city on 27 January 1913. The same year, the city population was evaluated at 37,000 by the Serbian authorities.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{claimed that}} {{there was no mention of}} the case in police records held by {{archives}} in Adelaide, but that instead, the incident had been related to him by residents of the district who had known Brown. He also placed it as having occurred between 1860 and 1870. Foster et al. note that this date is highly unlikely, as frontier violence in the district began when squatters arrived in 1843, and was tapering off by 1848 when the murders occurred. By the 1860s, Aboriginal labour was highly sought after by pastoralists in the district due to <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> of white labourers to the Victorian gold rush.|$|E

5|$|Local {{industries}} in Nashik, especially those {{located in the}} Ambad Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation area, were affected due to the large-scale departure of migrant workers. According to a report, 40percent small and medium {{industries in}} the Ambad industrial area had been closed down due to the migration. Though the local industries at Nashik are ancillary units, they provide material to big industries such as Mahindra and Mahindra and Crompton Greaves. Losses resulting from <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> were estimated to be Rs.500– 7billion.|$|E
5|$|Non-governmental organisations {{began to}} move back into the country, but the {{international}} community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime, and most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E
5|$|The city {{struggled}} to make a transition to new industries. During {{the second half of}} the 20th century, the city's recessions were longer than the national average. <b>The</b> <b>exodus</b> of defense companies (such as Lockheed Martin, formed from the merger of the Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta in 1995) and the electrical-manufacturing industry played a major role in Utica's recent economic distress. From 1975 to 2001, the city's economic growth rate was similar to that of Buffalo, while other upstate New York cities such as Rochester and Binghamton outperformed both.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} sources {{used by the}} evangelist were the Jewish scriptures (the Tanakh, more or less identical with the Christian Old Testament), probably in the Greek translation. John quotes from them directly, references important figures from them, and uses narratives from them {{as the basis for}} several of the discourses. But the author was also familiar with non-Jewish sources: the Logos of the prologue (the Word that is with God from the beginning of creation) derives from both the Jewish concept of Lady Wisdom and from the Greek philosophers, while John 6 alludes not only to <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> but also to Greco-Roman mystery cults, while John 4 alludes to Samaritan messianic beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was well-received in Serbia and abroad; {{it has since}} attained iconic status in Serbian popular culture. An allusion to it is made in Emir Kusturica's 1995 film Underground, in which war refugees are depicted marching towards Belgrade in similar fashion, following the German bombing {{of the city in}} April 1941. Several authors have noted similarities between Jovanović's depiction of the migration and images of other upheavals in Serbian history. Historian Katarina Todić observes that there are striking similarities between the painting and photographs of the Royal Serbian Army's retreat to the Adriatic coast during World War I.
