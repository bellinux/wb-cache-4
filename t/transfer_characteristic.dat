25|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>characteristic</b> of RO {{is usually}} {{represented}} as the electrical {{resistance of the}} photoresistor {{as a function of}} the current through the light source; it is a convolution of three main factors: the dependence of light source intensity on its current, optical coupling and spectral matching between the light source and photoresistor, and the photoresponse of the photoresistor. The first dependence is almost linear and temperature independent for LEDs in the practical range of the controlling current. On the contrary, for incandescent lamps the light-current curve is not linear, and the emission spectrum varies with temperature, and thus with the input current. As to the light detector, its properties depend on temperature, voltage and the history of utilization (memory effect). Therefore, the <b>transfer</b> <b>characteristic</b> takes a range of values.|$|E

40|$|Graphene field-effect {{transistors}} with source/drain {{contacts made}} of metals {{that can be}} easily oxidized such as ferromagnetic metals often display a double dip structure in the <b>transfer</b> <b>characteristics</b> because of charge density depinning at the contacts.

However, the shape of the <b>transfer</b> <b>characteristics</b> of devices fabricated using Ni contacts is found to be dependent on the length of the contact. This peculiar behavior was attributed to charge carrier injection from near the center of the contacts.
