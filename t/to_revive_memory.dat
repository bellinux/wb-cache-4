50|$|Her name {{appears as}} Bōrān (or Burān) on her coinage. The Persian poet Ferdowsi refers {{to her as}} Purandokht in his epic poem, the Shahnameh.

50|$|This support backfired {{somewhat}} {{when one}} of his proteges, William McGonagall, gained a reputation as the worst poet in the English language. McGonagall's Address to the Rev. George Gilfillan, the first poem he ever wrote, is arguably the only reason modern readers remember Gilfillan - though modern adherents have attempted <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> his <b>memory.</b>|$|R

I have {{received}} outrages from a person--a female I am sorry to say, for the credit of my sex--who {{is not to be}} mentioned without scorn and disgust; and therefore I would rather not mention her.' ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is curious}} to recall how Britten helped shatter that obvious, lucidly {{explicable}} presentation of myself upon which I had embarked with Margaret. He returned <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> a <b>memory</b> of adolescent dreams and {{a habit of}} adolescent frankness; he reached through my shallow frontage as no one else seemed capable of doing, and dragged that back-self into relation with it.|$|R
50|$|Aram Manukian was an {{advocate}} for self-reliance. He was noted {{for his ability to}} unite different sections of society for a common cause. He is widely considered by scholars to be the founder of the First Republic of Armenia. During the Soviet period, he, along with other prominent Dashnaks, was largely disregarded.

40|$|The name Salmon P. Chase {{is barely}} known {{and his career}} is largely forgotten.

In {{addition}} to explaining why this is a career worth both remembering and honoring, the author offers some possible reasons why his remarkable achievements have largely been forgotten...|$|R
60|$|Walthew {{held his}} breath until he heard the door shut behind him; {{then he turned to}} Gomez, who had risen from his seat at a table. It was a small room and the table stood between the men. Walthew felt his nerves tingle and his skin grow damp with {{perspiration}} as Gomez looked at him. There was surprise in the secretary's face and he seemed puzzled, {{as if he were trying}} <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> a <b>memory.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{success of}} The Lion King and {{popularity}} of its characters {{led to the}} production of Timon & Pumbaa, an animated television series starring Timon and Pumbaa.

60|$|It {{would not}} be {{possible}} for the writer to give any clear idea of the circumstances of the days that immediately followed, and which, within a week, brought Barnaby True and the enchanting object of his affections at once to the ending of their voyage, and of all these marvellous adventures. For when, in after times, our hero would endeavor <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> a <b>memory</b> of the several occurrences that then transpired, they all appeared as though in a dream or a bewitching phantasm.|$|R
50|$|On 21 May 1725, the empress Catherine I {{introduced}} the Imperial Order of St. Alexander Nevsky {{as one of}} the highest decorations in the land. During the Great Patriotic War, on 29 July 1942, the Soviet authorities introduced an Order of Alexander Nevsky <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> the <b>memory</b> of Alexander's struggle with the Germans. There was also a Bulgarian Order dedicated to Saint Alexander which was founded on 25 December 1881 and then ceased to exist when a People's Republic was declared on 16 September 1946.|$|R
50|$|The 1979 celebration was a {{great success}} and {{included}} the presence {{of some of the}} original immigrants born in British India. Government ministers Sham and Kamal Mohammed were there, as was the Indian High Commissioner and Presbyterian Church moderator Idris Hamid. The event was widely covered by the local media and immediately knew about the event. In fact it took just two years and an idea <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> the <b>memory</b> of the Arrival of Indians in Trinidad and Tobago to awaken the entire Indian community in Trinidad and Tobago.|$|R
50|$|The Tuanku Ja'afar Royal Gallery located nearby to Taman Tasik Seremban, is a {{building}} with {{an area of}} approximately 44,000 square feet that houses a gallery which was developed <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> the <b>memories</b> of the Late His Royal Highness Tuanku Ja’afar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman. The Gallery {{was the brainchild of}} the Late His Royal Highness who wanted to build a gallery that portrayed the uniqueness of Negeri Sembilan’s roots, the past royal rulers of Negeri Sembilan and his life journey. The Royal exhibition highlighted the exclusivity of the concept of ‘Biographical Journey of Tuanku Ja’afar’ with eight consecutive exhibition chambers.|$|R

Just like in real life, he has Lin as his rival.|$|R
60|$|On {{the way out}} to Quebec, the sea seemed <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> strange <b>memories.</b> I {{had never}} crossed it before, except long, long ago, on my way home from Australia. And now that I sat on deck, in a wicker-chair, and looked at the deep dark waves by myself, I began once more, in vague snatches, to recall that earlier voyage. It came back to me all of itself. And that was quite in keeping with my {{previous}} recollections. My past life, I felt sure, was unfolding itself slowly to me in regular succession, from childhood onward.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the 70-year-long anti-Dashnak {{propaganda}} in Soviet Armenia, Aram Manukian and other key ARF members who played major roles in modern Armenian history were largely discredited and forgotten. Efforts were made by politicians <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> Aram's <b>memory</b> after Armenia achieved independence from the Soviet Union. To symbolize the revival of Armenian statehood, the initial declaration of the independence of Armenia from the Soviet Union on 23 August 1990 was read by Aram Manukyan, a member of the parliament who was chosen only because he bore the same name as the founder of the First Republic. However, Manukian is still not widely known to the Armenian public.|$|R

Where you could follow your impulses and your imagination, even if that led you into situations that were scary, challenging, perhaps even downright dangerous. It is not mere nostalgia <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> these <b>memories.</b> Of course, we should not fall for the myth that there was a “golden age ” for growing up. But if we all agree that a taste of freedom and adventure are vital ingredients of a good childhood, then surely we should see to it that children today are able to enjo...|$|R

Those who make the pilgrimage want the ability to walk throughout the massive camp and imagine {{the experiences of the}} internees. “They want to traverse the site to experience the dimension and magnitude of the place, to gain a sense of the distances family members walked in their daily routine to eat meals, attend school, to do laundry and use the latrines.

Sparrow fell off a cliff during one planetside excursion and is stricken with amnesia. No one will discuss his past with him and the computer has restricted his data, reasoning that he should [...] "look within" [...] to fully recover. Sparrow struggles <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> his <b>memory</b> and familiarizes himself with the Astron, the crew, the enigmatic Captain Kusaka, {{the state of the}} ship and its mission; in which the search for life has lasted over 2000 years with no success.|$|R

Dartmouth surrendered on 18 January 1646, Hopton was defeated at the Battle of Torrington on 16 February, and surrendered the remnant of his worthless army on 14 March. Exeter fell on 13 April. Elsewhere, Hereford was taken on 17 December 1645, and the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold, the last pitched battle of the war, was fought and lost by Lord Astley on 21 March 1646.|$|R
50|$|Bishop Verot's {{initiative}} helped Florida materially {{as well as}} religiously. He was {{amongst the}} first to advocate it as a health resort, as well as culture of products which have since become valuable. He made an annual visitation of the whole diocese, establishing churches and schools at advantageous points, and aiming to lay a broad and solid foundation on which his successors might build. He loved <b>to</b> <b>revive</b> the <b>memory</b> of Florida's early martyrs, Spanish as well as French. His numerous contributions on religious and historical themes in contemporary periodicals possess permanent value; his best-known writings are his Pastoral on Slavery and his Catechism. He took a prominent part in the Plenary Council of Baltimore and the First Vatican Council.|$|R
