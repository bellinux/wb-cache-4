5|$|Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, {{mostly by}} the enzyme {{cytochrome}} P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, {{as well as}} an inactive benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they have little to no contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> alprazolam.|$|E

5|$|A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This {{produces}} a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon {{the nucleus of the}} comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E
5|$|According to Hardorff, {{the theory}} is {{discounted}} by most academics. He suggests that Marquis may have made errors due {{to the use of}} sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. In his book, Wooden Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians. Attributing the soldier's suicides <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although Wooden Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful– which he immediately spat out– that he took from a captured bottle. In later life, Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind {{to a halt and}} the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The RNA polymerase of Amanita phalloides is insensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.|$|E

5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the Depression and World War II.|$|E

After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side {{as a result of}} its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories, at Doiran and Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed.
