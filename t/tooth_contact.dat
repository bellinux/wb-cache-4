In subjects with different types of lateral guidance, intraoral lateral <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> identified with occlusal registration strips were compared with those identified by use of a semi-adjustable articulator, setting the condylar guidance in four different ways: using protrusive wax wafers, by axiography and by adding and subtracting 5 degrees from the value of condylar guidance obtained by protrusive wax wafers. Tolerance to variations of condylar guidance without changing lateral <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> was determined by increasing and decreasing the value of condylar guidance until lateral <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> changed. Different ways of setting condylar guidance on a semi-adjustable articulator give rise to different values of condylar guidance in the same subject. The occlusal repercussions of these variations of condylar guidance values depend on the type of lateral guidance.

40|$|The article {{describes}} a numerical {{model for the}} analysis of elastohydrodynamic lubrication under conditions in which the nominal lubricant film thickness is small compared to the roughness present on the surfaces (lambda ratio less than unity). These conditions occur in most types of gear <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> and in many other heavily loaded machine elements. In these situations, lubrication occurs at the roughness asperity level (micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication), and in extreme cases ‘mixed’ lubrication behaviour occurs in which momentary solid contacts between the surfaces take place. In both micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication and mixed lubrication regimes high, localised pressures are applied cyclically to asperity features as they move through the nominal contact leading to fatigue at the asperity level, which culminates in micropitting wear. Results of the modelling show the effect of lambda ratio in lubricated gear <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts,</b> and demonstrate the transition from full-film to micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication and mixed lubrication, and the consequences in terms of predicted fatigue damage...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of two types of occlusal accommodation on the arch separation in centric and eccentric arch positions and to assess the opposing <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> in professionally made, thermoformed sports mouthguards. Maxillary and mandibular alginate impressions, a wax interocclusal record of centric occlusion together with maxillary/condylar face-bow registrations, were recorded clinically for 10 undergraduate dental students who are sports activist volunteers of the School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen's University Belfast. Two ethylene vinyl acetate thermoformed maxillary mouthguards were made for each player (N = 20) using a standardised procedure. Ten mouthguards served both as the control (i. e. the non-accommodated) group and also the accommodated, occlusally 'imprinted' group. The other 10 mouthguards served as the accommodated, occlusally 'ground' group. Casts were articulated, each non-accommodated and accommodated mouthguard was seated and the extent of the interocclusal opening was recorded in all three arch relationships. The number of mouthguard and mandibular <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> were also recorded in each position. The increased vertical occlusal dimension that was found in the presence of non-accommodated mouthguards equated to the full-sheet thickness of the material that was used to form the mouthguards. Only mouthguards accommodated by grinding retained high levels of occlusal contact in all arch relationships that were tested. Within the limitations of this study, the modification of the occlusal surface made by flat grinding reduced the arch separation in eccentric movements and increased the opposing <b>tooth</b> <b>contacts</b> in custom-made mouthguards. This may contribute to increased comfort, compliance and the protective effect of these appliances thus resulting in a reduction of injuries to the teeth, arches and soft tissues...|$|R

50|$|As the NTI-TSS {{does not}} cover all of the teeth, it is classed as a partial {{coverage}} occlusal splint. Partial coverage splints are recommended by some experts, but they {{have the potential to}} cause unwanted tooth movements if worn 24 hours a day 7 days a week with no <b>tooth</b> <b>contact</b> (which is never recommended), which rarely can be severe. Since the patient cannot wear the NTI-tss device while chewing food, the posterior alveolar structures receive regular stimulation every day, therefore, there is no opportunity for a functional adaptation of the occlusal scheme, that is supra-eruption of the teeth.. Research shows that alveolar bone requires at least 8 days of lack of stimulation before bone growth at the apex (supra-eruption) can initiate. As for anterior intrusion, the lack of continuous apical force does not provide adequate opportunity to intrude an incisor. However, changes in the jaw relationship can be observed within 8 days (which is identified as a change in the occlusal scheme), and {{is a result of the}} normalization of the musculature.
