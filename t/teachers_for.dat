5|$|In the Spring of 1924, Göppert {{entered the}} University of Göttingen, where she studied mathematics. A purported {{shortage}} of women mathematics <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> schools for girls {{led to an}} upsurge of women studying mathematics {{at a time of}} high unemployment, and there was even a female professor of mathematics at Göttingen, Emmy Noether, but most were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificates.|$|E
5|$|The Central State Normal School, {{established}} to train <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> central Pennsylvania, {{held its first}} classes in 1877 at a site overlooking the West Branch Susquehanna River. The small school, with enrollments below 150 until the 1940s, eventually became Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. In the early 1880s, the New York and Pennsylvania Paper Mill in Castanea Township near Flemington began paper production {{on the site of}} a former sawmill; the paper mill remained a large employer {{until the end of the}} 20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|He was {{intended}} to have the name Joachim, but this was stopped on request from Joachim G. Giæver who voiced his dislike for the name. He was then christened Halfdan, changed to Halvdan some years later. The family lived in Tromsø, where Paul Steenstrup Koht was a headmaster and mayor. The family moved to Skien when Halvdan was twelve years old, where his father again immersed himself in politics: he served as mayor as well as parliamentarian for the Liberal Party. Koht finished school here, taking his examen artium in 1890. His father was among his <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> a while in Norwegian and Greek. In 1893, {{one year after the}} death of Koht's father, the family moved to Bekkelaget, a borough in Aker. Koht studied at the Royal Frederick University (now the University of Oslo).|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{the commune}} had eight primary schools with 19 <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> 595 children. There were 20 mahadras, or {{traditional}} schools, in 11 locations. Only four had a library or document repository. There were 11 writing rooms of varying quality, and one small vocational training centre. By 2007, the commune had 11 primary schools with 689 students (45percent {{of whom were}} girls) and 28 teachers, but no secondary school. Only three schools had desks. All had latrines, but not all had drinking water or facilities for preparing meals for the children. The quality of education was mixed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her work at Hull House, Smith was involved in public education. Francis Wayland Parker invited her to head the vocal music department at the Chicago Normal School in 1897 and she was asked by John Dewey to teach at the University of Chicago {{as the head of}} the Department of Music, School of Education from 1901 to 1910. She not only trained <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> Dewey but assisted him in developing a revised curriculum for the music education program.

5|$|The city {{is home to}} the Eqrem Çabej University, {{which opened}} its doors in 1968. The {{university}} has recently been experiencing low enrollments, and as a result the departments of Physics, Mathematics, Biochemistry, and Kindergarten Education did not function during the 2008–2009 academic year. In 2006, the establishment of a second university in Gjirokastër, a Greek-language one, was agreed upon after discussions between the Albanian and Greek governments. The program had an attendance of 35 students , but was abruptly suspended when the University of Ioannina in Greece refused to provide <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> the 2010 school year and the Greek government and the Latsis foundation withdrew funding.|$|E
5|$|These fashions {{permeated}} noble households, where resident musicians were employed, including viol and lute players. As {{elsewhere in}} Europe, musical ability {{became one of}} the major achievements expected of a nobleman or woman. Musicians were clearly employed as <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> the children of the household, both male and female. There is evidence for the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of lessons being given in a variety of instruments and singing, and of the purchase of sheet music and instruments (including the virginals and harpsichords). In the Highlands clan chiefs continued to employ harpists, and increasingly, pipers as fili and bards, whose prowess and ability to glorify their ancestors was a key element in underlying a clan's status and heritage into the seventeenth century. The earliest printed collection of secular music in Scotland was by publisher John Forbes in Aberdeen in 1662. Songs and Fancies: to Thre, Foure, or Five Partes, both Apt for Voices and Viols, known as Forbes' Cantus, was printed three times in the next twenty years. It contained 77 songs, of which 25 were of Scottish origin.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the most}} {{pressing}} problems facing education reformers was the scarcity of qualified teachers, {{which has led to}} a serious stunting of educational development. In 1986 there were about 8 million primary- and middle-school teachers in China, but many lacked professional training. Estimates indicated that {{in order to meet the}} goals of the Seventh Five-Year Plan and realize compulsory 9-year education, the system needed 1 million new <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> primary schools, 750,000 new <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> junior middle schools, and 300,000 new <b>teachers</b> <b>for</b> senior middle schools. Estimates predict, however, that the demand for teachers will drop in the late 1990s because of an anticipated decrease in primary-school enrollments.|$|E
