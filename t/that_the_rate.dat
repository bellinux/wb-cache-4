5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|As Energy Minister, Baird was {{entrusted}} with implementing the government's plan {{to sell off}} part of Ontario's Hydro One. A few months later, he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals. The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002 after hydro rates increased significantly {{in many parts of}} the province. Critics argued that the Progressive Conservative government's price deregulation policy (implemented before Baird became Energy Minister) was responsible. Baird suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> increases resulted from an unusually hot summer. Rates remained high through the autumn, and the Eves government was forced to re-regulate the market in November by introducing a price cap. The government continued to support deregulation in principle, but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office. The second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late January 2003, when Premier Eves announced that Hydro One would remain under public control.|$|E

The index was <b>the</b> <b>rating</b> on <b>the</b> appearance of <b>the</b> EM <b>that</b> <b>the</b> subject reported.

5|$|Basing {{himself on}} revised data, Sampson in 1995 {{estimated}} that the layers investigated represented {{a longer period of}} time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's Brachyceratops quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the Einiosaurus beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed speciation took place, with the populations splitting.

5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what it will look like in the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} effort initially concentrated on a gun-type fission weapon using plutonium called Thin Man. In April 1944, the Los Alamos Laboratory determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of spontaneous fission in plutonium bred {{in a nuclear}} reactor was too great due {{to the presence of}} plutonium-240 and would cause a predetonation, a nuclear chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. Oppenheimer then reorganized the laboratory and orchestrated an all-out and ultimately successful effort on an alternative design proposed by John von Neumann, an implosion-type nuclear weapon, which was called Fat Man. A variant of the gun-type design known as Little Boy was developed using uranium-235.|$|E

5|$|The mass, radius and {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} {{are closely}} interlinked, and their respective values can be approximated by three relations. First is the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which relates the luminosity L, the radius R and the surface temperature Teff. Second is the mass–luminosity relation, which relates the luminosity L and the mass M. Finally, the relationship between M and R is close to linear. The ratio of M to R increases {{by a factor of}} only three over 2.5 orders of magnitude of M. This relation is roughly proportional to the star's inner temperature TI, and its extremely slow increase reflects the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of energy generation in the core strongly depends on this temperature, whereas it has to fit the mass–luminosity relation. Thus, a too high or too low temperature will result in stellar instability.|$|E
5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E

5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} Universe {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe. Modern data suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that {{is very close to}} the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|E
5|$|There are {{dynamical}} forces {{acting on}} the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of increase of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing {{as time went on}} due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate of increase of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E
