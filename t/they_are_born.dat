5|$|Larvae hatch {{from their}} egg casing {{in two to}} six weeks. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> carnivores, feeding instinctively on small {{invertebrates}} that move in their field of vision. Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles. As they develop, they naturally feed upon larger prey. To increase their chances for survival, some individuals grow bigger heads and become cannibals, and feed upon their own brood mates.|$|E
50|$|Other areas admit Reception {{pupils in}} {{the term of}} their fifth birthday, while some admit pupils in September if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> between September and February, and in January if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> between March and August.|$|R
25|$|As generations do not overlap, {{there is}} no active kin selection. However, it is quite likely that female bees will stay {{in the same area}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> in, reusing the same {{aggregation}} of nests <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> in to bear their offspring.|$|R
50|$|As a whole, Australian {{residents}} identifying {{themselves as}} having Chinese ancestry made up 5.6% of those nominating their ancestry at the 2016 census and numbered 1,213,903. At the 2016 census, 509,555 people declared that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> in Mainland China, 86,886 declared that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> in Hong Kong, while 46,882 declared that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>born</b> in Taiwan. There {{are also a}} large number of persons of Chinese ancestry among those born in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam.|$|R
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> {{relatively}} immobile and defenseless {{and therefore}} require nourishment {{for a certain}} duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch {{but there is no}} increase during the egg stage.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} all passerines, the chicks are altricial; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> blind and covered only by sparse tufts of brown {{down on their}} backs, {{shoulders}} and parts of wings. By four days they open their eyes, and pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, {{and the rest of}} the body on days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel and pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and the laughing kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>born.</b> Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E

5|$|To {{some degree}} the {{movement}} has been successful. Beginning in 1998, the official curriculum in Taiwan schools has been changed to contain more frequent and favorable mention of aborigines. In 1996 the Council of Indigenous Peoples was promoted to a ministry-level rank within the Executive Yuan. The central government has taken steps to allow romanized spellings of aboriginal names on official documents, offsetting the long-held policy of forcing a Han name on an aborigine. A relaxed policy on identification now allows a child to choose their official designation if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> to mixed aboriginal/Han parents.|$|E
5|$|Incubation {{has been}} {{recorded}} as averaging around 17 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> blind and naked, and start to develop down on their heads on day two. Their eyes open around day six, and they begin developing their primary flight feathers around day nine or ten. For {{the first three days}} after hatching, the mother feeds the nestlings alone, with food brought to her by the father. The father feeds them directly from the fourth day onwards, with the mother brooding them afterwards until day seven. Flies, butterflies, moths, caterpillars and beetles predominate in the food fed to the young birds. Flame robins fed a higher proportion of flying insects to their young at Nimmitabel than did scarlet robins, which may have been due to their later start to breeding. Both parents participate in removing faecal sacs from the nest. Parents have been observed feeding young up to five weeks after leaving the nest.|$|E
5|$|Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> blind and covered {{only by a}} thin layer of down. By seven days, they are {{stretching}} wings and preening, and at two weeks they are able to fly. Parents feed young for at least three weeks after leaving the nest, and have been recorded giving them spiders, and insects such as flies and moths. Males take over feeding young when females begin renesting for the next brood. In a field study near Cooma in southern New South Wales, fledglings were observed to disperse from the natal territory after four to six weeks for a single brood year, and {{in less than a week}} on both occasions in a pair which raised two broods in the season. The long breeding season and multiple broods therein are an adaptation to mild climate and high levels of predation. Despite this, on average only two young are successfully fledged per year.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid {{on a bed of}} wood dust or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days of age in the wild and up to 30days of age in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Their lofty {{locations}} makes {{monitoring of}} Australian raven nests difficult. A clutch can comprise {{up to six}} eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with five being the most common number. Measuring , eggs are pale green or bluish-green and splotched with darker olive, brown and blackish markings. Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified. Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female over roughly 20days. Incubation is intermittent initially, becoming constant {{by the time the}} third or fourth egg is laid. Only one brood is raised per year, though a second clutch may be laid if the first clutch is lost early in the season. Late clutches have poor survival rates, possibly due to chicks getting dehydrated on hot days as the year progresses or being eaten by wedge-tailed eagles. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. They have pink skin until 5days of age, when feathers under the skin turn it grey. They lose their egg tooth at the same time. Their eyes begin opening at 5 to 6 days of age and are fully open by 11 to 12 days, by which time their feathers begin emerging. At 14 days, their primary feathers begin emerging, and they are fully feathered by 35–36 days old. They leave the nest at 40–45days of age, and stay with the parents for three to four months after that. They follow their parents and beg for food for the first month outside the nest but are feeding themselves by the third month. Young birds are often attacked when they enter neighbouring territories, and melees ensue as their parents try to defend them and herd them back.|$|E

25|$|Young elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the faeces {{of their}} mother, {{probably}} {{to obtain the}} bacteria required to properly digest vegetation.
