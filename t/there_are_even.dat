5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters.

5|$|Orangutans {{were known}} to the native people of Sumatra and Borneo for millennia. While some {{communities}} hunted them for food and decoration, others placed taboos on such practices. In central Borneo, some traditional folk beliefs consider it bad luck {{to look in the}} face of an orangutan. Some folk tales involve orangutans mating with and kidnapping humans. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>even</b> stories of hunters being seduced by female orangutans.|$|E
5|$|Wheelbarrow: The {{earliest}} wheelbarrows with {{archaeological evidence}} {{in the form of}} a one-wheel cart come from 2nd century Han Dynasty Emperor Hui's tomb murals and brick tomb reliefs. The painted tomb mural of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in a tomb at Chengdu, Sichuan province, dated precisely to 118 CE. The stone carved relief of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in the tomb of Shen Fujun in Sichuan province, dated circa 150 CE. And then there is the story of the pious Dong Yuan pushing his father around in a single-wheel lu che barrow, depicted in a mural of the Wu Liang tomb-shrine of Shandong (dated to 147 CE). However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>even</b> earlier accounts than this that date back to the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE. The 5th century Book of Later Han stated that the wife of the once poor and youthful imperial censor Bao Xuan helped him push a lu che back to his village during their feeble wedding ceremony, around 30 BCE. Later, during the Red Eyebrows Rebellion (c. 20 CE) against Xin dynasty's Wang Mang (45 BCE23 CE), the official Zhao Xi saved his wife from danger by disguising himself and pushing her along in his lu che barrow, past a group of brigand rebels who questioned him, and allowed him to pass after he convinced them that his wife was terribly ill.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} types of nouns that {{can be derived from}} verbs: present participle, past participle and verbal noun. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>even</b> nouns derived from simple verbs having the root fʿal or faʿlil.

These structures ultimately derive from those of Standard Arabic, even if they are radically different in modern Tunisian because of heavy influence from Berber, Latin and other European languages.|$|E
25|$|Bergfrieds {{very often}} have a square or round floor plan, but {{pentagonal}} towers are also frequently encountered; whilst octagonal towers are rather less common. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>even</b> {{a few examples of}} bergfrieds with irregular polygonal floor plans. A rare form is the triangular bergfried of Grenzau Castle near Höhr-Grenzhausen or that of Rauheneck Castle near Baden bei Wien. Towers with triangular and pentagonal floor plans invariably had a corner facing the main line of attack on the castle.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterial}} cytoskeleton {{may not be}} {{as complex}} as that found in eukaryotes; however, it contains proteins that are highly similar to actin monomers and polymers. The bacterial protein MreB polymerizes into thin non-helical filaments and occasionally into helical structures similar to F-actin. Furthermore, its crystalline structure is very similar to that of G-actin (in terms of its three-dimensional conformation), <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>even</b> similarities between the MreB protofilaments and F-actin. The bacterial cytoskeleton also contains the FtsZ proteins, which are similar to tubulin.|$|E

Months or even years could pass without the accused being informed about why they were imprisoned. The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend Mass nor receive the sacraments. The jails of the Inquisition were no worse than those of secular authorities, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>even</b> certain testimonies that occasionally they were much better.|$|E
25|$|According to Campbell and Lamar (2004), {{its range}} in Ecuador extends {{as far south}} along the Pacific coast as El Oro Province and the Vilcabamba area of the Río Catamayo Valley.

The Roman Catholic Church and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints each have a strong presence in the country as well.

25|$|As {{with other}} cities in Libya, there is a {{reasonable}} amount of ethnic diversity in Benghazi. The people of eastern Libya, Benghazi included, have in the past always been of predominantly Arab descent. In recent times, however, there has been an influx of African immigrants into Benghazi. There are also many Egyptian immigrants in Benghazi. A small Greek community also exists in Benghazi. The Greek island of Crete is a short distance from Benghazi and many families in Benghazi today bear Cretan surnames. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>even</b> a few Italian-related families, left from the colonial times before World War II.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicles}} used by EMS in South Africa {{can vary}} greatly {{across a broad}} range. They may be large or small, new or quite old, often driven by local economics. There is no specific current standard for ambulance design in South Africa. Some vehicles comply with either the European standard CEN 1789 or the US standard, KKK-1822, but many meet neither standard. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>even</b> examples of motorcycles with stretcher-carrying sidecars. There is currently a major initiative underway {{by the government of}} South Africa to replace much of the aging fleet with new high standard emergency ambulances. Plans call for the replacement of approximately 450 ambulances by 2010.|$|E
25|$|Amateur Microscopy is the {{investigation}} and observation of biological and non-biological specimens for recreational purposes. Collectors of minerals, insects, seashells, and plants may use microscopes as tools to uncover features that help them classify their collected items. Other amateurs {{may be interested in}} observing the life found in pond water and of other samples. Microscopes may also prove useful for the water quality assessment for people that keep a home aquarium. Photographic documentation and drawing of the microscopic images are additional tasks that augment the spectrum of tasks of the amateur. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>even</b> competitions for photomicrograph art. Participants of this pastime may either use commercially prepared microscopic slides or engage in the task of specimen preparation.|$|E
