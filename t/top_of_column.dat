He is given in the Synchronistic Kinglist as the counterpart of the Babylonian king Mâr-bîti-apla-uṣur (983-978 BC), the sole member of the 7th or Elamite dynasty of Babylon, although conventional chronology would suggest the subsequent king, Nabû-mukin-apli (978-943 BC), might be a more likely candidate.

30|$|After an {{underwater}} disturbance, a shock wave reaches the water surface and lifts it at an initial velocity of V_ 0 which depends on depth of loading.

Due to the explosion changes, the outer surface of dome and forms a semi-cylindrical water column with a wall thickness that {{is lower than the}} <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>column.</b> Finally, the wall becomes very thin and breaks, and then the vapor and gas will release into the atmosphere; this concept has been studied by Kozachenko and Khristoforov [1, 2].|$|E

40|$|Two {{separated}} observers, {{by applying}} local operations to {{a supply of}} not-too-impure entangled states (e. g. singlets shared through a noisy channel), can prepare {{a smaller number of}} entangled pairs of arbitrarily high purity (e. g. near-perfect singlets). These can then be used to faithfully teleport unknown quantum states from one observer to the other, thereby achieving faithful transfrom one observer to the other, thereby achieving faithful transmission of quantum information through a noisy channel. We give upper and lower bounds on the yield D(M) of pure singlets (|Ψ^-〉) distillable from mixed states M, showing D(M) > 0 if 〈Ψ^-|M|Ψ^-〉>. Comment: 4 pages (revtex) plus 1 figure (postscript).

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of radius-thickness ratio (R/t) and axial force {{subjected}} to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>column</b> on the ultimate loading capacity and deformability of steel-pipe columns, monotonic and cyclic loading tests were conducted under a constant compressive axial load by using sixteen steel-pipe column models. In this study, two types of cyclic loading tests were adopted: 1) of increased amplitude at every new cycle, 2) of constant amplitude. Results obtained from this experiment are as follows: 1) under cyclic loading with increased amplitude, two types of local buckling: elephant foot bulge mode and diamond shaped mode, are generated near the base depending upon the radius-thickness ratio; 2) the effects of radius-thickness ratio and compressive axial load on the maximum horizontal load are small; and 3) the maximum horizontal load may not {{be affected by the}} loading types...|$|E
