Paul O'Connor, the lead game designer for Sammy Studios and a fan of the Metroid series, remarked that players empathize and identify with Samus because she is often rewarded for indulging in her curiosity. The book Videogames and Art noted that in the original Metroid the player is not briefed on Samus's past or future; the only interaction that they have with the character is by being her through gameplay, while bits of information can be gleaned from the handbook and through concept art, adding, [...] "Samus is very rare for the character intimacy gained solely through game play and for her stasis and then drastic change," [...] referring to the revelation that she is a woman.

Although <b>the</b> tight <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> protein structures, in general, is a well-known fact, a systematic study of the role of geometric complementarity in <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> secondary structure elements has been lacking. To assess the role of the steric complementarity, we used a docking procedure to recreate <b>the</b> crystallographically determined <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> secondary structure elements in known protein structures by using the geometric match only. The docking results revealed a significant percentage <b>of</b> correctly predicted <b>packing</b> configurations. Different types of pairs of secondary structure elements showed different degrees of steric complementarity (from high to low: β–β, loop–loop, α–α, and α–β). Interestingly, the relative contribution of the steric match in different types of pairs was correlated with the number of such pairs in known protein structures. This effect may indicate an evolutionary pressure to select tightly <b>packed</b> elements <b>of</b> secondary structure to maximize <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire structure.
