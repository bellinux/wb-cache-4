5|$|Animal similes and metaphors {{have been}} used since {{classical}} times, for example by Homer and Virgil, <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> effects in literature, and to sum up complex concepts concisely.|$|E
5|$|Another critic has {{positively}} {{commented on}} McCloskey's use of page breaks as a pacing technique. McCloskey's use of one-sentence pages forces {{the reader to}} quickly turn the page, enhancing the sense of motion, especially during the home search and when Mrs. Mallard teaches the ducklings their basic skills. McCloskey also employs this page break method <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> surprise. When searching for a home, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard seem {{to have found a}} home on page eleven.|$|E
5|$|At most 600,000 years old, Kīlauea {{is still}} quite young for a Hawaiian volcano; the oldest volcano on the island, the northwestern Kohala, {{experienced}} almost 900,000 years of activity before going extinct. The volcano's foreseeable future activity {{will likely be}} much like {{it has been for}} the past 50,000 to 100,000 years; Hawaiian and explosive activity will continue <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> Kīlauea's summit, build up its rift zones, and fill and refill its summit caldera.|$|E

50|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> {{security}} at all installations, the Main Entrance Gate - used since opening in 1938 - is being replaced {{to conform to}} current force protection standards.|$|R
5|$|Christian {{meditation}} aims <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> {{the personal}} relationship {{based on the}} love of God that marks Christian communion. Both in Eastern and Western Christianity meditation is the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplative prayer. Teachings in both the Eastern and Western Christian churches have emphasized the use of Christian meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare's {{use of his}} poetic {{dramatic}} structure (especially effects such as switching between {{comedy and}} tragedy <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> tension, his expansion of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet {{over the course of}} the play.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Brad Follmer {{was created in}} season nine to provide a love interest for Reyes, as the writers believed the audience needed {{to know more about}} her. However, Follmer's unresolved relationship with Reyes also served <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> the conflict between Doggett and Follmer, as both men had feelings for her. Portraying actress Annabeth Gish was pleased that the relationship between her character and Scully was similar to that of two sisters, rather than Reyes serving as an antagonist to Scully.|$|E
50|$|Both Tempe and McClintock {{would share}} a {{defining}} rivalry in Tempe sports. Their {{football and basketball}} games, due <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> interest, often wound up on ASU's campus and fields.|$|R
50|$|Pacer (Carlos De Silva) - He has {{the genes}} of an unknown predatory animal. In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> physical abilities and fighting skills, he also has superior tracking skills.|$|R
50|$|After the 1998 United States embassy {{bombings in}} Africa, {{diplomatic}} personnel at embassy Dushanbe were temporarily relocated to Almaty, Kazakhstan, due <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> embassy security standards. The embassy was later reopened.|$|R
5|$|The gallery {{itself was}} a fashionable hit with the public. Newspapers carried updates of the {{construction}} of the gallery, down to drawings for the proposed façade. The Daily Advertiser featured a weekly column on the gallery from May through August (exhibition season). Artists who had influence with the press, and Boydell himself, published anonymous articles <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> interest in the gallery, which they hoped would increase sales of the edition.|$|E
5|$|Writing the {{screenplay}} took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, {{and although he}} passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on {{the screenplay}} was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay. The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the back story was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and {{the greater part of}} the action was set inside the house <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> the audience's feeling of claustrophobia. Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to make her a foil for Eleanor but also <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke was made more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character. The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on West Side Story.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and water retention of pizza cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties of pizza cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat pizza cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> the melt of low-fat pizza cheese by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The Conference of Montreal is a not-for-profit {{organization}} engaged <b>to</b> <b>heightening</b> {{knowledge and}} awareness of the issues concerning economic globalization, with a particular emphasis on {{the relations between the}} Americas and other continents.|$|R
50|$|Six {{months prior}} to the Khobar Towers bombing, on Monday, 13 November 1995, the OPM-SANG {{headquarters}} was bombed which led <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> threat level at Khobar. Both bombings have been attributed to Hezbollah Al-Hejaz.|$|R
5000|$|Some studies {{indicate}} a partner satisfaction rate of 70% or less, due, some studies suggest, <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> or unreasonable expectations. Many surgeons are now recommending that both partners be counseled pre-operatively regarding outcome and expectations.|$|R
5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings {{in a number of}} towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the Polish-Soviet War served <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> anti-Jewish sentiment.|$|E
5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
30|$|Presenting {{a unified}} message to {{political}} agencies, {{such as the}} national academies, federal and state departments, and legislators, to provide critical support to STEM areas, such as climate science, that may be subject <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> political scrutiny.|$|R
50|$|Classrooms with {{students}} of diverse ages allow younger gifted {{students to be}} grouped with older students who are closer to their academic level. They also create opportunities for peer instruction, leading <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> self-esteem in gifted students.|$|R
50|$|Computer rage {{refers to}} {{negative}} psychological responses due <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> anger or frustration. Examples of computer rage include cursing or yelling at a computer, slamming or throwing keyboards and mice, and assaulting the computer or monitor with an object or weapon.|$|R
5|$|During {{the siege}} of the city by the Fourth Crusade, the sea walls {{nonetheless}} {{proved to be a}} weak point in the city's defences, as the Venetians managed to storm them. Following this experience, Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) took particular care <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> and strengthen the seaward walls immediately after the Byzantine recapture of the city in 1261, since a Latin attempt to recover the city was regarded as imminent. Furthermore, the installation of the Genoese at Galata across the Golden Horn, agreed upon in the Treaty of Nymphaeum, posed a further potential threat to the city. Time being short, as a Latin attempt to recover the city was expected, the sea walls were heightened by the addition of two-meter high wooden and hide-covered screens. Ten years later, facing the threat of an invasion by Charles d'Anjou, a second line of walls was built behind the original maritime walls, although no trace of them survives today.|$|E
5|$|In February 1858 Felice Beato {{arrived in}} Calcutta and began {{travelling}} throughout Northern India {{to document the}} aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E
25|$|Incidence among African Americans {{doubled from}} 1988 to 2001 with a bias towards seminoma. The lack of {{significant}} increase in the incidence of early-stage testicular cancer during this timeframe suggests that the overall increase was not due <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> awareness of the disease.|$|R

50|$|In 1998, {{after the}} embassy bombings in Africa, Embassy Dushanbe American {{personnel}} were temporarily relocated to Almaty, Kazakhstan, due <b>to</b> <b>heightened</b> Embassy security standards. American Embassy Dushanbe has since returned to full operations and in July 2006 {{moved into a}} purpose-built embassy compound.|$|R
5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E
5|$|Callum's {{presence}} causes countless {{problems for}} the Platt family. His court proceedings cause the feud <b>to</b> <b>heighten</b> to violence. He also manipulates David's sister Sarah and gets her daughter Bethany into trouble with drugs. Callum attacks Sarah for framing him for a crime. Kylie hits Callum with a tool and kills him. She, Sarah and David bury Callum in a manhole under their home. They pretend to know nothing about Callum's disappearance and try to continue with their lives. A car crash occurs and a large vehicle smashes into their home leading {{to the discovery of}} Callum's body. Kylie and David try to convince Sarah to keep up their pretence and deny all knowledge of his murder. Tony Stewart, who had recently died, is blamed for the murder and David helps manipulate the situation so that police also believe the theory. Kylie decides that she cannot bring her children up in the home she killed Callum. She convinces David to permanently move to Barbados to be with her sister, Becky. To celebrate Kylie goes to the pub to collect champagne. She hears an argument and decides to investigate. She is shocked to find Gemma being attacked by Clayton and decides to intervene. He reacts by stabbing Kylie and she begins to bleed uncontrollably. David rushes to her aid and an ambulance is called. She acknowledges she is dying and says her goodbyes to David and Gail. She then dies and paramedics fail to resuscitate her.|$|E
