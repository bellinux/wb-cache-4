5|$|In 1883 Hardwicke Rawnsley was {{appointed}} vicar of Crosthwaite. In {{a study of}} Lake District towns in 1974, H A L Rice commented that to write about Keswick without mentioning Rawnsley would {{be the equivalent of}} writing about Stratford-upon-Avon without mentioning Shakespeare, so great was Rawnsley's impact on the town. He and his wife set up classes to teach metalwork and wood carving; these grew into the Keswick School of Industrial Art, which trained local craftsmen and -women from 1894 until it closed in 1986. He revived the ancient May Day festival in the town, and was a leading figure in the establishment of Keswick School, Blencathra Sanatorium and the County Farm School. As co-founder of the National Trust, Rawnsley contributed to Keswick's continued growth as a tourist centre, with the acquisition by <b>the</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>of</b> many acres of popular scenic land around Derwentwater, beginning with Brandelhow Wood in 1902.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Integrating <b>the</b> typologies <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> {{dimensions}} and <b>trust</b> ideal-types with <b>the</b> new typologies <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> forms and trust bases, I propose a geocentric framework <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> {{in general and}} <b>of</b> organizational <b>trust</b> in particular. <b>The</b> typology <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> forms is built on the dimension of spatial strength to address <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> building from weak trust to strong <b>trust</b> and on <b>the</b> dimension of temporal stage to address <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> building from initial trust to mature <b>trust.</b> <b>The</b> typology <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> bases is built on <b>the</b> dimension <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> sources to address <b>the</b> bases <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> building from depersonalized sources to personalized sources and on <b>the</b> dimension <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> domains to address <b>the</b> bases <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> building from dyad domains to network domains. Together with its three pillars (trust-building mechanisms, leadership and trust-as-choice), <b>the</b> central theme <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> building connects all four trust typologies toward a geocentric framework that integrates and transcends the cultural values of the East and the West.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{an objective}} model <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in peer-to-peer networks. Based on this model, we develop protocols {{that can be}} used by the peers in a peer-to-peer network to compute <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> values <b>of</b> other peers in these networks. According to our model, <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> value <b>of</b> a peer is the probability that this peer sends correct messages to other peers, provided that this probability is at least 0. 6. (A peer whose probability of sending correct messages is less than 0. 6 is regarded as a bad peer that cannot be trusted by other peers in the network.) Each peer actively monitors several good peers in the network and accurately estimates <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> values <b>of</b> each of them. The peers then exchange messages about <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good peers that they have monitored, and each of them ends up accurately computing <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> values <b>of</b> many good peers in the network, even though many of the exchanged messages are arbitrarily wrong.

5|$|Craig {{retired from}} {{first-class}} cricket at just 26years {{of age in}} 1962, but continued playing for Mosman in Sydney grade cricket on weekends until 1969. His marriage to Rosslyn Carroll in 1962 and his pharmaceutical career prevented him from applying himself fully to cricket. The couple had {{a boy and a}} girl, as well as an adopted son. Craig joined the Australian subsidiary of the British pharmaceutical firm Boots, rising to the position of managing director. He later served {{on the board of directors}} of the Bradman Museum in Bowral and later became its chairman. He was a board member of the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) for three years and served on <b>the</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>of</b> the Sydney Cricket Ground for varying periods from 1968 to 1996, totalling 18years. Upon first being appointed in 1968 to replace Stan McCabe, Craig was the youngest ever trustee of the SCG. One of the most controversial incidents during this time occurred in 1977–78 during the period of the breakaway World Series Cricket, which wanted to install floodlights at the SCG. The NSWCA opposed this, while the government sided with WSC. As a result of Craig's support of the NSWCA, the government dismissed him. Craig retired as the managing director of Boots' Australian subsidiaries. Craig was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997 for his contributions to cricket as a player and administrator. He died in Bowral from cancer on 16 November 2014.|$|E
5|$|Gonsales is a Spaniard {{forced to}} flee the country after killing {{a man in a}} duel. Having made his fortune in the East Indies, he decides to return to Spain, but falls ill on the voyage home and is set off on the island of St Helena to recover. There he discovers a species of wild swan able to carry {{substantial}} loads, the gansa, and contrives a device that allows him to harness many of them together and fly around the island. Once fully recovered, Gonsales resumes his journey home, but his ship is attacked by an English fleet off the coast of Tenerife. He uses his flying machine to escape to the shore, but once safely landed he is approached by hostile natives and is forced to take off again. This time his birds fly higher and higher, towards the Moon, which they reach after a journey of twelve days. There Gonsales encounters the Lunars, a tall Christian people inhabiting {{what appears to be a}} utopian paradise. After six months of living among them, Gonsales becomes homesick and concerned for the condition of his birds, and sets off to return to Earth. He lands in China, where he is immediately arrested as a magician, but after learning the language manages to win <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> <b>of</b> the local mandarin. The story ends with Gonsales meeting a group of Jesuit missionaries, who arrange to have a written account of his adventures sent back to Spain.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> <b>of</b> investors by his dress, by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had not engaged in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{participation}} in the baronial reform movement, Gloucester still maintained <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> <b>of</b> the king. He, Gaveston and the Earl of Warenne were the only earls to accompany the king on a Scottish campaign in 1310–11. In March 1311, while the Ordinances {{were still in the}} workings, Gloucester was appointed guardian of the realm while the king was still in Scotland. There are signs that he might have fallen out with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster – who was at this point the leader of the opposition against the king – over a feud between two of their respective retainers. When Gaveston once more returned from exile, however, Gloucester sided with the baronial opposition. The earls divided the country into different parts for defence, and Gloucester was given charge of the south. In June 1312, Gaveston was captured by Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who was working in cooperation with Lancaster. Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, who had the custody of Gaveston and had guaranteed his safety to the king, appealed to Gloucester, as Gaveston's kinsman, for assistance. Gloucester, however, refused to help, and Gaveston was killed. This act brought the country to the brink of civil war, and Gloucester {{was one of the few}} men who was still trusted enough by both sides to be able to take on a role as mediator. In the following months, he was among the main negotiators working towards an agreement between the king and the offending earls, an effort that was at least temporarily successful.|$|E

He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct.

Much of Richard's time as archbishop was spent in a dispute with Roger de Pont L'Evêque, the Archbishop of York over the primacy of England, and with St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury over the archbishop's jurisdiction over the abbey. Richard had better relations with King Henry II of England than Becket had, and was employed by the king on diplomatic affairs.
