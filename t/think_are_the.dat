500|$|In a quote used by Columbia University Press, Garner praised Animal Rights Without Liberation {{for being}} the first {{sustained}} attempt to use an interest-based theory of rights for animals, {{and the first to}} use such a theory to challenge animals' right to liberty. In his 2013 A Theory of Justice for Animals, Garner challenges Cochrane on his use of the argument from marginal cases. If animals are assumed to have an equal interest in life as typical humans because marginal humans are, then one could also assume animals to have an equal interest in liberty, because of the assumption of marginal humans' interest in liberty. Cochrane, however, denies that marginal humans are assumed to have a strong interest in liberty. The first part of the argument, Garner observes, assumes that marginal humans are considered to have an equal interest in (or an equal right to) life; this is a claim which Garner challenges, reaching what he considers a more nuanced position than Cochrane's. Nonetheless, the ideal theory which Garner endorses—the enhanced sentience position—is close to Cochrane's interest-based rights position. Garner himself identifies differences between his thought and Cochrane's in their respective use of the argument from marginal cases and the fact that Garner offers a nonideal theory, while Cochrane does not. Garner also questions the extent to which Cochrane is right that his reliance on interest rights is new, suggesting that Feinberg, James Rachels and Steve Sapontzis all used the language of interest rights. Garner adds that [...] "what Cochrane does, unlike Sapontzis, is to draw what I <b>think</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> correct conclusions from the adoption of an interest-based theory of animal rights".|$|E

[...] "The most interesting characters you see on most shows, don't you <b>think,</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ones that have a mixture? There's {{no such thing as}} pure evil. There's no such thing as pure good," [...] said Johansson. [...] "I love this character. [...] has come up with something that is a mixture between my father, his father, and The Great Santini." [...] His evil side comes to the forefront when his marriage to Deb crumbles. Dan experiences rivalry with his brother throughout the early seasons. His relationships with Karen and Deb are also major storylines in the series, and he tries to make amends for his wrongdoings despite his occasional impulse not to.|$|E

60|$|Sir,--Your English readers, better {{acquainted with}} your poems and romances than with your criticisms, have long {{wondered}} at the indefatigable hatred which pursues your memory. You, {{who knew the}} men, will not marvel that certain microbes of letters, the survivors of your own generation, still harass your name with their malevolence, while old women twitter out their incredible and heeded slanders in the literary papers of New York. But their persistent animosity does not quite suffice to explain the dislike with which many American critics regard the greatest poet, perhaps the greatest literary genius, of their country. With a commendable patriotism, they are not apt to rate native merit too low; and you, I <b>think,</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only example of an American prophet almost without honour in his own country.|$|E
60|$|Lady Desmond's {{heart was}} {{somewhat}} softened by this appeal; nor would I have it {{thought that she}} was a cruel woman, or an unnatural mother. It had not been her lot to make an absolute, dearest, heartiest friend of her daughter, as some mothers do; a friend between whom and herself there should be, nay could be, no secrets. She could not become young again in sharing the romance of her daughter's love, in enjoying the gaieties of her daughter's balls, in planning dresses, amusements, and triumphs with her child. Some mothers can do this; and they, I <b>think,</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> mothers who enjoy most fully the delights of maternity. This was not the case with Lady Desmond; but yet she loved her child, and would have made any reasonable sacrifice for what she regarded as that child's welfare.|$|E
6000|$|We {{had made}} the {{acquaintance}} of a Flemish artist of extraordinary merit, at Paris; and this gentleman (Mr. Wappers) kindly called this morning {{to take us to}} see the gallery. The collection is not particularly large, nor is it rich in cabinet pictures, being chiefly composed of altar-pieces taken from churches. The works are principally those of Rubens, Vandyke, {{and a few of the}} older masters. The Vandykes, I <b>think,</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> best. On the whole, it struck me there were more curious than pleasing pictures in this gallery, although they are all valuable as belonging to a school. The study of the [...] "Descent from the Cross" [...] is among them, and it gave me more pleasure than anything else. Vandyke certainly rose in our estimation, after this close comparison with his great rival: he is altogether more human than Rubens, who is a sort of Dutch giant in the art; out of the natural proportions, and always a giant.|$|E
