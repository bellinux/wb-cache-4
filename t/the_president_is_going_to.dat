When Winchell began gossiping in 1924 for the late scatological tabloid Evening Graphic, no U.S. paper hawked rumors about the marital relations of public figures until they turned up in divorce courts.

As you may be aware it was us in IEEE who started the mechatronics activities, and now we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have a new series of conferences in this area (please see the message below). For our chapters, we have increased our financial support and plan to provide other types of backing in the future.

What I have listed above are only a few items from a long list. In short, the past two years have been full of rewarding excitements and we have exciting years in front of us. This is an open invitation to you to play a more active role in our activities. This can be in our conferences, in our technical activities, in our publications, chapters, etc. Please contact <b>the</b> related Vice <b>President.</b> I would like to take this opportunity to wish you a joyous holiday season and a wonderful New Year.
