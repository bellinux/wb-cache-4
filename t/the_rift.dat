5|$|After {{spending}} the night together, Tosh and Tommy return to the hospital as the disruptions intensify, accompanied by Jack. During one disruption, the three witness the 1918 Torchwood team; Jack relays instructions through Tommy {{for them to take}} the 1918 version of Tommy into their custody before the older Tommy arrives. Tommy and Tosh share a goodbye, and Jack briefs Tommy on using <b>the</b> <b>Rift</b> Key before he steps back to 1918 during the next disruption. However, when back in the past, Tommy becomes shell-shocked, and is led back to his bed by nurses; he is unable to operate <b>the</b> <b>Rift</b> Key in his state. At Torchwood's headquarters, Jack and Tosh use the Cardiff Rift to project an image of Tosh into Tommy's mind. Tommy senses some familiarity with Tosh but otherwise does not recognise her. Despite this, Tosh is able to instruct Tommy to activate <b>the</b> <b>Rift</b> Key, and the distortions at the hospital soon dissipate. Recovering from events, Tosh brushes off Owen's sympathy and takes a moment to consider her short time with Tommy.|$|E

After the War Mage and the Sorceress begin to communicate with their master, he explains that he started to open <b>the</b> <b>Rifts</b> again because <b>the</b> world beyond <b>the</b> <b>Rifts</b> could not cope without <b>the</b> magic <b>the</b> <b>Rifts</b> provided.|$|R

5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens <b>the</b> <b>rift,</b> {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part of the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close <b>the</b> <b>rift,</b> but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening <b>the</b> <b>rift,</b> she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E
5|$|The {{continent}} didn't {{split into}} two because the Grenville province (a microcontinent) was converging with the proto-North American continent to the east.

After hearing about the trouble with the corpses, the Doctor convinces Gwyneth to help him hold a s√©ance to attempt to {{communicate}} with the dead. The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open <b>the</b> <b>rift</b> that exists {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross <b>the</b> <b>Rift.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Kohala, the {{numerous}} dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from seeping downslope to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go. Rather, the Kohala dike complex guides it northwest or southeast, down {{the axis of}} <b>the</b> <b>rift</b> zones, just like the surface water. On the other hand, the three smaller valleys between the large ones - Honopue, Honokea, and Honokane Iki - {{as well as the}} many smaller gulches which are not yet valleys, are deprived of groundwater by the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>rift</b> zone and its dikes. Without the large amount of water that is received by the bigger valleys, these valleys grow far more slowly. Due to its topography as essentially a flat crater floor surrounded by cones and fault scarps, the main caldera is affected relatively little by erosion from water.|$|E
5|$|Later in his career, Ford {{split with}} Huddleston's successor, Mitch McConnell, over a {{proposed}} settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies.

Both proposals were ultimately defeated, and <b>the</b> <b>rift</b> between Ford and McConnell never healed.|$|E
5|$|Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano has {{its origins}} in {{continental}} rifting‚Äîa long rupture in the Earth's crust where the lithosphere is being pulled apart. This incipient rifting has formed {{as a result of}} the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to <b>the</b> <b>rift</b> known as faults. Basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create effusive eruptions. <b>The</b> <b>rift</b> zone has existed for at least 14.9million years, and has created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Several dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active, with The Volcano being one of the three having erupted in the last few hundred years. Tseax Cone, which last erupted in the 18th century, is the southernmost volcano in the province, while Prindle Volcano in easternmost-central Alaska, which erupted more than 10,000years ago, is generally considered the northernmost.|$|E
50|$|Abstract mafic {{rocks at}} Lake Nipigon give {{evidence}} of rift-related continental basaltic magmatism during <b>the</b> Midcontinent <b>Rift</b> System event, estimated at 1,109 million years ago. Great sills up to 150 to(-) 200 m thick are also related with <b>the</b> <b>rifting</b> event, forming cliffs hundreds of meters high. The mafic and ultramafic intrusions centered on Lake Nipigon represent a failed arm of <b>the</b> main <b>rift</b> called <b>the</b> Nipigon Embayment.|$|R
40|$|The Laptev Sea is {{of great}} {{significance}} for studying the processes of the initial breakup of continents. It is the southern termination of the Gakkel spreading ridge and thus the location of structural features resulting from a continental margin/spreading ridge intersection. The present-day understanding of the Laptev Shelf geology {{is based on the}} Russian multichannel seismic reflection data and extrapolation of the terrestrial geology. Geologic and plate-kinematic data are used to constrain the interpretation of the seismic reflection data. <b>The</b> Laptev <b>Rift</b> System consists of several deep subsided rifts and high standing blocks of the basement. From west to east these are: the West Laptev and South Laptev rift basins, Ust' Lena Rift, East Laptev and Stolbovoi horsts, Bel'kov-Svyatoi Nos and Anisin <b>rifts.</b> <b>The</b> central and eastern parts of the shelf have the greatest contrasts in the gravity field ranging from ‚àí 60 mGal over <b>the</b> <b>rifts</b> to 50 mGal over <b>the</b> horsts. <b>The</b> <b>rifts</b> contain up to five seismic stratigraphic units bounded by clear regional reflectors and underlain by folded heterogeneous basement. They are suggested to be Late Cretaceous to Holocene in age and reflect different stages of spreading ridge/continental margin interaction. The estimated total thickness of the rift-related sediments varies between 4 and 8 ‚Äì 10 km while the sedimentary cover on the uplifts is significantly reduced and generally does not exceed 1 ‚Äì 2 km. An eastward decrease of the total thickness of the sedimentary sections from about 10 km in the South Laptev Basin to 4 ‚Äì 5 km in <b>the</b> Bel'kov-Svyatoi Nos <b>Rift</b> and <b>the</b> simplicity of <b>the</b> entire <b>rift</b> structure may indicate a rejuvenation of <b>the</b> <b>rifts</b> in <b>the</b> same direction. <b>The</b> entire <b>rift</b> system is covered by the uppermost seismic unit, which probably reflects a deceleration of <b>the</b> <b>rifting</b> during <b>the</b> last reorganization of the North American/Eurasian plate interaction since about 2 Ma...|$|R
50|$|Seismic {{data in the}} {{offshore}} Indus basin show evidence of an early <b>rift</b> geometry below <b>the</b> Deccan volcanics. Imaging is hampered {{by the presence of}} volcanics, which partly infill <b>the</b> <b>rifts</b> and by <b>the</b> thick overlying Indus Fan section of Oligocene to Recent age. The precise age of <b>the</b> <b>rifts</b> is unknown but is interpreted as most likely a mid-Cretaceous to Paleocene age and associated with the break up of the Madagascar/Seychelles/Indo-Pakistan plate.|$|R
5|$|The Ethiopian hare is {{endemic to}} Africa, and {{is found in}} the Afromontane Biozone of Ethiopia, and in the borders of the Sudanian Savanna Biozone; it also occurs west of <b>the</b> <b>Rift</b> Valley, in the Ethiopian Highlands, and abundantly found around the Lake Tana in Ethiopia.

5|$|The Jackson's {{hartebeest}} {{does not}} have a clear taxonomic status. It is regarded as a hybrid between the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest.

From Lake Baringo to Mount Kenya, the Jackson's hartebeest significantly resembles the Lelwel hartebeest, whereas from Lake Victoria to the southern part of <b>the</b> <b>Rift</b> Valley it tends to be more like the Coke's hartebeest.|$|E

Gordon goes through underground water channels as aliens pick off the remaining marines. He arrives at the Lambda Complex, where scientists developed the teleportation technology that allowed travel to Xen. The remaining staff tell Gordon that the satellite failed to reverse {{the effects of the}} resonance cascade as an immensely powerful being {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>rift</b> is keeping it open. The scientists activate the teleporter to send Gordon to Xen and stop the being. In Xen, Gordon encounters the remains of researchers before him and defeats Gonarch, the huge egg-laying headcrab.

50|$|The Udokan Plateau {{is linked}} to the Sayan-Baykal uplift and more {{specifically}} to a place in <b>the</b> Chara <b>rift</b> where it widens. Collision of India and Eurasia may have initiated volcanism in the Sayan Baykal region including the Udokan Plateau. It is not certain however that volcanism was caused by <b>the</b> <b>rifting</b> in <b>the</b> case of the Udokan plateau. Much of the volcanic activity occurred before <b>the</b> <b>rifting.</b> Beneath <b>the</b> northern margin of the plateau, anomalies in the asthenosphere have been described. This plateau and the neighbouring Vitim plateau are underpinned by a low velocity low density anomaly. One theory states that variations in lithospheric thickness between <b>the</b> Baikal <b>rift</b> and <b>the</b> Siberian platform generate a convection current in the asthenosphere. Another theory links volcanism in the Udokan plateau and other volcanic fields in the territory to two mantle plumes. Isotope data suggest the presence of at least two mantle reservoirs beneath <b>the</b> Baikal <b>rift.</b>|$|R
