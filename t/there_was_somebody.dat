500|$|A new storyline {{began in}} August 2016 when Babe became {{the victim of}} a revenge attack, having {{accumulated}} several enemies over {{the months leading up to}} the attack. Several media outlets suggested a range of suspects, with the most prominent suspects being Claudette, Les and Pam, Abi and Sylvie. Other suspects included: Linda, Lee, Whitney, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) and Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). The episode that aired in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2016 saw Babe argue with Claudette, Les, Abi and Sylvie with each suspect later seen going out, before someone confronts Babe in the Vic, locking her in the freezer. The scene where Babe is locked in the freezer received the episode's [...] "duff-duff". Episodes following the attack showed Babe tell her family that Sylvie was responsible for the attack, but have a conversation with Abi revealing her as the true culprit. Badland said that the attack [...] "takes Babe by surprise" [...] as [...] "she clearly didn't know <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> out there capable of doing this to her or else she'd have seen it coming." [...] She opined that [...] "Babe doesn't think for a minute that Abi could ever get the better of her." ...|$|E

2500|$|The wing commander, Colonel Gabriel, {{was asked}} by Senator Stennis, {{what he thought about}} filing the false {{intelligence}} reports. Gabriel replied, [...] "My conjecture was... it goes to the world, the OPREP-4—-and I assume <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> on the loading list [...] that did not have a need to know, and the full report would be filed with the special report that was sent in at night." ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{the absence}} of {{pleasure}} is not bad unless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> for whom this absence is a deprivation.|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY [Rising.] I don’t mind {{waiting in}} the {{carriage}} at all, provided <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> to look at one.|$|R
6000|$|... "What can I do for you, ma'am?" [...] she asked, in a {{confidential}} whisper. [...] "Don't speak loud! <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> {{in the next}} room." ...|$|R
60|$|The rest waited silent, {{glad that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> {{to take a}} lead, {{and in a few}} moments Dane looked round again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{they ought}} to go tick. I don't think I've paid for any of mine I've bought this season. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> here yesterday--' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{moment the}} cellar-door was opened he shuffled {{down the steps}} {{as fast as he}} could go. He knew <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> down there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you sure?" [...] gasped {{the unfortunate}} Tombey, for his hopes had been high. [...] "Is there {{no hope for}} me? Perhaps <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> else!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] I said, {{speaking}} in French, [...] "très bong! <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> who comes at twelve, quelqu'un qui vient à midi, who can talk English." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Farmer Griggs {{took his}} pipe from out his mouth. [...] "Did'ee hear un, dame?" [...] said he. [...] "Zooks now, <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> outside the door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's strange!" [...] said Janet. [...] "I thought <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> else when I {{first came}} out. Still, of course, {{it was nearly}} dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't know, in a way, and yet I did. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> {{about who}} {{made me think}} of England, and then, you see, I heard you sing." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{his lips}} {{touching}} Decoud's ear he declared {{his belief that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> else besides themselves upon the lighter. Twice now {{he had heard the}} sound of stifled sobbing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you {{for saying}} that, Laura," [...] he returned, with much emotion. [...] "It's {{nice to know}} that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> who won't go back on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "G E O F F R E--why, {{it must be}} {{meant for}} Geoffrey. Yes, of course it <b>is</b> {{possible}} that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> else, Mr. Davies. Geoffrey!--how curious!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Anne {{paused a}} moment, and then answered,--unwillingly, as though driven {{to make a}} reply which she knew to be indiscreet. [...] "Because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> in the hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> {{else that}} I did love. Then {{he said that}} of course that {{put an end to}} it all, and he wished me good-bye ever so calmly." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{made her}} quite spring round. [...] "That's {{just what you}} asked me the other time--one of the days <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody.</b> And I told you I didn't call anybody anything." ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{a curious}} effect about her as though {{when she went}} round the corner she would become {{somebody}} else. And a curious recurrent feeling that round the corner <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> else.|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be Lane's last throw," [...] said Haldane quietly. [...] "Ah! The tide <b>is</b> turning. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> who doesn't {{belong to}} us making {{a deal with}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Speaking of the claim, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> else to see you," [...] began Allen, {{when the}} talk was {{interrupted}} by the clattering of horses' hoofs on the rocks outside.|$|R
6000|$|I {{pointed to}} the new cottage. [...] "That ugly building," [...] I answered, [...] "seems to give you more room than you want--unless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> else living at the mill." ...|$|R
60|$|MAZZINI. Your {{housekeeper}} told me <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> upstairs, {{and gave}} me a pistol that Mr Hushabye had been practising with. I thought it would frighten him; but it went off at a touch.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Suspected? I {{should think}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> suspected. Egod!' said Bounderby, relinquishing Mrs. Sparsit's arm {{to wipe his}} heated head. 'Josiah Bounderby of Coketown {{is not to be}} plundered and nobody suspected. No, thank you!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's an {{official}} statement," [...] he {{continued in the}} same cautious mutter. [...] "It may be a lie. But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> arrested between midnight {{and one in the}} morning on Tuesday. This is certain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mary, [...] "a commander, to {{take the}} lead, and decide the {{thousand}} little questions which are likely to occur. Unless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> to decide them, <b>there</b> will <b>be</b> endless disputes." ...|$|R
6000|$|DUKE. [Continuing {{to lecture}} with enthusiasm.] Why, everything's {{temperament}}, you know! It's her temperament {{to see the}} fairies. It's my temperament not to see the fairies. Why, I've walked all round the grounds twenty times and never saw a fairy. Well, it's like that about this wizard or whatever she calls it. For her <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>there.</b> For us <b>there</b> would not <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>there.</b> Don't you see? ...|$|R
6000|$|The seated {{figure had}} risen from her chair, and turned a young and pretty face {{somewhat}} superciliously towards the stranger, as {{she said in a}} low tone to her unseen auditor, [...] "Hush! <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> here." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently Marston, {{looking over}} the rail, {{imagined}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> behind him on the deck. For a moment or two, however, he did not turn. He had heard no step and had recently felt himself highly strung. It looked as if Don Felix's death {{had given him a}} jar, but {{he was not going to}} indulge his shaken nerves. Still he felt <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> about and he slowly and deliberately looked round. The mulatto who had visited him before squatted on the deck, as if he had been there some time. Marston thought he saw amusement in his wrinkled face and his anger arose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you wouldn't {{thought so}} if you seen me over at our house. It seemed like <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> dead; I dasn't hardly go in, it was so dark and still. Whyn't you there? Didn't pop come home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It was Lapham who resumed the talk. [...] "I'm {{afraid we}} can't {{either of us}} see this thing in the right light. We're too near to it. I wish to the Lord <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> to talk to about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite unnecessary," [...] Harcutt {{declared}} briskly. [...] "Frankly, I don't {{believe in}} Mr. Sabin's golf. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> or something down here connected with his schemes; the golf is a subterfuge. He plays well {{because he does}} everything well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} {{pretend to be}} shy," [...] Rupert said, laughing. [...] "I can guess what 'the fact is.' I suppose that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> in your case too, and that you are {{just waiting to be}} married till mademoiselle goes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{often think}} that I must have missed {{a great deal}} by keeping single," [...] said the latter. [...] "It must be very {{pleasant}} when you’re away to know that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> at home counting the minutes until your return." ...|$|R
