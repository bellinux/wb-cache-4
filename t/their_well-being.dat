5|$|Tyler was a slaveholder, at {{one point}} keeping forty slaves at Greenway. Although he {{regarded}} slavery as an evil, and {{did not attempt to}} justify it, he never freed any of his slaves. Tyler considered slavery a part of states’ rights, and therefore the federal government lacked the authority to abolish it. The living conditions of his slaves are not well documented, but historians surmise that he cared for <b>their</b> <b>well-being</b> and abstained from physical violence against them.In December 1841, Tyler was attacked by abolitionist publisher Joshua Leavitt, with the unsubstantiated allegation that Tyler had fathered several sons with his slaves, and later sold them. A number of African American families today maintain a belief in their descent from Tyler, but {{there is no evidence of}} such genealogy.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in <b>their</b> <b>well-being.</b> Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E

25|$|Early old {{age is a}} {{pleasant}} time; children are grown, retirement from work, time to pursue interests.

25|$|Perceived {{organizational}} support (POS) is {{the degree}} to which employees believe that their organization values their contributions and cares about <b>their</b> <b>well-being</b> and fulfills socioemotional needs. POS is generally thought to be the organization's contribution to a positive reciprocity dynamic with employees, as employees tend to perform better to reciprocate received rewards and favorable treatment. This idea bloomed from Eisenberger and Rhoades' organizational support theory.|$|E
25|$|Concern for {{the fate}} of the Ethiopian Jews and fear for <b>their</b> <b>well-being</b> contributed {{eventually}} to the Israeli government's official recognition of the Beta Israel community as Jews in 1975, for the purpose of the Law of Return.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} whether subjective well-being of high school students is predicted by their academic, social, and emotional self-efficacy. The sample of this study consisted of 311 high school students of whom 64 % (n= 199) were girls and 36 % (n= 112) were boys. Data were collected by the Self-Efficacy Scale for Children, the Positive and Negative Experience Scale, and the Life Satisfaction Scale and analyzed through multiple regression analysis. Results showed that high school students’ academic, social, and emotional self-efficacy explained 19 % of variance in <b>their</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> and predicted <b>their</b> subjective <b>well-being.</b> Activities performed by school counselors to increase students’ academic, social, and emotional self-efficacy levels are thought to contribute to <b>their</b> subjective <b>well-being...</b>|$|R

25|$|Hugentobler, Israel, and Schurman (1992) {{detailed}} a different, multi-layered {{intervention in}} a mid-sized Michigan manufacturing plant. The {{hub of the}} intervention was the Stress and Wellness Committee (SWC) which solicited ideas from workers on ways to improve both <b>their</b> <b>well-being</b> and productivity. Innovations the SWC developed included improvements that ensured two-way communication between workers and management and reduction in stress resulting from diminished conflict over issues of quantity versus quality. Both the interventions described by Adkins and Hugentobler et al. had {{a positive impact on}} productivity.|$|E

25|$|Organizational support theory {{says that}} in order to meet socioemotional needs and to assess the {{benefits}} of increased work effort, employees form a general perception concerning {{the extent to which the}} organization values their contributions and cares about <b>their</b> <b>well-being.</b> Such POS would increase employees' felt obligation to help the organization reach its objectives, increase their identification with the organization, and contribute to their expectation that improved performance would be rewarded. Behavioral outcomes of POS would include increased in-role and extra-role performance, increased organizational commitment, and decreased withdrawal behaviors such as absenteeism and turnover.|$|E

25|$|During the epidemic, normal {{gameplay}} was disrupted. Player responses varied but resembled real-world behaviors. Some {{characters with}} healing abilities volunteered their services, some lower-level characters {{who could not}} help would direct people away from infected areas, some characters would flee to uninfected areas, and some characters attempted to spread the disease to others. Players in the game reacted to the disease {{as if there were}} real risk to <b>their</b> <b>well-being.</b> Blizzard Entertainment attempted to institute a voluntary quarantine to stem the disease, but it failed, as some players didn't take it seriously, while others took advantage of the pandemonium. Despite certain security measures, players overcame them by giving the disease to summonable pets. Blizzard was forced to fix the problem by instituting hard resets of the servers and applying quick fixes.|$|E
25|$|The {{home country}} {{organization}} will contact a partner {{organization in the}} country of the student’s choice. Students accepted for the program {{may or may not be}} screened by the organization in their home country. Partner organizations in the destination country each have differing levels of screening they require students to pass through before being accepted into their program. For example, students coming to the U.S. may be allowed to come on the recommendation of the organization in their home country, or the hosting partner may require the student to submit a detailed application, including previous school report cards, letters from teachers and administrators, and standardized English fluency exam papers. The U.S. agency may then accept or decline the applicant. Some organizations also have Rules of Participation. For example, almost all U.S. organizations cannot allow an exchange student to drive an automobile during their visit. Some organizations require a written contract that sets standards for personal behavior and grades, while others may be less rigorous. Lower cost programs can result in a student participating without a supervisor being available nearby to check on the student's well-being. Programs provided by agencies that provide compensation for representatives are more likely to retain local representatives to assist and guide the student and keep track of <b>their</b> <b>well-being.</b>|$|E

Migration of students is one the burning social issues today, which finally affects the academic progress and level of performance of the students. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to suggest practical implementation of Sen’s capability approach that is able to preserve its interpretative reality and methodological problems that couldn’t find an operative solution in more standard approaches to migrated students and <b>their</b> socio-economic <b>well-being</b> analysis. A strategy based on fuzzy sets theory has been suggested to analyze why this kind of approach could be useful for dealing with the complexity of a multidimensional assessment of well-being. Finally, the analysis depicts that the student community and <b>their</b> <b>well-beings</b> in terms of safe living, educations, social and psychological well-being is affected very badly...|$|R

500|$|The {{perceived}} interest response {{describes the}} outcome of a bargained decision when one individual attaches less value to his or her well-being.
