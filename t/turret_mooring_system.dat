40|$|ABSTRACTFloating {{production}} {{storage and}} offloading (FPSO) facilities are used {{at most of}} the offshore oil fields worldwide. FPSO usage {{is expected to grow}} as oil fields move to deeper water, thus requiring the reliability and stability of mooring wires and risers in extreme environmental conditions. Except for the case of predictable attack angles of external loadings, FPSO facilities with turret single point mooring (SPM) systems are in general use. There are two types of turret systems: permanent systems and disconnectable turret mooring systems. Extreme environment criteria for permanent moorings are usually based on a 100 -year return period event. It is common to use two or three environments including the 100 -year wave with associated wind and current, and the 100 -year wind with associated waves and current. When fitted with a disconnectable <b>turret</b> <b>mooring</b> <b>system,</b> FPSOs can be used in areas where it is desirable to remove the production unit from the field temporarily to prevent exposure to extreme events such as cyclones or large icebergs. Static and dynamic mooring analyses were performed to evaluate the stability of a spider buoy after disconnection from a turret during cyclone environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the coming}} years, {{there will be}} a growing demand for Floating Production and Storage Units (FPSOs) for ultra deep waters (greater than 2, 000 meters) worldwide.

40|$|This paper summarises {{the main}} results of {{experimental}} tests {{conducted at the}} Danish Hydraulic Institute {{in the frame of}} the EU-TMR-LSF project “A New Concept of Catenary <b>Mooring</b> <b>System</b> for FPSO”.

Here, a kind of dynamic positioning (DP) controller in terms of structural reliability is presented for the single-point turret-moored FPSOs. Firstly, the mathematical model of the moored FPSO in terms of kinematics and dynamics is established. Secondly, the catenary method is applied to analyze the mooring line dynamics, and mathematical model of one single mooring line is set up based on the catenary equation. Thereafter, mathematical model for the whole <b>turret</b> <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> is established. Thirdly, a structural reliability index is defined to evaluate the breaking strength of each mooring line. At the same time, control constraints are also considered to design a state feedback controller using the backstepping technique. Finally, a series of simulation tests are carried out for a certain turret-moored FPSO with eight mooring lines. It is shown in the simulation results that the moored FPSO can keep its position well in extreme seas. Besides, the FPSO mooring line tension is reduced effectively to ensure mooring lines safety to a large extent in harsh sea environment...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{aquaculture}} {{has been}} the fastest-growing animal food producing industry in the world. However, the absence of suitable production areas might potentially become the most limiting factor for future production growth. This motivates and necessitates the development of open sea fish farming. Design of offshore aquaculture systems is a novel and unique engineering challenge, which will depend on numerical tools that can simulate and predict the structural response in open sea conditions. In this master thesis, a vessel-shaped fish farm concept for offshore fish farming is studied. The vessel uses a <b>turret</b> <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> for station keeping and is designed to break incoming waves and reduce environmental loads on the system. Dynamic analyses {{have been carried out}} using numerical simulation programs, with the aim to analyse vessel motions, mooring lines, fish nets, and coupled motions of the system. For studies of the hydrodynamic properties of the vessel, different panel models were created using the design analysis tool GeniE. The RAOs in heave, roll, and pitch were obtained from frequency domain analyses of the vessel hull, using the potential flow solver Wadam. Hydrodynamic data acquired from frequency domain analyses were exported from Wadam to SIMO, the program used for quasi-static time domain analysis of the vessel and simplified mooring system. Based on the mooring lines performance in SIMO, new mooring line parameters were established for the fully coupled time domain simulations in SIMO-Riflex, where fully coupled time domain analyses of the vessel-shaped fish farm was carried out. A sensitivity study was carried out from the fully coupled time domain simulations by comparing three different fish net models; rigid model, flexible model, and flexible model with no reduction factor. It was found that the simplified models overestimate the drag forces on the system, and it is recommended that neither of the simplified models should be used for future dynamic analyses of aquaculture systems. Development of tension in the foremost and rearmost fish nets was studied in steady current conditions, and with a conjunction of regular waves and steady currents. A mutual dependency between the forces on the net and its deformations was found. Motions of the coupled fish farm system and the efficiency of mooring lines were studied in time domain simulations with regular waves and steady currents...|$|E
40|$|Compared to land, {{rail and}} air, sea {{transport}} {{has proven to}} have the largest contribution to the transport of goods and is witnessing a continuous growth over the years. The existing ports are dealing with an increasing flow of goods and the transporting vessels, resulting in capacity problems. New innovations and technology are needed to encounter these problems and in a sustainable way. One of the solutions proposed is to expand towards the sea. A floating port at a certain distance from land could reduce the pressure on these ports. The objective of the thesis is to examine feasibility of an offshore floating terminal for container transshipment with an annual throughput of 1 million TEU. Different locations {{around the world with}} high potential for the container transshipment have been proposed as possible locations for the floating terminal. The first step was to design the terminal according to certain requirements. Except for accommodating a number of activities, the terminal has also the function of creating protected waters for the vessels calling on it. Different floating concepts were examined for their eligibility and finally a pontoon-shaped structure was chosen for the form of the hull of the terminal. The terminal has a rectangular- shaped layout with a length dimension of 1190 m and a width of 240 m. Berthing facilities and 11 quay cranes are provided at the lee side of the terminal for the loading and unloading operations of the containers. The heart {{of the study was to}} draw conclusions about the operability of the designed system based on the results of a hydrodynamic research. Computer models such as DELFRAC and SEAWAY were used to calculate the responses of both the terminal and vessel, in different sea conditions. According to the criteria for container vessel motions during lifting operations and the response calculations, it was concluded that the (un) loading operations of the containers could proceed safely up to sea conditions with a significant wave height of 3 m. This state represents the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) for the designed system and is of importance for determining the downtime of the terminal as result of the wind waves generated motions. Station keeping of the terminal is necessary to prevent the terminal from being drifted away by sea loads. After considering a number of alternatives to achieve this function, it is finally chosen for a combined DP thrusters- <b>turret</b> <b>mooring</b> <b>system.</b> The system will make it possible for the terminal to maintain a beam-on position to waves during operating conditions. This is to fulfil the function as a breakwater. During high seas, the terminal rotates till a bow-on position (heading) to waves. The last characteristic of the system will result in reduction of the sea loads on the terminal and thus also the mooring loads during aggressive sea conditions. The total construction cost of the terminal, including the necessary equipment is estimated for 448 million Euros. The terminal revenues are represented in the transshipment fee that the shipping liners must pay when using the terminal. According to the results of the financial analyses, a minimum fee of 125 Euro per TEU must be charged in order to make the terminal cost-effective. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|From {{a marine}} {{operational}} point of view, a precise position and motion control of ships and other floating structures are important. In order {{to design a}} mooring system that can satisfy this, the top end motion of the mooring lines must be calculated. The excitation loads on a moored vessel are due to wind, waves and current. The wind is characterized as a static force excited by the mean wind speed, and as a low-frequency force excited by wind gusts. The waves are characterized by static mean forces, first order linear forces and second order non-linear wave forces. The current forces are considered as static forces. The main categories of station keeping are pure mooring systems, such as spread and single-point moorings, dynamic positioning systems and thruster-assisted mooring systems. Typical arrangements are taut, semi-taut and catenary systems. Mooring lines {{can be divided into}} several segments, with different material and buoyancy elements along the line. Mooring lines are often made of chain, synthetic fibre rope, wire rope or a combination of them. Three limit states are described; intact (ULS), accidental (ALS) and fatigue (FLS). Generally there are three different methods to compute the response of a floating structure; the frequency domain, time domain or a combined time and frequency domain approach. In the frequency domain, the non-linear restoring terms and damping terms are linearised and the low- and wave-frequency load effects are decoupled. The total contribution is then found by use of the superposition principle. In the time domain, the motions are solved simultaneously and non-linear effects are directly accounted for in the restoring and damping terms. The FPSO in question is located in the Barents Sea on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The ship-shaped unit has a passive <b>turret</b> <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> consisting of three bundles with five anchor lines each, resulting in 15 mooring lines. The vessel has in total 11 risers, with opportunity for future risers. A coupled SIMO-RIFLEX model provided by Statoil has been used to perform simple ULS and ALS analyses in the software SIMO, by use of the time domain approach. In this thesis three following limitations are considered valid; three environmental conditions are tested, the risers are disabled and the number of required simulations are found to be 14. In addition, the turret model is simplified to a beam element with zero torsional stiffness. Two important functional requirements for the FPSO are that the integrity of the risers are maintained, provided by an offset requirement, and that the safety factor for the moorings are fulfilled. Several analyses for the intact condition are performed for different 100 -years conditions for the loaded vessel. Four additional ALS analyses are conducted for the case with the most loaded line in ballast condition; one and two anchor line failure, and two definitions of the ALS extreme weather with 10 000 -year return period. The vessel offset, the mooring line tensions and the dynamic turret support forces for all cases are discussed and compared with the respective acceptance criteria. In addition, simple uplift calculations are derived for the intact condition and the condition most sensitive towards uplift. Ship-shaped units are sensitive to low-frequency motion, and therefore the sea state with the shortest period is the most critical one. The results show that the in-line condition leads to the highest tension in the mooring lines, hence this condition is further investigated for the accidental limit states. Both one and two line failures fulfils the requirements for permanent structures operating on the Norwegian Continental Shelf provided by DNV GL. Statoil has an internal requirement for the extreme weather conditions, both extreme conditions fulfils the criteria. Comparing two definitions of the ALS extreme weather with 10 000 -year return period, for the waves and wind, the waves were found to be the most critical extreme condition giving the highest responses of the ship-shaped unit and mooring system. Units with large topsides, such as semi-submersibles, are often more sensitive towards extreme wind. The dimensioning parameter for the FPSO is the tension in the heaviest loaded line in the two anchor line failure analysis, with a margin of 0. 27...|$|E

40|$|In the {{development}} of wave energy converters, the <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> is a key component for a safe station-keeping and {{an important factor in}} the cost of the wave energy production. Generally, when designing a <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> for a wave energy converter, two important conditions must be considered: (i) that the <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> must be strong enough to limit the drifting motions, even in extreme waves, tidal and wind conditions and (ii) it must be compliant enough so that the impact on wave energy production can be minimised. It is frequently found that these two conditions are contradictory. The existing solutions mainly include the use of heavy chains, which create a catenary shaped mooring configuration, allowing limited flexibility within the <b>mooring</b> <b>system,</b> and hence very large forces may still be present on mooring lines and thus on anchors. This solution is normally quite expensive if the costs of the materials and installation are included.

This study seeks to provide a novel mooring and anchor concept which can be used to design efficient <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> relevant to Floating Offshore Wind Turbines...|$|R
40|$|In global {{responses}} {{analysis for}} an innovative deep draft multi-spar platform, three {{different types of}} the <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> are considered, namely a catenary, a semi-taut and a taut <b>mooring</b> <b>system.</b> These three types of <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> have the same arrangements with similar static restoring force characteristics. In this paper, the platform motions and mooring responses in three different water depths ranging from 500 m to 1500 m are analyzed. The coupling effects between the spar platform and its mooring lines are investigated through a numerical simulation method. Free-decay and three hours simulations under certain sea state conditions in the South China Sea are executed. The specifi c numerical results and analysis conclusions would be helpful for <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> selection and motion performance study in the preliminary design...|$|R

The field has been developed with a production and storage vessel, connected to six subsea wellhead templates. Flexible risers carry the wellstream up to the vessel, which rotates around a cylindrical <b>turret</b> <b>moored</b> to the seabed. Risers and umbilicals are also connected to the turret. The ship has a processing plant on deck and storage tanks for stabilised oil.|$|R

40|$|In the {{deepwater}} exploitation {{of oil and}} gas, replacing the polyester rope by a wire in the chain-wire-chain mooring line is proved to be fairly economic, but this may provoke some corresponding problems. Te aim {{of this paper is}} to compare the fatigue damage of two <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> types, taking into account corrosion effects. Using a semi-submersible platform as the research object, two types of <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> of the similar static restoring stiffness were employed. Te mooring lines had the chain-wire-chain and chain-polyester-chain structure, respectively. Firstly, the numerical simulation model between the semi-submersible platform and its <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> was built. Te time series of mooring line tension generated by each short-term sea state of South China Sea S 4 area were calculated. Secondly, the rain flow counting method was employed to obtain the fatigue load spectrum. Thirdly, the Miner linear cumulative law model was used to compare the fatigue damage of the two <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> types in long-term sea state. Finally, the corrosion effects from zero to twenty years were considered, and the comparison between the fatigue damage of the two <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> types was recalculated...|$|R
