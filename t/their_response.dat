A model of consumer processing of international advertising has been proposed that consolidates a dual-element thesis comprising research on consumer processing of advertising, and several streams of research on cross-national individual difference variables. Empirical analysis of the hypothetical model through structural equation modeling yields supportive results: positive effects of consumers' country attitudes on <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> to the creative presentation of international advertising, and positive effects of consumers' country-of-origin perceptions on <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> to the buying proposal of international advertising. However, the hypothesized negative effects of consumer ethnocentrism on <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> to international advertising was not confirmed. The study contributes to our understanding of cross-national individual difference variables that precede and determine consumers' attitudes toward foreign advertisements. It has practical implications for standardization versus localization of international advertising strategy. ...|$|R

5|$|For a long time, {{bivalves}} {{were thought}} to be better adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks as an example of replacement by competition.

All this has been broadly disproven, though; rather, the prominence of modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in <b>their</b> <b>response</b> to extinction events.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia aculeata {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to <b>their</b> <b>response</b> to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from. It is serotinous—it accumulates a canopy seed bank that is released only in response to fire—so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime. Plants take three to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire.|$|E
