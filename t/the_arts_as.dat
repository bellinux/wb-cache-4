5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather than {{to the left of the}} stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is the same as that of the national flag. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>as</b> Pantone 032.|$|E

40|$|The paper aims at {{studying}} <b>the</b> {{potential of}} <b>art</b> {{of being a}} metaphorical “tool” for the interior design approach. The relationship between the design approach and artistic installations {{can be seen in}} three dimensions of the design process: in exploring the theoretical meaning of <b>the</b> space (<b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>as</b> a media to know novel vocations of spaces during the concept generation process); in experimenting the physical impact of the artefact in <b>the</b> space (<b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>as</b> a matter of innovation during the verification of the project); in expressing innovative spatial concepts (<b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>as</b> a “language” to communicate novel provocative and disruptive visions during the communication of the idea). We will choose (as case studies) those installations conceived by designers in order to underline the artistic value in the design field. In conclusion: we embrace <b>the</b> idea that <b>art</b> can be considered as a paradigmatic incubator in the process of “living” the Interiors. Starting from that, we are going to underline some methodological attitudes within the design culture in relation to the artistic research and to interpret new domestic aesthetics...|$|R

25|$|Protagoras {{does not}} deny being a Sophist, and claims {{that it is an}} ancient and honorable art, the same art practiced by Homer and Hesiod. These poets, he says, used <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>as</b> a screen, a front, to protect {{themselves}} from the charge. He says that he is more straightforward than the ancient artists, trainers, and musicians in frankly admitting that he is an educator. Protagoras says he is old enough now to be the father of any of the men present, and would like now to address himself to the whole company of people in the house. Socrates assumes that Prodicus would not want to miss the lecture, and so Callias and Alcibiades are sent to rouse him from his bed (317c–e). According to Francis Bacon, Prodicus is led to produce a speech in the dialogue (337a), which seems to Bacon as humiliating for him.|$|E
25|$|Ukrainian folk-stage dance {{began the}} path to {{transforming}} into its present incarnation first and foremost through the work of Vasyl Verkhovynets (b. 1880, original surname Kostiv), an actor, choir conductor, and amateur musicologist. Verkhovynets had acquired a professional level of training in <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>as</b> part of Mykola Sadovsky's theatrical troupe, which had itself incorporated a distinguished level of folk dance in its productions of dramas based on Ukrainian folk themes. While touring central Ukraine with the theatrical troupe, Verkhovynets' would take off whenever he could and visit the villages surrounding the cities he was performing in, {{in order to learn}} about and record the villages' traditional dances. His landmark book which he based upon this research, Theory of Ukrainian Folk Dance (Teopiя Українського Hapoднoго Taнкa) (1919), brought {{together for the first time}} the various steps and terminology now recognized by all contemporary students of Ukrainian dance. It also fundamentally altered the nature of Ukrainian folk dance by setting dances on a stage (with the audience seated at the front, two wings, and a backdrop), and laid out a method of transcribing folk dances, which was later put into use across the Soviet Union. This book has since been reprinted five times (the last time in 1990) and remains a basic instructional text of Ukrainian dance.|$|E

For that purpose, a new concept approach to state of <b>the</b> <b>art,</b> its origins, and its definition are suggested. Furthermore, it is strongly suggested that alternative research methods include three essential elements. It is advisable to advance in the theoretical and methodological fields of the state of <b>the</b> <b>art,</b> <b>as</b> a proposal to get a critical insight into the methodological strategies of the object of study which promote involvement, self-criticism and reflection within educational communities...|$|R
