500|$|Bradfield has {{described}} the recording of the album as preventing him from having a social life and Alex Silva attributes the break-up {{of his relationship with}} his girlfriend at the time to the long hours involved in the recording. Guitarist Richey Edwards attended recording sessions but would, according to Wire, [...] "collapse on <b>the</b> <b>settee</b> and have a snooze" [...] while the other band members did all the recording. He was drinking heavily and frequently crying. [...] "Inevitably", says Bradfield, [...] "the day would start with a 'schhht!'; the sound of a can opening." ...|$|E

60|$|Here the servant, napkin on arm, made {{a motion}} {{as if waiting}} his master's good pleasure.

2500|$|Aft of <b>the</b> <b>settee</b> on {{starboard}} is the galley. L-shaped, {{it features}} a large top opening ice box / refrigerator, [...] capacity, three burner propane stove with oven, hot and cold pressure water, and a deep double centreline sink.

Pot storage is located below the stove and there is additional storage {{above and below the}} galley sink area.|$|E
25|$|In {{the month}} between 19 July and 20 August, Mermaid {{captured}} ten vessels, five {{of which she}} burnt or scuttled. Four were <b>the</b> French <b>settee</b> Bien Venue, which had been sailing from Fréjus to Marseilles with deals (long wooden planks), <b>the</b> French <b>settee</b> San Antonio, which was sailing from Oneglia to La Silva with a cargo of snuff, <b>the</b> French <b>settee</b> Saint Pierre, which was sailing from Bandol to Marseilles with firewood, and an unnamed Spanish settee carrying barilla. Mermaid ran one French settee, which was carrying wheat, ashore and scuttled her too. The three vessels Mermaid kept were the Spanish sloop Saint Juan Baptiste, which was sailing from Cette to Genoa with wine, an unnamed Spanish <b>settee</b> carrying barilla, <b>the</b> French <b>settee</b> Sainte Barbe, which was sailing from Marseilles with wheat, the French ketch Notre dame de la Providence, which was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa with wine and flour, and <b>the</b> Genoese <b>settee</b> Conception, which was sailing from Bandol to Genoa with wine.|$|R
2500|$|In June, Centaur was {{involved}} in a brief action off Toulon before elements of Admiral Keith's fleet joined her. Centaur and [...] fired at a brig-corvette and several settees off Toulon. They were then able to capture and destroy four of <b>the</b> <b>settees.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Chauncy, being now {{tired of}} walking, went {{to sit down}} upon one of <b>the</b> <b>settees</b> next to where Hilbert and Rollo had just gone to take a seat. Mr. Chauncy was next to Hilbert. He {{immediately}} began to talk with Hilbert about the lottery.|$|R
2500|$|Connolly's biography, Billy, {{written by}} wife Pamela Stephenson, {{documented}} years {{of physical and}} sexual abuse by his father, which began when he was ten and lasted until he was about fifteen. [...] "Sometimes, when father hit me, I flew over <b>the</b> <b>settee</b> backwards in a sitting position. It was fabulous. Just like real flying, except you didn't {{get a cup of}} tea or a safety belt or anything." [...] In 1949, Mona gave birth to a son, Michael, by a [...] "local man". He was presented as a brother to Billy and Flo, and nobody questioned it.|$|E
2500|$|The large space {{contained}} numerous chairs, couches, {{and other}} furnishings in {{a blend of}} Indian and English design. Several pieces of [...] "deliberate Anglo-Indian design" [...] were created for the Dorothy Vernon Room, consisting of a sofa (Deanery.354), two armchairs (Deanery.355–356), and two side chairs (Deanery.357–358). These pieces were made of dark wood decorated with panels of perforated copper and stenciled designs in black paint on the frame. From a 1908 photograph of the room, one can see some of Garrett's teakwood furniture from Baltimore (e.g. Deanery.382–383), {{as well as the}} swing settee by de Forest and his Ahmedebad Wood Carving Co. <b>The</b> <b>settee</b> is composed of intricately carved teak panels and hangs from four elaborately designed brass chains that depict three-dimensional birds, elephants, and human figures.|$|E
60|$|Here Phil waited, {{at the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>settee.</b> She {{headed for}} a rocker, but he piled sofa-cushions for her {{at the other end of}} <b>the</b> <b>settee,</b> and she obediently sank down there.|$|E
60|$|So Rollo {{brought the}} boat {{up to the}} shore, and they all got out. Mr. and Mrs. Holiday walked up and took their seats on one of <b>the</b> <b>settees,</b> while Rollo and Lucia began to run about and play along the parapet wall which {{separated}} the promenade from the water.|$|R
60|$|It {{was decided}} Ikey {{should be left}} upon one of <b>the</b> <b>settees</b> in <b>the</b> park, while the others went {{on a tour of}} {{investigation}} for the purpose of finding new lodgings, and then the party separated with the understanding that they would meet an hour later to partake of breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|While Rollo was {{listening}} to this conversation, Hilbert's father and another gentleman who had been walking with {{him up and down}} the deck came and sat down on one of <b>the</b> <b>settees.</b> Very soon, Hilbert, seeing his father sitting there, came eagerly to him, and said, holding out his hand,-- ...|$|R

Coming forward between <b>the</b> <b>settee</b> and the writing table, he starts on seeing Barbara fashionably attired and in low spirits.|$|E
60|$|The surgeon now went away, leaving Rollo and Jane on <b>the</b> <b>settee</b> together.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} interior layouts were produced at the factory, with an even greater variety produced by home builders of the 400 kit boats sold. A typical layout will feature a galley and sizeable navigation station with a quarter berth aft, with two sofas or a sofa and dinette, a head and hanging locker, and a V-berth forwards. A common layout had pilot berths behind <b>the</b> <b>settees.</b> <b>The</b> quality of finish in the kit boats varies enormously, with some being well above factory standards.|$|R

2500|$|In 1803 Phoebe was sailing out of [...] Malta. At some point, perhaps {{during the}} summer, her boats {{participated in a}} {{disastrous}} attack on two French privateers off Civitavecchia. The privateers repulsed the British, who lost eight men killed and wounded. On 1 August, Phoebe captured two settées, which a French squadron recaptured. In recapturing <b>the</b> <b>settees,</b> <b>the</b> French squadron involved lost an opportunity to capture Phoebe, though they did capture the schooner [...] and a transport.|$|R

60|$|One morning, a {{few days}} after the storm {{described}} in the last chapter, Rollo was sitting upon one of <b>the</b> <b>settees</b> that stood around the skylight on the promenade deck, secured to their places by lashings of spun yarn, as has already been described, and was there listening to a conversation which was going on between two gentlemen that were seated on <b>the</b> next <b>settee.</b> <b>The</b> morning was very pleasant. The sun was shining, the air was soft and balmy, and the surface of the water was smooth. There was so little wind that the sails were all furled--for, in the case of a steamer at sea, the wind, even if it is fair, cannot help to impel the ship at all, unless it moves faster than the rate which the paddle wheels would of themselves carry her; and if it moves slower than this, of course, the steamer would by her own progress outstrip it, and the sails, if they were spread, would only be pressed back against the masts by the onward progress of the vessel, and thus her motion would only be retarded by them.|$|R
60|$|Austin {{sat down}} on <b>the</b> <b>settee</b> and blinked at the burly, {{hard-faced}} {{man in front of}} him.|$|E

50|$|On 21 and 22 October 1806, Lieutenant Sir William Parker again led Renomees {{boats in}} cutting-out expeditions. The first {{occurred}} at Colon, on Majorca, {{where in the}} face of enemy fire the British captured one tartane of four guns, and two settees, one of which mounted three guns. <b>The</b> <b>settees</b> were carrying grain and the British were able to bring them out. The tartan ran aground so the raiding party set her on fire, which led to her blowing up. One British seaman was wounded in the action.|$|R
60|$|The {{children}} {{stood by}} the railing of the deck for some time after they came up from below, gazing at the shores, and admiring the various pictures of rural beauty which the scene presented to the eye. At length, becoming a little tired, they went and sat down upon one of <b>the</b> <b>settees,</b> where {{they could have a}} more comfortable position, and still enjoy a good view. Not long afterward, the captain, who had been walking up and down the deck for some time, came and sat down by them.|$|R
50|$|A {{good number}} of boats were home finished, in many cases gaining a more {{practical}} galley in the starboard forward area of the cabin, but losing part of <b>the</b> starboard <b>settee</b> berth.|$|R
