40|$|International audienceGlobal aerosol {{and ozone}} {{distributions}} and their associated radiative forcings were simulated between 1850 and 2100 following a recent historical emission dataset {{and under the}} representative concentration pathways (RCP) for the future. These simulations were used in an Earth System Model {{to account for the}} changes in both radiatively and chemically active compounds, when simulating the climate evolution. The past negative stratospheric ozone trends result in a negative climate forcing culminating at − 0. 15 W m − 2 in the 1990 s. In the meantime, the tropospheric ozone burden increase generates a positive climate forcing peaking at 0. 41 W m − 2. The future evolution of ozone strongly depends on the RCP scenario considered. In RCP 4. 5 and RCP 6. 0, the evolution of both stratospheric and tropospheric ozone generate relatively weak radiative forcing changes until 2060 - 2070 followed by a relative 30 % decrease in radiative forcing by 2100. In contrast, RCP 8. 5 and RCP 2. 6 model projections exhibit strongly different ozone radiative forcing trajectories. In the RCP 2. 6 scenario, both effects (stratospheric ozone, a negative forcing, and tropospheric ozone, a positive forcing) decline towards 1950 s values while they both get stronger in the RCP 8. 5 scenario. Over the twentieth century, the evolution of the total aerosol burden is characterized by a strong increase after World War II until the middle of the 1980 s followed by a stabilization during the last decade due to the strong decrease in sulfates in OECD countries since the 1970 s. The cooling effects reach their maximal values in 1980, with − 0. 34 and − 0. 28 W m − 2 respectively for direct and indirect total radiative forcings. According to the RCP scenarios, the aerosol content, after peaking around 2010, is projected to decline strongly and monotonically during the twenty-first century for the RCP 8. 5, 4. 5 and 2. 6 scenarios. While for RCP 6. 0 the decline occurs later, after peaking around 2050. As a consequence the relative importance of the <b>total</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> of aerosols becomes weaker throughout the twenty-first century compared with the positive forcing of greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, both surface ozone and aerosol content show very different regional features depending on the future scenario considered. Hence, in 2050, surface ozone changes vary between − 12 and + 12 ppbv over Asia depending on the RCP projection, whereas the regional direct aerosol radiative forcing can locally exceed − 3 W m − 2...|$|E
40|$|The barrel is {{a special}} {{thick-walled}} cylinder. It is significance to study the temperature distribution of thick-walled cylinder under liquid-cooled state to weapon launch safety and effectiveness.

The objective of this ex vivo study was a systematic evaluation of the vascular <b>cooling</b> <b>effects</b> in multipolar RFA. Materials and methods: Multipolar RFA with three bipolar RFA applicators was performed ex vivo in porcine liver (applicator distance 20 [*]mm, energy input 40 [*]kJ). A saline-perfused glass tube (‘vessel’) was placed parallel to the applicators in order to simulate a natural liver vessel. Five applicator-to-vessel geometries were tested. A liquid-filled glass tube without perfusion was used as a dry run. Ablations were orthogonally cut to the applicators at a defined height. <b>Cooling</b> <b>effects</b> were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively along these cross sectional areas. Results: Thirty-six ablations were performed. A <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> could be seen in all ablations with perfused vessels compared to the dry run. While this <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> did not have any influence on the ablation areas (859 – 1072 [*]mm 2 versus 958 [*]mm 2 in the dry run, p[*]>[*] 0. 05), it had a distinctive impact on ablation shape.

Based on environmental and plant data, including the tree species, crown diameter of trees, physiologically equivalent temperature (PET), and sky view factor (SVF) in an outdoor space, a series of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) procedures was implemented to identify the tree species that are appropriate for improving thermal comfort. The results indicated strong correlations between SVF, average crown diameter, and PET. SVF decreased as the average crown diameter increased. For the average crown diameter of trees in an area wider than 1. 5 m, the <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> was especially dominated by the tree species. Therefore, 15 species were screened by HCA procedures, based on a similar <b>cooling</b> <b>effect.</b> These species had various <b>cooling</b> <b>effects,</b> and were divided into four categories.

40|$|The cooling {{factor of}} W is {{evaluated}} using {{state of the}} art data for line radiation and an ionization balance which has been benchmarked with experiment. For the calculation of line radiation, level-resolved calculations were performed with the Cowan code to obtain the electronic structure and excitation cross sections (plane-wave Born approximation). The data were processed by a collisional radiative model to obtain electron density dependent emissions. These data were then combined with the radiative power derived from recombination rates and bremsstrahlung to obtain the <b>total</b> <b>cooling</b> factor. The <b>effect</b> of uncertainties in the recombination rates on the cooling factor was studied and was identified to be of secondary importance. The new cooling factor is benchmarked, by comparisons of the line radiation with spectral measurements as well as with a direct measurement of the cooling factor. Additionally, a less detailed calculation using a configuration averaged model was performed. It was used to benchmark the level-resolved calculations and to improve the prediction on radiation power from line radiation for ionization stages which are computationally challenging. The obtained values for the cooling factor validate older predictions from the literature. Its ingredients and the absolute value are consistent with the existing experimental results regarding the value itself, the spectral distribution of emissions and the ionization equilibrium. A table of the cooling factor versus electron temperature is provided. Finally, the cooling factor is used to investigate the operational window of a fusion reactor with W as intrinsic impurity. The minimum value of nT tau(E), for which a thermonuclear burn is possible, is increased by 20 % for a W concentration of 3. 0 x 10 (- 5) compared with a plasma without any impurities, except for the He ash which is considered in both cases...|$|R

This paper presents a new methodology to evaluate the <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> of DGFs related to fine-scale plant characteristics for hot summer days using thermal infrared (TIR) and three-dimensional point cloud (3 DPC) data, through a case study conducted at the Executive Office Building on Nanjing University's Xianlin Campus, China.

In the North American boreal forests, they {{have been shown to}} exert a strong <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> through post-fire changes in surface albedo that has a larger overall impact on the climate system than associated carbon emissions. However, these findings are not directly applicable to the Siberian larch forests, a major component of the boreal biome where species composition are dominated by a deciduous needleleaf species and fire regimes are characterized by the common occurrence of both stand-replacing and less-severe surface fires. This dissertation quantifies the post-fire surface forcing imposed by both fire types in these forests over 14 years since fire, and determines that both surface and stand replacing fires impose <b>cooling</b> <b>effects</b> through increased albedo during snow season. The magnitude of the <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> from stand replacing fires is much larger than that of surface fires, and this is likely a consequence of higher levels of canopy damage after stand-replacing fires. At its peak (~ year 11 after fire occurrence), the cooling magnitude {{is similar to that of}} the North American boreal fires. Strong <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> and the wide-spread occurrence of stand-replacing fires lead to a net negative surface forcing over the entire region between 2002 and 2013. Based on the extended albedo trajectory which was made possible by developing a 24 -year stand age map, it was shown that the <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> of stand-replacing fires lasts for more than 26 years. The overall <b>cooling</b> <b>effect</b> of surface fires is of lower magnitude and is likely indicative of damages not only to the canopies but also the shrubs in the understory.
