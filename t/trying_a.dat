5|$|At the 2009 World Championships, Lysacek placed {{second in}} the short program. He then won the free skating segment to win the {{competition}} overall, becoming the first American man since Todd Eldredge in 1996 to win the World title. His placement, combined with that of Brandon Mroz, qualified the United States for three entries in the men's event at the 2010 Winter Olympics. At the World Championships, Lysacek competed with a stress fracture in his left foot, which prevented him from <b>trying</b> <b>a</b> quadruple jump at the competition. During the off-season, Lysacek took two months off from skating to give the injury time to heal. He was called the frontrunner for the 2010 Olympic gold by some journalists.|$|E
5|$|Following the score, kickoff, and return, Tech began another {{offensive}} possession at its 24-yard line. The Hokies {{picked up}} two first downs and drove into NC State territory, but the clock continued to tick toward halftime. In the Wolfpack {{side of the}} field, Tech running back Eddie Hunter broke free for a 23-yard run, the longest play by Virginia Tech in the second quarter. There was now just over twominutes remaining in the quarter. Tech was unable to pick up another first down after Hunter's run, and attempted to convert the fourth down rather than <b>trying</b> <b>a</b> field goal. When the play was stopped for a loss, however, Virginia Tech was denied points and NC State's offense returned with 47seconds remaining in the half.|$|E

Bryan Randall was sacked for a loss of 10yards, however, and the Hokies turned the ball over to Air Force after failing to gain the first down.|$|E

Although popular in the 1920s and 30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs. Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication.

5|$|Oklahoma State scored first, with a {{surprising}} 49yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had lined up tight on 4th and 1 as if <b>trying</b> <b>a</b> short, power run, but faked that play {{and threw a}} deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard. Texas replied with a touchdown pass from Young to Thomas, but David Pino missed the extra point, allowing the Cowboys to retain the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas completed a field goal to make the score 21–9 {{at the end of}} the firstquarter. The Cowboys scored one touchdown in the secondquarter off of a pass that was deflected by Texas, and Texas made a field goal near the end to cut into the lead, leaving Oklahoma State ahead 28–12 at halftime. The secondhalf was dominated by Texas as they scored fiveunanswered touchdowns to win the game. The scores consisted of tworushing touchdowns by Vince Young, tworushing touchdowns by Ramonce Taylor, and a 21-yard touchdown pass to Neale Tweedie.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} play of Utah's drive, Johnson {{completed}} a 22-yard pass to wide receiver Brian Hernandez. Utah's offense faltered, however, {{and was forced to}} punt. The ensuing punt from Sakoda was downed at the Midshipmen 8-yard line, and Navy's offense was forced into a three plays-and-out possession. Beginning at their own 41-yard line, Utes quarterback Johnson threw three consecutive completions to bring the drive to the Midshipmen 27-yard line. Just outside the Navy red zone, the Midshipmen defense forced a fourth down for Utah. Utah attempted to convert the fourth down instead of <b>trying</b> <b>a</b> long field goal. The conversion was successful, and on the first down following the conversion, Utah executed an end-around that went for 23 yards and a touchdown. The score cut Navy's lead to three points and put the score at 17–14 with 4:47 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
25|$|The radio {{receiver}} {{turned out to}} be a more difficult problem. Early on they decided to use the same basic receiver system as the earlier Mk. IV radar. This had originally been a television receiver designed by Pye Ltd. to pick up BBC transmissions on 45MHz. It was adapted to the MK. IV's ~200MHz by using it as the intermediate frequency stage of a superheterodyne system. To do this, they had added another tube that stepped down the frequency from the radar's 193MHz to 45MHz. In theory this should be just as easily adapted to the AIS's 3GHz, using a similar solution. The problem was that the magnetron's frequency tended to drift, in small amounts pulse-to-pulse, and much greater amounts as it heated and cooled. Any sort of fixed-frequency step-down like the one used in the Mk. IV wouldn't work. After <b>trying</b> <b>a</b> variety of designs based on klystrons and older-style magnetrons, they eventually gave up.|$|E

25|$|Tuning load to gun {{can also}} yield great {{increases}} in accuracy, especially for standard, non-accurized rifles. Different rifles, {{even of the}} same make and model, will often react to the same ammunition in different ways. The handloader is afforded a wider selection of bullet weights than can readily be found in commercially loaded ammunition, {{and there are many}} different powders {{that can be used for}} any given cartridge. <b>Trying</b> <b>a</b> range of bullets and a variety of powders will determine what combination of bullet and powder gives the most consistent velocities and accuracies. Careful adjustment of the amount of powder can give the velocity that best fits the natural harmonics of the barrel (see accurize and internal ballistics). For ultimate accuracy and performance, the handloader also has the option of using a wildcat cartridge; wildcats are the result of shaping the cartridge and chamber themselves to a specific end, and the results push the envelope of velocity, energy, and accuracy. Most, but not all, reloads perform best when the powder selected fills 95% or more of the case (by volume).|$|E
25|$|No further Confederate {{reinforcements}} arrived that year, and Baylor's battalion {{was tied}} down fighting Apache bands in southern New Mexico. Canby spent {{the remainder of}} the year trying to raise five regiments of infantry, and wrote to the governor of Colorado, William Gilpin, asking him for Colorado volunteer troops to help defend New Mexico. Confederate general Henry H. Sibley raised a brigade of Texas cavalry over the summer of 1861 and brought it to New Mexico in late January and early February 1862. Intending to invade Colorado to seize the gold and silver mines located there, Sibley arrived outside Fort Craig on February 15. By this time, Canby had received only two companies of Colorado volunteers, and out of the five New Mexico regiments which were being recruited, only two had the full ten companies formed. After several days of skirmishing before the fort, during which Canby refused to leave his fortifications, Sibley moved to {{the eastern side of the}} Rio Grande and started north, intending to cut off Canby's lines of supply and of reinforcements to Albuquerque. However, Canby was able to intercept the Confederates at the Val Verde ford, resulting in a battle on February 21. While the Union force was defeated, they were able to withdraw back into Fort Craig and refused Sibley's demand of surrender. Rather than <b>trying</b> <b>a</b> direct assault on the fort, Sibley continued north towards Colorado; Canby dispatched his militia regiments ahead of Sibley to contest his advance, while remaining at the fort in order to intercept any reinforcements and supplies bound for Sibley.|$|E
25|$|Despite the England {{collapse}} {{the pitch}} was losing its moisture and looked better for runs. Colin McDonald and Neil Harvey saw the day out with 96/1 {{for the loss}} of Jim Burke, bowled by Statham for 3 when he left the ball alone. Lacking the pace of the Australian bowlers Statham and Loader could not make the ball lift as they had done and Trevor Bailey and Jim Laker suffered as Harvey struck 10 fours in his 60 not out by the end of New Year's Day. They returned to the fray the following morning with May setting only one slip as he tried to stop the flow of runs, which saved Harvey when he edged to the vacant second slip on 67. Bailey bowled down the leg side with a leg field while Harvey watched the balls go by, but he and McDonald were able to run quickly between the wickets and keep the score ticking over, but only 39 runs were made off 18 eight–ball overs before lunch. Soon after the break Tom Graveney took a juggled catch at first slip off Statham to dismiss McDonald for 47 after four hours. Norm O'Neill came into a defensive field to Tony Lock bowling round the wicket and found it difficult to make runs, but tried one cracking drive that was stopped by the bowler and hurt his hand. Harvey tok 267 minutes to make his century, but there was a huge roar round the giant Melbourne Ground when he reached three figures. With his hundred up he attacked Laker and Lock, but with tight fields and accurate bowling he was unable to get away. The new ball was taken after tea and Statham had O'Neill (37) caught behind <b>trying</b> <b>a</b> powerful stroke off his back foot. Peter Loader, who had been plundered for 36 runs in 8 overs bowled Harvey (167) when he missed an on–drive. Considering the quality and the accuracy of the bowling Alec Bedser thought this was Harvey's best century and it was greatly appreciated by the 71,000 crowd. They could not have enjoyed what followed as Bobby Simpson and Richie Benaud went for ducks and Australia crashed from 255/2 to 262/6. Ken Mackay (18) and Alan Davidson (25) pulled the score to 282/6 {{by the end of the}} day, but Statham (7/57) had them out in the morning, then cleaned up tail for 308. He became only the sixth England bowler to take seven wickets in a Test innings in Australia after Tom Richardson (8/94), George Lohmann (8/35 and 8/58), Wilfred Rhodes (7/56 and 8/68), Doug Wright (7/105) and Frank Tyson (7/27). Once again Neil Harvey had scored over half the innings for Australia, but they were only 49 runs ahead.|$|E

500|$|Both legal teams, in {{planning}} their trial strategy, considered {{the implications of}} <b>trying</b> <b>a</b> white man based on the testimony {{of a black man}} in front of an early 1900s Georgia jury.

[...] Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as [...] "a familiar type" [...] of [...] "old negro", like a minstrel or plantation worker. [...] Dorsey's strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man could not have been intelligent enough to make up a complicated story. The prosecution argued that Conley's statement explaining {{the immediate aftermath of the}} murder was true, that Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.|$|E
