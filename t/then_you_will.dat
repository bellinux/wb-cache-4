500|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, DeLee {{observed}} that obstetric complications and deaths were so common that he [...] "often wondered whether nature did not intend women should be used up {{in the process of}} reproduction, in a manner analogous to that of the salmon, which dies after spawning. Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, if you believe that a woman after delivery should be as healthy, as well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the child should be undamaged, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> have to agree with me that labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E

You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be alone again, in your motel room.

500|$|To avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised Hurst {{they would}} return the mules and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw. Hurst went to nearby Charleston, but the Cowboys showed up {{two days later}} without the mules, {{laughing}} at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst had printed and distributed a handbill in which he named Frank McLaury as specifically assisting with hiding the mules. He reprinted this in The Tombstone Epitaph on July 30, 1880. Virgil later said that McLaury had {{asked him if he}} had posted the handbills. When Virgil said he had not, McLaury said if Virgil had printed the handbills it was Frank's intention to kill Virgil. He warned Virgil, [...] "If you ever again follow us as close as you did, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> have to fight anyway." [...] This incident was the first run-in between the Clantons and McLaurys and the Earps.|$|E

He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot."

Martha appeared in the [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] video as Minaj's apparent fairy godmother. Although Minaj was rapping in songs such as [...] "All I Do Is Win (Remix)", she promised to introduce Nicki, Roman and Onika on her first album.|$|E
500|$|As Rosas {{aged and}} his health declined, the {{question}} of who would succeed him became a growing concern among his supporters. His wife Encarnación had died in October 1838 after a long illness. Although devastated by his loss, Rosas exploited her death to raise support for his regime. Not long after, at the age of 47, he began an affair with his fifteen-year-old maid, María Eugenia Castro, with whom he had five illegitimate children. From his marriage to Encarnación, Rosas had two children: Juan Bautista Pedro and Manuela Robustiana. Rosas established a hereditary dictatorship, naming the children from his marriage as his successors, stating that [...] "hey are both worthy children of my beloved Encarnación, and if, God willing, I die, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> find that they are capable of succeeding me." [...] It is unknown whether Rosas was a closet monarchist. Later during his exile, Rosas would declare that Princess Alice of the United Kingdom would be the ideal ruler for his country. Nonetheless, in public he stated that his regime was republican in nature.|$|E

500|$|Cowboy Frank Patterson [...] "made {{some kind}} of a compromise" [...] with Captain Hurst, who persuaded the posse to withdraw, with the {{understanding}} that the mules would be returned. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Capt. Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the flyer in The Tombstone Epitaph, on July 30, 1880. Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst [...] "unmanly", [...] "a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar", and accused Hurst of stealing the mules himself. Capt. Hurst later cautioned Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan that the Cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him, [...] "If you ever again follow us as close as you did, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> have to fight anyway." [...] A month later, Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him if he ever followed them as he had done before, they would kill him.|$|E
500|$|Endecott's {{instructions}} {{were to go}} to Block Island, where he was to kill all of the Indian men and take captive the women and children. He was then {{to go to the}} Pequots on the mainland, where he was to make three demands: first, that the killers of Oldham and the other trader be surrendered; second, that a payment of one thousand fathoms of wampum be made; and third, that some Pequot children be delivered to serve as hostages. Endecott executed these instructions with zeal. Although most of the Indians on Block Island only briefly opposed the English landing there, he spent two days destroying their villages, crops and canoes; most of the Indians on the island successfully eluded English searches for them. English reports claimed as many as 14 Indians were killed, but the Narragansetts only reported one dead. Endecott then sailed for Saybrook, an English settlement {{at the mouth of the}} Connecticut River. Lion Gardiner, the leader there, angrily informed Endecott when he learned of the mission's goals, [...] "You come hither to raise these wasps around my ears, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> take wing and flee away." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the album, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times writes: [...] "I did like the driving, {{collective}} muscle of the band, though, very much," [...] but he also describes its aesthetics as [...] "cluttered and gaudy". For PopMatters, Associate Music Editor Justin Cober-Lake writes: [...] "In many ways, it's a supreme accomplishment with difficult technique passages and broad soundscapes; on the other hand, it's a journey that's too long to take." [...] In {{his review of}} Corea's later work The Ultimate Adventure, Will Friedwald of The New York Sun writes: [...] "'To the Stars' was trite, electronic bubblegum music {{that sounded like a}} cheesy video-game soundtrack." [...] Writing in The Times, John Bungey comments that [...] "many of the pieces are straitjacketed into the cosmic concept", concluding his review with: [...] "If you prefer hi-fi to sci-fi, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be hoping that Corea leaves the space helmet at home next time." [...] John L. Walters gave the album a negative review in The Guardian, writing that the album [...] "cries out for warning stickers - 'this album contains dangerously high levels of Scientology'", and that it [...] "drags some perfectly fine jazz musicians ... through conceptual purgatory".|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, MTV Unplugged {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{three out of}} five stars, praising Katy for being a hard working music act and [...] "seeming more likeable here than she did on her debut", though he noted that her flaws were [...] "amplified" [...] during the performance. Sahar from Blogcritics was more positive about the set, writing that although Perry was not the [...] "best singer out there", she made up for it [...] "in catchiness and..... adorableness". The contributor was more negative of the acoustic version of [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] {{and the fact that}} MTV cut out parts from the video recording: [...] "What I'd like to have seen is for MTV to make Katy Perry enter into an unscripted dialog with the fans that are there, film the whole thing and put that on a DVD – <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> really have something unplugged. For how can you truly know an artist if we don't see such interactions?" [...] Becky Bain from website Idolator favored Perry's live voice and her natural presentation, though she was ambivalent towards the decision of giving the songs an acoustic treatment. She {{went on to say that}} the MTV Unplugged versions of Perry's songs were not able to substitute the [...] "glossy originals". Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly gave the live album a D, opining that [...] "the stripped-down treatment of MTV Unplugged does Perry's yowling voice no favors", and that [...] " [...] songs just aren't solid enough to stand on their own without loads of glossy production". Catherine Lewis of The Washington Post praised Perry's [...] "translate her more rambunctious numbers into an acoustic format" [...] and wrote album was [...] "definitely a step in a good — and unexpected — direction".|$|E
500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E
