5|$|Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 2001. The case {{concerned}} {{the extent of}} the government’s power to limit an individual’s complete control of his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant. A divided Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable law-enforcement need to acquire a warrant, namely, to prevent the potential destruction of evidence within the home.|$|E
5|$|Justice Souter joined Breyer's {{opinion in}} all respects but wrote {{separately}} to condition his support on the belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> was appropriate {{only because of the}} immediate danger that the evidence could have been destroyed. Only in this unique instance could the warrant requirement be waived.|$|E

5|$|The large {{budget and}} notable talent {{for the project}} made it {{difficult}} for the production company to secure directors willing to take on the series, causing 2009 to begin with a brief stir of media attention. Shortly thereafter, Taewon announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> was over and Kim Kyu-tae and Yang Yun-ho would be helming the series. Simultaneously, KBS was announced as the South Korean broadcaster. Later in the month, on February 19, Kim So-yeon was cast as a North Korean agent.|$|E
5|$|Although {{missing person}} cases are {{normally}} handled by {{local and state}} police, the FBI joined the investigation ten days after she disappeared. The FBI interviewed family from Massachusetts, and the Haverhill police chief disclosed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> was now nationwide. Ten days after her disappearance, New Hampshire Fish and Game conducted a second ground and air search, using a helicopter with a thermal imaging camera, tracking dogs and cadaver dogs. Murray's older sister discovered a ripped white pair of women's underwear lying in the snow on a secluded trail near French Pond Road on February 26, but DNA tests found that the underwear {{did not belong to}} Murray.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} {{searches}} {{in public schools}} do not require warrants, {{as long as the}} searching officers have reasonable grounds for believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> will result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity. However, in Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009), the Court ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to have received drugs from that student. Similarly, in Samson v. California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds. Searches of prison cells are subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable cause.|$|E
5000|$|Under this analysis, I {{need not}} reach the {{validity}} of the Illinois statute under which the Illinois court sustained <b>the</b> <b>search.</b> Parenthetically, I find the Court's failure to pass on the Illinois statute puzzling in light of <b>the</b> Court's holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>searches</b> were not authorized by Terry." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} sharing model assumes that individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model assumes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> modes are mutually exclusive. Hopping {{with the head}} facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E
