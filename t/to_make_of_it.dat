25|$|On 25 August 1791, he met {{the king}} of Prussia at Pillnitz Castle, near Dresden, and they drew up the Declaration of Pillnitz, stating their {{readiness}} to intervene in France if and when their assistance was called for by the other powers. The declaration was a mere formality, for, as Leopold knew, neither Russia nor Britain was prepared to act, and he endeavored to guard against the use which he foresaw the émigrés would try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> In face of the reaction in France to the Declaration of Pillnitz, the intrigues of the émigrés, and attacks made by the French revolutionists {{on the rights of}} the German princes in Alsace, Leopold continued to hope that intervention might not be required.|$|E
500|$|The Great Galilean was {{not well}} received. The New York Times {{reviewer}} called it hopelessly muddled, finding Keable's claims about the unknowability of Jesus contrary to his efforts to understand and worship him: [...] "Frankly, {{we do not know}} what <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> We can only suppose that street preaching at Cambridge, and even climbing Kilimanjaro, are not conducive to logic." ...|$|E
500|$|The final symphony, the Ninth, was {{completed}} in late 1957 and premiered in April 1958, four months before the composer's death. It is scored for a large orchestra, including three saxophones, a flugelhorn, and an enlarged percussion section. The mood is more sombre {{than that of the}} Eighth; Grove calls its mood [...] "at once heroic and contemplative, defiant and wistfully absorbed". The work received an ovation at its premiere, but at first the critics were not sure what <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and it took some years for it to be generally ranked alongside its eight predecessors.|$|E

500|$|The {{documentary}} {{received the}} 1974 [...] "Alfred I. du Pont/Columbia University Award in Broadcast Journalism" [...] (DuPont Award). [...] The jurors from the 1974 DuPont-Columbia awards {{stated that the}} documentary was: [...] "hectic, hilarious and not a little disquieting. With a heavier and less sure hand, the subject would have been squashed beneath the reporters’ irony or contempt. As it was, cult religion was handed to us, live and quivering, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> what we would." [...] The group's work impressed WNET president John Jay Iselin, and he raised additional funds that helped TVTV to produce five more programs, including Gerald Ford's America.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{is a mix}} of {{rock and}} roll and rhythm and blues with the {{original}} score created by film composer Elmer Bernstein, who had been a Landis family friend since John Landis was a child. Bernstein was easily persuaded to score the film, but was not sure what <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Similar to his preferring dramatic actors for the comedy, Landis asked Bernstein to score it as though it were serious. He adapted the [...] "Faber College Theme" [...] from the Academic Festival Overture by Brahms, and said that the film opened yet another door in his diverse career, to scoring comedies.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times later {{described}} Yesterday's Wine as [...] "the {{last and}} best of [...] Nashville albums", {{saying that it was}} [...] "Organized in the manner of an epic poem, each cut a metaphor in the journey through life... it was Nashville's first fully conceived concept album, and nobody knew what <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It soon disappeared quietly and utterly." [...] Rolling Stone wrote: [...] " [...] is the first of his bold, conceptual departures from country's hits-plus-filler norm. Rather than tack rock guitar riffs onto modern honky-tonk sagas, Nelson absorbed the innovations of Bob Dylan and the singer-songwriters into his own distinct style. Even if the narrative concepts don't always hold together, Willie hangs his most ambitious albums on some of his catchiest tunes." ...|$|E

500|$|At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign {{she belonged}} to Kappa Kappa Gamma {{sorority}} where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, [...] "the prettiest I had ever seen", quite popular {{with men and}} with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't know what <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} added Justin's sister Iris as {{a supporting}} {{character in the}} revised series, and established a sexual {{tension between the two}} characters early on. While reviewers were unsure what <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Daniel Knauf advertised the relationship as [...] "just as warped and incestuous as ever" [...] in the new season. Clancy Brown (Brother Justin) and Amy Madigan (Iris) acknowledged the lust between their characters but assumed their relationship had not been consummated in the first season. They were not in favor of their characters getting together like HBO had wanted, as [...] "that's really not what they're about." [...] Per Brown, the sibling relationship informs Brother Justin's and Iris's character and motives, and continued tension frightens the audience more if it is never resolved. Although Brown and Madigan wanted to leave the status of their characters' relationship as lovers open, they deliberately played their kisses more intimate and familiar than most people would consider comfortable. Several characters intervene the siblings' relationship during the show's run. The writers had planned a sexual innuendo between Iris and Tommy Dolan, a news reporter who investigates in the arson case, but Robert Knepper (Dolan) later felt his character might just have been a pawn between Brother Justin and Iris as siblings, making Brother Justin jealous. The Crowes also regularly hire new maids, which Knauf explained as Iris lining up surrogate women to relieve Brother Justin's sexual pressure.|$|E
500|$|By early 1955, Presley's regular Hayride appearances, {{constant}} touring, and well-received record releases {{had made}} him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas. In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought the singer {{to the attention of}} Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed top country star Eddy Arnold, Parker was now working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour. When the tour reached Odessa, Texas, a 19-year-old Roy Orbison saw Presley for the first time: [...] "His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing.... I just didn't know what <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it." [...] Presley made his television debut on March 3 on the KSLA-TV broadcast of Louisiana Hayride. Soon after, he failed an audition for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on the CBS television network. By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to [...] "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. Some of the songs, like [...] "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the [...] "R idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were [...] "more in the country field", [...] "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both". This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because [...] "he sounded too much like a hillbilly." [...] The blend {{came to be known as}} rockabilly. At the time, Presley was variously billed as [...] "The King of Western Bop", [...] "The Hillbilly Cat", and [...] "The Memphis Flash".|$|E

2500|$|In 1953 {{at the age}} of 13 Janis Martin was {{developing}} her own proto-rockabilly style on WRVA's Old Dominion Barn Dance, which broadcast out of Richmond, VA. Although Martin performed mostly country songs for the show, she also did songs by Rhythm and blues singers Ruth Brown and LaVern Baker, as well as a few Dinah Washington songs. [...] "The audience didn't know what <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> They didn't hardly allow electric instruments, and I was doing some songs by black artists—stuff like Ruth Brown's [...] "(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{writer of}} the pseudo-Cyprian De Rebaptismate says that on the {{strength}} of the words of John, that [...] "we were to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire," [...] the Simonians maintained that the orthodox baptism was a mere form, and that they had the real baptism, for, as soon as their neophytes went down into the water, a fire appeared on it. The writer does not dispute the fact, but is at a loss what <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Was it a bit of jugglery, or a natural phenomenon, or a piece of self-deception, or an effect of magic? In advocacy of this baptism, we are told, there was composed by the same heretics a book which was inscribed the Preaching of Paul.|$|E
2500|$|VA-11 HALL-A has {{received}} very positive pre-release reception.

After all, a game that's story-driven lives and dies on the quality of said story." [...] He compared it to Her Story as something that could [...] "prove to be [...] very cool." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Kyle LeClair of Hardcore Gamer, writing that [...] "VA-11 Hall-A sure looks great and has quite a unique hook to it, so we'll be sure to try and wet our whistles with it when it comes out on the PC". Graham Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun claimed that although [...] "VA-11 Hall-A, whose punctuation I already resent having to type, is skirting with genres I don't care about: anime-styled visual novels", he found VA-11 HALL-As branching-style plotline to be more engaging that an average [...] "linear and relatively uninteractive" [...] visual novel. Rock, Paper, Shotgun also chose VA-11 HALL-A {{to be one of the}} best games shown at EGX Rezzed 2016.|$|E
