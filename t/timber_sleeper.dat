50|$|The former wharf site, {{incorporating}} timber posts, {{and much}} of the tramway, which joins the meatworks, are situated on tidal flats, forming part of the Newport Conservation Park. Other remains include further evidence of the tram line such as <b>timber</b> <b>sleeper</b> and metal remains. Also extant in the Newport Conservation Park is evidence of timber fording of Bund Creek and remains of {{what appears to be a}} corduroy road.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{remaining}} evidence of the purpose and working life of the site is on the platform. Of the monorail above each engine, only the vertical I-beams, cut off at their base, indicate where they were situated. Engines and propellers were manoeuvred into position using a block and tackle which ran along this monorail. Four steel circles set in the concrete, {{the legs of the}} barrel-type engine stands cut off at their base, show the engine stand position. What remains of the <b>timber</b> <b>sleeper</b> and bitumen floor along the frontal width of stands 1 to 4 delineates the position of the propeller arc. Drum caps, steel plates and pieces of cloth are embedded in the bitumen.|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{deterioration of}} <b>timber</b> <b>sleepers</b> {{combined with an}} intensified pressure on limiting the use of hardwood timber because of various environmental concerns are the main drivers of research conducted throughout the world directed towards finding a suitable alternative for replacing <b>timber</b> <b>sleepers.</b> While many railway infrastructure companies have long been trialing pre-stressed concrete and steel for replacing <b>timber</b> <b>sleepers,</b> this has gained limited success as these materials have not proven reliable alternatives to <b>timber</b> turnout <b>sleepers.</b> Research and development has now been focused on fibre composites as this material {{can be made to}} have similar usability and design characteristics to hardwood timber with the added advantages. However, several challenges need to be overcome for fibre composite sleepers to become a suitable alternative to <b>timber</b> <b>sleepers.</b> This paper provides an overview of the various initiatives at the Centre of Excellence in Engineered Fibre Composites which aims to further the understanding of the design and performance issues associated with the eventual application of this new technology. Results of the on-going research and development on sleeper material made from a new generation fibre composite sandwich structure for replacement sleepers in a railway turnout are highlighted in this paper...|$|R
25|$|<b>Timber</b> <b>sleepers</b> were {{replaced}} when they neared {{the end of}} their lifespan of 15 to 25 years. The new replacement sleepers, made out of concrete, have a significantly longer lifespan. Train services on the line were ended earlier to allow more time for the sleeper replacement works. All <b>timber</b> <b>sleepers</b> {{were replaced}} by April 2015. After the completion of the replacement works, train services resumed their normal operating hours.|$|R
40|$|Structural {{optimisation}} of composite railway sleeper {{is becoming}} an important area of research to effectively use composite materials and minimising their manufacturing costs. This study used the finite element approach to structurally optimise a composite sleeper for a mainline railway track and evaluate their performance. Strand 7 finite element simulation is executed to achieve this goal. This study presents the optimised shape of a sleeper which requires only one-third volume {{to that of a}} standard rectangular sleeper. The performance of the optimised sleeper is determined in a high and low stiffness support foundation and the results obtained from this analysis are compared with the behaviour of traditional <b>timber</b> <b>sleeper.</b> The new composite sleeper showed comparable behaviour with that of <b>timber</b> <b>sleeper</b> and performed within their allowable limit. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the {{premature}} failures of traditional railway sleepers have significantly increased the track maintenance costs. The primary obstacle to minimising this problem {{is the lack of}} understanding of the mechanism of sleeper degradation. This paper discusses the different deterioration mechanisms for traditional timber, concrete and steel sleepers and the potential protective measures to minimise these problems. This paper exhaustively reviews the failure mechanisms of these three commonly used sleeper materials with suggested solutions. Fungal decay, end splitting and termite attacks has been identified as the principal causes of <b>timber</b> <b>sleeper</b> failures. On the other hand, concrete sleepers are vulnerable to rail-seat deterioration, cracking and damaging under different loading conditions and adverse environments. Steel's risk of corrosion and fatigue cracking makes it an inferior-quality material for sleeper. Solution approaches are recommended and provided in this paper in order to the best utilise these different railway sleeper materials. New materials are also introduced as effective alternative to replace the traditional railway sleepers. ...|$|E
40|$|Hardwood {{has been}} the {{preferred}} material for railway sleepers and maintenance work on existing <b>timber</b> <b>sleeper</b> track continued to be provided by hardwoods. Over the past decade, it has been increasingly difficult to get good quality hardwood in quantities {{to keep up with}} demand. This trend is set to continue and will become critical within the foreseeable future, hence the need to develop a sleeper product made from renewable resources. A collaborative effort between the Centre of Excellence in Engineered Fibre Composites (CEEFC) and Austrak Pty Ltd aims to develop an optimised fibre composite turnout sleeper for replacing deteriorated hardwood sleepers in railway turnouts. The building block of this alternative sleeper material is a new generation composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and high strength core material. This paper provides an overview of the on-going research and development on this alternative sleeper material and the consequent issues in using this material for replacement sleepers in railway turnouts...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the work {{undertaken}} at the Queensland University of Technology to develop an integrated computer based tool for the prediction of track behaviour under changing traffic conditions. The track degradation model described here {{takes into account the}} degradation effects due to the interactions between track components. The model uses mechanistic relationships and embraces all the major factors which may influence service life of track components. The model was applied to a typical Australian railway track and the results are summarised here. The results showed that increasing axle load and train speed accelerates track degradation in general and rail wear in particular. Sub-grade stiffness and ballast depth are found {{to be the most important}} parameters for track roughness. <b>Timber</b> <b>sleeper</b> failure is sensitive to both traffic parameters and environmental factors, such as the decay index and track drainage condition. Increases in axle loads may not lead to higher sleeper damage failure rate at fixed traffic loads. Decay index, track drainage condition and average age of sleepers, all have a noticeable effect on sleeper failure...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} flexural and shear behaviour of the full-scale glue-laminated composite sandwich beams in three different layouts was conducted to evaluate the suitability of this construction system for railway turnout sleepers. The building block of this innovative beam is a novel composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre composite skins and modified phenolic core material that has been specifically developed for civil engineering applications. The sandwich beam is produced by gluing layers of fibre composite sandwich structure together in flatwise (horizontal) and in edgewise (vertical) orientations. The glued sandwich beams with edgewise laminations presented appropriate strength and stiffness for replacement turnout <b>timber</b> <b>sleeper.</b> The mechanical properties of these glue-laminated sandwich beams are comparable with the existing timber turnout sleepers demonstrating that the innovative composite sandwich beam is a viable alternative sleeper material for railway turnouts. From this study, it is concluded that the glue-laminated composite sandwich structures {{have the potential to}} be used for replacement railway turnout sleepers. An enhanced understanding of the behaviour of fibre composite sandwich structures for potential civil engineering applications is also an outcome of this investigation. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on <b>timber</b> railway <b>sleepers</b> {{with a view}} to select a suitable stiffness and a modulus of elasticity for the design of a fibre composite railway sleeper. Eight full size <b>timber</b> <b>sleepers</b> were tested using a four point bending test arrangement. An overview of existing material for railway sleepers is also presented. Based on the tests, it is concluded that <b>timber</b> <b>sleepers</b> have significant variation in strength and stiffness as can be inferred from the modulus of elasticity (Esleeper) which ranged between approximately 9520 MPa and 27600 MPa. It is desirable to develop a concept fibre composite sleeper within a similar range of modulus of elasticity. Based on the statistical analysis, it is proposed to use the lower tail value that is 12000 MPa as design modulus of elasticity for the fibre composite railway sleeper...|$|R
40|$|Timber is {{the most}} widely used {{material}} for railway sleepers, however, as a sleeper material it deteriorates with time and needs appropriate replacement.
