The second essay, [...] "Response Cries", considers the use of utterances and their social implications in different social contexts. Specifically, Goffman discusses [...] "self-talk" [...] (talking <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular)</b> {{and its role in}} social situations. Next, in [...] "Footing", Goffman addresses the way that footing, or alignment, can shift during a conversation.

2500|$|In January 2007, {{during the}} first week of Scooter Libby's trial, it was {{revealed}} in court proceedings that former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was granted immunity from prosecution by Patrick Fitzgerald in February 2004. Fleischer reportedly acknowledged discussing Valerie Plame with reporters, but promised to cooperate with Fitzgerald's investigation only if granted immunity. When the deal was struck, Fleischer told Fitzgerald that he had discussed Plame with David Gregory of NBC News and John Dickerson of Time in July 2003, days before leaving his job at the White House. Fleischer testified that he first learned about Plame and her CIA affiliation during a July 7, 2003, lunch with Libby. Fleischer also testified that four days later, while aboard Air Force One and during a five-day trip to several African nations, he overheard Dan Bartlett reference Plame. According to Fleischer, Bartlett stated <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> [...] "His wife sent him...She works at the CIA." [...] Shortly after overhearing Bartlett, Fleischer proceeded to discuss Plame with Gregory and Dickerson. According to Fleischer, neither Gregory nor Dickerson showed much interest in the information. Dickerson has denied Fleischer's account. Gregory has declined to comment on the matter. With regard to the immunity deal, Fitzgerald told the court [...] "I didn't want to give [...] immunity. I did so reluctantly." [...] Libby's attorney, William Jeffress, sought to learn more about the deal, telling the court [...] "I'm not sure we're getting the full story here." [...] According to Matt Apuzzo of the Associated Press, [...] "Prosecutors normally insist on an informal account of what a witness will say before agreeing to such a deal. It's known in legal circles as a proffer, and Fitzgerald said [...] he never got one from Fleischer." ...|$|E

6000|$|There {{are many}} able and {{patriotic}} {{members in the}} House of Commons--Sir Robert Inglis, Sir Robert Peel, and some others. But I grieve that they never have the courage or the wisdom--I know not in which the failure is-- to take their stand upon duty, and to appeal to all men as men,--to the Good and the True, which exist for all, and of which all have an apprehension. They always set to work--especially, his great eminence considered, Sir Robert Peel--by addressing themselves to individual interests; the measure will be injurious to the linen-drapers, or to the bricklayers; or this clause will bear hard on bobbin-net or poplins, and so forth. Whereas their adversaries--the demagogues--always work on the opposite principle: they always appeal to men as men; and, as you know, the most terrible convulsions in society have been wrought by such phrases as Rights of Man, Sovereignty of the People, &c., which no one understands, which apply <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> but to all in general.[1] ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Darling {{loved to}} have {{everything}} just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse. As they were poor, owing {{to the amount of}} milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> until the Darlings engaged her. She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery. She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On John's footer [in England soccer was called football, [...] "footer" [...] for short] days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair.|$|E

He was clothed in purple and fine linen, as butterflies should be clothed, and fared sumptuously everyday; but whence came his gay colours, or why people fed him with pate and champagne, nobody knew and nobody asked.|$|R
