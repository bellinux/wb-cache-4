500|$|George {{is still}} singing {{as they enter}} Alton Benes's hotel. Elaine has not arrived yet, so <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with her father and nervously order drinks. They have an awkward {{conversation}} with him; Alton asks who is the [...] "funny guy" [...] (Jerry), to which George says it's Jerry. Alton then recalls about a funny guy in Korea who got his brains blown out over the Pacific and that [...] "there's nothing funny about that". Jerry (frightened) eventually goes to the bathroom, abandoning George (also frightened), who attempts to compliment Alton about his book, Fair Game. George gets uncomfortable and tells Alton {{he has to make}} a phone call. He meets Jerry in the bathroom and both mention how terrified they are because of Alton; they decide to go home if Elaine does not show up in the next ten minutes. When they return, Alton receives a message from Elaine, who will arrive in thirty minutes, which worries them both.|$|E
500|$|After riders enter a Krusty-themed ride vehicle, Homer orders {{everyone}} to sit down, {{telling them that}} all the seats are the same, except {{the ones that are}} better and threatens to make an annoying noise until <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> Even when riders do sit down, Homer always makes the annoying noise, regardless. Jeremy Freedman then appears on a TV screen in the ride cabin and assures the riders that their comfort and safety {{are in the hands of}} highly qualified teens, like himself and explains the operators' requirements. He then tells the riders to enjoy themselves, but keep the screaming down so he can study for a math test, because if he does not get a C or higher, he will get kicked out of the audio-visual club. He then begins reading his textbook upside down (unknown to him) while quiet elevator music, utilizing part of the instrumental to [...] "The Simpsons Theme" [...] begins playing in the background. If the ride takes longer than usual to begin, a visual reading 'Krustyland, where fun takes a holiday," [...] with Krusty and Mr. Teeny dancing appears, and the music changes tempo, getting more upbeat.|$|E

Darren {{is due to}} go on a date he has arranged and Nancy comes to watch him, Darren's date does not arrive. As the evening continues, the pair realise there is an attraction between them and agree to go home together. Dawson said that the pair have [...] "always sort of hated each other" [...] as they are opposites, explaining that [...] "She's a feminist and he's a male chauvinist pig!" [...] He felt for the pair to begin {{a relationship}} is a [...] "case of opposites attracting - for some reason it works". Dawson added that through the pair's [...] "pompous ways" [...] they have both been through [...] "hard times and been through them with each other because they've known each other for so long". He commented that the pair have [...] "never seen eye-to-eye, but I think that when <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and chat they realise they have a lot more in common than they think. In the past they just didn't want to accept that". E4 described the relationship this way: [...] "She's chalk and he's definitely more than a bit cheesy, but there you have it; Darren and Nancy (Dancy) are now officially an item!

500|$|Michael {{had shown}} the office a [...] "work in progress" [...] {{cut of the}} film years ago, but the {{employees}} all mistook it for a comedy, and Michael was so offended by their laughing that he shut down the screening. Everyone is very eager to see Michael's film, albeit only because they all appear in it, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) warns everyone {{to be mindful of}} how sensitive Michael is and not laugh. However, Pam is unable to keep herself from crying out in horror when she sees her mother cast in the film as a scantily clad nurse, and Jim (John Krasinski) fails to fully suppress his laughter at [...] "The Scarn" [...] scene, so Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away. Michael asks Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) what she thought and she does not seem impressed. Michael gets angry at her because he considers the film his [...] "dream", and he then offers the rest of the office the opportunity to finish seeing the film, which they happily accept. While watching, Michael begins noting how the film is not really very good; he steps outside and tells Holly that it is a bad film but also one that people are having fun watching. <b>They</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and laugh {{with the rest of the}} office through the film's conclusion.|$|E
500|$|In April 1998, {{three years}} after the game was released, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under {{criticism}} for owning 435,000 shares worth $9 million in Cendant, which by this point had purchased Sierra On-Line, due to the violence in the Phantasmagoria and other Sierra games. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, and Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene. They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in West Paducah, Kentucky, and Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the [...] "increasingly violent world many American children enter when <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> {{in front of a computer}} screen". Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: [...] "We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children. We know that our membership would not want us to do that." [...] The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in California, Ohio and Texas.|$|E

We propose a meeting to discuss all the issues, because it just seems the sensible thing to do. To be honest I am not surprised by anything they do anymore. They can say all the threats and deadlines they want but we won’t {{come to an end}} of the matter until <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and talk to us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Consideration {{for animals}} is an {{important}} part of Judaism. It is part of the Noachide code. Resting on the Sabbath also meant providing rest for the working animals, and people are instructed to feed their animals before <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to eat. At harvest time, the working animals must not be muzzled, so that they can eat of the harvest as they work. All animals must be kept in adequate conditions. Sports like bullfighting are forbidden. Animals may be eaten as long as they are killed using [...] shechitah, a method where the animal has its throat cut using a specially sharpened knife. Jewish butchers are trained in this method which must meet the requirements of kashrut.|$|E
2500|$|In the introduction, {{the poet}} {{establishes}} the setting using conventional astrological and geographical references which place the poem within the traditional {{framework of a}} dream poem and introduces the dreamer who sits “all solytary alone besyde a lake,/ Musyng on a maner how that I myght make/ Reason & Sensualyte in oon to acorde” (1). [...] But, before he can think through his puzzle he is overcome by sleep. [...] Morpheus comes and escorts him {{to the court of}} Minos which is being held at the estate of Pluto. [...] There the dreamer watches as Diana and Neptune accuse Aeolus of flouting their authority and discrediting them in the eyes of their worshippers. [...] Before the trial can be concluded a messenger comes from Apollo, asking Minos to hold off on the judgement and inviting all the gods to his palace for a banquet. [...] In Apollo’s palace, Diana’s complaint is resolved and the dreamer describes each of the gods and goddesses as <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to eat. [...] The gods won’t allow Discord into their feast, but as she is leaving she meets with Atropos and sends him to stir things up. [...] Atropos goes to the gods and complains that while the gods claim to have given him power to bring death to any who disobeyed or despised them, there is one person who has escaped his power. [...] He threatens to leave their employ if they don’t make good on their promise to him and give him power over this person. [...] All the gods agree that they will bring down this one who defies Atropos. [...] They quickly resolve the dispute between Neptune and Aeolus to ensure that the offender {{will not be able to}} escape in the sea or air and then ask who it is that has defied them. [...] When Atropos tells them that it is Virtue, Pluto says he knows him well and the only thing that can harm Virtue is Vice, Pluto’s bastard son. [...] Vice is called for, and he assembles his host for battle. [...] Morpheus warns Virtue of the impending battle and Virtue prepares his host and heads to the field of Microcosm, hoping to arrive before Vice and thus have the advantage. [...] The descriptions of the assembly of these armies are made up long lists of characters representing various vices and virtues and types of people under the influence of Vice and Virtue.|$|E

60|$|Mara had {{sufficient}} instinctive {{insight into the}} feminine rôle in the domestic concert not to adventure a direct argument just now in favor of her friends, and therefore she proposed that <b>they</b> should <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> together under a cedar hard by, and look over the first lesson.|$|R

60|$|The dogs thus {{personally}} conducted are of many varieties; {{but they}} are one in fatness, in pampered, diseased vileness of temper, in insolent, snarling capriciousness of behaviour.

60|$|The Marquis's manner was affable in the extreme.
