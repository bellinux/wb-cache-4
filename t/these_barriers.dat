5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago). The patterns of diversity found in its mitochondrial DNA {{are consistent with the}} repeated splitting and merging of its populations as geographical barriers were alternately formed and inundated. The most recent of <b>these</b> <b>barriers</b> was a land bridge across the Torres Strait that reopened only some 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation exists between the sharks found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 the US Army began {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) as an anti-ballistic missile to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the missile could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead {{while it was still}} far enough away to give the missile time to launch. All of this appeared to be within the state of the art, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. <b>These</b> <b>barriers</b> were swept aside in late 1957 after the launch of the R-7 Semyorka, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority.|$|E
5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite <b>these</b> <b>barriers,</b> both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E

5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches <b>these</b> <b>barriers,</b> the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>these</b> <b>barriers</b> to access, health {{services}} {{have shown a}} trend toward improvement {{over the past twenty}} years. Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis B, diphtheria and measles increased an average of 60percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth. In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births. Schistosomiasis, malaria and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at only 0.2percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000people, in part due to the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa. Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67years for women.|$|E

40|$|Although {{epithelial}} cells are continuously shed {{from the surface}} of the intestine, the intestinal epithelium maintains the integrity of the epithelial barrier. This is achieved through a highly dynamic process involving reorganization of tight junction and adherens junction proteins. This process both ejects the cell from the epithelial monolayer and plugs the gap left after the cell is shed. Inflammatory insults can trigger a disturbance of <b>these</b> <b>barrier</b> functions by increasing rates of cell shedding. Epithelial cell shedding and loss of barrier can be visualized by confocal laser endomicroscopy in humans.

40|$|Collective Protection Shelters have {{historically}} been heavy, cumbersome, carried a high logistic burden, and above all been very expensive.
