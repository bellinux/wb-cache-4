25|$|The prime {{mission of}} the ship is the direct {{transport}} and discharge of liquid and dry cargo to shallow <b>terminal</b> <b>areas,</b> remote under-developed coastlines and on inland waterways. The ship does not require external cranes or port facilities, and even in only four feet of water under full load, the ship is still able to land. This capability expands the choice of landing locations, {{and at the same}} time reduces the potential enemy impact on the logistics support operations.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main entrances into IAH's <b>terminal</b> <b>areas.</b> John F. Kennedy Boulevard {{is the main}} north-south artery into the airport and intersects with Greens Road {{becoming}} an expressway leading to the terminals (by traveling west on Greens Road, one can access the nearby Greenspoint business and residential district). Will Clayton Parkway, which runs east to west, is another main road for IAH. Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 (I-69/US59) is connected to IAH by Will Clayton Parkway. The Hardy Tollway Connector runs from west to east connecting JFK Boulevard to the Hardy Toll Road.|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{flow control}} and {{sequencing}} of air traffic {{operations in the}} near <b>terminal</b> <b>area</b> are discussed. The near <b>terminal</b> <b>area</b> model {{is based on the}} assumptions that the aircraft enter the <b>terminal</b> <b>area</b> along precisely controlled approach paths and that the aircraft are segregated according to their near <b>terminal</b> <b>area</b> performance.

50|$|The future {{development}} of the airport is governed by a 30-year master plan. Projected developments include a new Virgin Australia business lounge, expansion of the International <b>terminal</b> <b>area,</b> and re-{{development of the}} entire land-side <b>terminal</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
25|$|The airport {{incorporates}} two cargo areas, North Cargo and South Cargo. The North Cargo <b>terminal</b> <b>area</b> {{is used by}} cargo airlines.

25|$|Area A is a {{triangle}} of land between the A538 road and Runway 1 and the cargo terminal {{which is currently}} under development to be available for summer 2016. It will be used together with Area E, {{a triangle}} of land west of the A538 up to the M56, with its west corner opposite Warburton Green, {{for the expansion of}} aircraft maintenance and cargo <b>terminal</b> <b>areas.</b> Clough area to be enhanced with mitigation measures that will become part of the extensive Landscape Habitat Management Area. The A538 alignment to be retained and capacity added as required by increased traffic volumes.|$|E
25|$|Guideways {{were made}} of {{concrete}} and based on highway construction techniques. The varying topography of the airport resulted in both aerial and ground level guideways winding their way over and under public roadways. As the guideway entered the semicircular terminals or remote parking areas, it remained at ground/ramp level and under the terminal building. At these <b>terminal</b> <b>areas</b> the guideway branched out to serve various stations, bypass tracks and vehicle storage sidings. Additional bypass guideways were constructed as the airport expanded. At several locations along the guideway tug sidings were located near the airport service road, allowing a disabled vehicle {{to be removed from}} the guideway and towed to the maintenance facility.|$|E
25|$|The Dallas/Fort Worth Airport had {{recently}} started construction, and a people mover {{was one of}} their requirements. The airport consisted of four semi-circular <b>terminal</b> <b>areas</b> arranged in a line with large parking lots on either ends of the line, and two hotel towers in the middle. It was miles {{from one end to the}} other, so some form of rapid transit was needed to move people around the complex. DFW wanted the system to transport not only people, but mail, trash, supplies, and baggage as well. Varo Corp. {{had recently}} purchased the Monocab concept from its private developer and were pitching the system to DFW. LTV was asked to join them in a joint proposal, which was submitted late in 1970, along with two others from different providers. However, all three were over the price the airport had budgeted, and the companies were asked to re-submit.|$|E
