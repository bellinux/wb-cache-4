5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

60|$|She turned <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> abrupt {{recovery}} of her customary manner.|$|R
60|$|The Nugget {{watched her}} {{disappear}} through the trap-door, then turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of resolution.|$|R
60|$|Zillah was dismissed. Nugent--thus far, unusually grave, and unusually anxious--turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of relief.|$|R
60|$|My cousin {{held out}} her hand <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> charmingly frank impulsiveness.|$|E
60|$|She turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> swift movement, {{her eyes}} filled with tears.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Ravenor turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slight frown {{upon his}} fine forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is Italian {{blood in}} him,' said Charlotte brightly. 'For he spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Italian accent. But I can't think {{whether he is}} {{a boy or a}} man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is my lord dead? Oh, say not he is dead," [...] she cried, {{lifting her}} noble-looking face, all stained {{as it was}} <b>with</b> tears, up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of {{infinite}} beseeching that went straight to my heart.|$|R
60|$|The {{world is}} full of officious, interfering busy-bodies. I should no more think of posting a letter that didn't belong <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unused stamp on it, than I should think o' flying; but some meddle-some son of a ----a gun posted that letter and I got it.|$|R
60|$|She turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{very bright}} smile {{and gave me}} her hand.|$|E
60|$|Perry {{looked through}} the lenses of a moment, and then turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile.|$|E
60|$|She {{started to}} her feet, and came close up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> look of fury.|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot, Sylvia. We {{are as much}} {{divorced}} as if {{judge and}} jury had decided the righteous but hard separation for us. You can never be <b>a</b> wife <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unconquerable affection in your heart; I can never be your husband while {{the shadow of a}} fear remains. I will have all or nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a lovely}} altar-cloth," [...] he whispers <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> enthusiasm that only makes one sorrow for him the more, so utterly {{impossible}} does it cause all hope of cure to seem. [...] "And they've got a coffin in the north crypt that is simply a poem. I never enjoyed a sarcophagus more in all my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do, friend Joseph," [...] {{said the}} widow, signing {{to him to}} go downstairs in her easy self-possessed way. [...] "Mr. David is too {{sensible}} to take notice of trifles.

60|$|Mr Abney {{had turned}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> look of hopeless bewilderment. I raised my eyebrows.|$|E

60|$|John Clayton {{departed}} chuckling, and Holmes turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shrug of {{his shoulders}} and a rueful smile.|$|E
6000|$|As my {{neighbour}} sat down, {{he turned}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inane smile which occupied all his face. 'Good evening,' he said, in a baronial drawl. 'Miss Cayley, I gathah? I asked the skippah's leave to set next yah. We {{ought to be}} friends--rathah. I think yah know my poor deah old aunt, Lady Georgina Fawley.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} haunted," [...] he said, [...] "by those words spoken at Athens. 'Whom {{therefore}} ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you.' That comes <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> effect of--guidance is an old-fashioned word--shall I say suggestion? To {{stand by the}} altar bearing strange names and ancient symbols, speaking plainly to all mankind of the one true God--!" ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the next}} day, being May the twentieth, he came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wan face.|$|R
60|$|Capitaine Brunot turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gentle smile, {{and there}} was a {{wonderful}} look in his dark, kind eyes.|$|E
60|$|She turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{little smile}} of apology. There {{was a new}} look in her face too. She spoke gravely.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Perch came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{face like}} a {{squeezed}} lemon, {{and asked me if}} I could lend her five nails.|$|E

60|$|A little {{incident}} comes <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> connected <b>with</b> <b>a</b> coffee-house not {{far from}} Jubilee Street on the Mile End Road.|$|R
6000|$|... "How then, sir, came Sir Wycherly <b>to</b> honour <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> request <b>to</b> visit him?" [...] {{demanded the}} other, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{extremely}} awkward pertinency.|$|R
60|$|And {{two days}} later Lucy came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white face {{to say that he}} had been arrested for forging a cheque.|$|E
60|$|Laura {{was near}} enough to hear the last word, softly as he whispered it. She turned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> look of terror.|$|E
60|$|His {{face grew}} a shade paler as he glanced it through. Then he folded {{it up and}} handed it back <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> polite gesture.|$|E
6000|$|At {{that point}} the guide halted. He peered with hand across his eyebrows among the tangled brake of tree-ferns <b>with</b> <b>a</b> terrified look; then he shook his woolly black head ominously. [...] "I can't go on, Monsieur," [...] he said, turning <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unfeigned shudder. [...] "Madame has not taken the path of Our Lady. She {{has gone to the}} left along the other road, which leads at last to the Vaudoux temple." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{walked a}} dozen paces down the {{bridle-path}} that joined {{the road at}} this place, and pointed out {{the way that he}} should go, past Ditchingham church. As I did so I noticed that while I spoke the stranger was watching my face keenly and, as it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inward fear which he strove to master and could not. When I had finished again he raised his bonnet and thanked me, saying, ...|$|R
60|$|Forgetful that I was in {{a foreign}} land--that he might not {{understand}} me--I told it him in English, I told it him at length, I told it very loud and clear. He stood a yard in front of <b>me,</b> listening <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> expression of ecstatic joy I have never before or since seen equalled on any face, human or canine. He drank it in {{as though it had}} been music from Paradise.|$|R
