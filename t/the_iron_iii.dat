40|$|This thesis aims to gain {{further insight}} into how the {{naphthenic}} acids (NA), which cause different problems with respect to flow assurance, can {{be removed from the}} water phase. The main objective has been to test how effective the polyethyleneimine functionalized magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are to remove phenylacetic acid, which functioned as model naphthenic acid from water. The first part of the experimental work was concerned with the adsorp- tion of polyethyleneimine onto the nanoparticle surface. The zeta potentials as function of pH were determined for both <b>the</b> <b>iron</b> oxide nanoparticles and the polymer. From superimposing the isoelectric points for both syn- thesised and purchased iron oxide nanoparticles and comparing them to the zeta potentials for polyethyleneimine, pH 8 was chosen. Since the confidence for the true mean of the zeta potential was low for <b>the</b> functionalized <b>iron</b> (II, <b>III)</b> oxide core, using shaking overnight, the functionalization was done again with <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> oxide as core. In a new approach the polyethyleneimine was added to <b>the</b> supernatant of <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> oxide after centrifugation followed by sonication. The new functionalized nanoparticles gave a high confidence for the zeta potentials and were attracted to an external magnetic field. The spe- cific surface area for <b>the</b> functionalized <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> oxide nanoparticles was iiidetermined to be 62. 5 ± 0. 2 with 95 % confidence, using gas adsorption. The composition with respect to mass was determined to be 6 wt% from running a thermogravimetric analysis. Hence, the surface excess of poly- ethyleneimine was calculated to be 0. 9 mg/m 2. In {{the second part of the}} experiments, test adsorptions of the model acid were conducted using <b>the</b> polyethyleneimine coated <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> oxide nanoparticles. At pH 8 the adsorption of the phenylacetic acid was negli- gible. A new calibration curve was made at pH 4. 5. Two different values for the surface excess were obtained. When concentration of the bulk acid prior to the adsorption was estimated from the calibration curve, the surface excess was calculated to be 0. 16 mg/m 2, whereas 0. 28 mg/m 2 was procured using the value from the balance.

This highly endothermic reaction requires a catalyst to lower the reaction temperature. This reaction forms part of the HyS (Hybrid Sulphur) cycle, a proposed thermochemical process for the industrial scale production of hydrogen and oxygen from water. The study aimed at obtaining reaction kinetics for this reaction employing pure, unsupported <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> oxide as catalyst as a cheaper alternative compared to supported iron catalysts. It {{was found that the}} SO 3 conversion was carried out in the absence of diffusion limitations and that the reverse reaction did not play a significant role. By assuming plug flow conditions in the reactor and 1 st order kinetics, the kinetic parameters of the reaction were obtained. These parameters that form part of the Arrhenius law in describing the reaction rate constant, were determined to be 118 (± 23) kj / mol for the activation energy (Ea), and a value of 3 (± 0. 5) x 108 hr- 1 was obtained for the Arrhenius frequency factor (A). Both values correspond to literature, although in general larger activation energies were published for <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> oxide derived supported catalysts. A comparison of {{the performance of}} <b>the</b> pure, unsupported <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> oxide catalyst with other <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> oxide derived supported catalysts (or pellets) has shown that <b>the</b> pure <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> oxide catalyst exhibit similar activities.

The addition of these species seems to have a larger influence on the reaction rate at low reaction temperatures around 700 °C than at higher reaction temperatures (i. e. 750 °C and 825 °C).
