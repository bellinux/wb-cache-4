5|$|The {{mechanism}} {{only works}} if <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> cooler than the reference temperature. If <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E

40|$|This {{information}} {{is designed to}} belie the misconception that <b>the</b> capacity of <b>air</b> to hold water vapor is temperature dependent and that air can become saturated with water vapor. The temperature of a cloud droplet or ice crystal will be nearly {{the same as that}} of <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> so people imagine that somehow <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>was</b> to blame. But, if the other gases of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>were</b> removed, leaving everything else the same, condensation and evaporation would proceed as before and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>was</b> irrelevant to <b>the</b> behavior of the water molecules. It is therefore not correct to assign the behavior of water to an invented holding capacity of <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Educational levels: High school, Middle school...|$|R

5|$|Lung {{function}} {{testing is}} carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> called the residual volume. Together these terms {{are referred to as}} lung volumes.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potentially}} damaging materials include non-archival quality cardboard, card, paper, {{cotton and}} cork, {{all of which}} give off acidic vapors over time. PVC and polyurethane plastics are also a problem, as they degrade and give off acidic vapors with time. High humidity of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> a significant contributing factor, as is lack of ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the common house martin is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, and preferably near water, although it {{is also found in}} mountains up to at least 2,200metres (7,200ft) altitude. As its name implies, it readily nests on man-made buildings, and will breed even in city centres if <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> clean enough. The other two species favour mountainous country (and sea cliffs in the case of Asian house martin); they use buildings as nest sites less frequently than their northern relative. The wintering grounds of the two migrant species include a range of open country and hilly habitats.|$|E

5|$|Titan's {{components}} are air-cooled by heat sinks, but <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> chilled before being pumped through the cabinets. Fan noise is {{so loud that}} hearing protection is required for people spending more than 15 minutes in the machine room. The system has a cooling capacity of 23.2 MW (6600 tons) and works by chilling water to 5.5 °C (42 °F), which in turn cools recirculated air.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock {{with each other and}} have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump {{followed}} in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic as <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> slowly {{withdrawn from the}} vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers {{to the left of the}} painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved.|$|E

5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) is an {{archaeologist}} who discovers star charts in caves {{around the world}} with his lover, Elizabeth Shaw. After awakening from cryosleep near LV-223, he introduces the purpose of the mission with Shaw. While the Prometheus flies over the moon, Holloway spots an artificial arrangement of structures and directs the ship to land near one. He goes with the first expedition crew to the concealed Juggernaut, discovers that <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> clearer than anywhere on Earth and removes his helmet. After Shaw retrieves a preserved Engineer head, the expedition is informed of an incoming storm and Holloway {{and the rest of the}} crew return to the Prometheus. Disappointed by the Engineers' apparent extinction, he sulks and berates Shaw for still being a Christian. David brings Holloway a drink, and they discuss the merits of creating beings; he tainted the drink with a minute organism from a cylinder he brought from he structure, infecting Holloway. Holloway has sex with Shaw shortly afterwards, impregnating her with an alien embryo. After seeing a small, extraterrestrial parasite in his eye, Holloway returns to the Engineer ship and becomes ill. As the expedition returns, Holloway worsens; the infection becomes obvious, and Vickers obeys his request to kill him with a flamethrower outside the ship.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts usually {{move from}} west to east, or from {{southwest}} to northeast, but rarely from the south. Because of this, these cold fronts do {{not result in}} the cold being intense since they are moderated as they pass over the surrounding oceans. In the rare cases when cold fronts move northwards from the south (Antarctica), the cold air masses are not moderated by the surrounding oceans, resulting in very cold temperatures throughout the region. In general, the passage of cold fronts {{is more common in}} the south than in the north, and occurs more in winter than in summer. The movement of warm, subtropical air into the region occurs frequently in summer up to 46oS. When warm subtropical air arrives in the region, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> dry, resulting in little precipitation, and causes temperatures to be higher than those observed in northeast Argentina.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mature}} {{stage of a}} thunderstorm, the warmed air {{continues}} to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the tropopause. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large {{that they do not}} melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating downdrafts as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E
5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E

5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by {{using some of the}} liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey to}} the waterhole is {{undertaken}} at around dawn when <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> cool. Later in the day, when the air temperature may reach over 50°C, the birds are inactive and {{have the ability to}} increase their thermal insulation when the air temperature exceeds their body temperatures. At very high temperatures they also resort to gular fluttering and gaping to cool themselves. At night, several flocks coalesce and fly off into the rocky desert far away from any vegetation. Each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving from side to side. There are no jerboas or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and the birds are safe.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) {{vertebrates}} that do {{not maintain}} their body temperature through internal physiological processes. Their metabolic rate is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. Amphibians breathe {{by means of a}} pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>is</b> forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin.|$|E
