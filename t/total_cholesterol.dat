5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of <b>total</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. <b>Total</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while <b>total</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower <b>total</b> <b>cholesterol</b> than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E

40|$|Objective Although {{a concern}} exists that 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl {{coenzyme}} A reductase inhibitors (statins) might {{increase the risk}} of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), the contribution of these agents to the relationship between serum cholesterol and disease occurrence has been poorly investigated. Methods We compared consecutive patients having ICH with age and sex-matched stroke-free control subjects in a case-control analysis, as part of the Multicenter Study on Cerebral Haemorrhage in Italy (MUCH-Italy), and tested the presence of interaction effects between <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> levels and statins on the risk of ICH. Results A total of 3492 cases (mean age, 73. 012. 7 years; males, 56. 6 %) and 3492 control subjects were enrolled. Increasing <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> levels were confirmed to be inversely associated with ICH. We observed a statistical interaction between <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> levels and statin use for the risk of haemorrhage (Interaction OR (IOR), 1. 09; 95 % CI 1. 05 to 1. 12). Increasing levels of <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> were associated with a decreased risk of ICH within statin strata (average OR, 0. 87; 95 % CI 0. 86 to 0. 88 for every increase of 0. 26 mmol/l of <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> concentrations), while statin use was associated with an increased risk (OR, 1. 54; 95 % CI 1. 31 to 1. 81 of the average level of <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol).</b> The protective effect of serum cholesterol against ICH was reduced by statins in strictly lobar brain regions more than in non-lobar ones. Conclusions Statin therapy and <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> levels exhibit interaction effects towards the risk of ICH.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether screening of thyroid function is justified in patients with hypercholesterolaemia, we determined the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism {{at different levels of}} <b>total</b> plasma <b>cholesterol</b> in middle-aged men and women. DESIGN AND METHODS: 1200 participants were selected from a population based cross sectional study on risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The participants were divided into three groups: <b>total</b> plasma <b>cholesterol</b> 8 mmol/l. Each group was comparable in size and sex distribution. Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as plasma TSH levels higher than 4 mU/l, in the presence of normal free thyroxine (FT 4 (4)) concentration. RESULTS: Plasma samples of a total of 1191 participants were analyzed. The overall prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism was 1. 9 % in men and 7. 6 % in women of middle age. In women the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism increased from 4. 0 percent in the lowest, to 10. 3 percent in the highest cholesterol stratum (P = 0. 02). In men, the mean prevalence was 1. 8 percent and roughly similar in the various strata. After age correction, an increase of 1 mU/l TSH in women was associated with an increase of 0. 09 mmol/l <b>total</b> plasma <b>cholesterol</b> (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 02 - 0. 16 mmol/l). A similar trend was found in men (0. 16 mmol/l, 95 % CI - 0. 02 - 0. 34 mmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: In the population, the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is up to 10 percent in middle aged women with high levels of <b>total</b> plasma <b>cholesterol</b> and may justify case-finding. In these women approximately 0. 5 mmol/l of <b>total</b> plasma <b>cholesterol</b> {{can be attributed to the}} subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

40|$|Current {{understanding}} {{of the impact of}} lipids and other risk factors on coronary heart disease is largely {{based on the results of}} parametric multiple regression analyses of large prospective studies. To assess the potential impact of the a priori assumption of linearity of continuous risk factors on the results of parametric analyses, the authors completed a secondary analysis of the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence and Follow-up Studies (1972 - 1987) data using an assumption-free nonparametric modeling approach. The effects of <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> and the ratio of <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> to high density lipoprotein cholesterol, adjusted for common risk factors, were estimated using a smoothing spline method available in the generalized additive model extension of the multiple logistic regression. The data set included 2, 512 men in the random sample of the Lipid Research Clinics study who did not take lipid-lowering medications. During the median follow-up of 12. 6 years, 94 coronary heart disease deaths occurred. The generalized additive model fits the effects of <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> (p < 0. 01) and the ratio of <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0. 02) significantly better than the parametric logistic regression.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] biochemical and hematological parameters were investigated during experimentally induced hypercholesterolemia in rabbits. A close correlation between the <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> concentration and the changes in body mass and β globulin concentration was observed. The initial increase in these parameters {{was followed by a}} reduction in body mass and β globulin concentration and was accompanied by a simultaneous decline in the <b>total</b> serum <b>cholesterol</b> values. The slight increase in total serum protein levels could be attributed to an elevation in the globulin fraction. Both the relative and absolute α and γ globulin concentrations increased progressively {{during the course of the}} study. The significance of these findings is discussed. Anemia of a biphasic character (the second phase being hemolytic) was associated with the hypercholesterolemia.

Between 1999 and 2010, the percentage of U.S. adults with high <b>total</b> <b>cholesterol</b> declined from approximately 18% to 13%. However, according to the American Heart Association, nearly half of U.S. adults today (44%) are still at increased risk for atherosclerotic disease because their levels of <b>total</b> <b>cholesterol</b> are elevated (200mg/dL or higher). Of these 98.8 million individuals with elevated cholesterol, 33.6 million have high cholesterol (240mg/dL or above), and 71.3 million have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 130mg/dL or higher. In addition, approximately 19% of U.S. adults have low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and one-third have elevated triglycerides. Finally, dyslipidemia affects the vast majority (up to 97%) of individuals with diabetes and contributes to their elevated risk for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of {{biopolymer}} encapsulation on the digestion of <b>total</b> lipids and <b>cholesterol</b> in egg yolk using an in vitro human digestion model. Egg yolks were encapsulated with 1 % cellulose, pectin, or chitosan. The samples were then passed through an in vitro human digestion model that simulated the composition of mouth saliva, stomach acid, and the intestinal juice of the small intestine by using a dialysis tubing system. The change in digestion of total lipids was monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The digestion rate of <b>total</b> lipids and <b>cholesterol</b> in all egg yolk samples dramatically increased after in vitro human digestion. The digestion rate of <b>total</b> lipids and <b>cholesterol</b> in egg yolks encapsulated with chitosan or pectin was reduced compared to the digestion rate of <b>total</b> lipids and <b>cholesterol</b> in other egg yolk samples. Egg yolks encapsulated with pectin or chitosan had lower free fatty acid content, and lipid oxidation values than samples without biopolymer encapsulation. Moreover, the lipase activity decreased, after in vitro digestion, in egg yolks encapsulated with biopolymers.
