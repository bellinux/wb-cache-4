5|$|The 169Yb isotope (with a {{half-life}} of 32 days), {{which is}} created {{along with the}} short-lived 175Yb isotope (half-life 4.2 days) by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors, {{has been used as}} a radiation source in portable X-ray machines. Like X-rays, the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body, but are blocked by bones and other dense materials. Thus, small 169Yb samples (which emit gamma rays) act like tiny X-ray machines useful for radiography of small objects. Experiments show that radiographs <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> a 169Yb source are roughly equivalent to those <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> X-rays having energies between 250 and 350keV. 169Yb is also used in nuclear medicine.|$|E
