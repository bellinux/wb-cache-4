50|$|There are {{two types}} of non-territorial males in A. maculosum. One type is a {{satellite}} male that stays {{in one corner of the}} territory and doesn't patrol as widely as <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> owner. <b>The</b> second type is a wandering intruder that visits certain territories repeatedly. For example, a wandering intruder has been seen to go between two different sites 18 times within an hour. The transient bee might call before he is detected by <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> bee. These non-territorial males flee the scene immediately after being approached by <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> bee. If caught by <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> male while attempting to copulate, the non-territorial male and the female he is trying to reproduce with will be violently struck by <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> bee in order to separate the pair. In other cases, <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> male will pull the non-territorial male off the female and continue to copulate with the free female. It seems that in general, non-territorial males mate fewer times than territorial males.|$|R

40|$|General Information The Pathology {{rotation}} {{will provide}} the house staff officer with a broad overview of clinical pathology, laboratory diagnosis and blood banking procedures. When interested, <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> may be assigned to gross pathology. Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> is encouraged to review general organ pathology in areas of specific interest {{with the assistance of}} a staff pathologist. Goals and Objectives The goal of this rotation is to integrate the role of clinical medicine and clinical pathology in total patient care. Value to <b>the</b> <b>Resident</b> This rotation should allow <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> to understand <b>the</b> pathologist's contribution to disease diagnosis. A better understanding of the interpretation of clinical pathological laboratory studies would result. The utility of various clinical diagnostic testing procedures continues to evolve and provides <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> with new methods for diagnosis.

Educational Content <b>The</b> <b>resident</b> will be exposed to clinical as well as surgical pathology experiencing frozen section and autopsy preparation, the basics of pap smear interpretation and reporting, bone marrow reviews, aspiration cytology, biopsy interpretation, pathologic slide interpretation, toxicology screens, tumor marker interpretation, microbiology lab overview, and blood banking techniques.

Attractor switching, evolutionary suicide as well as most cases of "the resident strikes back" in systems with multiple attractors are possible only near a bifurcation point in the strategy space where <b>the</b> <b>resident</b> attractor undergoes a discontinuous change.
