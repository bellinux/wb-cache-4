50|$|Over{{pressure}} (or blast overpressure) is {{the pressure}} {{caused by a}} shock wave over and above normal atmospheric pressure. The shock wave {{may be caused by}} sonic boom or by explosion, and the resulting overpressure receives particular attention when measuring the effects of nuclear weapons or <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Reports by {{the rebel}} fighters of the Free Syrian Army claim the Syrian Air Force used such weapons against {{residential}} area targets {{occupied by the}} rebel fighters, as for instance in the Battle for Aleppo and also in Kafar Batna. A United Nations panel of human rights investigators reported that the Syrian government used <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bombs</b> against the rebellious town of Qusayr in March 2013.|$|R
2500|$|Another Russian-mediated ceasefire {{was agreed}} in Sochi on 27 July and lasted until 16 September, when Abkhazian separatists {{violated}} the agreement (citing Georgia's {{failure to comply}} with the terms of the agreement) and launched a large-scale offensive against Sukhumi. During the siege, Russian MiG-29s dropped <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bombs</b> on Georgian residential districts in Sukhumi and Georgian villages along the Gumista River. [...] Russian journalist Dmitry Kholodov stayed in Sukhumi before it fell, and reported that the city was repeatedly shelled by Russian forces, causing heavy civilian casualties.|$|R

50|$|A <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bomb</b> {{is a type}} of {{explosive}} that utilizes oxygen from the surrounding air to generate an intense, high-temperature explosion, and in practice the blast wave typically produced by such a weapon is of a significantly longer duration than that produced by a conventional condensed explosive. The fuel-air bomb is one of the best-known types of thermobaric weapons.|$|E
50|$|The US {{military}} {{also used}} thermobaric weapons in Afghanistan. On 3 March 2002, a single 2000 lb laser guided <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bomb</b> {{was used by}} the United States Army against cave complexes in which Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters had taken refuge in the Gardez region of Afghanistan. The SMAW-NE {{was used by the}} US Marines during the First Battle of Fallujah and Second Battle of Fallujah.|$|E

2500|$|Yousef was {{assisted}} by Iraqi bomb maker Abdul Rahman Yasin, who helped assemble the complex [...] bomb, {{which was made}} of a urea nitrate main charge with aluminum, magnesium and ferric oxide particles surrounding the explosive. The charge used nitroglycerine, ammonium nitrate dynamite, smokeless powder and fuse as booster explosives. Three tanks of bottled hydrogen were also placed in a circular configuration around the main charge, to enhance the fireball and afterburn of the solid metal particles. The use of compressed gas cylinders {{in this type of}} attack closely resembles the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing 10 years earlier. Both of these attacks used compressed gas cylinders to create fuel-air and <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bombs</b> that release more energy than conventional high explosives. According to testimony in the bomb trial, only once before the 1993 attack had the FBI recorded a bomb that used urea nitrate.|$|R
2500|$|Some defense analysts {{question}} {{both the}} yield {{of the bomb}} and whether it could be deployed by a Tupolev Tu-160 bomber. A report by Wired says photos and the video of the event {{suggest that it is}} designed to be deployed from the rear of a slow moving cargo plane, and they note that the bomb-test video released by the Russians never shows both the bomb and the bomber in the same camera shot. There are also questions on what type of explosives it used. They quoted Tom Burky, a senior research scientist at Battelle, saying [...] "It's not even clear what kind of weapon the Russians tested." [...] He questions if it was what some experts call a fuel-air explosive or if it was a thermobaric weapon. [...] "Fuel-air and <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bombs</b> differ in usefulness". Burky says that the weapon depicted in the video appears to be a fuel-air explosive, based on its shape.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, {{a program}} of {{military}} research was launched with collaboration between the Spanish Ministry of Defence (Directorate General of Armament and Material, DGAM), Explosives Alaveses (EXPAL) and Explosives Rio Tinto (ERT) {{with the goal of}} developing a Spanish version of a <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bomb,</b> the BEAC (Bomba Explosiva de Aire-Combustible). A prototype was tested successfully in a foreign location out of safety and confidentiality concerns. The Spanish Air Force has an undetermined number of BEACs in its inventory.|$|E
50|$|The main {{developments}} in this laboratory were the air torpedo L 40, {{which could be}} dropped from any height and speed up to 700 km/h, the Dornier Do 335 high-speed aircraft and the Hexenkessel (Witch's Cauldron) project, which aimed to develop a highly effective detonation charge {{for use in a}} warhead of a surface-to-air missile. Coal dust was launched in a grenade, and dispersed by an explosive charge. The subsequent very large explosion was to achieve a high effectiveness. In 1943 the first test with a 60 kilogram <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bomb</b> was carried out.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power of}} large bombs is {{typically}} measured in kilotons (kt) or megatons of TNT (Mt). The most powerful bombs ever used in combat {{were the two}} atomic bombs dropped by the United States to attack Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the most powerful ever tested was the Tsar Bomba. The most powerful non-nuclear bomb is Russian [...] "Father of All Bombs" [...] (officially Aviation <b>Thermobaric</b> <b>Bomb</b> of Increased Power (ATBIP)) followed by the United States Air Force's MOAB (officially Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or more {{commonly known as the}} [...] "Mother of All Bombs").|$|E
5000|$|The {{designation}} [...] "BLU" [...] {{stands for}} Bomb Live Unit, {{as opposed to}} [...] "BDU" [...] (Bomb Dummy Units) used for practice. Originally designed to create an instant clearing in the jungles of Vietnam, the BLU-82B/C-130 was test-dropped there from a CH-54 Tarhe [...] "Flying crane" [...] helicopter. Later it was used in Afghanistan as an anti-personnel weapon and as an intimidation weapon because of its very large blast radius (variously reported as 300 to 900 feet/100 to 300 meters) combined with a visible flash and audible sound at long distances. It {{is one of the}} largest conventional weapons ever to be used, outweighed only by a few earthquake <b>bombs,</b> <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bombs,</b> and demolition (bunker buster) bombs. Some of these include the Grand Slam and T12 earthquake bombs of late World War II, and more currently, the Russian Air Force FOAB and USAF GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb, and the Massive Ordnance Penetrator.|$|R

5000|$|Russian thermobaric weapons, {{also known}} as [...] "fuel-air bombs", {{have been used by}} the {{government}} side during the war. One Buratino thermobaric rocket launcher [...] "can obliterate a roughly 200 by 400 m area with a single salvo". Since 2012, rebels have said that the Syrian Air Force (government forces) is using thermobaric weapons against residential areas occupied by the rebel fighters, such as during the Battle of Aleppo and also in Kafr Batna. A panel of United Nations human rights investigators reported that the Syrian government used <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bombs</b> against the strategic town of Qusayr in March 2013. In August 2013, the BBC reported on the use of napalm-like incendiary bombs on a school in northern Syria. On 2 December 2015, The National Interest reported that Russia was deploying the TOS-1 Buratino multiple rocket launch system to Syria, which is [...] "designed to launch massive thermobaric charges against infantry in confined spaces such as urban areas." ...|$|R
50|$|In January 2015, Bain is {{contacted}} by a Croatian weapons smuggler {{known as the}} Butcher (Mira Furlan), who sends Dragan (Dragomir Mrsic), a crooked Interpol agent, to help the gang steal a <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bomb.</b> The gang steal the weapon {{in one of two}} ways - either by stealing it from a ship at the docks, or interecepting a train carrying it in the middle of a forest. After the job is complete, Dragan stays in America as a permanent member of the gang. After this, Hoxton is {{contacted by}} an old associate named Bonnie (Rhona Cameron), who possesses information vital to finding the rat that sold him out, and she bargains this information in exchange for a place in the gang. Knowing where the informant is hiding, the gang infiltrate his FBI safehouse to find that it was Hector who sold them out. They kill him and recover the evidence that the FBI have about them. Around this time, Jacket (protagonist of Hotline Miami) joins the gang through unknown means, just as the gang further humiliate GenSec by stealing money from various display vaults at their newly built arena, during a concert by Swedish DJ Alesso.|$|E
40|$|The long {{duration}} and high impulse shock wave of <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bomb</b> threatens {{the security of}} underground structures. To obtain high resistance blast door against thermobaric shock wave, firstly, the dynamic mechanic property of high damping rubber was studied by split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) equipment and the stress-strain relationship of high damping rubber under average strain rate of 5200 /s was obtained. Secondly, the numerical model of interlayered high-damping-rubber blast door was established with ANSYS/LS-DYNA code based on test results, and the antiknock performance of interlayered high-damping-rubber blast door under thermobaric shock wave was analyzed by contrast with ordinary blast door. The {{results showed that the}} midspan displacement of the blast door decreased firstly and then increased with the increase of thickness of the high-damping-rubber interlayer, and the optimal thickness of the high-damping-rubber interlayer for energy consuming was 150 [*]mm in the calculation condition of this paper. With the increase of the distance between the interlayer and the front surface of the door, the midspan displacement of the blast door decreased continually. The midspan maximum displacement of interlayered high-damping-rubber blast door decreased 74. 5 % in comparison to ordinary blast door. It showed that the high-damping-rubber structure can effectively improve the antiknock performance of blast door under thermobaric shock wave...|$|E
50|$|A <b>thermobaric</b> <b>bomb's</b> {{effective}} yield requires {{the most appropriate}} combination {{of a number of}} factors; among these are how well the fuel is dispersed, how rapidly it mixes with the surrounding atmosphere, and the initiation of the igniter and its position relative to the container of fuel. In some designs, strong munitions cases allow the blast pressure to be contained long enough for the fuel to be heated up well above its auto-ignition temperature, so that once the container bursts the super-heated fuel will auto-ignite progressively as it comes into contact with atmospheric oxygen.Conventional upper and lower limits of flammability apply to such weapons. Close in, blast from the dispersal charge, compressing and heating the surrounding atmosphere, will have some influence on the lower limit. The upper limit has been demonstrated strongly to influence the ignition of fogs above pools of oil. This weakness may be eliminated by designs where the fuel is preheated well above its ignition temperature, so that its cooling during its dispersion still results in a minimal ignition delay on mixing. The continual combustion of the outer layer of fuel molecules as they come into contact with the air, generates additional heat which maintains the temperature of the interior of the fireball, and thus sustains the detonation.|$|R

However, the van was not filled to capacity. Yousef used four 20 ft (6 m) long fuses, all covered in surgical tubing. Yasin calculated that the fuse would trigger the bomb in twelve minutes after he had used a cigarette lighter to light the fuse.|$|R
