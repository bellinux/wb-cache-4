25|$|The {{goal of the}} IGRT {{process is}} to improve the {{accuracy}} of the radiation field placement, and to reduce the exposure of healthy tissue during radiation treatments. In years past, larger planning <b>target</b> <b>volume</b> (PTV) margins were used to compensate for localization errors during treatment. This resulted in healthy human tissues receiving unnecessary doses of radiation during treatment. PTV margins are the most widely used method to account for geometric uncertainties. By improving accuracy through IGRT, radiation is decreased to surrounding healthy tissues, allowing for increased radiation to the tumour for control.|$|E
25|$|Currently, certain {{radiation}} therapy techniques employ {{the process of}} intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). This form of radiation treatment uses computers and linear accelerators to sculpt a three-dimensional radiation dose map, specific to the target's location, shape and motion characteristics. Because {{of the level of}} precision required for IMRT, detailed data must be gathered about tumour locations. The single most important area of innovation in clinical practice is the reduction of the planning <b>target</b> <b>volume</b> margins around the location. The ability to avoid more normal tissue (and thus potentially employ dose escalation strategies) is a direct by-product of the ability to execute therapy with the most accuracy.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: Significant tumor {{shrinkage}} {{and weight}} loss may occur during Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aims to evaluate the dosimetric effect of volumetric changes on <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> and organs at risk (OARs) during IMRT, using reassessment of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material and methods: Nineteen loco-regionally advanced NPC patients treated with IMRT were recruited prospectively. Repeat planning CT and MRI were acquired at 30 and 50 Gy intervals. Recontouring of <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> and OARs {{was based on the}} fused CT-MRI images. Hybrid plans with recontouring were generated. The assessment of volumetric and dosimetric changes was performed by comparing the hybrid plans with the original plan. Results: There was <b>volume</b> reduction of <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> and parotid glands over the course of IMRT. Relative to the original plan, the hybrid plans demonstrated significantly higher dose to most of <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> with greater dose inhomogeneity, higher maximum doses to the spinal cord and brainstem, and higher median doses to the parotid glands. Conclusions: Replanning with repeat CT and MRI scans at 30 Gy is essential to keep a satisfactory dose to the <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> and avoid overdosing the OARs. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2500|$|Volumetric {{modulated}} arc therapy (VMAT) {{is a new}} radiation technique, {{which can}} achieve highly conformal dose distributions on <b>target</b> <b>volume</b> coverage and sparing of normal tissues. The specificity of this technique is to modify the three parameters during the treatment. VMAT delivers radiation by rotating gantry (usually 360° rotating fields {{with one or more}} arcs), changing speed and shape of the beam with a multileaf collimator (MLC) ("sliding window" [...] system of moving) and fluence output rate (dose rate) of the medical linear accelerator. VMAT also has the potential to give additional advantages in patient treatment, such as reduced delivery time of radiation, compared with conventional static field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).|$|E
2500|$|Stereotactic {{radiosurgery}} {{was first}} developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat small {{targets in the}} brain that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes. The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation {{was made in the}} early fifties, with x-rays. The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the <b>target</b> <b>volume,</b> delivering a lethal cumulative dose of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson. [...] At this time, stereotactic proton beams had replaced the x-rays. The heavy particle beam presented as an excellent replacement for the surgical knife, but the synchrocyclotron was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the Karolinska Institute and consisted of several cobalt-60 radioactive sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays. This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In the 1980s the third and fourth units (with 201 cobalt-60 sources) were installed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Sheffield, England. The fifth Gamma Knife was installed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh in 1987.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Conventional {{clinical}} staging {{for prostate}} cancer has many limitations. This study evaluates the impact of adding MRI scans to conventional clinical staging for guiding decisions about radiotherapy target coverage. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 115 patients who were treated between February 2002 and September 2005 with radical radiotherapy {{for prostate cancer}}. All patients had MRI scans approximately 2 weeks before the initiation of radiotherapy. The T stage was assessed by both conventional clinical methods (cT-staging) {{as well as by}} MRI (mT-staging). The radiotherapy <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> were determined first based on cT-staging and then taking the additional mT staging into account. The number of times extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion was incorporated into <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> was quantified based on both cT-staging and the additional mT-staging. RESULTS: Extracapsular extension was incorporated into <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> significantly more often with the addition of mT-staging (46 patients (40 %) [*]) compared with cT-staging alone (37 patients (32 %) [*]) (P[*]=[*] 0. 002).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{radiotherapy}} planning study evaluated tumour delineation {{using both}} optimally respiratory gated and nongated fluorine- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (F-FDG-PET). METHODS: For 22 non-small-cell lung tumours, both scans {{were used to}} create the nongated and gated (g) gross tumour volumes (GTVg) together with the accompanying clinical <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> (CTV) and planning <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> (PTV). The size of the <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> (TV) was evaluated and the accompanying radiotherapy plans were created to study the radiation doses to the organs at risk (OAR). RESULTS: The median volumes of GTVg, CTVg and PTVg were statistically significantly smaller compared with the corresponding nongated volumes, resulting in a median TV reduction of 0. 5 cm (interquartile range 0. 1 - 1. 2), 1. 5 cm (- 0. 2 to 7. 0) and 2. 3 cm (- 0. 5 to 11. 3) for the GTVg, CTVg and PTVg, respectively. For the OAR, only the percentage of lung (GTV included) receiving at least 35 Gy was significantly smaller after gating, with a median difference in lung volume receiving at least 35 Gy of 5. 7 cm (interquartile range - 0. 8 to 30. 50). CONCLUSION: Compared with nongated F-FDG-PET, the TVs obtained with optimally respiratory gated F-FDG-PET were significantly smaller, however, without a clinically relevant difference in radiation dose to the OAR...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} delineations and interpretations of <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> by {{physicians}} in different radio-oncology centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven Swiss radio-oncology centers delineated volumes according to ICRU 50 recommendations for one prostate and one {{head and neck}} case. In order to evaluate {{the consistency of the}} volume delineations, the following parameters were determined: 1) the <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> (GTV, CTV and manually expanded PTV) and their extensions in the three main axes and 2) the correlation of the volume delineated by each pair of centers using the ratio of the intersection to the union (called proximity index). RESULTS: The delineated prostate volume was 105 +/- 55 cm(3) for the CTV and 218 +/- 44 cm(3) for the PTV. The delineated head and neck volume was 46 +/- 15 cm(3) for the GTV, 327 +/- 154 cm(3) for the CTV and 528 +/- 106 cm(3) for the PTV. The mean proximity index for the prostate case was 0. 50 +/- 0. 13 for the CTV and 0. 57 +/- 0. 11 for the PTV. The proximity index for the head and neck case was 0. 45 +/- 0. 09 for the GTV, 0. 42 +/- 0. 13 for the CTV and 0. 59 +/- 0. 06 for the PTV. CONCLUSIONS: Large discrepancies between all the delineated <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> were observed. There was an inverse relationship between the CTV volume and the margin between CTV and PTV, leading to less discrepancies in the PTV than is the CTV delineations. There was more spread in the sagittal and frontal planes due to CT pixel anisotropy, which suggests that radiation oncologists should delineate the <b>target</b> <b>volumes</b> not only in the transverse plane, but also in the sagittal and frontal planes to improve the delineation by allowing a consistency check...|$|R
