5000|$|... "Big Red" [...] {{is one of}} {{the early}} true pro touring muscle cars, the first Silver State classic, {{unlimited}} class record holder. Built in 1987 by R. J. and Dan Gottlieb and crew using a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro for the main platform. The power came from a 540 c.i. lingenfelter built all aluminum Donovan big block chevrolet V8 making 750 feet pounds of <b>torque</b> and 800 <b>horse</b> <b>power.</b> R. J. and crew went on to set the record for the Unlimited class of 197.99 mph (318.63 km/h). The original car was destroyed in an accident in the La Carrera road race as the chassis were unable to handle the high power output. The second car was designed and built by Bill Osborne with a spaceframe tube chassis. Big Red was retired to a car museum in Laughlin, Nevada in 1996, and was revived for racing again in 2004 with a complete overhaul and restoration of the entire car.http://bigredcamaro.com/ ...|$|R
40|$|A four- stroke {{gasoline}} engine {{was used to}} {{study the effects of}} engine speed and valve clearance on the engine <b>torque,</b> brake <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> and brake specific fuel consumption of this engine. The exhaust gas such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon and free oxygen were also investigated. The experimental results could be provided to the users and repairmen of a four-stroke {{gasoline engine}} for reference. The partial load experimental results showed that: (1) The overall results of engine <b>torque,</b> brake <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> and brake specific fuel consumption for valve clearance at 0. 35 mm were better than that valve clearance greater or less than 0. 35 mm. (2) The maximum engine torque was happened at 1900 RPM engine speed. (3) The maximum engine brake horsepower was happened at 3700 RPM∼ 4000 RPM engine speed. (4) The engine speed at minimum brake specific fuel consumption was happened between maximum engine torque and maximum brake horsepower. The full load experimental results showed that: (1) The overall results of engine performance for engine speeds lower than 3100 RPM had positive relationship with valve clearance. However, the 0. 35 mm valve clearance had the best engine performance for engine speeds than 3400 RPM. (2) The engine torque curve was symmetrical and the maximum torque was happened at 3100 RPM engine speed. (3) The maximum brake horsepower was happened at 4600 RPM∼ 4900 RPM engine speed. (4) The minimum brake specific fuel consumption for different valve clearances were located at different engine speed owing to the double-tube carburetor of the experimental engine. The exhaust gas analytical results showed that: (1) The valve clearance had negative effects on the carbon monoxide for engine speeds lower than 3400 RPM, but positive effects on the carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide was lowest and carbon dioxide was highest at 0. 35 mm valve clearance as engine speeds higher then 3700 RPM. (2) The percentages of hydrocarbon were lowest and carbon dioxides were highest for 0. 35 mm valve clearance compared with others. (3) The lower the valve clearance, the higher the percentages of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon in the exhaust gas. As valve clearance were larger than 0. 35 mm, the high percentages carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon were happened at high engine speeds. 本研究針對四行程汽油引擎，探討全負荷與部分負荷狀態下，各種不同汽門間隙及引擎轉速，對引擎扭力、制動馬力及燃料消耗率的影響。並在全負荷的測試條件下對引擎排氣中的一氧化碳（CO）、二氧化碳（CO 2 ）、碳氫化合物（HC）及氧（O 2 ）含量進行檢測，以分析不同汽門間隙對廢氣排放的影響。同時針對汽門間隙於規格值時，全負荷與部分負荷狀態之廢氣排放進行比較。本研究之成果將可提供使用者、維修者及相關研究人員之參考依據。 研究結果顯示，於部分負荷狀態下：（ 1 ）引擎汽門間隙調整於標準規格值時，於測定的各種轉速下，其引擎扭力、制動馬力與燃料消耗率三者的整體表現，均較汽門間隙小於或大於規格值時為佳。（ 2 ）引擎最大扭力出現在轉速為 1900 RPM處。（ 3 ）引擎之最大制動馬力約出現在轉速為 3700 RPM∼ 4000 RPM處。（ 4 ）最低燃料消耗率時之引擎轉速，落於最大扭力與最大制動馬力之間。 全負荷狀態下：（ 1 ）在最大引擎扭力之轉速點 3100 RPM以前，其引擎性能之整體表現與汽門間隙大小呈現正相關，即汽門間隙較大表現較佳。但在 3400 RPM以後，則以汽門間隙於規格值時的表現較佳。（ 2 ）整體引擎扭力曲線呈現出圓滑對稱之現象，最大扭力出現在引擎轉速 3100 RPM處。（ 3 ）引擎之最大制動馬力約出現在 4600 RPM∼ 4900 RPM處。（ 4 ）本研究採用雙管化油器，因此，各不同汽門間隙之最低燃料消耗率的出現點並不一致。 全負荷狀態下之廢氣排放：（ 1 ）引擎轉速於 3400 RPM以下時，CO之排放量大致與汽門間隙呈現負相關，而CO 2 之排放量則與汽門間隙呈現正相關，CO與 CO 2 之排放量於 3700 RPM以上時，則以汽門間隙於規格值時的表現較佳。（ 2 ）汽門間隙於規格值時，其HC之排放量最低，而O 2 之排放量也最佳，且曲線最平穩。（ 3 ）汽門間隙愈小於規格值，其廢氣中CO與HC的含量愈高；而汽門間隙大於規格值時，在高轉速時CO與HC含量才有明顯偏高的現象。中文摘要…………………………………………………………Ⅰ 英文摘要…………………………………………………………Ⅲ 目錄………………………………………………………………Ⅵ 圖目錄……………………………………………………………Ⅹ 表目錄…………………………………………………………ⅩⅢ 壹、緒論………………………………………………………… 1 1. 1 前言 …………………………………………………… 1 1. 2 研究目的 ……………………………………………… 4 貳、文獻探討…………………………………………………… 6 2. 1 汽門機構 ……………………………………………… 6 2. 1. 1 汽門間隙偏離規格值之弊害 …………………… 9 2. 1. 2 可變動汽門機構………………………………… 10 2. 2 引擎扭力……………………………………………… 16 2. 3 引擎馬力……………………………………………… 18 2. 3. 1 指示馬力 ………………………………………… 18 2. 3. 2 制動馬力………………………………………… 19 2. 3. 2. 1 總馬力……………………………………… 20 2. 3. 2. 2 淨馬力……………………………………… 20 2. 3. 3 摩擦馬力………………………………………… 21 2. 3. 4 制動馬力、指示馬力及摩擦馬力之關係……… 21 2. 4 燃料消耗率…………………………………………… 23 2. 5 廢氣排放……………………………………………… 24 2. 5. 1 燃料與燃燒……………………………………… 24 2. 5. 2 移動污染源……………………………………… 25 2. 5. 3 廢氣排放之控制技術 ………………………… 26 參、材料與方法 ……………………………………………… 29 3. 1 實驗材料與設備……………………………………… 29 3. 1. 1 實驗材料………………………………………… 29 3. 1. 2 實驗設備………………………………………… 29 3. 2 實驗方法……………………………………………… 31 3. 2. 1 汽門間隙之調整………………………………… 31 3. 2. 2 汽門升程與曲軸轉角之量測…………………… 31 3. 2. 3 馬力試驗機之操作……………………………… 32 3. 2. 4 排氣檢測方法…………………………………… 33 3. 3 實驗設計……………………………………………… 34 3. 3. 1 引擎性能測試…………………………………… 34 3. 3. 2 引擎排氣檢測…………………………………… 34 3. 3. 3 汽門開啟度數之量測…………………………… 35 3. 4 資料分析及統計……………………………………… 35 3. 4. 1 引擎性能分析…………………………………… 35 3. 4. 2 汽門間隙與引擎排氣成分之關係……………… 36 3. 4. 3 汽門開啟度與曲軸轉角關係之分析…………… 37 肆、結果與討論 ……………………………………………… 38 4. 1 汽門升程曲線………………………………………… 38 4. 2 部分負荷測試………………………………………… 43 4. 2. 1 扭力與引擎轉速之關係………………………… 44 4. 2. 2 制動馬力與引擎轉速之關係…………………… 47 4. 2. 3 燃料消耗率與引擎轉速之關係………………… 50 4. 2. 4 引擎性能曲線分析……………………………… 53 4. 2. 5 引擎排氣溫度…………………………………… 60 4. 2. 6 容積效率………………………………………… 62 4. 3 全負荷(Full Load) 測試 …………………………… 64 4. 3. 1 扭力與引擎轉速之關係………………………… 65 4. 3. 2 制動馬力與引擎轉速之關係…………………… 69 4. 3. 3 燃料消耗率與引擎轉速之關係………………… 71 4. 3. 4 容積效率………………………………………… 74 4. 4 部分負荷與全負荷引擎性能之比較………………… 76 4. 4. 1 引擎扭力之比較………………………………… 76 4. 4. 2 制動馬力之比較………………………………… 77 4. 4. 3 燃料消耗率之比較……………………………… 84 4. 4. 4 汽門間隙 0. 35 mm部分負荷與全負荷狀態下容積 效率與扭力之 比較 …………………………… 85 4. 5 全負荷狀態下汽門間隙與廢氣成分分析…………… 87 4. 5. 1 一氧化碳………………………………………… 87 4. 5. 2 二氧化碳………………………………………… 90 4. 5. 3 碳氫化合物……………………………………… 92 4. 5. 4 氧………………………………………………… 96 4. 5. 5 不同汽門間隙全負荷狀態下引擎轉速與CO、CO 2 、HC及O 2 含量之關係…………………………… 98 4. 5. 6 汽門間隙 0. 35 mm部分負荷與全負荷狀態下CO、 CO 2 、HC及O 2 含量之比較……………………… 105 伍、結論 ……………………………………………………… 109 陸、對今後研究工作之建議 ………………………………… 110 柒、參考文獻 ………………………………………………… 11...|$|R

These include: larger pistons, turbochargers, dual racing carburetors, fuel injection, and high performance cylinder heads. Some performance engines can run on premium unleaded gasoline.
