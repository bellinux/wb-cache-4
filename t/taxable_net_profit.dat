In {{this paper}} we present {{results of the}} {{research}} made between 2008 - 2010 {{on the effectiveness of}} soil fertilization with organic fertilizers and value cultivars tested, in terms of production. Experiences had been located in the experimental field of Jucu, CJ. We took four cultivation of artichokes in the study: “Unirea”, “Violet”, “Agrosel 656 ” and “Chişinău”. They were placed in the experimental field of Jucu- Cluj, made in two densities (3. 57 pl/sqm and 2. 38 pl/sqm) and three levels of fertilization (unfertilized, fertilized with 20 t/ha farmyard manure and 40 t/ha manure in the fall plowing). The sowing was performed manually in the artichokes nests (2 - 3 seeds/nest). The experience was located in four repetitions of 10 sqm. Biometric measurements were conducted at 10 plants in each plot experimental environments. Harvesting has been done manually with a sickle. Economic efficiency was established by calculating the following economic indicators: production per hectare achieved, value of trading, average price recovery, cost of production, cost per unit of product, <b>taxable</b> <b>profit,</b> <b>net</b> income + grants, rate is expressed as %, <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> + subsidy rate. From the cultivars studied, the highest <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> was obtained in cultivation Unirea (8, 976 lei/ha), followed by far by the Purple (6, 745 lei/ha). The main driver of profit was due to the production of plant material. From the three agrofunds, the ones fertilized with 40 t / ha manure {{turned out to be the}} most economically efficient of all cultivars due to higher production per hectare...|$|R

Variance in <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> margins, as a key number for profitability, for firms in this industry ranges by 60 %. As <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> margin is defined as <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> divided by revenue, these latter two directly affect <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> margin. Yet, leaving the obvious determining mathematical explanations aside, other factors might affect the profitability of the firms, showing, what distinguishes successful firms from less successful ones. This study is aiming at exploring the factors affecting the profitability of Swedish firms producing wooden single-family houses. By means of those factors, variances in <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> margins might be explained more thoroughly. Data from annual reports were collected from 52 firms in the industry and a correlation analysis performed.
