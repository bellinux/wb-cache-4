5|$|Metro relies {{extensively}} on passenger fares and appropriated financing from the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C. governments, which are represented on Metro's board of directors. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> {{not have a}} dedicated revenue stream as other cities' mass transit systems do. Critics allege that this has contributed to Metro's recent history of maintenance and safety problems.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their toes to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E
5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E
25|$|Finally, these {{variables}} describing <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>do</b> not change with time; i.e. it is a static system.|$|R
5000|$|... {{computational}} level: what <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>do</b> (e.g.: what problems does it solve or overcome) and similarly, {{why does}} it do these things ...|$|R
30|$|This {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that {{assessment}} is prescriptive, that is, <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> <b>do</b> not exist yet or for which no empirical data is available.|$|R
5|$|The system only {{applies to}} players {{currently}} under {{contract with a}} Japanese team, although players who have nine {{or more years of}} playing service with NPB are exempt. It does not apply to free agents or to amateur players who have never played in NPB. Mac Suzuki, Micheal Nakamura, Kazuhito Tadano, and Junichi Tazawa are the only Japanese players to have debuted in MLB without having played in NPB. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not work in reverse; it does not regulate MLB players, such as Alex Cabrera, who moved to NPB.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the inner ward contain {{extensive}} first floor passageways, similar to those at Caernarfon Castle. These were intended to allow members of the castle to move between the towers, accessing the guardrooms, sleeping chambers and the castle latrines. The latrines were designed to be drained by a special system using {{the water from the}} moat, but <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not appear to have worked well in practice. The six towers were intended to be three storeys high and contained fireplaces. The castle chapel was built into one of the towers and would have been used by the king and his family, rather than the wider garrison.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{maintenance}} {{is crucial to}} ensure that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not clog with sediments and that the desired infiltration rate is maintained. This includes checking and maintaining the pre-treatment by periodic inspections and cleaning of clogged material.|$|E
5000|$|... algorithmic/representational level: how <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>do</b> what it does, specifically, what {{representations}} does it use {{and what}} processes does it employ {{to build and}} manipulate the representations ...|$|R
50|$|The book {{claims that}} the elderly, minorities, and rural areas are all {{discriminated}} against in national <b>systems</b> and that <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> <b>do</b> not make care available based on need.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the user}} and <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>do</b> not have <b>the</b> {{same type of}} language, {{therefore}} to make possible the communication process, the interfaces must serve as intermediaries or translators between them.|$|R
25|$|Caste {{system in}} Jainism {{has existed for}} centuries, {{primarily}} in terms of endogamy, although, per Paul Dundas, in modern times <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not play a significant role. This is contradicted by Carrithers and Humphreys who describe the major Jain castes in Rajasthan with their social rank.|$|E
25|$|Certain computable ordinals are {{so large}} that while they can be given by a certain ordinal {{notation}} o, a given formal system might not be sufficiently powerful to show that o is, indeed, an ordinal notation: <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not show transfinite induction for such large ordinals.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} {{consists of}} five sets of double road wheels with torsion bar springs. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not have track return rollers. The forward and rearmost road wheels {{are equipped with}} hydraulic shock absorbers. On some of the tanks lightweight openwork road wheels were used.|$|E
30|$|Remark 2. Li [8] {{considered}} {{the stability of}} neutral type descriptor systems with constant time-delay, and <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>did</b> not include parameter uncertainty in the derivative of its state. So <b>the</b> <b>system</b> (1) is more widely in our article.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>did</b> {{not always}} {{function}} as intended and collisions, derailments and runaways were not unknown. The remains of several wrecked wagons still lie beside, or even some distance from, the incline formation.|$|R
50|$|Since the Redstone's {{automatic}} inflight abort {{sensing system}} was running in open-loop mode, the engine shutdown did not trigger an abort. However, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>did</b> report an abort condition, {{so it did}} function properly.|$|R
25|$|The ALUPEC {{comes close}} to a perfect phonetic system in that almost every letter {{represents}} only one sound and almost every sound is represented by only one letter. The vowels may have a graphic accent, but <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not consider letters with accents as separate letters.|$|E
25|$|In quantum mechanics, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> {{not follow}} a single path whose action is stationary, but the {{behavior}} of the system depends on all imaginable paths and the value of their action. The action corresponding to the various paths is used to calculate the path integral, that gives the probability amplitudes of the various outcomes.|$|E
25|$|If {{a system}} {{undergoes}} certain phase transformations while being heated, such as melting and vaporization, {{it may be}} observed that the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not change until the entire sample has completed the transformation. The energy introduced into the system while the temperature did not change is called a latent energy, or latent heat, in contrast to sensible heat, which is associated with temperature change.|$|E
50|$|This example {{assumes that}} dominoes {{toppling}} {{into each other}} behave deterministically. Even the above-mentioned external forces which might interrupt <b>the</b> <b>system</b> are causes which <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>did</b> not consider, but which {{could be explained by}} cause and effect in a larger deterministic system.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>did</b> {{not sell}} in large numbers. Radio Shack's next {{business}} system was {{an extension of}} the TRS-80 product line, the TRS-80 Model II, released in May 1979. The Tandy 10 was discontinued in late 1980.|$|R
50|$|The {{industrial}} design of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> followed Olivetti esthetic and functional standards. Cabinets were about 1 metre high and interconnected by overhead conduits, so <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>did</b> not require <b>the</b> raised floor of other mainframe designs. Each cabinet contained a subsystem (processor, memory, tape drives).|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> {{not make}} much use of fare zones aside from {{downtown}} zones in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where rides only cost $0.50. Fare transfer cards valid for 2.5 hours are available upon payment of fare. Only the Northstar commuter rail line charges fares based on distance. A number of discounted multiple-use transit pass options are available. In early 2007, the system introduced a {{contactless smart card}} (the Go-To card) for paying fares.|$|E
25|$|The {{technology}} allows non-digital {{objects to}} be used as input devices. In one example, a normal paint brush was used to create a digital painting in the software. This is made possible by the fact that, in using cameras for input, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not rely on restrictive properties required of conventional touchscreen or touchpad devices such as the capacitance, electrical resistance, or temperature of the tool used (see Touchscreen).|$|E
25|$|In a cyclic {{process in}} which <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> net work on its surroundings, it is {{observed}} to be physically necessary not only that heat be taken into the system, but also, importantly, that some heat leave the system. The difference is the heat converted by the cycle into work. In each repetition of a cyclic process, the net work done by the system, measured in mechanical units, {{is proportional to the}} heat consumed, measured in calorimetric units.|$|E
50|$|Several {{cryptographic}} tools, including secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, {{allow for}} the private computation of data on untrusted systems. Data in use could be operated upon while encrypted and never exposed to <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> processing.|$|R

30|$|From April 14 to 30, 18 {{earthquakes}} {{generated a}} seismic intensity of ≥ 5 L (JMA 2016), {{equal to the}} threshold of seismic intensity for warning issuance. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>did</b> not issue warnings for four out of the 18 earthquakes.|$|R
25|$|The ALUPEC is a {{phonetic writing}} {{system based on}} the Latin script and states only which letters {{should be used to}} {{represent}} each sound. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not establish rules for spelling (orthography). For that reason, Cape Verdean creole writing is not standardized; the same word or the same sentence may appear written in different ways. Cape Verdeans, then, write idiosyncratically — that is, each person writes {{in his or her own}} dialect, sociolect, and idiolect.|$|E
25|$|The French-American-British (FAB) {{classification}} system {{was published in}} 1976 to classify the leukaemias. It placed CMML {{into the category of}} MDS, along with the refractory anaemia, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts, refractory anaemia with excess blasts and refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> have clinical utility; however factors such as cytogenetic status are not within the remit of the classification. For this reason, many disease entities in these groups show a great deal of heterogeneity.|$|E
25|$|While a {{high level}} of {{autoimmunity}} is unhealthy, a low level of autoimmunity may actually be beneficial. Taking the experience of a beneficial factor in autoimmunity further, one might hypothesize with intent to prove that autoimmunity is always a self-defense mechanism of the mammal system to survive. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>does</b> not randomly lose the ability to distinguish between self and non-self, the attack on cells may be the consequence of cycling metabolic processes necessary to keep the blood chemistry in homeostasis.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: For {{the series}} The Starlost, the Magicam, a servo {{controlled}} dolly {{along with a}} secondary periscope camera filming a model background, was designed by Douglas Trumbull, however, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>did</b> not work reliably and blue screen effects were used.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> encomienda <b>system</b> in Spanish America {{differed}} from the Peninsular institution in that encomenderos did not own the land on which the natives lived. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>did</b> not entail any direct land tenure by the encomendero; Indian lands were {{to remain in the}} possession of their communities.|$|R
5000|$|... 1482. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>did</b> {{not come}} into wide use in Europe, however, until the {{invention}} of printing. (See, for example, the 1482 Ptolemaeus {{map of the world}} printed by Lienhart Holle in Ulm, and other examples in the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz, Germany.) ...|$|R
