In ยง 5. 2. 3, slide 23 (also shown below on the right), we saw the 3 -stage Clos network (and, before that, its specialization, the Benes network). There is an analogy [...] or even equivalence [...] between these two systems in circuit switching (the analogy carries over to packet switching, with TST becoming an input-queued or CIOQ crossbar, and Clos becoming a "Parallel Packet Switch " (PPS)). The analogy goes as follows. Each of the Clos middle-stage switches implements one time slot of the TST crossbar inside a frame; there are N 2 middle-stage switches in the Clos network, and there must be N 2 time slots in each frame of the crossbar in the <b>TST</b> <b>switch.</b> The role of each input TSI in the TST is to "switch " in time any connection, from the arbitrary time slot that it arrives at, to an arbitrary time slot when the crossbar is available to serve it; correspondingly, the role of each first-stage switch in the Clos is to switch "in space " any connection, from the arbitrary input port that it enters on, to an arbitrary middle-stage switch that is available to serve it. The general Clos fabric has N 1 first-stage switches, each of them of size INxN 2; and there are N 2 middle-stage switches, each of them of size N 1 xN 3. The corresponding TST system has N 1 input TSI's [...] one for each of the N 1 input ports of the crossbar; each input TSI receives a frame consisting of I...|$|E

In this exercise set we will study the way in which these input-TSI's should rearrange the incoming connections. To make it easier to think about the problem, we will formulate it using colors, as in figure 1. Colors, in our case, will correspond to outgoing links; in figure 1 there are n= 4 outgoing links, so there are n= 4 colors. For simplicity we will assume that the number of incoming links is also n, equal to the number of outgoing links, and that all liks have the same speed, hence the same number of slots in their frames [...] call this number m...|$|R
