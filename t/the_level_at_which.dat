5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Pallas has a moon. A moon about 1 kilometer in diameter was suggested based on occultation data from an occultation on 29 May 1978, and another one separated from Pallas by 750 kilometers and 175 kilometers in diameter itself was suggested in 1980, but later shown incorrect in 1983 occultation observations. Considering <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> Pallas has been studied and observed since it was discovered, it is unlikely that there are any large moons orbiting Pallas.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can be roughly classified according to <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements {{within a single}} machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers {{to work on the}} same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.|$|E

5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> advertisements are most effective.|$|E
5|$|With the pre-War team dispersed, {{the club}} {{struggled}} to reassert its {{dominance in the}} late 1940s and eventually suffered relegation to the Second Division under Cliff Britton in the 195051 season. After finishing second in the 195354 season, the club returned to the top tier of English football, <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> they have played ever since. In 1961, the club appointed Harry Catterick as manager who led the club to the league title again in both the 196263 and 196970 seasons, with the league successes punctuated by another FA Cup triumph, this time a 32 victory over Sheffield Wednesday at Wembley.|$|E

Grid-tied PV power systems can be divided into two main groups, namely centralized MPPT (CMPPT) and distributed MPPT (DMPPT). The DMPPT systems are further classified according to <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> MPPT can be applied, i. e. string, module, submodule, and cell level. Typical topologies for each category are also introduced, explained and analyzed.

40|$|This article {{provides}} a general {{overview of the}} intersecting fields of metaphor research and research on ‘nations’ and ‘the national’, reflecting on <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> metaphor is relevant {{to the study of}} these concepts. Many case studies concentrating on specific issues, such as EU integration, have demonstrated that metaphors play a role in constructing both national and supranational identities (see e. g., Marks 2004; Hülsse 2006; Musolff 2000 etc.). However, a general overview of <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> metaphors are relevant to the study of ‘the national’ is still lacking. This study addresses these levels by focusing on three topics: the banal reference to the nation as a personified individual and its possible implications, the family metaphor as the key metaphor that constitutes the nation and related concepts in public and nationalistic discourse, and the type and role of metaphors in scholarship concerned with nations...|$|R

25|$|Acetaldehyde is {{also created}} by thermal {{degradation}} or ultraviolet photo-degradation of some thermoplastic polymers {{during or after}} manufacture. One common example occurs when {{a bottle of water}} is left in a hot car for a few hours on a hot, sunny day, and one notices its strange sweet taste in the water from the breakdown of the polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) container. The water industry generally recognizes 20–40 ppb as the taste/odor threshold for acetaldehyde. <b>The</b> <b>level</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> an average consumer could detect acetaldehyde is still considerably lower than any toxicity.|$|E

25|$|Many 2010-era digital delays {{present an}} {{extensive}} array of options, including a {{control over the}} time before playback of the delayed signal. Most also allow the user to select the overall level of the processed signal {{in relation to the}} unmodified one, or <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the delayed signal is fed back into the buffer, to be repeated again. Some systems in the 2010s allow more exotic controls, such as the ability to add an audio filter, or to play back the buffer's contents in reverse. As digital memory became cheaper in the 1980s, units like Lexicon PCM42, Roland SDE-3000, TC Electronic 2290 offered above 3 seconds delay time, enough to create background loops, rhythms and phrases. The 2290 was upgradeable to 32 seconds and Electro-Harmonix offered a 16-second delay and looping machine.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the almost}} {{universal}} assumption to the contrary, the wastewater treatment facilities installed in December 1959 {{had no effect}} on the level of organic mercury being released into the Shiranui Sea. The pollution and the disease it caused continued to spread. The Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectural governments conducted a joint survey in late 1960 and early 1961 into the level of mercury in the hair of people living around the Shiranui Sea. The results confirmed that organic mercury had spread all around the inland sea and that people were still being poisoned by contaminated fish. Hundreds of people were discovered to have levels greater than 50 ppm of mercury in their hair, <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> people are likely to experience nerve damage.

25|$|In April 2011, the United States Department of Energy {{published}} {{projections of}} the radiation risks {{over the next year}} (that is, for the future) for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50kilometers from the plant. That is <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> relocation would be considered in the USA, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. However, natural radiation levels are higher {{in some parts of the}} world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the incident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.|$|E
