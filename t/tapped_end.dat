40|$|A {{pneumatic}} {{transfer system}} has been developed for use with series 100 Special Form {sup 252 }Cf. It was developed to reduce the exposure to personnel handling sources of {sup 252 }Cf with masses up to 150 {micro}g by permitting remotely activated two-way transfer between the storage container and the irradiation position. The pneumatic transfer system also permits transfers for reproducible repetitive irradiation periods. In addition to the storage container equipped with quick-release fittings, the transfer system consists of an irradiation station, a control box with momentary contact switches to activate the air-pressure control valves and indicators to identify {{the location of the}} source, and connecting air hose and electrical wire. A source of 20 psig air and 110 volt electrical power are required for operation of the transfer system which can be easily moved and set up by one individual in 5 to 10 minutes. Tests have shown that rarely does a source become lodged in the transfer tubing, but two methods have been developed to handle incomplete transfers of the {sup 252 }Cf source. The first method consists of closing one air vent to allow a pressure impulse to propel the source to the opposite side. The second method applies to those {sup 252 }Cf capsules with a threaded or <b>tapped</b> <b>end</b> to which a small ferromagnetic piece can be attached; an incompletely transferred source in the transfer tube can then be guided to a position of safety by surrounding the transfer tubing containing the capsule with a horseshoe magnet attached {{to the end of a}} long pole...|$|E

40|$|Solution searching {{devices that}} {{operate on the}} basis of {{controlling}} the spatiotemporal dynamics of excitation transfer via dressed photon interactions between quantum dots have been proposed. Long-range excitation transfer based on dressed photon interactions between randomly distributed quantum dots is considered to be effective in realizing such devices. Here, we successfully controlled the spatiotemporal dynamics of excitation transfer using a Y-junction structure consisting of randomly dispersed CdSe/ZnS core-shell quantum dots. This Y-junction structure has two “output ends” and one “tap end. ” By exciting one output end with control light, we observed increased excitation transfer to the other output end via a state-filling effect. Conversely, we observed reduced excitation transfer to the output ends by irradiating the <b>tap</b> <b>end</b> with control light, due to excitation of defect levels in the <b>tap</b> <b>end.</b> These results show the possibility of controlling the optical excitation transfer dynamics between multiple quantum dots...|$|R

5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, stud bolts a.k.a studs are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded Stud Bolts", [...] "Tap End Stud Bolts", and [...] "Double End Stud Bolts". Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded studs have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. <b>Tap</b> <b>end</b> studs have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end stud bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully threaded studs with chamfered ends, and double end studs with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For studs that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|R

5000|$|Stark {{is known}} for the feature 24 Years at the <b>Tap</b> <b>End,</b> in which he reads {{excerpts}} from his [...] "autobography" [...] (a joke pronunciation of autobiography used on the show). He was originally inspired to write his own autobiography after reading the autobiography of Brendan Sheerin from Coach Trip. The title refers to his on-air realisation, at age 24, {{that he had been}} sitting at the wrong end of the bath his whole life. The first episode aired on 11 November 2011. In this episode, Stark revealed that his parents had originally planned to name him [...] "Padraig". Throughout the series, Stark recounts memorable events from his [...] "years at the tap end" [...] which often include mistakes made and life lessons learned through adventures with his friends. The second series of the show concluded in 2013, with no plans for a third. However, a one-off special aired in January 2014 as part of a comedy night on Radio One. This late night edition, Tap End: Unplugged, aired live In front of a studio audience and featured a live rendition of the theme tune. The late airing allowed Stark to reveal the full story of a holiday to Prague he had discussed in a previous episode, telling parts which were considered [...] "too rude for daytime" [...] and using strong language.|$|R

40|$|Insulation defect {{detection}} in time ensures higher {{operational reliability}} of power system assets. Power transformers {{are the most}} critical unit of power systems both from economical and operational front. Hence it becomes necessary to have knowledge of the actual insulation condition of transformer to increase dependability of the system. The performance and ageing of the transformer insulation is mainly affected by Partial discharges (PD). Proper diagnosis in terms of amplitude and location of partial discharge in a power transformer enables us to predict well in advance, with much confidence, the defect in insulation system, which avoids large catastrophic failures. In this work a 20 kVA, 230 / 50 kV single phase core type transformer is used for evaluation of the transfer function-based partial discharge detection and location using modeling of the winding, using design data. The simulation of capturing on-line PD pulses across the bushing tap capacitor is done for various tap positions. Standard PD source model is used to inject PD pulse signal at 10 tap locations in the winding and corresponding response signatures are captured at the bushing <b>tap</b> <b>end</b> (across 1000 pF). The equivalent high frequency model of the winding {{is derived from the}} design parameters using analytical calculations and simulations in packages such as MAGNET and ANSOFT. The test conditions are simulated using ORCAD- 9 and the results are evaluated for location accuracy using design parameter based PD monitoring method. ...|$|R
