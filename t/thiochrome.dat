In all those studies, ThTP was separated from other thiamine derivatives using a paper chromatographic method, followed by oxidation in fluorescent <b>thiochrome</b> compounds with ferricyanide in alkaline solution.

40|$|Methods for the {{separation}} and estimation of thiamine, thiamine monophosphate and thiamine diphosphate {{which would be}} applicable to biological extracts were investigated. Two methods for the estimation of thiamine were compared, the acid dye method and the <b>thiochrome</b> method. The <b>thiochrome</b> method was preferred as the acid dye method was more difficult to perform and some interference by certain amino acids was indicated. As both methods only estimate free thiamine, the optimum conditions for hydrolysis of thiamine phosphate esters by wheat germ acid phosphatase were also investigated. High phosphatase concentrations in the digestion mixture interfered with the extraction of <b>thiochrome,</b> by isobutanol, after oxidation of the free thiamine produced. Variation of the buffer in which the digestion was performed also affected the recoveries obtained. The inclusion of magnesium ions in the digestion mixture increased {{the activity of the}} enzyme so {{that it was possible to}} use an amount of phosphatase which was low enough to avoid interference with the extraction of <b>thiochrome</b> but which was sufficient to completely hydrolyse thiamine phosphate esters. The presence of magnesium ions also prevented the interference observed when formate rather than acetate buffers were used in the digestion mixture. A variety of separation techniques were investigated. Compared to paper and thin layer chromatography, high voltage paper electrophoresis (at 3 kV in pH 3. 5 buffer) gave the best and quickest separations. However only a 60 % recovery was obtained after samples were eluted from the paper with 0. 1 M hydrochloric acid. Separation was achieved by elution of the <b>thiochrome</b> derivatives of thiamine, TMP and TDP from Sephadex G 10 gel. Recoveries, estimated spectrophotometrically, indicated that this method could be used for the quantitative separation of thiamine and its phosphate esters. However since the method does not allow concentration of samples, it would be unsuitable for the estimation of biological extracts. Separation of thiamine and its esters using three ion exchange resins was also investigated. Partial separation of thiamine and its phosphate esters was obtained with Amberlite GC 50 resin, {{the separation}} being determined by the form of the resin used. The hydrogen form of the resin allowed separation between TDP and thiamine-TMP while the sodium form separated thiamine from TMP-TDP. Neither form of the resin bound TDP firmly even when water was used as the eluent, so that separation of TDP and TTP would not be possible. Separation was attempted by eluting samples from Dowex 1 -X 8 resin with formate buffers of increasing ionic strength or pH. While the separation of thiamine, TMP and TDP appeared to be complete, by the elution profile, it was found that sample breakdown occurred. Electrophoresis of the eluted samples showed that the only peak which contained a single component was that corresponding to thiamine. Sample break-down was further indicated by a low recovery obtained when a sample containing only TDP was eluted. Identification of the peak contaminants was attempted using high voltage electrophoresis but proved difficult due to salt retardation affecting the positions of the peak components after electrophoresis. With Dowex 50 resin TDP and TMP were easily separated and eluted with ammonium acetate buffer of varying pH and ionic strength but the elution of thiamine required high pH or ionic strength solutions. Sample breakdown also appeared to occur on elution of samples from the resin. When TMP and TDP were eluted, separation appeared to be complete but a recovery of greater than 100 % was obtained for TMP and both eluted compounds exhibited a progressive breakdown after elution. Sample breakdown was particularly notable when thiamine alone was eluted as 2 peaks were eluted and, after oxidation, yellow fluorescent material as well as the usual blue (characteristic of <b>thiochrome)</b> was observed. Characterisation of the yellow fluorescent compound(s) was attempted using electrophoresis, ultra-violet spectra and fluorescent spectra and it was found to be similar, but not identical, to thiamine...|$|E

Addition of chloramphenicol and cycloheximide to the assay medium suppressed bacterial and yeast contamination and enabled tests to be automated without recourse to aseptic procedures. Evaluation of the assay included precision analysis and estimation of thiamin recovery. Results obtained on red cell extracts were compared with an established colorimetric (<b>thiochrome)</b> method. RESULTS [...] Acceptable intrabatch and interbatch precision was obtained and good recovery of thiamin added to serum was obtained. Non-parametric reference ranges {{based on the results}} from 505 healthy people were: serum thiamin 11. 3 - 35. 0 nmol/l and red cell thiamin 190 - 400 nmol/l.

40|$|THREE {{methods have}} been {{described}} for the estimation of aneurin. Firstly, a biological method, first used by Meiklejohn (1937) and subse-quently modified by Sinclair (1938). This method is used on blood-plasma and depends {{on the ability of}} a fungus to grow only in the presence of •aneurin. In Sinclair's hands the test has attained a considerable degree of accuracy, but the method is a delicate one, requiring much experience in the interpretation of the results, so that ' it is improbable that it will become a routine laboratory method. Secondly, the rat bradycardia method, first used in estimating the vitamin Bx content of the urine by Harris and Leong (1936). This method also is not suitable for routine use. Thirdly, the thio-chrome method, first used by Jansen (1936) for estimating aneurin in yeast extract, and subsequently modified by Westenbrink and Goudsmit (1937 a) for detecting this substance in the urine. The basis of the method is the oxidation of the vitamin to <b>thiochrome,</b> which is then estimated by means of its blue-violet fluorescence in ultra-violet light. A blank must be deter-mined to allow for the presence of fluorescent substances in the original urine. Modifications of the method have been described by Karrer (1937), Ritsert (1938), and others.

40|$|A CHEMICAL {{method for}} the {{estimation}} of thiamin (vitamin Bi), should have the advantages, as compared to biological assay, of speed, accuracy, cheapness, and ease of performance. The great advantage of biological assay is definite specificity. However, under well controlled conditions the uncertainties of chemical assay may become negligible. Of the several methods proposed for the chemical estimation of thiamin, the <b>thiochrome</b> method of Jansen * has received the most attention. Re-cently, the method of Prebluda and McCollum 2 as modified by Melnick and Field 3 {{has been shown to}} possess a high degree of specificity and accuracy, but the technic as described seems too complex for ordinary clinical purposes. Schultz et al. 4 have developed a fermentation test for vitamin Bx which ap-parently is rapid and sufficiently specific for most purposes. The phycomyces growth method of Schopfer, 5 applied to various ma-terials by Meiklejohn, 6 Bonner, 7 and Rowlands, 8 may prove to be of con-siderable value as a comparatively simple method of biological assay suitable for clinical investigation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to relate experiences with the <b>thiochrome</b> method as applied to urine in study of the metabolism of thiamin in normal and thiamin deficient subjects, with special attention to the possibility of diagnosis of thiamin deficiency states.

It is shown that this thiamine and its main katabolit - tiohrom, can increase levels of RNA in the blood as without and with the presence of exogenous nucleotides [...] At the same time, it was noted that the introduction into the environment of nucleotides showed a more positive effect. It was found that other metabolites of thiamine do not significantly affect the biosynthesis of RNA. It was also noted that in the liver of white rats after the introduction of vitamin B 1 and its metabolites, changes occur from the second hour of the study, and in four hours only thiamine and <b>thiochrome</b> have a positive effect. In the rat brain, the positive effect was recorded only after administration of <b>thiochrome.</b> According to the study, it was found that <b>thiochrome</b> had the greatest effect on the content of RNA, a less favorable effect was observed in the introduction of thiamine. At that time, other metabolites of thiamine did not show a positive effect, which makes it possible to consider them ineffective when exposed to the content of RNA.

40|$|Vitamin B 1 (thiamin) is a {{cofactor}} {{for critical}} enzymatic processes and is scarce in surface oceans. Several eukaryotic marine algal species thought {{to rely on}} exogenous thiamin are now known to grow equally well on the precursor 4 -amino- 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -methylpyrimidine (HMP), including the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi. Because the thiamin biosynthetic capacities of the diverse and ecologically important haptophyte lineage are otherwise unknown, we investigated the pathway in transcriptomes and two genomes from 30 species representing six taxonomic orders. HMP synthase is missing in data from all studied taxa, but the pathway is otherwise complete, with some enzymatic variations. Experiments on axenic species from three orders demonstrated that equivalent growth rates were supported by 1  µM HMP or thiamin amendment. Cellular thiamin quotas were quantified in the oceanic phytoplankter E. huxleyi using the <b>thiochrome</b> assay. E.  huxleyi exhibited luxury storage in standard algal medium [(1. 16 ± 0. 18) × 10 − 6  pmol thiamin cell− 1], whereas quotas in cultures grown under more environmentally relevant thiamin and HMP supplies [(2. 22 ± 0. 07) × 10 − 7 or (1. 58 ± 0. 14) × 10 − 7  pmol thiamin cell− 1, respectively] were significantly lower than luxury values and prior estimates.

Overall nutrition was similar in all groups as assessed by anthropometry, and no patient had clinical evidence of thiamine deficiency. There {{was no significant difference}} among the groups in mean concentration of any form of thiamine. The scatter was much greater in patients with alcoholic liver disease but only 8. 7 % had biochemical thiamine deficiency (defined as a blood concentration of the active coenzyme greater than 2 SD below the mean control value). An unexpected finding was of abnormally high total thiamine concentrations (greater than 2 SD above the mean control value) in 17. 4 % of patients with alcoholic liver disease, the highest concentrations being found in two patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. The ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated thiamine was calculated as an index of phosphorylation and, although the mean did not differ significantly among the groups, the range was greatest in alcoholic liver disease. The lowest ratios occurred in the two patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, but neither had evidence of thiamine pyrophosphate deficiency. Contrary to studies using indirect assay techniques, these results suggest that thiamine deficiency is unusual in well nourished patients with alcoholic liver disease. The new finding of unexpectedly high thiamine concentrations in some patients may be due to abnormalities of hepatic storage or release in liver disease, particularly in severe alcoholic hepatitis.

40|$|Graduation date: 1950 The blood {{thiamine}} {{concentration of}} 11 subjects {{was determined by}} means of the Friedemann and Kmieciak (1943) method every 5 days during a 30 -day experimental period. Study I was conducted on 5 students in 1947 and Study II was conducted on 6 students in 1948. The subjects in both studies were on diets in which their intake of ascorbic acid only was controlled. A record was kept of each subjects food intake. The daily values for total Calories, non-fat Calories and thiamine in the diet were obtained from food tables. Non-fat Calories, the ratio of non-tat Calories to total Calories, thiamine to 1000 Calories and thiamine to non-fat Calories were calculated. The blood thiamine values for the subjects in Study I (all girls) ranged from 4. 91 to 10. 85 mcg per cent. There was a general decrease throughout the study in the mean intake of thiamine expressed in terms of mcg per 1000 Calories and mcg per 1000 non-fat Calories. The greater the decrease in thiamine intake in terms of mcg per 1000 non-fat Calories the greater was the loss of blood thiamine. The values for thiamine in the blood of the boys in Study II ranged from 8. 00 to 15. 32 mcg per cent and for the one girl in Study II from 8. 35 to 13. 93 mcg per cent. The blood thiamine values for the subjects in Study II did not indicate the same relationship to thiamine intake as did those in Study I. There was an increase in the concentration of the thiamine in the blood even though there was a decrease in the mean thiamine intake from the beginning {{to the end of the}} experiment. It would appear, therefore, that the boys obtained sufficient thiamine throughout the 30 -day period. No data have been obtained which indicate whether or not there are variations from day to day in the concentration of thiamine in the blood when subjects are maintained on a constant intake of thiamine. A metabolism study using 5 adult women as subjects was planned in order to determine the daily values for thiamine in the blood when subjects were maintained on a controlled diet for a period of 52 days. An unpublished micro-method for the determination of thiamine in the blood developed by Dr. H. Burch (1948) was to be used. The experimental diet consisted of a basal diet providing approximately 1000 Calories and 300 mcg of thiamine with additions to the basal diet planned in units providing approximately 500 Calories and 150 mcg of thiamine. The values for protein, fat, carbohydrate and total Calories were obtained, from food tables. Non-fat Calories were calculated and the thiamine content of the food was determined by analysis. All 5 subjects ate the same food each day. In spite of the fact that considerable preliminary work was performed before the study started the blood thiamine values obtained in the nutrition laboratory were always significantly lower than results obtained by other workers. It was decided to freeze the blood samples after the protein had been removed and work on certain aspects of the method before any analyses of the blood thiamine were made. Further study of the Burch method included variation in the amounts of potassium acetate used, use of different trichloroacetic acid reagents, tests for enzyme activity, variations in the incubation procedure, variations in the procedure for the oxidation to <b>thiochrome</b> and in the extraction of <b>thiochrome,</b> reading samples sooner after transfer to optically matched tubes, variations in the irradiation procedure, use of all new reagents, use of another micro-photofluorometer, development of standard curves and the determination of the response of two subjects to an oral test dose of thiamine hydrochloride.

40|$|A {{modification}} of the AOAC method for thiamin determination utilizing reversed phase (RP) C 18 packing material was developed for analysis of milk, infant formula and breakfast cereal products. Thiamin was extracted from food samples and hydrolyzed following a similar Association of official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) (1984) procedure. The sample filtrate was purified by passing through the reversed phase C 18 column. An isocratic mobile phase consisting of 3 % KCl and methanol (70 : 30) was used to elute thiamin from the reversed phase C 18 column. The sample eluate was oxidized to <b>thiochrome</b> and quantified on a fluorometer using similar AOAC procedure. The experimental technique was compared to the existing AOAC (1984) method, which employs a Bio-Rex 70 resin in the purification step of thiamin analysis. There {{was no significant difference}} in the thiamin content of the samples determined by the two methods. However, there was significant difference in the recovery of thiamin, when taken through the method or added to food samples before extraction. The recoveries of the added thiamin were 97. 97 ± 0. 69 % and 92. 67 ± 1. 25 % for RP C 18 and AOAC (1984), respectively, the coefficient of variation was 0. 70 % and 1. 34 % for RP c 18 and AOAC (1984) methods respectively. (1984.), respectively, the coefficient of variation was 0. 70 % and 1. 34 % for RP C 18 and AOAC (1984) methods respectively. The RP C 18 method was found to be better than the AOAC (1984) method in terms of accuracy, precision, and reproduciblity. And the RP C 18 proved to be faster than the AOAC ((1984) method. There was no difference in the cost of the two methods. Analysis for thiamin in the two infant formulas used in this study, gave values that were 132. 37 % and 202. 90 % of the declared levels, while thiamin content of breakfast cereal was 210. 33 % of the declared level...|$|E
40|$|Khoa/Khava/Mava {{refers to}} the {{partially}} dehydrated whole milk product prepared by the continuous heating of milk. Nutrient composition of khoa {{is important because it}} goes into the preparation of several indigenous sweet-meats. In the present study the nutrient composition of market khoa samples were analysed. These were compared with the nutrient composition of laboratory khoa samples prepared from pure cow milk or buffalo milk. MATERIALS AND METHODS Market samples-A total of 6 market samples of khcsa were purchased (1 sample from the local area i. e. Vallabh Vidyanagar, 2 samples from the neighbouring Anancl city, 1 sample from Barocla city and 2 samples from Ahmedabad city). These were analysed for the nutrient content. Laboratory samples-Laboratory samples of khoa were prepared from pure cow milk as well as from pure buffalo milk. Preparation of khoa in the laboratory essentially included boiling of SOOgms of whole milk in a stainless steel vessel on a gas stove with constant stirring (approx. 45 minutes) until a solid mass was formed. The samples were cooled and used freshly for analysis. Nutrient composition-The 6 market samples and 2 laboratory samples (one-from cow milk and the other from buffalo milk) of khoa were analysed for their proximate composition, mineral and vitamin content. Moisture was analysed by the standard AQAC (1984) 1 method while total solids was calculated as 100 minus moisture content. Carbohydrate estimation was carried out by the anthrone method (Plummer 1990) 2, fat content was determined by the standard AOAC (1984) method while protein estimation was carried out by the micro Kjeldahl method (Oser 1976) 3 Ash content was determined by the standard AOAC method (1984) 1. Calcium was determined by the titrimetric method of Clark and Col lip (1928) while phosphorus was estimated by the colorimeteric method of Fiske and Subbaroa (1925) 5.

40|$|The {{failure of}} adrenalectomized mice {{to respond to}} {{thyroxine}} {{by an increase in}} oxygen uptake was not reversed by intramuscular injections of thiamine. Thiamine-deficient mice were found to be incapable of respond-ing to thyroxine by an increase in the metabolic rate. introduction It is well known that the injection of thyroxine into animals and birds will be followed, after a latent period, by an increase in the basal metabolic rate. Two patho¬ logical states are known in which this action of thyroxine is absent: it is not observed in pigeons suffering from thiamine deficiency (Rubino & Pennetti, 1957) nor in adrenal¬ ectomized mice (Ganju & Lockett, 1958). The object {{of the present study was}} to discover whether deficiency of thiamine abolishes the effect of thyroxine on the oxygen consumption of mice, as in birds, and to discover whether the decreased oxygen consumption of adrenalectomized mice and their failure to respond to thyroxine are related to an inability to make full use of the thiamine supplied (Marchetti, Montari & Rossi, 1955). METHODS Male white mice, weighing 20 - 30 g., were divided into groups which were kept separately in standard Boots type cages in a single room under similar conditions of lighting, temperature (21 - 24 ° c) and humidity. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed as described by Ganju & Lockett (1958). Sham operations differed only in that the adrenals were left untouched. Diet. Unoperated and sham-operated mice drank water; adrenalectomized mice drank 0 - 4 % NaCl (w/v) in water. Diet 41 b of Stein was supplied, when used, in wire baskets. The thiamine-deficient diet consisted of: dextrinized starch 60 %; casein 23 %; corn oil 6 %; dried liver powder (thiamine 7 µg. |g., as determined by <b>thiochrome</b> method, supplied by Oxo Laboratories Ltd) 5 %; U. S. P. XII salt mixture (no. 2) 4 %. Weighed amounts of bulk diet were mixed daily with water containing added vitamins to yield a stiffpaste which was supplied in hanging troughs...|$|E
40|$|As a {{disulfide}} form B(1), namely, thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryldisulfide (TTFD) possessing tetrahydrofurfuryl group, {{has been}} synthesized on {{the heel of}} alkyldisulfide form B(1) derivatives such as thiamine propyldisulfide (TPD) and thiamine oxyethyldisulfide (TOED), etc, the author with purpose to compare B(1) -effects not only of TTFD, but also of TPD and TOED, carried {{out a series of}} experiments on the prevention of B(1) deficiency in lovebirds. For the test animals 28 lovebirds weighing about 12 g each and fed on the routine feed for one week were divided into 5 groups, and they were then fed on B(1) deficient standard feed. One group was taken as the control, and each of four other groups was daily fed orally on 0. 006 μM of B(1), TPD, TOED and TTFD respectively at a given time for 16 - 17 days. Next, the daily dose of each was cut down to 0. 003 μM, and the daily body weight and the length of survival time were recorded. The dose of 0. 006 μM is equivalent to about 2 γ B(1). The experiments were repeated twice, and in the second series tow birds selected from each group on the eleventh day, namely, on the day just before the vitamin B(1) -deficient group died of cramps, were sacrificed, and the total B(1) contents in the liver, heart and brain were estimated. The quantitative analysis of B(1) was carried out by the <b>thiochrome</b> method and estimated by Coleman's fluorescent spectroscope. The duration of survival in the B(1) -deficient group was on the average of 8. 8 days, while that given B(1), TPD, and TTFD was on the average of 16. 4, 202, and 17. 0 days respectively. The total B(1) -contents in the organs were 59. 0 γ, 119. 0 μ, and 79. 6 γ in the liver, heart and brain respectively. In the groups administered B(1), TPD, and TTFD, the contents in the liver of each were 259. 1 γ, 251. 1 γ, and 206. 2 γ; in the heart, 289. 2 γ, 242. 3 γ, and 228. 5 γ; and in the brain, 135. 2 γ, 145. 6 γ and 121. 9 γ respectively. Among the groups given B 1 -derivative there is no significant difference, but the groups given B(1), the B(1) -content of the heart is somewhat greater while the B(1) -contents of the liver, heart and brain in TTFD group were slightly lower than in other groups. 1. From these it has been confirmed that TPD, TOED, and TTFD like B(1) all prolong the span of life and show the effect preventing B(1) deficiency. 2. Among them the preventive effect of TPD is most marked, while the other B(1) -derivatives show the effect not greatly different from that of B(1). 3. On estimating values of B(1) -contents in the organs of the each gruop on the eleventh day, the tissue B(1) -contents of the liver, heart and brain in TTFD group were somewhat less than these in B(1) -group or in TPD group...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Improvements in {{instrumentation}} for fluorometric kinetic {{measurements and}} the application of a new intensified diode array (IDA) rapid scanning system to low level transient fluorescence measurements are reported. This instrumentation is applied to a new fluorometric kinetic method for thiamine (TM). Modifications to the existing fluorometric reation rate instrument include a mechanical arm to reproducibly position a reagent delivery tube over the sample cell. Also a new circuit provides a trigger signal which synchronizes the reagent delivery from an automatic dispenser with the rate measurement. A new KIM ratemeter was designed and constructed which uses only a single board microcomputer and a minimum of external hardware to acquire and store up to 100 data points and to perform rate or signal magnitude calculations. A significant advantage of the KIM ratemeter is that, since the data are stored in memory, the data may be reexamined and further calculations performed after the experiment is over. The software programmability of the KIM ratemeter provides greater flexibility of measurement times and functions than a hardwired ratemeter. Data points can represent time periods from 0. 25 s to 64 s. The time between data points is between 64 μs and 0. 44 s depending on the variables selected. Subroutines to perform a hexidecimal to BCD conversion and hardware to output the numbers to a digital printer are described. The IDA system is composed of the commercial IDA detector, an in house control module, a PDP 11 / 20 computer, and software. The IDA system can obtain spectra from 200 - 800 nm in as little as 5 ms, or 15 ms when the data are stored in the computer. The IDA detector was characterized and S/N expressions are presented. The design of the control module, computer interface, and interactive BASIC and assembly language programs are described. Using the IDA system under software control one can automatically store data from any portion of a spectrum, control integration times, acquire multiple spectra which may be added together or stored separately, and time periods between integrations. Spectra may be displayed and manipulated on the graphics terminal and added or subtracted. Also summations, means, standard deviations, and rates of change of signals in specific wavelength regions of the spectra may be calculated. Results of the application of this system to situations involving only test equipment or to real analytical situations are presented. A new fluorometric kinetic method for thiamine in which thiamine reacts with Hg(II) to form fluorescent <b>thiochrome</b> (TC) is presented. An extensive absorption study of the reactions of thiamine in basic aqueous solutions is described which provides evidence of the formation of Hg(II) complexes with thiamine. The results of an extensive interference study of species in multivitamin tablets and of the successful analysis of multivitamin and cereal samples are presented. The kinetic method for thiamine has a dynamic range of over four orders of magnitude, a detection limit of 2 x 10 ⁻⁹ M, and is faster and simpler than the standard method. The IDA system was used to study cereal and urine matrices and provided information impossible or very difficult to obtain with a typical scanning monochromator. The IDA system was also applied to a novel simultaneous analysis of thiamine and riboflavin involving both steady state and kinetic fluorescence measurements. The multichannel, computer control, and data storage capabilities of the IDA system were used to automatically initiate the reaction, and time and acquire successive spectra from which both the steady state fluorescence of riboflavin and the thiamine reaction rate are obtained...|$|E
