25|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, an {{indifference}} graph is an undirected graph constructed by assigning a real number to each vertex and connecting two vertices by an edge when their numbers are within one unit of each other. Indifference graphs are also the intersection graphs of sets of unit intervals, or of properly nested intervals (intervals none of which contains any other one). Based on <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> interval representations, these graphs are also called unit interval graphs or proper interval graphs; they form a subclass of the interval graphs.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{optimism}} bias occurs for both positive events, such as believing oneself {{to be more}} financially successful than others, and negative events, such as being {{less likely to have}} a drinking problem, there is more research and evidence suggesting that the bias is stronger for negative events. Different consequences result from <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> events: positive events often lead to feelings of well being and self-esteem, while negative events lead to consequences involving more risk, such as engaging in risky behaviors and not taking precautionary measures for safety.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{micelles}} {{was introduced to}} describe the core-corona aggregates of small surfactant molecules, however it has also extended to describe aggregates of amphiphilic block copolymers in selective solvents. It {{is important to know}} the difference between these two systems. The major difference between <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> aggregates is in the size of their building blocks. Surfactant molecules have a molecular weight which is generally of a few hundreds of grams per mole while block copolymers are generally one or two orders of magnitude larger. Moreover, thanks to the larger hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, block copolymers can have a much more pronounced amphiphilic nature when compared to surfactant molecules.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} {{of the existence of}} an ordinary line can also be posed for points in the real projective plane RP2 instead of the Euclidean plane. The Euclidean plane {{can be viewed as a}} subset of the projective plane, but the additional points and lines of the projective plane do not change the problem, as any finite set of projective points can be transformed into a Euclidean point set without changing its set of ordinary lines. Therefore, any pattern of intersecting points and lines that exists in one of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> plane also exists in the other. However, the projective viewpoint allows certain configurations to be described more easily.|$|E

One example of paired-associate JOLs is the cue-target JOL, where the subject determines the retrievability of the target when both the cue and target of the to-be-learned pair are presented. Another example is the cue-only JOL, where the subject must determine the retrievability of the target when only the cue is presented {{at the time of}} judgment. <b>These</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> JOLs differ in their accuracy in predicting future performance, and delayed judgments tend to be more accurate.|$|E
25|$|Endogenous/natural AAS like {{testosterone}} and DHT {{and synthetic}} AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On {{the basis of}} animal bioassays, {{the effects of these}} agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. Dissociation between the ratios of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> effects is observed in rat bioassays with various AAS relative to the ratio observed with testosterone. Explanations for the dissociation include differences in intracellular metabolism, functional selectivity (recruitment of coactivators), and non-genomic mechanisms (i.e., signaling through non-AR membrane androgen receptors, or mARs). Support for the latter two explanations is limited and more hypothetical, but there is a good deal of support for the intracellular metabolism explanation.|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} the transverse and time-time {{components of the}} instantaneous gluon propagator in Coulomb gauge QCD by using an SU(3) quenched lattice simulation on isotropic and anisotropic lattices. We find that the gluon propagators suffer from strong discretization effects on the isotropic lattice; on the other hand, those on the anisotropic lattices give a better scaling. Moreover, on <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> lattices the transverse parts are significantly suppressed in the infrared region and have a turnover at about 500 [MeV]. The high resolution to the temporal direction due to the anisotropy yields small discretization errors for the time-time gluon propagators, which also show an infrared enhancement as expected in the Gribov-Zwanziger confinement scenario.

25|$|The quantum key {{distribution}} protocols described above provide Alice and Bob with nearly identical shared keys, and also with {{an estimate of the}} discrepancy between the keys. These differences can be caused by eavesdropping, but also by imperfections in the transmission line and detectors. As it is impossible to distinguish between <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> errors, guaranteed security requires the assumption that all errors are due to eavesdropping. Provided the error rate between the keys is lower than a certain threshold (20% as of April 2007), two steps can be performed to first remove the erroneous bits and then reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrary small value. These two steps are known as information reconciliation and privacy amplification respectively, and were first described in 1992.|$|E

There are shared variables between the two concepts, involving the flow of time, i.e., temporal in nature, and involving motion (on the part of either the artist or subject), spatial in nature.|$|E
25|$|An {{external}} stimulus {{is required}} in order to trigger the differentiation of the meristem into a flower meristem. This stimulus will activate mitotic cell division in the meristem, particularly on its sides where new primordia are formed. This same stimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a developmental pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems. The main difference between <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> meristem, apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled) phyllotaxis, that is, the absence of stem elongation among the successive whorls or verticils of the primordium. These verticils follow an acropetal development, giving rise to sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Another difference from vegetative axillary meristems is that the floral meristem is «determined», which means that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer divide.|$|E

25|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{inertial}} forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is subjected to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities, in {{what is known as}} a boundary layer {{in the case of a}} bounding surface such as the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of higher velocity fluid, such as the hot gases from a flame in air. This relative movement generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing turbulent flow. Counteracting this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which as it increases, progressively inhibits turbulence, as more kinetic energy is absorbed by a more viscous fluid. The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> forces for given flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular situation.|$|E
25|$|Identity synergy principle: The {{fact that}} the {{personal}} and social selves can be activated independently {{raises the possibility that}} they may combine synergistically to motivate pro-group behavior. Consistent with this possibility, {{studies have shown that the}} activation of either the personal self or social self amplifies the willingness of strongly fused persons to behave in a pro-group fashion. For example, activating the personal self by ostracizing participants from the group based on their personal preferences, or activating the social self by ostracizing participants based on their group membership, resulted in the amplification of endorsement of pro-group action for strongly, but not weakly, fused individuals. Thus, unlike social identity theory which assumes that the personal self does not play a role in pro-group behavior, fusion theory holds that pro-group behaviors are motivated by both the personal and social selves and <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge may sometimes work together.|$|E

Two of these permits allow for the relocation of gopher tortoises, either to some other place on the site being used for construction, or to a recipient site which has been certified by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The third type of permit allows for temporary relocation of tortoises while major utility lines are installed. In the third case, the tortoises are returned to their habitat after construction is complete.|$|E
