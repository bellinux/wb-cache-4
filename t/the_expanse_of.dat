Although Tayloe {{preferred}} {{to live at}} Windsor, his estate in King George County, Virginia, his wife asked that they move into the city, where she was more comfortable. The house was constructed on Lots 10 and 11 in Square 221. At {{the time of the}} building's construction in 1828, <b>the</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> the city from 15th Street NW (one block east of the home) to 17th Street NW from the White House north to H Street NW was a flat field bare of trees and shrubs.|$|E
5|$|The word afternoon, which {{derives from}} after and noon, has been attested from {{about the year}} 1300; Middle English {{contained}} both afternoon and the synonym aftermete. The standard locative marking for the word was at afternoon in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries but has shifted to in the afternoon since then. In Southern U.S. and Midland American English, the word evening is sometimes used to encompass all times between noon and night. The Irish language contains four different words to mark time intervals from late afternoon to nightfall, this period being considered mystical. Metaphorically, the word afternoon refers to a relatively late period in <b>the</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> time or in one's life.|$|E
5|$|Endemic to South Africa, the bluebuck was {{confined}} to the southwestern Cape. A 2003 study estimated <b>the</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> the historic range of the bluebuck at , mainly along the southern coast of South Africa; fossils, however, have been discovered in a broader area that includes the southern and western CFR and even the highlands of Lesotho. Historical records give a rough estimate of its range. On 20January 1774, Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg recorded a sighting in Tigerhoek, Mpumalanga. In March or April 1783, Levalliant claimed to have witnessed two specimens in Soetemelksvlei, Western Cape. Based on these notes, a 2009 study by the South African zoologist Graham I. H. Kerley and colleagues estimated {{the range of the}} bluebuck to be limited within a triangular area in the Western Cape, bounded by Caledon to the west, Swellendam to the northeast and Bredasdorp to the south. Rock paintings in the Caledon river valley of the Free State province in eastern South Africa have been identified as bluebucks, which also confirms the once wider distribution of the species.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by {{the governments of the}} respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at <b>the</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> the third country which imports the good.|$|E
5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the dining room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located {{on the east side of}} the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests <b>the</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{anthropologists have}} shown that the {{relationship}} between religion and politics is complex, especially when viewed over <b>the</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> human history. While religious leaders and the state generally have different aims, both are concerned with power and order; both use reason and emotion to motivate behavior. Throughout history, leaders of religious and political institutions have cooperated, opposed one another, or attempted to co-opt each other, for purposes both noble and base, and have implemented programs {{with a wide range of}} driving values, from compassion aimed at alleviating current suffering to brutal change aimed at achieving longer-term goals, for the benefit of groups ranging from small cliques to all of humanity. The relationship is far from simple. But religion has often been used coercively, and has used coercion.|$|E

25|$|In 1820, Godwin {{published}} Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind as a rebuttal to Malthus' essays. Godwin's main {{argument was}} against Malthus' notion that population tends to grow exponentially. Godwin believed that for population to double every twenty-five years (as Malthus had asserted {{had occurred in}} the United States, due to <b>the</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> resources available there), every married couple {{would have to have}} at least eight children, given the rate of childhood deaths. Godwin himself was one of thirteen children, but he did not observe the majority of couples in his day having eight children. He therefore concluded:In reality, if I had not taken up the pen with the express purpose of confuting all the errors of Mr Malthus’s book, and of endeavouring to introduce other principles, more cheering, more favourable to the best interests of mankind, and better prepared to resist the inroads of vice and misery, I might close my argument here, and lay down the pen with this brief remark, that, when this author shall have produced from any country, the United States of North America not excepted, a register of marriages and births, from which it shall appear that there are on an average eight births to a marriage, then, and not till then, can I have any just reason to admit his doctrine of the geometrical ratio.|$|E
25|$|During their 2003 deployment, VP-4 {{continued}} to support Operation Enduring Freedom against terrorist factions in the Philippines, providing critical real time intelligence. These missions highlighted <b>the</b> <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> Coalition operations against Al-Qaeda and Al-Qaeda backed terrorists. VP-4 {{also had the}} opportunity to conduct the P-3C’s primary mission, ASW, against diesel and nuclear powered submarines, completing this deployment by flying over 4,000 mishap-free flight hours and completing over 800 missions. In 2005, VP-4 successfully completed a wartime deployment to the Middle East and Western Pacific, carrying out a wide variety of missions ranging from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief support missions to the Indian Ocean tsunami victims, to direct support of ground combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. In December 2006, the squadron deployed to Misawa AB and Kadena AB, and to the Philippines, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in the Philippines. This was followed by a return to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in November 2008. On this deployment, VP-4 supplied detachments in support of numerous joint and multinational exercises at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom; RAF Kinloss, Scotland; and NAS Sigonella, Sicily. This experience proved invaluable during the ensuing interdeployment readiness cycle, when VP-4 successfully planned, hosted, and executed the world's largest joint, multinational military exercise, RIMPAC 2010. Following completion of a series of detachment operations, VP-4 departed MCB Kaneohe Bay for a split site deployment in November 2010, supporting assets in both the US 5th Fleet and US 7th Fleet AORs. Following the catastrophic 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of 11 March 2011, VP-4 forward-deployed to Misawa AB in fewer than 24 hours and re-established CTG 72.4 as an operational entity and the first US aviation unit on station for Operation Tomodachi, with VP-4 subsequently providing 254 flight hours of humanitarian and disaster relief support to the Japanese people.|$|E
