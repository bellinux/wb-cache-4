There is an attic beneath the coped gables and surmounted by octagonal chimney stacks. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> laid out with a hall, solar and gallery with an undercroft. It has flagstone floors and a 16th-century stone fireplace.|$|E
5|$|The skeet {{house was}} built around 1925, and is a small one-story log building, three bays wide and one bay deep with a gable roof. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> rustic, with a small kitchen and one large {{multi-purpose}} room. The building contributes to the estate's early 20th century development.|$|E
50|$|In 1988 <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> {{divided into}} {{multiple}} spaces {{for a variety}} of uses, including an amusement arcade and a pub.

5|$|He {{lived in}} Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, in the {{restored}} Bailey House, designed by Richard Neutra. After his home {{was destroyed by}} a fire in 2007, Simon redesigned it to be environmentally friendly; much of <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> constructed from recycled materials while solar panels provide virtually its entire power needs. The building has a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certificate. He had an extensive art collection; he owned paintings by Thomas Hart Benton, John Singer Sargent {{and one of the}} original casts of Auguste Rodin's The Thinker. He also had a sculpture by Robert Graham and works by Alberto Vargas, Gil Elvgren, Ed Ruscha and Richard Estes.|$|E
5|$|Now {{imagine a}} stack of {{hyperbolic}} disks where each disk represents {{the state of the}} universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. It looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder {{plays an important role in}} the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.|$|E
5|$|Roney {{calls in}} his friend Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Rocket Group {{to prevent the}} {{military}} from disturbing what he believes to be an archaeological find. Quatermass and Colonel Breen, recently appointed to lead the Rocket Group over Quatermass's objections, become intrigued by the site. As more of the artefact is uncovered additional fossils are found, which Roney dates to five million years, suggesting that the object is at least that old. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> empty, and a symbol of five intersecting circles, which Roney identifies as the occult pentacle, is etched on a wall that appears to conceal an inner chamber.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> {{completely}} rebuilt in 1978-79.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{very large}} ballroom, a bar, coffee room and drawing room. Some of <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> <b>were</b> by Henri Matisse, {{who was also a}} member. It was reached by a small and rickety lift. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> Moorish and {{mirrored}} with pieces of 18th century glass.|$|R
50|$|Monsignor Battelli {{restored}} the castle, rebuilding a chapel {{and created a}} library. To the latter have been added papers and volumes from the Archbishopric. In the late 19th-century, <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> <b>were</b> refurbished, creating a large hall, theater, and <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> <b>were</b> decorated in 1895 by Enrico Mancini in a neoclassical style.|$|R
5|$|Shackleton is {{an impact}} crater that {{lies at the}} south pole of the Moon. The peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight, while <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> perpetually in shadow (a Crater of eternal darkness). The {{low-temperature}} interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the Moon. Measurements by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater, which may indicate the presence of water ice. The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton.|$|E
5|$|The {{hall was}} {{extended}} {{in the late}} 18th century and altered by Edward Blore in the early Victorian era. It was extensively restored by E. M. Barry after a fire in 1866, and is considered among his best works. Other artists and craftsmen employed during the restoration include J. Birnie Philip, J. G. Crace, Henry Weekes and the firm of Clayton and Bell. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> elaborately decorated and contains many fine examples of wood carving, chimneypieces and plasterwork, {{some of which are}} Jacobean in date.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> {{decorated}} in Greek Revival. style. Immediately inside the entrance is a hall laid with a stone and marble patterned floor. The ceiling has a saucer dome supported by eight marble Ionic columns in a circle. In addition it contains decorative anthemion friezes and a stone and marble patterned floor. The morning {{room in the}} east corner is in a late 19th century Adam/Wyatt style.|$|E
50|$|Some {{parts of}} <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>interior</b> <b>are</b> in <b>the</b> Thurrock Museum, including a magnificent fireplace. Other parts of <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>were</b> rescued when <b>the</b> house was demolished and are displayed at Valence House Museum, Dagenham.|$|R
5000|$|When Opel {{realized}} that the public disliked <b>the</b> Rekord <b>interior,</b> they introduced <b>the</b> [...] "C" [...] package. The [...] "C" [...] cars where fitted with extra instruments (oil pressure, voltmeter etc.) and <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> either red, dark blue, green, or brown. As all parts of <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>were</b> colored, it seemed more luxurious than it did previously.|$|R
50|$|A {{renovation}} of <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> {{carried out in}} 2009-2010.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> {{in red and}} wood. The central part, {{including}} both doors on each side, are on a low-floor section, while the area at the front is higher. The original seating configuration was for 88 seats, but due to customer complaints about lack of seat pitch, NSB has reconfigured the trains in 2006 to 76 seats. Trains are equipped with vending machines for simple refreshments. Garbage is recycled in three categories.|$|E
5|$|The {{limestone}} {{building has}} a slate hipped roof. It is rectangular with a projecting doric portico entrance and an extension to the rear. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> {{laid out in}} a U shape, with the larger Ball Room and Tea Room along either side with the octagonal Card Room at the end. The rooms have Whitefriars crystal chandeliers and are decorated with pictures by Thomas Gainsborough, Allan Ramsay (artist), Edwin Long and William Hoare.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum is}} {{constructed}} from bare reinforced concrete. The primary museum floor is lifted six metres {{above the ground}} on huge piloti and is accessible via a free-standing staircase. The rhythmical facade comprises vertical elements that repeat outwards from the centre. Like the exterior, <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> finished with rough concrete; {{the idea was to}} keep the surfaces plain so that nothing could distract the visitor from the contents of the exhibits.|$|E
50|$|A {{restoration}} of <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> completed in November 1998.|$|R

5|$|Using global geometry, some spacetimes can {{be shown}} to contain {{boundaries}} called horizons, which demarcate one region {{from the rest of}} spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's horizon, is not a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|Anshei Israel Synagogue is a {{historic}} synagogue located in Lisbon, Connecticut, United States. The Orthodox congregation was founded with 15 families and constructed the synagogue in 1936. It was built by George Allen & Sons. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> a single room that is lined with five benches before an altar which held the sacred ark. The congregation's membership dwindled throughout the 1940s and 1950s, limiting the services to holidays before finally closing in the early 1980s. Rules in the congregation were not as strictly enforced as in the Old World, as there was no curtain to separate the sexes and distant members were allowed to drive {{part of the way}} to its services. The Town of Lisbon took ownership of the property in the 1980s. The synagogue is currently maintained by the Lisbon Historical Society. The synagogue was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Vicars' Chapel is {{rubble masonry}} however the south face {{which can be}} seen from the close is of white Conglomerate quarried locally. The shields on the wall are those of Nicholas Bubwith, {{suggesting}} that construction was started during his reign as bishop between 1407 and 1424, and John Stafford who was bishop from 1424 until 1443 suggesting that construction was completed under his episcopate. The lower floor was a chapel, and a spiral stair led up to the library. The chapel was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St Katherine. It is now used by the chaplain of Wells Cathedral School. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> decorated with 19th century gesso work by Heywood Sumner.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> remodeled and {{decorated}} in baroque style in 1746. The richly carved, gothic, early 16th century choir stalls were preserved {{when most of}} <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> decorations <b>were</b> removed during the iconoclasm of the Reformation.|$|R
50|$|Damage {{sustained}} by palace and cathedral during World War II bombing were repaired starting in 1946. <b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> only finished in 1955. More exterior repairs followed in 1962-71 and <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> renovated in 1972-4. Following reunification in 1990 (and especially after 2003) more extensive {{work was done}} both on <b>the</b> exterior and <b>interior</b> of <b>the</b> cathedral.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has <b>been</b> sealed so <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> not seen.|$|R
