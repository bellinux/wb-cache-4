6000|$|... "Ah, very good-natured {{of you to}} your wife's mother. I hope <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> have no {{objection}} to take a walk to Mohill this evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} read {{the details of the}} coup that was planned. But there are just two small entries that refer to <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> In the light of what {{happened}} they are interesting.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're working {{four hundred}} just now," [...] replied Mr. Harriwell, cheerfully; [...] "but <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> us, with <b>you,</b> <b>of</b> course, and the skipper and mate of the Arla, can handle them all right." ...|$|R
5000|$|The theory test is <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> <b>three</b> tests <b>you</b> {{will need}} to pass before you can {{register}} as an ADI. It {{is made up of}} two elements: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; we {{will take}} some tins with us. There {{is going to be}} another big fight to-morrow; as we are all going, you can go too if you like. We shall want <b>you</b> for <b>the</b> horses. <b>Three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> can stop with them at a time, and the others can go and see what is doing, and then change about, you know, so that you can all see something. The spare horses must have plenty of food left them, and must have a good drink before we start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to bring these other scoundrels to their senses, and {{early in the morning}} <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> will be on your way to jail, where I hope you may remain {{for the rest of your}} lives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Death at {{the hands}} of Swart Piet and his Kaffir tribesmen for <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> and the two slaves, and for the fourth, the lady Swallow there, a love which she does not seek, the love of the murderer of her father, her mother, and her chosen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} waited till {{they got in}} at the window," [...] said Lord Aveling; [...] "they would get it hotter if they had {{actually}} committed the burglary. And it was lucky for you two of the policemen were out by the gates, and followed up <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> I doubt {{if you could have}} secured the two of them--though it was confoundedly plucky of you, all the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{young and}} strong, and am refreshed, now. Take Mr. Brown to our house, {{and give him}} help--you see how plainly he needs it. I will go back {{and take care of}} the Old People; I can be there in twenty minutes. You can go on and do what you first started to do--wait on the main road at our house until {{somebody}} comes along with a wagon; then send and bring away <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> us. <b>You</b> won't have to wait long; the farmers will soon be coming back from town, now. I will keep old Polly patient and cheered up--the crazy one doesn't need it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your reverence {{need not}} be excited," [...] said Holmes, {{lighting}} a cigarette. [...] "The case is clear enough against you, and all I ask is a few details for my private curiosity. However, if there's any difficulty in your telling me, I'll do the talking, and then you will see how far {{you have a chance}} of holding back your secrets. In <b>the</b> first place, <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> came from South Africa on this game--you Williamson, you Carruthers, and Woodley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whence come you?" [...] he went on, [...] "who are you? {{and why are}} <b>the</b> faces <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> white, and <b>the</b> face of {{the fourth}} as the face of our mother's sons?" [...] and he pointed to Umbopa. I looked at Umbopa as he said it, and it flashed across {{me that he was}} right. The face of Umbopa was like the faces of the men before me, and so was his great form like their forms. But I had not time to reflect on this coincidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just for that, {{and for all}} {{the rest}} of your insolences, <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> are going to get yours. All the wrongs of a {{lifetime}} are rising now in my brain in a dazzling brightness. I shall go Berserk in a moment. But first, and I speak as an agriculturist, and I address myself to you, Lute, in all humility, in heaven's name what is Meniere's Disease? Do sheep catch it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this the}} master of Putnam Hall smiled broadly. [...] "Always like to be together, eh? All right, I don't know but {{what it will be}} safer for <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> to go together," [...] he said; and Dick lost no time in telling his brothers. In a few minutes the trio set off for the Stanhope cottage, little dreaming of the long time that was to elapse before they should see Putnam Hall again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll see, my boy," [...] said Keegan--and now the benevolent {{attorney}} had altogether {{lost his}} smile,--"you'll see, my boy, whether I won't make {{the two of}} you pay for this; ay! and the whole family too, for a set of proud, beggarly, starved-out paupers. By G----, I'll sell every rotten stick of old furniture left in the house, on the 6th of next month; and <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> shall be tramping in the roads before the winter's over!" ...|$|E
5000|$|At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>three</b> years <b>you</b> shall {{bring forth}} all the tithe of your produce in that year, and shall lay it up inside your gates; And the Levite, {{because he has}} no part nor {{inheritance}} with you, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, who are inside your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.” (...) ...|$|R
6000|$|He added a {{touch or}} two, {{and then gave}} her his sketch. She looked at it, but she went on with her idea of a moment before. [...] "If a woman were {{to ask you to}} marry her you would say, 'Certainly, my dear, with pleasure!' And you would marry her and be ridiculously happy. Then at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>three</b> months <b>you</b> would say to her, 'You know that blissful day when I begged you to be mine!'" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the common and {{different}} views concerning role models respected by university students in Japan, Korea and China, based on the survey of questionnaires. This paper reports the analysis of one question regarding the respected role models, “Write <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>three</b> people <b>you</b> respect in the order that you respect. ” The results were compared among the countries and derived some interesting tendencies. Japanese students respected “present Japanese (e. g., Ichiro), ” while Korean and Chinese students respected “historical people (e. g., Lee, Sun-Shin). ” From the viewpoint of Confucianism, many different factors were found and some suggestions were described based on the detailed analysis...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did I {{take you}} into my inn yonder in Beirut {{when you were}} the pilgrims Peter and John? Why did I find you the best horses in Syria and guide you to the Al-je-bal? Why did I often dare death by torment for you there? Why did I save <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you?</b> And why, for all this weary while, have I--who, after all, am nobly born--become the mock of {{soldiers}} and the tire-woman of the princess of Baalbec? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As long as {{we stood}} to {{windward}} of it" [...] replied Hendrick, [...] "we were safe from the tree itself, though in danger from surrounding trees, but now, with this great trunk above us, other trees can do us no harm. As for the stem sinking lower, it can't do that until this solid branch that supports it becomes rotten. Come now," [...] he added, [...] "we will encamp here. Give me the axe, Oliver, and <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> help to carry away the branches as I chop them off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it {{is a bit}} heavy. I've fairly {{given up}} my {{connection}} with my last ship, and as the new commander took possession this morning I was obliged to bring away my last box. Now, I don't want Liffie to move it about when putting things to rights, or to meddle with it in any way. When we want to sweep behind or under it I'll shift it myself. But, after all, you're safe not to move it, for <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> together couldn't if you were to try ever so much. So, good-day. I'll be back to tea." ...|$|E
40|$|God is {{the reason}} why this study is complete. He brought me to this endeavor, and then He brought me through it. I could never thank Him or praise Him enough for the many undeserved gifts He has {{bestowed}} upon me. My three beautiful children, Katherine, Victoria and William, sacrificed more than anyone else during these many years in order for me to pursue my education. I could never truly express to all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> how grateful I am that you are such wonderful, loving children. I had been told that getting a Ph. D. while raising three children alone would be an impossible task; if you all had not been such easy children to raise I could never have done this. I am sorry that you all had to go through so much in this process. I am in constant amazement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> you; <b>you</b> are all my heroes. Thank you for your sacrifices, for your patience and for your enduring love. I can only hope that you all see this as an example in perseverance. Thank you to my father who has believed in me from the beginning. Thank you for calling everyday to see if I had completed that “book report ” yet. My answer, finally, is yes! I have completed that book report! I know raising two daughters on your own wasn’t easy; you once told me that if you spent any more time praying for me you would have to quit your job. I know your greatest prayer was that your daughters would be educated. God heard you. Thank you for your love. Thank you to my mother. Although you were not here to see me grow up and accomplish this task, I know you have been watching from heaven, and I know you are proud. Thank you for your love...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert's {{review of}} the movie was a mixed 2.5 out of 4 stars. [...] "The movie starts promisingly ... a scene where Butch puts down a {{rebellion}} in his gang {{is one of the}} best things in the movie ... And then we meet Sundance's girlfriend, played by Katharine Ross, and the scenes with <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> them have <b>you</b> thinking you've wandered into a really first-rate film." [...] But after Harriman hires his posse, Ebert thought the movie's quality declined: [...] "Hill apparently spent a lot of money to take his company on location for these scenes, and I guess when he got back to Hollywood he couldn't bear to edit them out of the final version. So the Super-posse chases our heroes unceasingly, until we've long since forgotten how well the movie started." [...] The dialogue in the final scenes is [...] "so bad we can't believe a word anyone says. And then the violent, bloody ending is also a mistake; apparently it was a misguided attempt to copy [...] "Bonnie and Clyde. ..." [...] we don't believe it, and we walk out of the theater wondering what happened to that great movie we were seeing until an hour ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not argue}} with me," [...] the sister said angrily. [...] "I {{tell you this}} obstinacy will be {{permitted}} no longer. Had it not been that Alexander of Lorne begged {{that we would not}} be harsh with you, steps would long since have been taken to bring you to reason; but we can no longer permit this advocacy of rebellion, and the last unmaidenly step which <b>you</b> took <b>of</b> setting at defiance your friends and relatives, and even of sending messages hence, must be punished. The abbess bade me reason with you and try and turn your obstinate will. Your cousins of Badenoch here have appealed to you in vain. This can no longer be tolerated. The lady abbess bids me tell you that she gives you three days to renounce the rebel opinions you have so frowardly held, and to accept the husband whom your uncle and guardian has chosen for you, your cousin John of Lorne, his son. During that time none will speak to you. If at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>three</b> days <b>you</b> are still contumacious you will be confined to your cell on bread and water until better thoughts come to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{looked at}} me and said--not to me, mind you, but to the soaks: 'It's time this worthy man went ashore'--me! worthy man! 'Fowler,' she said--you know, just like a {{straight}} order, and she didn't mister him--it was plain Fowler--'Fowler,' she said, 'just tell Adamu Adam to man the whale-boat, and while he's taking Captain Oleson ashore have your boat put me on the Flibberty. <b>The</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> sail with me, so pack your dunnage. And the one of you that shows up best will take the mate's billet. Captain Oleson doesn't carry a mate, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are wasting time," [...] Wingate {{declared}} a little shortly. [...] "It is better {{that we have}} a complete understanding. Get this into your head," [...] he went on, drawing a long, ugly-looking pistol from his trousers pocket, and displaying it. [...] "This is the finest automatic pistol in the world, and I am one of the best marksmen in the American Army. I shall leave you, for the present, ungagged, but if rescue comes to you by any efforts of your own, I give you my word of honour as an American gentleman that I shall shoot <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> and be proud of my night's work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mayhap, Macumazahn, but my wrongs are {{the wrongs}} of a nation, {{therefore}} I {{think of the}} nation, and at least I do not fear death like you white men. Now hearken. Presently your friends will tell you a story. The lady Heddana {{will tell you how}} I made use of her for a certain purpose, for which purpose indeed I drew <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> into Zululand, because without her I could not have brought about this war into which Cetewayo did not wish to enter. When you have heard that story, do not judge me too hardly, Macumazahn, who had a great end to gain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here we are," [...] Sam Dickson said. [...] "Now, stop quietly outside. I {{will call}} <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> up, when I {{have spoken to}} Mr. Eastrey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before we go further," [...] {{said the}} smiling Stranger, [...] "it is my {{pleasure}} to inform <b>you</b> that all <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> are destined to become great." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} see this through, Tony," [...] he said, [...] "with Hastings and Mackenzie. <b>Three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> will be enough; I shall have {{need of the}} others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Love {{is a bad}} diplomatist," [...] replied Bernaldez, with {{a little}} smile, [...] "and who can count last year's clouds? What is done, is done. Now I will try to arrange that <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> shall be brought {{straight}} before their Majesties when they sit to hear cases {{on the day after}} to-morrow. With the Queen you will have a better chance than at the hands of any alcalde. She has a heart, if only one can get at it--that is, except where Jews and Maranos are concerned," [...] and again he glanced at Castell. [...] "Meanwhile, there is money in plenty, and in Spain we ride to heaven on gold angels," [...] he added, alluding to that coin and the national corruption.|$|E
6000|$|... "At least I {{will look}} after you, you half-bred dogs, who yap out ill-omened prophecies of death into my face. Since <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> loved my {{daughter}} whom you brought to her doom, and were by her beloved, if differently, I think it best {{that you should}} follow on her road. How? That is the question? Shall I leave you to starve in these great caves?--Nay, look not towards the road of escape which doubtless she pointed out to you, for, as Humphrey knows, I can travel swiftly and I {{will make sure that}} you find it blocked. Or shall I--" [...] and he glanced upwards at the great globes of wandering fire, as though he purposed to summon them to be our death, as doubtless he could have done.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{you shall}} learn in due course. On {{the second night}} from this I command <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> to wait upon me at sundown in the buried halls of Nyo. Till then you see no more of Yva, for I do not trust her. She, too, has powers, though as yet she does not use them, and perchance she would forget her oaths, and {{following}} some new star of love, {{for a little while}} vanish with you out of my reach. Be in the sepulchre at the hour of sundown on the second day from this, all three of you, if you would continue to live upon the earth. Afterwards you shall learn my will and make your choice between Yva with majesty and her loss with death." ...|$|E
6000|$|MARGARET. He got my pearls back once--without loss of life. A frightfully good fireside manner. Do get him here, Mabel, {{and have}} a heart-to-heart talk, all <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> eh?" [...] muttered the bully. [...] "We'll {{see about}} this some other time," [...] and leaving his camp chair he {{made for the}} cabin and disappeared, from view.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told them}} no, {{but that you}} were {{expected}} in a few days. Then both of them began to brag, and said they had it in for all <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> Rovers." ...|$|R
