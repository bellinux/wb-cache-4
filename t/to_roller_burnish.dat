40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} shot peening and <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> on the fatigue {{performance}} of the γ(TiAl) alloy Ti- 45 Al- 9 Nb- 0. 2 C was investigated {{over a wide range}} of processing intensities. At optimized conditions shot peening and <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> can markedly improve the fatigue strength at ambient temperatures. For temperatures above 650 °C, the residual compressive stresses induced by shot peening and <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> quickly relax. This indicates that, at elevated temperatures, surface roughness and dislocation strengthening become more important for the fatigue performance of mechanically surface-treated components. <b>Roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> leads <b>to</b> much lower surface roughness than shot peening, resulting in more effective improvement of high temperature fatigue performance. However, surface strengthening by shot peening can also be beneficial for the fatigue performance at elevated temperatures, when the surface roughness is reduced by subsequent polishing...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is {{investigation}} of fine machining efficiency of 34 CrMo 4 steel with <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> tools. Application of <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> process as a clean and environmentally friendly machining process which can replace other pollution processes is of great interests. It is important to evaluate the influence of material properties (primary hardness) for smoothing efficiency and achieving of lower roughness and higher work piece hardness. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental tests of cutting outputs have been done on specimens prepared for final machining process to estimate the rate of roughness decrease, and diameter increase. Roughness measured data before and after <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> process have been compared. Findings: It was found that surface roughness is significantly lower after <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing.</b> Roughness ratio (before/after process) and decrease factor was 4 what doesn’t satisfy expected results. Some roughness results after burnishing exceed upper limits. Research limitations/implications: Results and findings presented in this paper are qualitative and might be slightly different in other machining condition (e. g. higher hardness materials and higher roughness of row material). Practical implications: Smoothing process can be performed on standard machine tools without additional reconfiguration tasks. Process is very rapid. Process is very versatile for any workshop and can be conducted without coolant what is additional advantages for the environment and pollution free machining.

Dry and lubricated sliding conditions for both parallel and crossed burnished orientations were considered. The results revealed that low burnishing feed rate and smaller roller contact width led to a decrease in coefficient of friction for both polymers while improvement in the wear resistance was observed.

50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> is {{a method}} of cold working metal {{surfaces}} to induce compressive residual stresses and enhance surface roughness qualities. The tooling typically consists of a hardened sphere or cylindrical roller. These tools are pressed onto/across the part being processed. The part (or the tool in some applications) must be moving at a constant rate of speed, for example {{in the case of}} <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> a part on a lathe, the part is spinning and the burnishing tool is moved across the surface as a constant rate; therefore, producing a very consistent finish across the part. Another application is thrust bearing surfaces of some production crankshafts. A dual roller (cylindrical) tool is moved into the thrust bearing journal of a crankshaft, while the crankshaft is spinning the tool is indexed (so each <b>roller</b> is perpendicular <b>to</b> the thrust surface while backing each other up) deforming the surfaces. So the diameters of each roller added together (compensated for elastic deformation) equals the finish dimension of the thrust bearing.|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to enhance the {{mechanical}} properties and microhardness of the surface of O 1 steel using the <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> process. In manufacturing processes, surfaces and their properties are as important as the bulk properties of the materials. Surface treatment is an important aspect of all manufacturing processes. It has been used to impart certain physical and mechanical properties, such as appearance, corrosion, friction, wear and fatigue resistance. Widely used methods of finishing treatment that create necessary parts with the given roughness usually do not provide optimum quality of the surface. Therefore, methods of Surface Plastic Deformation (SPD) are used. One of the most effective representatives is the <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing.</b> This can simply achieved by pressing a hard and highly polished ball or roller against the surface of metallic work pieces. In this paper the effect of diamond pressing process with a different pressing force (105, 140, 175, 210) N was studied and the results of the experiments are presented.

In both cases, a burnishing tool runs against the workpiece and plastically deforms its surface. In some instances of the latter case (and always in ballizing), it rubs, in the former it generally rotates and rolls. The workpiece may be at ambient temperature, or heated to reduce the forces and wear on the tool. The tool is usually hardened and coated with special materials to increase its life.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A lot of {{innovations}} in molding and casting technology and also simulation techniques have made ductile iron {{more and more}} competitive and it even competes meanwhile against steel forgings. A successful substitution of steel forgings for example is the wheel carrier for a high vo-lume car with the Georg Fischer new ductile iron material 'SiboDur', a ductile iron family with high strength and high elongation at the same time. But {{there is still a}} great potential for ductile iron cast-ings to substitute steel forgings, in particular in the automotive industry. One example is the crank-shaft for the engine: Quite a lot of gasoline engines are equipped with ductile iron crankshafts, but for instance most of the diesel engines are still running with forged steel cranks. The reason is most-ly the belief of design engineers that {{it is not possible to}} get similar fatigue limit with castings com-pared to forged steel. This belief may often be correct, but using local strengthening technologies, such as <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> of bearing fillets or inductive hardening of highly stressed areas can raise the fatigue limit of casted crankshafts dramatically. The paper presents studies which show that using the right ductile iron material and optimized <b>roller</b> <b>burnishing</b> conditions can raise the fatigue limit of cast crankshafts to values even higher than forged steel ones (material 38 MnVS 6). But even quenched and tempered forged steel crankshafts are in the focus to be substituted by castings. It i...|$|R

After RB, the fatigue strength (at 10 (7) cycles) in the as-rolled alloy and the aging heat-treated (T 5 -treated) specimens increased from 150 and 155 MPa, to 225 and 210 MPa, respectively. RB led to a subsurface fatigue-crack nucleation in both the as-rolled and the 15 -treated materials. In the as-rolled alloy, small cracks (in the stage I) propagated along cleavage planes after RB. In contrast, in the 15 -treated specimens, the small cracks grew by coalescence of the sheared dimples.
