5|$|Support for {{parliamentary}} reform plummeted {{after the}} launch of the French Revolution in 1789. Many English politicians became steadfastly opposed to any major political change. Despite this reaction, several Radical Movement groups were established to agitate for reform. A group of Whigs led by James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale and Charles Grey founded an organisation advocating parliamentary reform in 1792. This group, known as the Society of the Friends of the People, included 28 MPs. In 1793, Grey presented to the House of Commons a petition from the Friends of the People, outlining abuses of the system and demanding change. He did not propose any specific scheme of reform, but merely a motion that the House inquire into possible improvements. Parliament's reaction to the French Revolution was so negative, that even this request for an inquiry was rejected by a margin of almost 200 votes. Grey tried to raise the subject again in 1797, but <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>again</b> rebuffed him by a majority of over 150.|$|E

25|$|Many {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the burial of the mummies and some present-day Lebanese burials. For example, one of the infants had long strands of hair between its toes. According to local tradition {{in some areas of}} Lebanon today, a mother whose child dies will pull out her hair in lamentation while kissing the feet of her deceased child. Similarly, today in Lebanon, when the last member of a family dies, the key to the family house is thrown over the roof, indicating that no one will live in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>again.</b> The presence of a key in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave may also indicate that the last member of a family had died there as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{house where}} Gavrilo Princip lived in Sarajevo was {{destroyed}} during World War I. After the war, it was rebuilt {{as a museum}} in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was conquered by Germany in 1941 and Sarajevo {{became part of the}} Independent State of Croatia. The Croatian Ustaše destroyed <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>again.</b> After the establishment of Communist Yugoslavia in 1944, the house of Gavrilo Princip became a museum again and there was another museum dedicated to him within the city of Sarajevo. During the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, the house of Gavrilo Princip was destroyed a third time and rebuilt {{for the third time in}} 2015. Prior to 1992 the site on the pavement on which Princip stood to fire the fatal shots was marked by embossed footprints. These were destroyed as a consequence of the 1992–95 war in Bosnia. There is still a plaque in front of the museum at the spot where Gavrilo Princip stood when he fired the shots.|$|E
500|$|The Republican Party's {{popularity}} {{after the}} {{victory in the}} Spanish–American War led Weaver, for the first time, to doubt that populist values would eventually prevail. With {{the demise of the}} Populist Party, Weaver became a Democrat and was a delegate to the 1904 Democratic National Convention. He was displeased at the party's nominee, AltonB. Parker, whom he thought [...] "plutocratic", but Weaver supported his unsuccessful campaign nevertheless. He gave serious consideration to running for <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>again</b> that year, but decided against it. In 1908, he supported Bryan's third campaign as the Democratic nominee for president, but it, too, was unsuccessful.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{weeks before}} he dies, he {{contacts}} Holly and asks if she knows anyone [...] "in the system" [...] who needs and deserves help, but is too proud to ask for it. Holly suggests Connie Tepos (Elpidia Carrillo), who lives with her two kids and an abusive boyfriend, but cannot afford to leave. When [...] "Ben" [...] arrives to [...] "interview" [...] her {{under the guise of}} dealing with the IRS, Connie is embarrassed and humiliated that he knows what has been going on. She defends her boyfriend, is offended by [...] "Ben"'s suggestion that she should leave with her kids, and kicks him out of her house. In the meantime, [...] "Ben" [...] moves out of his house and into a local motel, taking with him his pet box jellyfish, decidedly the most venomous creature on earth, with its sting causing death in three to five minutes. That night, after being beaten by her boyfriend again, Connie contacts [...] "Ben". He meets her, tells her not to be weak, and gives her the keys and directions to his beach house. She takes her two children and they move into the house. Then, she reads a letter from [...] "Ben" [...] which includes the deed to <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>again</b> giving no explanation, and asking for her to respect his wishes, not try to contact him, not tell anyone how she got the house, and [...] "live life abundantly".|$|E
2500|$|Problems {{with the}} Savoyes caused {{by all the}} {{requests}} for additional payment from the contractors for all the changes were compounded by the requirement for early repairs to the new house. Each autumn the Savoyes suffered problems with rainwater leaks through the roof. By refusing downpipes and sills which would interrupt their aesthetic, the white surfaces were more susceptible to staining and erosion due to the water pour-down. Additionally, these building was also scarred with cracks because the material was not designed for structural durability. The Savoyes continued {{to live in the}} house until 1940, leaving during World War II. It was occupied twice during the war: first by the Germans - when it was used as a hay store - and then by the Americans, with both occupations damaging the building severely. The Savoyes returned to their estate after the war, but, no longer in position to live as they had done before the war, they abandoned <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>again</b> shortly after. The villa was expropriated by the town of Poissy in 1958, which first used it as a public youth center and later considered demolishing it {{to make way for a}} schoolhouse complex. Protest from architects who felt the house should be saved, and the intervention of Corbusier himself, spared the house from demolition. A first attempt of restoration was begun in 1963 by architect Jean Debuisson, despite opposition from Corbusier. The villa was added to the French register of historical monuments in 1965, becoming the first modernist building designated as historical monument in France, and also the first to be the object of restoration while its architect was still living. In 1985, a thorough state-funded restoration process, led by architect Jean-Louis Véret, was undertaken, being completed in 1997. The restoration included structural and surface repairs to the facades and terraces because of deterioration of the concrete, [...] the installation of lighting and security cameras, and the reinstatement of some of the original fixtures and fittings.|$|E
