5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries as <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> 10−7 to 10−8m {{it has no}} measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε ring is not precisely known, although the ring is certainly very thin—by some estimates as <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of Gospel passages. Today, {{it consists of}} 340 vellum leaves, or folios. The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets, called bifolios, which are folded in half to form two folios. The bifolios are nested inside {{of each other and}} sewn together to form gatherings called quires. On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolio but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire. The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires. There are between four and twelve folios (two to six bifolios) per quire; the folios are commonly, but not invariably, bound in groups of ten. Some folios are single sheets, as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages. The folios had lines drawn for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolios were folded. Prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages. The vellum is of high quality, although the folios have an uneven thickness, with some being close to leather while others are so <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> to be almost translucent.|$|E

50|$|In {{this type}} of estuary, river output greatly exceeds marine input and tidal effects have a minor importance. Fresh water floats {{on top of the}} {{seawater}} in a layer that gradually <b>thins</b> <b>as</b> it moves seaward. The denser seawater moves landward along the bottom of the estuary, forming a wedge-shaped layer that is <b>thinner</b> <b>as</b> it approaches land. As a velocity difference develops between the two layers, shear forces generate internal waves at the interface, mixing the seawater upward with the freshwater. An example of a salt wedge estuary is the Mississippi River.|$|R
50|$|These {{estuaries}} {{are characterized}} by a sharp density interface between the upper layer of freshwater and the bottom layer of saline water. River water dominates in this system, and tidal effects have a small role in the circulation patterns.

The denser seawater moves along the bottom up the estuary forming a wedge shaped layer and becoming <b>thinner</b> <b>as</b> it moves landward.

25|$|Anglers {{of the era}} who {{ventured into}} the Esopus valley were usually advised by guidebooks and {{magazine}} articles touting the Catskills' trout populations to bypass the main stream {{in favor of the}} tributaries, since the Esopus itself was generally too warm for brook trout, the favored species at that time, and still too polluted by runoff from the tanneries. In the 1880s pioneering fish farmer Seth Green advocated the stocking of rainbow trout in streams where the brook trout population was beginning to <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> a result of the fishing pressure, as they could handle warmer water better. Other anglers feared that, if introduced, the more aggressive rainbows would displace the native brooks.|$|E
25|$|Tāwari is a {{rich source}} of nectar, which is often so {{abundant}} that bees produce monofloral honey, that is the honey is chiefly made of nectar from Tāwari flowers. Tāwari honey is regularly for sale from food shops in New Zealand. The nectar contains a lot of fructose and much water. The honey may be <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> a consequence, but nonetheless crystallizes quickly. The honey has a light colour and tastes a bit like butterscotch. It contains relatively few pollen, and if at least 20% of the pollen is Tāwari, it can be marketed as Tāwari honey. Bark can produce a black dye that is known to be used on flax. Māori people use the flowers to make necklaces and other adornments to be worn at festivities.|$|E
