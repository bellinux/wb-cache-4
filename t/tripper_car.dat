40|$|This study {{describes}} <b>tripper</b> <b>car</b> operators’ {{exposure to}} {{coal tar pitch}} volatiles at an operation at Coal Distribution Steam Plant that {{involves the use of}} coal tar mix to feed as fuel the steam generating boilers. A cross-sectional task-based exposure assessment approached was used. The objectives of this study were to monitor <b>tripper</b> <b>car</b> operators’ exposures to coal tar pitch volatiles as benzene soluble fraction and to then compare the measured concentrations with the occupational exposure limit. The general aim {{of the study was to}} accumulate data about employee exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles in South African Petrochemical Refineries. A total of 56 samples was collected and analyzed for coal tar pitch volatiles – benzene soluble fraction. Of the 56 samples, 41 were personal samples collected on the breathing zones of the workers and 15 samples were field blank samples. The method used for the collection of the samples was the United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety & Health Administration Method 58. In South Africa the available occupational exposure limit for coal tar pitch volatiles is the time weighted average occupational exposure limit – recommended limit for cyclohexane soluble fraction which is 0. 14 mg/m 3. For the evaluation of personal exposure to compare with the occupational exposure limit, the UK Health & Safety Executive Method for the Determination of Hazardous Substances (MDHS) 68 was adopted in the past to monitor workplace air. This method was since withdrawn by the Health & Safety Executive after research conducted by the Health & Safety Laboratory revealed that unacceptable variability were introduced into the method due to the small mass changes involved and the difficulty in accurately weighing the filters before and after the cyclohexane extraction. Due to the unavailability of a suitable and acceptable method to assess workers’ exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles – cyclohexane soluble fraction to compare to the South African occupational exposure limit, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration Method Number 58 was used during this study for the collection of the samples. This is a validated method. This method follows a similar approach as the MDHS 68 however benzene is used instead of cyclohexane during sample extraction. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration have the permissible exposure limit of 0. 2 mg/m 3 for coal tar pitch volatiles – benzene soluble fraction to use when assessing worker exposure. This limit was used during this study for assessing <b>tripper</b> <b>car</b> exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles. No coal tar pitch volatiles were detected on the samples collected during the study. The results revealed concentrations below detection limit of the test laboratory analytical method. The detection limit used thereof was 0. 1 mg per sample. The <b>tripper</b> <b>car</b> operators were therefore exposed to coal tar pitch volatiles at concentrations that complied with the permissible exposure limit 0. 2 mg/m 3. The hypothesis of this study was that the <b>tripper</b> <b>car</b> operators at Coal Distribution Steam Plant are over exposed to coal tar pitch volatiles – benzene soluble fraction. This hypothesis is therefore rejected. Based on the results derived from this study it is recommended that further research studies be conducted specifically with focus on different methods of exposure assessment to workers exposed to coal tar pitch volatiles in South African Petrochemical Refinery Plants. - ii - Since the method used was limited to the particulate phase of the contaminant exposure, with the gaseous phase of exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles only looked at when the PEL is exceeded. A method that can measure both the gaseous and particulate phase of the contaminant must be investigated...|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} {{is a popular}} destination for day <b>trippers.</b> The <b>car</b> park {{at the foot of}} the Seebuck is the base for numerous walks to the nearby ridge (to the Feldberg, Stübenwasen and Notschrei, to the Toter Mann, to the Herzogenhorn or to Hinterzarten), as well as walks to the nearby valleys (Menzenschwand valley, Wiese, St. Wilhelm's Valley, Zastler valley).|$|R
2500|$|The port handles around 8 {{million tonnes}} of coal for clients {{such as the}} Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board, Karnataka Power Corporation, cement plants of Tamil Nadu and {{independent}} power producers in northern Tamil Nadu and southern Andhra Pradesh. The coal handling for the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board {{was transferred to the}} Ennore Port. In 2005, as part of pollution-control measure, the port has installed wind curtains made of ultraviolet resistant fabric along the harbour's beachfront for over 1.5km to the east of the coal terminal to prevent wind carrying coal dust into the city at a cost of [...] 3.7 million. In 2008, the port has also installed a semi-mechanised closed coal conveyor system comprising two streams with a capacity of 15 million metric tons/annum and a handling rated capacity of 1,500 metric tons/hour/stream and running for a length of 5km at two berths, namely, Jawahar Dock IV and VI, at a cost of [...] 430 million to transfer the coal to the individual coal plots {{at the southern end of}} the port, from where the cargo will be transported by rail to respective destinations, thus preventing pollution from coal dust and eliminating movement of coal-carrying trucks within the port. The conveyor runs at an elevation of 10–13m and has provision for longitudinal movement along the road to the plots and transverse movement for stacking coal at individual plots. Coal discharged into the hoppers located at the two docks is conveyed to coal plots through conveyors or <b>tripper</b> <b>cars</b> and is equipped with belt weigher. The conveyor system is expected to remain functional for about 5 years, till Ennore Port is ready to handle coal for all the clients.|$|R
50|$|Lavernock started {{settling}} back {{to quiet}} seclusion {{in the late}} 1960s when the railway line closed down under the Beeching Axe. Some modern day <b>trippers</b> arrived by <b>car,</b> {{to the degree that}} the lanes and the Swanbridge car park were often jammed, but visitor numbers had dropped off {{to such a degree that}} falling profit margins meant all the food outlets, the Golden Hind pub and eventually even the Bay Hotel closed down and the decline was accelerated even further.|$|R
