5|$|As {{the winner}} of 2015–16 I-League, Bengaluru FC were paired against 8th ranked team Aizawl F.C. for the quarter-final round. On 30 April 2016, in {{the first leg of}} quarter finals, Bengaluru FC took an early lead in 15th minute with a goal from Eugeneson Lyngdoh, however Alfred Jaryan {{equalized}} for <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> in 38th minute. Aizawl struck the final blow in the dying minutes when Joel Sunday scored the winner for <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team,</b> leaving Bengaluru FC trailing after the first leg. Bengaluru FC suffered a shock defeat in the home leg as well, as the team went down 2–3 to Aizawl. C.K. Vineeth's first half equalizer and Sunil Chhetri's successful penalty proved insufficient as Bengaluru FC were ousted from the Federation cup on 3–5 aggregate loss.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{retired from}} playing {{as a result}} of an eye {{complaint}} and a knee injury. York drew 1–1 away to Burton Albion, with an own goal scored by Shane Cansdell-Sherriff giving York the lead in the 64th minute before <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> equalised eight minutes later through Billy Kee. Atkinson was released after failing to force himself into the first team and signed for Scarborough Athletic, with whom he had been on loan. York drew 0–0 at home with second-placed Oxford United, in which Carson came closest to scoring with a volley that flashed across the face of the goal. This was followed by another draw after the match awa to Accrington Stanley finished 1–1, with <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> equalising 10 minutes after a Fletcher penalty had given York the lead in the 35th minute. Striker Shaq McDonald, who had been released by Peterborough United, was signed on a contract until the end of the season. York's last match of 2013 was a 2–1 defeat away to Bury, a result that ended York's run of consecutive draws at five. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> were 2–0 up by the 19th minute, before Michael Coulson scored York's goal in the 73rd minute. This result meant York would begin 2014 in 22nd-position in the table, only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.|$|E

5|$|Game one {{was held}} in Montreal in a very warm Montreal Forum on September 2 before 18,818 fans. The gamesmanship between the teams started before the first faceoff. Canada was {{assigned}} <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> for all games in Canada, while the Soviets would be <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> in Moscow. The Soviets would not release their lineup until they had seen their opponents', the opposite order, considering they were the visitors. The official scorer {{had to return to}} the Soviets' dressing room and demand the lineup. To Sinden, he wanted to put the Ellis-Clarke-Henderson line on against Valeri Kharlamov's line. The Soviets did not start Kharlamov's line and Sinden named Phil Esposito's line for the opening face-off.|$|E
5|$|Pundits {{and opponents}} have {{asserted}} that Boise State benefits from an added advantage by wearing their blue home uniforms {{to match the}} playing field. Boise State possessed a 64–2 record at Bronco Stadium from 1998 to 2008. Nevada, designated as <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team,</b> likewise wore blue uniforms during the Humanitarian Bowl.|$|E
5|$|York {{began the}} season with a 1–0 home win over the {{previous}} season's play-off finalists, Northampton Town, with debutant Jarvis scoring the winning goal in the 90th minute. However, defeat came in York's match against Championship team Burnley {{in the first round of}} the League Cup, going down 4–0 at home. The team endured their first league defeat of the season in the following match after being beaten 2–0 away by Dagenham & Redbridge, <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> scoring in each half. York then held Hartlepool United to a 0–0 home draw, before being beaten 3–2 away by Bristol Rovers, in which Jarvis scored twice before John-Joe O'Toole scored the winning goal for <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> in the 67th minute. Two signings were made shortly before the transfer deadline; defender George Taft was signed on a one-month loan from Leicester City, while Middlesbrough midfielder Ryan Brobbel joined on a one-month loan. Midfielder John McReady, who had been told he had no future with the club, departed after signing for F.C. Halifax Town.

5|$|A {{month after}} the final, he was again {{selected}} for the Academy squad for three limited overs matches against a touring Indian team. Queenslander Stuart Law captained the Australian side that included former Australian keeper Rod Marsh. In Australia's victory in the first match in Canberra, Ponting top-scored with 71, before making 52 in a victory in Sydney. The last match was also successful for <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team,</b> with Ponting not required to bat.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer {{to move out of the}} way of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI, named after H. D. G. Leveson-Gower. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current Test players be allowed {{to play for the}} hosts. After his demands were met, Bradman named a full-strength team. After the tourists dismissed <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> for 177, Morris made 62 in a 102-run opening stand with Barnes before Yardley bowled him. Australia declared at 8/489 and time ran out with Leveson-Gower's XI at 2/75 after multiple rain delays.|$|E

5|$|Baseball writer-scorers usually {{worked at}} the games played at the home stadium of the team which they covered for their newspaper.

5|$|Donald Bradman's 1948 touring {{party to}} England {{has become known}} to cricket history as The Invincibles, {{remaining}} undefeated in its 31 matches. Miller started the tour strongly, scoring a hard-hitting 50 not out against Worcestershire, and an unbeaten 202 against Leicestershire. In the next match against Yorkshire, Miller took 6/42, including the prized wicket of Hutton, as <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> were demolished for just 71. Australia then struggled to 101, including a counterattacking 34 from Miller, who took 3/49 in the second innings in an Australian victory.|$|E
5|$|Following St Hill's {{return to}} the West Indies, the Inter-Colonial Tournament took place in Trinidad during January and February 1929. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> {{defeated}} British Guiana before beating Barbados by an innings in the final. St Hill batted at number three throughout but managed scores of just 4, 23 and 5. However, Trinidad could not defend their title in October as British Guiana defeated the team by four wickets. St Hill batted at number seven in the first innings and three in the second innings but made just 11 runs in the match.|$|E

5|$|Having {{made only}} 5 and 18 in the {{previous}} Test, Jack Crapp was originally dropped from the team but was reprieved by Washbrook's injury. The England selectors were widely condemned for their decisions, which were seen as an investment in youth rather than necessarily picking the best players available at the time. Their frequent changes meant <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> had used a total of 21 players for the five Tests.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Greer {{served as the}} home field for the Father Ryan High School {{football}} team. Father Ryan returned to playing at Greer from 2006 through 2008, before moving to a new school athletic complex for the 2009 season. Depending on the Sounds' schedule, some of the school's home games were held at the visiting school's field (with Father Ryan designated as <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team)</b> or at other unused local high school fields. In the football configuration, the field runs along the first base line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} match, New Zealand batted first and Meckiff played {{a leading role}} in Australia's victory, taking 4/28 from 27.2 overs to help dismiss the hosts for 198. The fast bowler was not {{required}} to bat as the tourists replied with 8/350 declared. He took 2/17 in the second innings as <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> fell for 161 before Craig's men sealed the series with a 10-wicket win.

5|$|It was {{the first}} time since the 1996 postseason that <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>team</b> won both of the conference {{championship}} games.

Two minutes before full-time, Barmby, on as a substitute, scored the winning goal, rebounding a shot that came off the post.
