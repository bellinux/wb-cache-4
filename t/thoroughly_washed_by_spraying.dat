40|$|Attention {{is drawn}} {{to the degree of}} {{contamination}} of anaesthetic equipment and the responsibility resting upon anaesthetists for disinfecting all apparatus between cases. Possible methods of disinfection are briefly reviewed. Reasons of efficiency, conveni-ence, cost and practicability are given for suggesting that a domestic washing-up machine is the best form of disinfection so far devised. Although Ziegler and Jacoby (1956) suggested that corrugated tubing and reservoir bags may not be significantly contaminated with bacteria by patients, anaesthetists have become increas-ingly aware of the existence and dangers of such contamination of the equipment they use. The role played by this vehicle in postoperative in-fection has not yet been ascertained but it is now well known that ventilators used in inten-sive care can be responsible for both re-infection and cross-infection. An editorial on this matter (1964) leaves the reader in no doubt that the risk is real and that the anaesthetist must make it his duty to ensure that cross-infection will not occur. The editorial {{goes so far as to}} suggest that the same standards should be applied to the work of the anaesthetist as to that of the surgeon. Our interest in this problem was sharply stimulated by two recent outbreaks of post-operative chest infection which followed the opening of theatre suites. Before the introduction of the method of disinfection herein described, only the endotracheal tubes, connections and the pharyngeal airways received attention. These were <b>thoroughly</b> <b>washed</b> <b>by</b> hand, autoclaved and packaged. Laryngoscopes were washed under the tap by the theatre attendant. Under these circumstances bacteriological in-vestigation showed that parts of the anaesthetic equipment yielded profuse growths of Staph. aureus, Strep, faecalis, Esch. coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, as well as Ps. pyocyanea and Prot. vulgaris. The accepted methods of disinfection were considered, namely high and low temperature autoclaving, boiling, steeping in antiseptic, e. g. chlorhexidine (Stratford, Clark and Dixson, 1964), and hand washing in soap and water. All were rejected, for various reasons given below, in favour of some automatic device which would both wash and pasteurize...|$|R

It was then added onto an affinity column of p-aminomethylbenzene sulfonamide coupled to CM Bio-gel AR to purify the membrane-bound carbonic anhydrase activity. This resulted in a 50 % pure enzyme. It was then concentrated and fractionated on an anion-exchange column, and desalted and purified to homogeneity (SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing) by gel filtration.
