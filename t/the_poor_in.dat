An example {{was the case of}} Wee Theam Tew, who gave up a clerical post with Macalister & Co. and proceeded to England to further his studies in law and qualify for the Bar in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply. But in areas such as the provision of free medical care and education for children, neither of which was available to <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> England living outside workhouses until the early 20th century, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma that the Poor Law authorities never managed to reconcile.|$|E

5|$|On 22 May 1816, a {{group of}} 56{{residents}} met at The Globe Inn in Littleport to discuss the lack of work and rising grain costs. Fuelled by alcohol, the residents directed their anger at local farmer Henry Martin. He had been overseer of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> 1814 and was not well liked by the parishioners. One man went to get a horn from Burgess, the lighterman, and started blowing it outside The Globe Inn, gathering hundreds of villagers to join the first group, and the riot commenced.|$|E
5|$|The 19th century saw major {{development}} in healthcare in Arbroath. In 1836 a dispensary {{was set up}} by public subscription to provide medical care for <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> 1842 a typhus epidemic in the town {{led to the creation of}} a small fever ward to keep patients in isolation. The following year subscriptions began to be taken to develop this into Arbroath Infirmary, which opened in 1845, and moved to new premises in 1916.|$|E
5|$|The Maundy Dish {{is one of}} six used by the Queen at Royal Maundy for {{handing out}} alms to elderly people in {{recognition}} of their service {{to the church and}} local community. The ceremony, which takes place in a different cathedral every year, entirely replaced the ancient custom of washing the feet of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> 1730, and the dish, though it bears the royal cypher of William and Mary, dates from the reign of CharlesII. Two purses containing specially minted coins are taken from the dish and presented to each recipient.|$|E

5|$|The poverty Henson {{had seen}} during his {{six months in}} Birkenhead gave him a strong impetus to {{minister}} to <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> 1887, after being ordained deacon, he {{took charge of the}} Oxford House Settlement, a high-church mission in Bethnal Green, a poor area of the East End of London.

5|$|At {{the age of}} ten, Zita {{was sent}} to a {{boarding}} school at Zanberg in Upper Bavaria, where there was a strict regime of study and religious instruction. She was summoned home in the autumn of 1907 at the death of her father. Her maternal grandmother sent Zita and her sister Franziska to a convent on the Isle of Wight to complete her education. Brought up as devout Catholics, the Parma children regularly undertook good works for <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> Schwarzau the family turned surplus cloth into clothes. Zita and Franziska personally distributed food, clothing, and medicines to the needy in Pianore. Three of Zita's sisters became nuns and, for a time, she considered following the same path. Zita went through a patch of poor health and was sent for the traditional cure at a European spa for two years.|$|E
5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce {{separation of church and}} state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU was involved in the Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E

5|$|Harriet Fisher Jones {{was born}} on 2 May 1841 in Warrington to her father, Evan Jones, a tinsmith, and his wife, Harriet Jones. As {{she and her mother}} shared the same name, she became better known as Jeannie. In 1860, she married a fruit merchant, Robert Willis, and the couple {{travelled}} to New York City, where she took an interest in the black rights movement. On her return to England, she and her husband settled in London and had a son, Robert Frederick Evan Willis, better known as Fred. Willis spent some time helping <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> the slums of London. She was heavily influenced by the works of Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin, setting her on the path of socialism.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Faithfull {{became the}} {{principal}} of Cheltenham Ladies' College, succeeding Dorothea Beale. She remained in that position for 15 years. In 1920, she became Justice of the Peace for Cheltenham, {{becoming one of the}} first women magistrates in England. Faithfull was active as a social worker, improving social conditions for <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> London, and was chair of a committee to improve nutrition in children. She founded the Old People's Housing Society in Cheltenham, later renamed the Lilian Faithfull Homes. Faithfull was the model for the Helen Butterfield character in The Constant Nymph, a 1924 novel by Margaret Kennedy (a former student of Cheltenham). She was a Fellow of King's College London and received a honorary MA from Oxford in 1925. In 1926 Faithfull was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She never married.|$|E
5|$|In London, {{there was}} a great massing of the poor, and the Reformation {{threatened}} to eliminate some of the infrastructure used to provide for the poor. As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from voluntary contributions, so it instituted the first definite compulsory Poor Rate in 1547 which replaced Sunday collections in Church with a mandatory collection for <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of poor who could work, but yet could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King’s Palace at Bridewell where poor could receive shelter and work at cap-making, feather-bed making, and wire drawing.|$|E

5|$|Recalling her {{inability}} to help the wounded people whom she saw during the Second World War, Hsu {{decided to become a}} nurse. As she was overaged at 47, she wrote a request to the chief matron of the Nursing Council in London. Touched by Hsu's sincerity and dedication, her application was accepted. She spent eight years in England doing nursing and another eight in Paraguay {{as a member of the}} German charity group Bruderhof, to start hospitals and homes for the aged there. In her mid-50s, she decided to return home to Penang to be with her mother. In Malaysia, she assisted her brother in starting the Assunta Foundation for <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> <b>in</b> Ipoh. She also played a key role in the startup of three homes for the elderly and two homes for young girls and neglected children in Ipoh.|$|E
5|$|Rodham then entered Yale Law School, {{where she}} {{served on the}} {{editorial}} board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action. During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center, learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973). She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing. Edelman later became a significant mentor. Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.|$|E
5|$|The Diocese {{established}} an institute to train female schoolteachers for the Anglican schools in Brighton {{and the rest}} of Sussex in Black Lion Street in The Lanes (the ancient heart of the town) in April 1842. This was done in association with the National Society for the Education of <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> <b>in</b> the Principles of the Established Church. More space was soon needed, so in 1854 it found a site {{on the west side of}} Ditchling Road on which to build a larger college. Ditchling Road, which ran across Ditchling Beacon to Ditchling village and then on to Cuckfield and eventually London, became a turnpike in 1770 and was thereafter one of the main north–south routes into and out of Brighton. The chosen site was on the north side of Viaduct Road, which was built to link Ditchling and London Roads and which formed the northern edge of Brighton's ecclesiastical parish and municipal borough until 1873.|$|E

5|$|The {{hospital}} of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, {{was established by}} Bishop Andreas before 1237 for {{the aid of the}} poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} pigeon was exceptional {{for a number}} of reasons. In modern times, it is the only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct even though it was once the most numerous species of bird on Earth. Its former numbers are difficult to estimate, but one ornithologist, Alexander Wilson, estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds. The decline of the species was abrupt; in 1871, a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds, yet the last individual in the species was dead by 1914. Although habitat loss was a contributing factor, the species is thought to have been massively over-hunted, being used as food for slaves and, later, <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> <b>in</b> the United States throughout the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of Kenyatta's succession {{had been an}} issue of debate in Kenya ever since independence, and he had not unreservedly nominated a successor. However, the transition of power proved smooth, something which surprised many international commentators. As Vice President, Moi {{was sworn in as}} Acting President for a 90-day interim period. In October he was unanimously elected KANU President and subsequently declared President of Kenya itself. Moi emphasised his loyalty to Kenyatta—"I followed and was faithful to him until his last day, even when his closest friends forsook him"—and there was much expectation that he would continue the policies inaugurated by Kenyatta. He nevertheless criticised the corruption, land grabbing, and capitalistic ethos that had characterised Kenyatta's period and expressed populist tendencies by emphasising a closer link to <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> 1982 he would amend the Kenyan constitution to create a de jure one-party state.|$|E
