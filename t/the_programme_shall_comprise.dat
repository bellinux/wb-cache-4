Last {{year when}} I {{referred}} to this subject, I told the House that it would be my object to remove any defects that I and those who advise me might discover in the Army system, and more especially, of course, in the schemes of Lord Kitchener. Since then, with the assistance of two very important Committees, well qualified by expert military knowledge, I {{came to the conclusion that}} an improved equipment was required. Hon. Gentlemen may think that my opinion alone would not be worth much; but, after all, civilians have got to decide these questions, and, provided that they arm themselves with the expert knowledge of military authorities, it is rightly their voice that settles the matter. Certain changes were necessary in the allocation of units in order to enable the troops to be better trained, and therefore our final conclusion was that the special military expenditure shown in the financial statement must go on for some years more. But the House will see that we have arranged to cut down the rate of the annual grant, and we have taken care--and this, I think, ought to be set down to our credit--that every estimate for every item included in <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> <b>shall</b> be submitted to vigilant scrutiny here as well as in India. I have no prepossession in favour of military expenditure, but the pressure of facts, the pressure of the situation, the possibilities of contingencies that may arise, seem obviously to make it impossible for any Government or any Minister to acquiesce in the risks on the Indian frontier. We have to consider not only our position with respect to foreign Powers on the Indian frontier, but the exceedingly complex questions that arise in connection with the turbulent border tribes. All these things make it impossible--I say nothing about internal conditions--for any Government or any Minister with a sense of responsibility to cancel or to deal with <b>the</b> military <b>programme</b> in any high-handed or cavalier way.|$|R

This Diploma Work points out to the chicane problem area in broader context. The main goal of the Work is to compare the chicane occurrence at primary schools in the regional city and other local towns with population number up to one thousand five hundred inhabitants. A factual investigation focus is based on a long-term cooperation with the SOS Archa Centre which implements preventive programmes at primary schools in Plzeň and the Plzeň Region. Results of the investigation provide a statement of present status of the chicane problem area in the region {{and at the same time}} they discover the riskiest group of pupils who a successive intended focus of <b>the</b> preventive <b>programmes</b> <b>shall</b> be aimed at. Theoretical part of the Work defines the term "chicane, it describes its evolutionary phases, its exposures, characteristics of aggressors and victims as well as possible chicane consequences. Further on, it outlines appropriate steps leading to chicane analysis and its precaution. From the sociology point of view, a quantitative research was carried out and a method of anonymous questionnaire was used for data collection. Any obtained data were processed in the way of secondary analysis. Pupils of the first and second stage of two primary schools in the regional city and two primary schools in local towns whose population number is below one thousand five hundred presented an essential file of the research. It resulted from the research there were more children involved in chicane in a smaller town than in bigger one. Herewith the original hypothesis was refuted. The research results showed subsequently that the riskiest group endangered by chicane were boys of the second stage of primary school in local towns. The research will be used by the SOS Archa Centre for targeted and natural integrating of <b>the</b> above preventive <b>programmes</b> of schools...|$|R

The {{projects}} main purpose is to apply the knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>Programme</b> and <b>shall</b> be carried out together with a company. The project shall be driven out independently and lead to both an oral and a written presentation.   This report describes a work of improvement for Metso Paper in Karlstad, referring to the motor and drive train mechanism of two screw jacks {{that is used to}} tightening the wind or felt in the paper machine. This project has lead to a complete proposition, a description of manufacturing and is founded upon an asynchronous motor with a thoroughgoing drive shaft with two planetary gear boxes on both side of the motor. This solution is a result of an evaluation of different concept (chapter 2), regarding common motors and gears on the market. The reason that we used this motor and gears is mainly due to the minor space requirements that such solution can accomplish, with an inline drive train. The solution shall be able to fit different configurations of screw jacks, regarding the size of motor, ratio of gears and the length between the jacks. This is mainly done with adjustments of the holder, to fit the motor {{and the rest of the}} drive train. But this is basically the same solution. Subsequently the motor, gears and other components is selected accordingly to this report and we have chosen to show our solution fully on the screw jacks A 50 that is placed in configuration that is about 6 m apart. Further, due to the conditions in the paper machine, a cover has been designed to prevent the paper pulp to come in direct contact with motor and drive train.   The requirements that Metso Paper has set up is that the solution should be able to come as a module, meaning in our case that the motor, drive train and holder can be delivered as one unit together with a parallel shaft that connects the two screw jacks. ...|$|R
