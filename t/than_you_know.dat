500|$|Truman {{continues}} to sail until – {{to his surprise}} – his boat punctures {{the wall of the}} dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is [...] "no more truth" [...] in the real world and [...] "I know you better <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> yourself", that he brings comfort to his audience and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: [...] "You never had a camera in my head!" [...] and [...] "In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night," [...] previously his unwitting catch-phrase, takes a bow, and leaves. Watching the show at home, Sylvia races to meet Truman, while Christof's supervisors end the show for the last time and the audience starts looking for something else to watch.|$|E
500|$|The World's Most Phallic Building contest was {{a contest}} held in 2003 by Cabinet {{magazine}} {{to find the}} building which most resembled a human phallus. The contest originated when writer Jonathan Ames drew the ire of Slate readers by claiming, in a diary that was later published in his book I Love You More <b>Than</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know,</b> that the Williamsburg Bank Building in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, was the world's most phallic. This led Cabinet magazine to initiate a search of its own to find which building was truly the [...] "world's most phallic". Cities and readers subsequently poured in their views and staked their claims to the magazine's editors. After months of entries and discussion, the Ypsilanti Water Tower was announced as the winner, [...] although the winner of a readers' poll was the Florida State Capitol building in Tallahassee. Another notable nominee was the Torre Agbar of Barcelona.|$|E

500|$|Kelefa Sanneh wrote a lukewarm {{review of}} the album in The New York Times, believing that Jay-Z's {{reluctance}} to indulge in the gangsta rap lyricism of his past resulted in wavering, equivocal songs such as [...] "No Hook" [...] and [...] "Say Hello". [...] "Once, words just seemed to flow out of him, as if he couldn't help himself", Sanneh wrote. [...] "Now it's clearer than ever that he's choosing them carefully." [...] Louis Pattison of NME was more critical and called it a regression from the [...] "slightly bloated" [...] Kingdom Come, lamenting the shortage of [...] "don't-give-a-fuck attitude" [...] highlighted on [...] "Success" [...] in favor of less effective raps exploiting Jay-Z's entrepreneurial personage. In MSN Music, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Say Hello" [...] and [...] "Blue Magic" [...] as highlights while humorously using sampled film dialogue from the latter track to frame his lukewarm opinion of the album: [...] "Jay-Z, that's a brand name, like Pepsi, that's a brand name – he stands behind it, he guarantees it, even if you don't know him any more <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the chairman of Universal Music".|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, in her {{review for}} TrekNation, {{said that it}} wasn't {{as good as the}} {{previous}} episode and thought that there were plot holes. She felt that some of the episode featured bad science, such as when Tucker was transferred between the two ships. She also criticised Archer going down to the Klingon base on his own, calling him a [...] "putz" [...] and said of the Klingon attack, [...] "since when do Klingons destroy ships with deadly subroutines rather <b>than,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> BOMBS?" [...] She thought the characterisation was forced, and wanted a better resolution to the events in [...] "Affliction" [...] which she had called [...] "one of the greatest hours of Star Trek ever". Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", gave the episode a score of two out of four, saying that the battle scenes were [...] "painfully routine" [...] and that where the episode [...] "runs off the rails is in these final 10 minutes". He felt that it was a pattern of the final episodes in story arcs not having a [...] "satisfying finish" [...] and that [...] "Divergence" [...] followed in this pattern set by [...] "The Augments" [...] and [...] "The Aenar". The two part story in [...] "Affliction" [...] and [...] "Divergence" [...] were subsequently ranked the fifth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt.|$|E
