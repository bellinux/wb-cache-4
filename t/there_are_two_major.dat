5|$|At present, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> {{methods of}} {{producing}} isotopes of transplutonium elements: (1) irradiation of the lighter elements with either neutrons or (2) accelerated charged particles. The first method {{is most important}} for applications, as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.|$|E

5|$|Most of the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is flat, with a {{slope of}} 0 to 3 percent. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> lines of hills in the watershed, {{one of which}} is in the northern part and the other of which is in {{the central part of the}} watershed. These lines of hills have a slope of 3 to 8 percent.

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> valleys in the park, Death Valley and Panamint Valley. Both {{of these}} valleys were formed {{within the last}} few million years and both are bounded by north–south-trending {{mountain}} ranges. These and adjacent valleys follow the general trend of Basin and Range topography with one modification: there are parallel strike-slip faults that perpendicularly bound the central extent of Death Valley. The result of this shearing action is additional extension in {{the central part of}} Death Valley which causes a slight widening and more subsidence there.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> versions {{of his birth}} and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and {{it is impossible to}} tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Production of lead is {{increasing}} worldwide {{due to its}} use in lead–acid batteries. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> categories of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64million from secondary production. The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of refined lead were China, the United States, and South Korea. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010, {{the total amount of}} lead in use, stockpiled, discarded or dissipated into the environment, on a global basis, is 8kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries (20–150kg per capita) rather than less developed ones (1–4kg per capita).|$|E

5|$|The antbird family {{contains}} over 200 species, variously called antwrens, antvireos, antbirds and antshrikes. The names {{refer to}} the relative sizes of the birds (increasing in the order given, though with exceptions) rather than any particular resemblance to the true wrens, vireos or shrikes. In addition, members of the genus Phlegopsis are known as bare-eyes, Pyriglena as fire-eyes and Neoctantes and Clytoctantes as bushbirds. Although the systematics of the Thamnophilidae is based on studies from the mid-19th century, when fewer than half the present species were known, comparison of the myoglobin intron 2, GAPDH intron 11 and the mtDNA cytochrome b DNA sequences has largely confirmed it. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> clades – most antshrikes and other larger, strong-billed species as well as Herpsilochmus, versus the classical antwrens and other more slender, longer-billed species – and the monophyly of most genera was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> {{reproductive}} {{strategies of}} teleosts; semelparity and iteroparity. In the former, an individual breeds once after reaching maturity and then dies. This {{is because the}} physiological changes that come with reproduction eventually lead to death. Salmon of the genus Oncorhynchus are well known for this feature; they hatch in fresh water and then migrate to the sea for up to four years before travelling back to their place of birth where they spawn and die. Semelparity is also known to occur in some eels and smelts. The majority of teleost species have iteroparity, where mature individuals can breed multiple times during their lives.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> stadiums and {{an arena}} within FSU's main campus: Doak Campbell Stadium for football, Dick Howser Stadium for men's baseball, and the Donald L. Tucker Center for men's and women's basketball. The Mike Long Track {{is the home}} of the {{national}} champion men's outdoor track and field team. H. Donald Loucks courts at the Speicher Tennis Center {{is the home of}} the FSU tennis team. By presidential directive the complex was named in honor of Lieutenant Commander Michael Scott Speicher, a graduate of Florida State University and the first American casualty during Operation Desert Storm. The Seminole Soccer Complex is home to women's soccer. It normally holds a capacity of 1,600 people but has seen crowds in excess of 4,500 for certain games. The home record is 4,582 for the 2006 game versus the University of Florida. The FSU women's softball team plays at the Seminole Softball Complex; the field is named for JoAnne Graf, the winningest coach in softball history.|$|E
