This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most <b>talented</b> <b>people</b> to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs. Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. Finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate.|$|E

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the planning for what became The Owen School, the goal was to create a graduate business school of “the highest professional quality” with a two-year program leading to an MBA. Most students in the early years were young men from Tennessee and surrounding states, fulfilling the hopes of businessmen to keep <b>talented</b> <b>people</b> in the area, but by 2008, men and women from across the United States and from international locales had attended The Owen School. At present about 25 percent are international students, and 33 percent are women.

Although Hamilton Finlay {{is considered one of}} the most important Scottish artists of the 20th century, Stoddart profoundly disagrees with his working methods: [...] "Finlay was the godfather of a problem that's rampant everywhere today. He called the people who made his work 'collaborators'. What we call them nowadays is 'fabricators'. They're <b>talented</b> <b>people</b> who are plastically capable, but they never meet their 'artist'. They're grateful, desperate and thwarted." ...|$|E

Of Chenoweth's future with Glee beyond [...] "Home", Falchuk commented that the producers want to [...] "have her around as much as possible", and although no plans have been solidified, she may return in the second season. He expanded: [...] " [...] you have talents like that, it's very hard to not want them back.

[...] His policies provided the show with a succession of female producers and writers, many of whom went on to lead the boom in children's programming at Nickelodeon, the Disney Channel, and PBS in the 1990s and 2000s. [...] One of these women was Dulcy Singer, who later became the first female executive producer of Sesame Street.|$|E

500|$|Ed Fries, head of Microsoft Studios' {{publishing}} {{division at}} the time of acquisition, said that the company attempted to preserve Rare's culture so its staff could continue feeling that they worked for Rare rather than Microsoft. Rare employees differed about working conditions after the Microsoft acquisition. According to Star Fox Adventures lead engineer Phil Tossell, conditions became more stressful after an [...] "imperceptible" [...] start, and the culture of the two companies began clashing with each other. Tossell said that Microsoft gradually imposed a corporate structure on Rare, including more performance reviews and meetings, to which some Rare members found difficulty in adapting. Some admitted that early changes, such as permitting team members to discuss projects they were not working on and allowing staff members to use the internet or listen to music during work hours, were beneficial to team morale. Betteridge called the overall change [...] "positive", saying that Microsoft's capital could help Rare develop their projects. Former Rare employee Gavin Price said that some Microsoft executives, such as Phil Spencer, were supportive of the developer. Grant Kirkhope, a former composer at Rare, strongly criticised Microsoft for ruining Rare. Fansite Rare-Extreme documented {{a day in the life}} at Rare in 2008 with two employees showing a 9 till 5 work schedule. Former Xbox executive Peter Moore voiced his disappointment with Rare's works after the acquisition. He noted that Rare employees were attempting to [...] "recreate the glory years", but their skills had become outdated and were no longer [...] "applicable in today's market".
