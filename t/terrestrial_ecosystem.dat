5|$|All in all, a GRB {{within a}} few parsecs, with its energy {{directed}} towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during the burst itself {{and for a few}} years thereafter. Models show that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage. It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.|$|E
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E

Since the tropical rainforests are estimated to hold 50% of the planet's species, the canopy of rainforests worldwide may hold 45% of life on Earth. The Amazon rainforest borders 8 countries, it has the world's largest river basin and the source of 1/5 of the Earth's river water. It has the world's highest diversity of birds and freshwater fish.

40|$|Despite the {{agreement}} that China’s <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> can provide a carbon sink and offset carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from fossil fuels, the magnitude and spatial distribution of the sink remain uncertain. Accurate quantification of the carbon sequestration capacity of China’s <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> has profound scientific and policy implications. Here, {{we report on the}} magnitude and patterns of China’s terrestrial carbon sink using the global monthly CO 2 flux data product from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), the world’s first satellite dedicated to global greenhouse gas observation. We use the first year’s data from GOSAT (June 2009 –May 2010) that are currently available to assess China’s biospheric carbon fluxes. Our results show that China’s <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> provide a carbon sink of − 0. 21 Pg C a− 1. The consumption of fossil fuels in China leads to carbon dioxide emissions of 1. 90 Pg C a− 1 into the atmosphere, approximately 11. 1 % of which is offset by China’s <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> China’s <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{play a significant role in}} offsetting fossil fuel emissions and slowing down the buildup of CO 2 in the atmosphere.

40|$|Because {{protected}} areas {{are a major}} means of conservation, {{the extent to which}} ecosystems are represented under different protection regimes needs to be ascertained. A gap analysis approach was used to assess the representativeness of Chile's <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in differing kinds of {{protected areas}}. <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> were described in terms of potential vegetation, employing three protection scenarios. Scenario 1 was based exclusively on the Chilean National System of Protected Wild Areas (SNASPE). Scenario 2 included all types of public protected areas, namely SNASPE, nature sanctuaries and Ministry of National Heritage lands. Scenario 3 included all items in Scenario 2, but also included private protected areas and biodiversity priority sites. There is insufficient protection of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> under the Scenario 2. In addition to the low level of ecosystem protection provided by state protected areas (only 42 of the 127 <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> had > 10 % of their area protected), 23 <b>terrestrial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> were identified as having no protection at the national level.
