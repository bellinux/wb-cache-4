5|$|<b>The</b> <b>electric</b> {{field was}} {{formally}} {{defined as the}} force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> field is the local gradient of <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> potential. Usually expressed in voltspermetre, the vector direction of the field is the line of greatest slope of potential, and where the equipotentials lie closest together.|$|E
5|$|A few teleosts are dangerous.

5|$|The {{concept of}} <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> field was {{introduced}} by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. <b>The</b> <b>electric</b> field acts between two charges {{in a similar manner}} to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.|$|E

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, the brightness of <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> arc {{is a source of}} the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> arc.|$|E
