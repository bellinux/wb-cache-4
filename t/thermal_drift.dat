25|$|Circuits with defined {{control voltage}} of the divider can {{compensate}} for the <b>thermal</b> <b>drift</b> of the LED in a RO, {{but not for the}} memory effect and <b>thermal</b> <b>drift</b> of the photoresistor. The latter compensation requires a second (reference) photoresistor, which is illuminated by the same light intensity, at the same temperature as the main (modulating) device. Best compensation is achieved when both photoresistors are formed on the same semiconductor chip. The reference photoresistor is included in a divider of stabilized voltage or in a measuring bridge. The error amplifier compares the voltage at the middle point of the divider with the target value and adjusts the controlling current. In the linear controlling regime the RO becomes an analog multiplier: the current through the photoresistor is proportional to the product of the voltage across the photoresistor and the control voltage.|$|E

50|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{resistance of}} a conducting element, usually a copper trace in Printed circuit Board(PCB) can use {{be used as}} sensing element instead of a shunt resistor. Since no additional resistor is required this approach promises a low-cost and space saving configuration with no additional power losses either. Naturally, the voltage drop of a copper trace is very low due to its very low resistance, making {{the presence of a}} high gain amplifier mandatory {{in order to get a}} useful signal.There are several physical effects which may alter the current measurement process: <b>thermal</b> <b>drift</b> of the copper trace, initial conditions of the trace resistance etc. Therefore, this approach is not suitable for applications that require a reasonable accuracy due to the large <b>thermal</b> <b>drift.</b> In order to overcome the problems associated with the temperature drift, a digital controller can be used for <b>thermal</b> <b>drift</b> compensation and calibration of the copper trace.A significant drawback of this kind of current sensor is the unavoidable electrical connection between the current to be measured and the sense circuit. By employing a so-called isolation amplifier, electrical isolation can be added. However, these amplifiers are expensive and can also deteriorate the bandwidth, accuracy and <b>thermal</b> <b>drift</b> of the original current sensing technique. For these reasons, current sensing techniques based on physical principles that provide intrinsic electrical isolation deliver a better performance at lower costs in applications where isolation is required.|$|E

Traditionally, an AFM cannot scan images as fast as an SEM, requiring several minutes for a typical scan, while an SEM is capable of scanning at near real-time, although at relatively low quality.

50|$|A {{magneto-resistor}} (MR) is a two terminal device which {{changes its}} resistance parabolically with applied magnetic field. This {{variation of the}} resistance of MR due to the magnetic field {{is known as the}} Magnetoresistive Effect. It is possible to build structures in which the electrical resistance varies as a function of applied magnetic field. These structures can be used as magnetic sensors. Normally these resistors are assembled in a bridge configuration to compensate for <b>thermal</b> <b>drift.</b> Popular magneto resistance-based sensors are: Anisotropic Magneto Resistance (AMR), Giant Magneto Resistance (GMR), Giant Magneto Impendence (GMI) and Tunnel Magneto Resistance (TMR). All these MR-based sensors have higher sensitivity compared to Halleffect sensors. Despite of this, these sensors (GMR, CMR, and TMR) are still more expensive than Hall-effect devices, have serious drawbacks related with nonlinear behavior, distinct <b>thermal</b> <b>drift,</b> and a very strong external field can permanently alter the sensor behavior (GMR). GMI and TMR sensors are even more sensitive than GMR based sensors, but still in the test phase and no commercial version are available today.|$|E

Piezoelectric creep can also be a problem, so the microscope often needs time to settle after large movements before constant height imaging can be performed.|$|E

That is why the necessary heat output and power consumption for a thermal bimorph actuator is relatively high.

5000|$|Shunts {{are rated}} by maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500 A, 75 mV shunt {{would have a}} {{resistance}} of 0.15 milliohms, a maximum allowable current of 500 amps and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 millivolts. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50 mV, 75 mV or 100 mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100 mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, {{at which point the}} derating factor must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly. At 80 °C <b>thermal</b> <b>drift</b> begins to occur, at 120 °C <b>thermal</b> <b>drift</b> is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140 °C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to annealing resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. [...] If the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself. Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg (grounded side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are Hall effect current sensors and current transformers (see clamp meters). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common accuracy of such devices are ±0.1% & 0.25% and 0.5%.|$|E

Because the topographic image and the tunneling spectroscopy data are obtained nearly simultaneously, there is nearly perfect registry of topographic and spectroscopic data. As a practical concern, the number of pixels in the scan or the scan area may be reduced to prevent piezo creep or <b>thermal</b> <b>drift</b> from moving the feature of study or the scan area during the duration of the scan.
