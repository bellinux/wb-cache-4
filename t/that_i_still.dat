Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.|$|E

The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom FernandoII, King-consort of Portugal: [...] "By the time you receive this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone... God who has made me pass though so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." [...] PedroII had already lost another son, Dom Afonso, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: [...] "Twice already I have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." [...] Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.|$|E

She had little money and worked as a waitress at Dunkin' Donuts and with modern dance troupes, taking classes at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and eventually performing with Pear Lang Dance Theater. Madonna said of her move to New York, [...] "It was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi cab. I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I'd ever done." [...] She started to work as a backup dancer for other established artists. Madonna claimed that during a late night she was returning from a rehearsal, when a pair of men held her at knifepoint and forced her to perform fellatio. Madonna later commented that [...] "the episode was a taste of my weakness, it showed me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> could not save myself {{in spite of all the}} strong-girl show.

500|$|Rivera is {{a devout}} Christian. During his childhood, {{neither he nor}} his family {{attended}} church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, [...] "I am glad we lost the World Series, because it means <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> have a friend." [...] Rivera's pitching glove was inscribed [...] "Phil. 4:13", in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 ("I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me").|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E
500|$|Sanctuary {{was mostly}} filmed on virtual green screen sets. Initially Tapping went through {{what she called}} [...] "chroma key green headaches" [...] because she had to stare at nothing but bright green walls {{for the first few}} days. When she got used to it, she likened filming on green screen to working in theatre. In the second season her daughter, Ashley was killed off. The producers, as well as the American and Canadian {{networks}} to give the character, including Magnus, a deep and most dramatic impact. They also wanted Magnus to feel more angry and vulnerable throughout the season, especially in the first three episodes. After playing Magnus in the series' third season, Tapping admitted that she still does not get Magnus because [...] "there's so many things about the decisions that she makes <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> can't wrap my head around, and to me that's fascinating as an actor, to try to get inside somebody so complex and so kind of confusing." [...] In the episode [...] "Normandy", Tapping wore a red-haired wig for Magnus during her time in the Second World War, as an homage to her late grandmother. For the fourth season, Tapping requested that Magnus would be given a new love interest. The request was granted {{in the form of a}} female virologist appearing early in the season (thus establishing Magnus's bisexuality).|$|E

[...] While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosiński to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.|$|E

His singing career reached stellar status in 1990 with the release of the album entitled [...] "Would It Be Possible" [...] (可不可以), and his subsequent releases only solidified his status as a marketable singer.

Some of these songs might not be instantly accessible, but I (immodestly) think they are all quite special." [...] A few of the album's songs are somewhat similar to the ones found in Play, but the tracks were criticized as inferior by AllMusic's John Bush, who gave the release three out of five stars. Moby realized this and even admitted that if not for the overwhelming success of Play, the songs would not have been given a wide release. Neva Chonin from Rolling Stone gave it three-and-a-half stars and said it was [...] "more of a meditative tone poem" [...] than the [...] "millennial time signature" [...] that was Play.|$|E

2500|$|From that {{statement}} of March 1834, {{it does not}} appear that animosity still existed on the composer's part. Through an intermediary, Bordesi (or Bordese), a mutual friend of both men, Romani initially expressed interest in re-establishing friendly relations with Bellini. Thus, Bellini wrote back to the intermediary stating: [...] "Tell my dear Romani <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> love him even though he is a cruel man" [...] and he continues by wondering if Romani ever thinks about him where he, Bellini, says [...] "whereas I do nothing but to talk about him to the entire universe". Then he ends with: [...] "Give him a kiss for me". This was followed by a letter to Florimo in late May where Bellini wishes to know if Romani reciprocated his feelings, which—it appears—did happen when he writes to Romani himself (most likely expansion of the initial draft) laying out a series of concerns, but quoting back to him a part of his own letter to Bordese in which Romani states [...] "I have not ceased to love him , for I recognise that the blame is not all his".|$|E

Socialist French parliamentarian André Vallini reportedly claimed that Bongo had bankrolled numerous French electoral campaigns, both Right and Left. In 2008, French President, Nicolas Sarkozy demoted his minister in charge of looking after the ex-colonies, Jean-Marie Bockel, after the latter noted the [...] "squandering of public funds" [...] by some African regimes, provoking Mr. Bongo's fury.He made his country and his oil industry available as a source of offshore slush funds", said political analyst Nicholas Shaxson, {{the author of a book}} on Africa's oil states.
