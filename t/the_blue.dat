5|$|After {{being drafted}} by <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets, Filatov signed a three-year {{contract}} with the club on July 10, 2008. His base salary for the contract was $875,000, with bonus clauses that could bring the value as high as $1.35million per season. His signing with Columbus created some controversy within the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), however, as League President Alexander Medvedev claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets owed CSKA Moscow compensation of at least $1.5million for signing Filatov. Medvedev claimed that although the term of the contract had expired, under Russian law it did not terminate until an indemnity amount had been negotiated. <b>The</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets and Filatov believed that giving his club 30 days notice was sufficient to terminate the contract. CSKA threatened to withhold Filatov's transfer card, thus impeding his ability to play in another league, but Filatov, his lawyers and <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets believed they had followed the necessary tenets of Russian law. Filatov's contract was one of six reviewed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) {{in an attempt to}} mediate the disputes between the KHL and NHL. During this investigation, the players were unable to play international hockey sanctioned by the IIHF. In September, the KHL dropped its opposition to Filatov's contract with <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets, and he received his transfer.|$|E

5|$|Columbus started March with a 2–0 shutout {{against the}} Colorado Avalanche. They {{proceeded}} {{to win their}} next game against the Phoenix Coyotes 5–2, which {{marked the first time}} that <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets posted back-to-back regulation victories during the season. Columbus again defeated the Coyotes three days later to earn their first three-game win streak of the season. They extended the streak to four with a win over the Los Angeles Kings before it came to an end with a 4–1 loss to the St. Louis Blues. It was the only four-game win streak of the season for <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets. They immediately matched their four-game win streak with a four-game losing streak and with ten games remaining, <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets were the first team eliminated from playoff contention. Shortly after being eliminated, they were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers 6–3; the loss clinched last place in the NHL for Columbus. It {{was the first time in}} franchise history <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets finished in 30th place.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{enormous}} size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case in National Geographic Magazine {{of a blue}} whale being attacked by orcas off the Baja California Peninsula; the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, but <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> whale sustained serious wounds and probably {{died as a result}} of them shortly after the attack. In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale off California, with one of them biting the tip of <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> whale's tail fluke. <b>The</b> <b>blue</b> whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed. A similar incident happened on May 18, 2017 in Monterey Bay, with the orcas swimming in a line up to <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> whale's side. <b>The</b> <b>blue</b> whale fled and escaped. Orcas have virtually no chance against an adult blue whale, but may attack them on occasion anyway for their own enjoyment. Up to a quarter of <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.|$|E

5|$|During the {{off-season}} <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets parted ways with defensemen Jan Hejda, Anton Stralman, Sami Lepisto and Mike Commodore. Hejda, who played {{four of his}} first five NHL seasons with <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets, was offered a contract by Columbus, but felt that the organization undervalued him and left via free agency. Columbus had offered him a three-year, $7.5 million contract. He instead signed a four-year, $13 million deal with the Colorado Avalanche. Stralman and Lepisto were not given qualifying offers which made them unrestricted free agents, and both signed with other teams. Commodore had originally signed a big contract with <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets in 2008, but fell out of favor. He was waived, sent to the minors and eventually had his contract bought out. In order to replace the departed players, Columbus not only acquired James Wisniewski, but also signed ten-year NHL veteran Radek Martinek. Martinek played only seven games with <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets before suffering a concussion and missing {{the remainder of the}} season. Brett Lebda was brought in to replace him.|$|E
5|$|Filatov did {{not make}} the team after {{attending}} training camp with <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets, instead making his North American professional debut for <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch. On October 15, 2008, however, Filatov was called up to the NHL, playing in his first game and scoring his first goal with <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets on October 17 against the Nashville Predators. For the rest of the 2008–09 season, Filatov split time between the AHL and the NHL. He played eight games with <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Jackets, finishing the season with four goals. He became the first Blue Jackets rookie to record a hat-trick in the January 10, 2009, game against the Minnesota Wild. At the end of the season, Filatov had played 39 games with the Crunch in the AHL, scoring 16 goals and 16 assists. For his performances, he was named as a starter for the PlanetUSA team in the 2009 AHL All-Star Game.|$|E
