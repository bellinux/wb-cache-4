25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most securitizations are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan. Fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets, such as home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans. Prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to uncover the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> {{violence}} <b>underlying</b> the life histories of institutionalized women from the women's perspective and point of view. We analysed the life histories of six women who began their life trajectories in situations of vulnerability as adults. The results show that these life trajectories are affected by various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>underlying</b> intrafamily and gender-based violence against women. One of the main conclusions is that violence, whether intrafamily or gender-based, is an important factor in gender-specific social exclusion, added to which is a lack of institutional support. This forms a barrier that prevents or hinders women with dependants from escaping the violence by themselves, and for this reason it can be considered institutional violence (insofar as the state tolerates and allows it) ...|$|R

50|$|VADs are {{distinct}} from artificial hearts, which {{are designed to}} assume cardiac function, and generally require {{the removal of the}} patient's heart. Moreover, VADs are designed to assist either the right ventricle (RVAD) or the left ventricle (LVAD), or to assist both ventricles (BiVAD). The type of ventricular assistance device applied depends upon the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>underlying</b> heart disease, and upon the pulmonary arterial-resistance, which determines the workload of the right ventricle. The left-ventricle assistance device (LVAD) is the most common device applied to a defective heart (as it is sufficient in most cases -the right side of the heart is then often already able {{to make use of the}} heavily increased blood flow-), but when the pulmonary arterial-resistance is high, then an (additional) right-ventricle assistance device (RVAD) might be necessary to resolve the problem of cardiac circulation.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the accuracy of item parameter standard error of estimates (SEEs) produced by BILOG-MG 3 by examining their performance under a variety of conditions. The Factors manipulated in this study were <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>underlying</b> difficulty (b) distribution, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>underlying</b> discrimination (a) distribution, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>underlying</b> lower asymptote (c) distribution, test length (I), <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>underlying</b> latent trait (2 ̆ 6 thgr;) distribution, sample size (J), and the number of quadrature points. ^ Results showed that the accuracy of the estimated SEb under the 1 PL, 2 PL, and 3 PL models depended on the magnitude of the b parameter being estimated. Under the 1 PL model, the accuracy of the estimated SEb was related to the underlying b and 2 ̆ 6 thgr; distributions as well as I. The 2 PL model results showed that the accuracy of the estimated SEb was related to I, but no other factors in this study {{had an impact on the}} accuracy of estimation of SEb under this model. For the 3 PL model, results showed that the accuracy of the estimated SEb tended to be impacted by I, while certain combinations of J, I, underlying b distribution, and underlying a distribution had consistently uniform accuracy of estimation of SEb across the range of b parameters studied. ^ When considering the accuracy of the estimated SEa, the 2 PL and 3 PL model results showed that the accuracy depended upon the magnitude of the a parameter being estimated, while an increase in I increased the accuracy of the estimated SEa under the 2 PL and 3 PL models. Moreover, 2 PL and 3 PL model results showed the accuracy of the estimated SEa was related to the underlying item a, b, and 2 ̆ 6 thgr; distributions as well as J and I, when the entire range of a parameters was considered. ^ The accuracy of the estimated SEc under the 3 PL model was independent of the magnitude of the item c parameter being estimated and unaffected by any combination of factors studied. The implications and limitations of these results are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring {{of three}} moraine lakes (two {{of which are}} located on frontal moraines, and one is lateral) lasted some years.

Direct contact of lake water with glacier ice gives its temperature during ablation period of 2. 54 °С or in 3. 1 times lower, than in frontal lakes. That’s why the dam quickly collapses and the lake volume increases. Dams of the lakes located on frontal moraines are subject of destruction much less. Dynamics of these lakes is caused by retreat of glaciers, and the maximum depths are fixed in {{the central part of}} a lake. Water temperature during the cold period remains here steadily positive and promotes formation of filtration channels in the layer with moraine sediments which almost without ice. The increasing of lakes occurs due to ice ablation from the nearest glacier. Precipitations, if they influence to the change of water level in lakes, are not essential. </p...|$|E
