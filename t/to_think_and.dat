5|$|The Analytical Review offered {{its readers}} {{access to a}} wide variety of works. In July 1789, when the Bastille fell, the Analytical {{reviewed}} The Rural Economy of Gloucestershire, Life of Thomas Chatterton, Transactions in Bengal, Military Operations on the Coromandel Coast, Poetry and Music of the Italian Opera, and Histoire Politique de la Revolution en France. The journal also laid provocative facts before the public to prompt them <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>and,</b> if necessary, to take action, although it claimed not to advocate one viewpoint over another. For example, when philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke issued his politically controversial Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), the Analytical Review reviewed it extensively, as well as the many responses to it, such as Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), Vindiciae Gallicae (1791) by James Mackintosh, and Rights of Man (1791) by Thomas Paine. However, the majority of the excerpts that the reviewers chose to publish came from the rebuttals to Burke's work.|$|E

Regina and the Evil Queen split into two entities, and Regina rips the evil queen's heart out and crushes it, destroying her darkness.|$|E
25|$|Many sports popular {{today were}} formalised by British Public schools and {{universities}} in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the British empire, and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> act {{as part of a}} team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as the Football Association (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{her career}} she {{recognized}} that negative symptoms and associated cognitive impairments had more debilitating effects than psychotic symptoms, like delusions and hallucinations. While psychotic symptoms represent an exaggeration of normal brain/mind functions, negative symptoms represent a loss of normal functions, for example, alogia {{the loss of the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> speak fluently, affective blunting the loss of the ability to express emotions, avolition, loss of the ability to initiate goal-directed activity, and anhedonia, loss of the ability to experience emotions. The papers describing these concepts have become citation classics, as determined by the Science Citation Index produced by the Institute for Scientific Information.|$|E

25|$|Adolescence {{is also a}} {{time for}} rapid {{cognitive}} development. Piaget describes adolescence as the stage of life in which the individual's thoughts start taking more of an abstract form and the egocentric thoughts decrease. This allows the individual <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> reason in a wider perspective. A combination of behavioural and fMRI studies have demonstrated development of executive functions, that is, cognitive skills that enable the control and coordination of thoughts and behaviour, which are generally associated with the prefrontal cortex. The thoughts, ideas and concepts developed at this period of life greatly influence one's future life, playing {{a major role in}} character and personality formation.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Elana Maryles Sztokman, in {{her book}} The Men's Section: Orthodox Jewish men in an Egalitarian World {{conducted}} research into the identities and tensions among men who belong to partnership minyans. She found that many Orthodox Jewish men choose to attend these settings due to dissatisfaction with {{the ways in which}} Orthodoxy socializes men into constructs of masculinites. Orthodoxy, according to the research, constructs a masculinity that is rooted in obedience, unquestioning performance, emotionlessless, conformity, and elitism. Men who attend partnership minyans are often disillusioned from those constructs and seek a space where they are welcome <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> act for themselves, to be warm and inclusive, to challenge socially-accepted conventions within Orthodox synagogues, and to act out a less exclusively-cerebral and more humanely emotional-spiritual variation of Jewish masculinity. This book, incidentally, won the 2012 National Jewish Book Council Award.|$|E
25|$|The {{psychological}} dependence associated with morphine addiction {{is complex and}} protracted. Long after the physical need for morphine has passed, the addict will usually continue <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> talk {{about the use of}} morphine (or other drugs) and feel strange or overwhelmed coping with daily activities without being under the influence of morphine. Psychological withdrawal from morphine is usually a very long and painful process. Addicts often suffer severe depression, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, amnesia (forgetfulness), low self-esteem, confusion, paranoia, and other psychological disorders. Without intervention, the syndrome will run its course, and most of the overt physical symptoms will disappear within 7 to 10 days including {{psychological dependence}}. A high probability of relapse exists after morphine withdrawal when neither the physical environment nor the behavioral motivators that contributed to the abuse have been altered. Testimony to morphine's addictive and reinforcing nature is its relapse rate. Abusers of morphine (and heroin) have one of the highest relapse rates among all drug users, ranging up to 98% in the estimation of some medical experts.|$|E

25|$|Relevant {{evidence}} suggests that Eleanor was not fluent in English, but was accustomed to read, and so presumably <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> speak, in French, her mother's tongue, with which {{she would have been}} familiar from childhood despite spending her early years in Spain. In this she was luckier than many medieval European queens, who often arrived in their husband's realms to face the need to learn a new language; but the English court was still functionally bilingual, in large measure through the long succession of its queens, who were mostly from French-speaking lands. In 1275, on a visit to St Albans abbey in Hertfordshire, the people of the town begged her help in withstanding the abbot's exactions from them, but one of her courtiers had to act as translator before she could respond to the plea for assistance. All the literary works noted above are in French, as are the bulk of her surviving letters, and since Peckham wrote his letters and his angelic treatise for her in French, she was presumably well known to prefer that language.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding Creelman’s glorified {{account of}} Díaz, Creelman does {{highlight}} the immediacy Díaz took to establish order—and fear—into dissenters of law {{as soon as}} he went into power in 1876. Díaz created localized bands of vigilantes, knowns as the rurales, who “punish robbery with death and requir the execution of culprits within a few hours after they were caught.” If the thief was not caught within a few hours, the chief officer of the given district would suffer the consequences. The same was said for the hacienda owner whose presumed thief Indian was not caught. Díaz continues: “It is true that we were harsh….to the point of great cruelty…. it was necessary then to the life and progress of the nation. The results have justified it” since “Mexico needed peace, even an enforced peace, that the nation might have time <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> work.” Creelman supports Díaz and states that even though Díaz “straighten out the public debt,” economized public expenditure, and industrialized the country, “his eyes were ever fixed on… a peace born of constructive and persuasive statesmanship, backed by strength, but to be maintained by force alone, when necessary—as the indispensable preliminary and accompaniment of national regeneration” In the long run, brutality and cruelty, according to Creelman’s interview of Díaz, were necessary elements to bring order, progress, and peace to Mexico.|$|E
500|$|According to Tattvarthasutra, a major Jain text, [...] "the {{severance}} of vitalities out {{of passion}} is injury".
