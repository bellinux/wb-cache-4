40|$|In most {{business}} relationships, written {{contracts are}} not drawn up, since businessmen find <b>the</b> drawing of <b>written</b> contracts both complicated and {{a waste of}} time. There are, of course, companies that draw up detailed written contracts, but those contracts are seldom applied {{as a means to}} settle disputes. Nor is the contracted party sued or threatened to be summoned to court. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>written</b> contract is available if something very extraordinary occurs. They are primarily made when their use value exceeds the cost of making of <b>the</b> <b>written</b> contracts. A detailed written contract can for instance, function as a means of communication. Since knowledge about written contracts for internal reasons is limited, there was every reason to continue studying how written contracts are used. In an endeavour to find possible factors to explain <b>the</b> use of <b>written</b> contracts, <b>the</b> interaction model is used as a point of departure (Håkansson 1982). Since contracts can be subdivided into richly varied and multidimensional processes, it is necessary to study them at a detailed level. Furthermore, to achieve a more holistic account, it is necessary to make use of both oral and written sources. In all, there are 14 propositions in this study. The empirical results demonstrate that the most important explanation for the use of <b>the</b> <b>written</b> contracts are <b>the</b> qualities inherent in <b>the</b> <b>written</b> contract itself, not the contract negotiations or the closeness between the party and other influencing factors. <b>The</b> <b>written</b> contract itself directly influences the actual use of <b>the</b> <b>written</b> contract. <b>The</b> production technologies of the individual parties, the product exchange between them, and the possible existence of standardised <b>written</b> contracts for <b>the</b> line of business in question influences <b>the</b> <b>written</b> contract. <b>The</b> closeness between the parties influences <b>the</b> <b>written</b> contract as well as the contract negotiations and the contract negotiations influence <b>the</b> <b>written</b> contract and <b>the</b> closeness between the parties...|$|R
