50|$|In 1915, he {{developed}} the <b>tephigram.</b> Shaw also studied air pollution, publishing his book The Smoke Problem of Great Cities in 1925.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tephigram</b> {{was invented}} by Napier Shaw in 1915 and is used {{primarily}} in the United Kingdom and Canada. Other countries use similar thermodynamic diagrams for the same purpose however {{the details of their}} construction vary. In the <b>tephigram,</b> isotherms are straight and have a 45 degree inclination to the right while isobars are horizontal and have a slight curve. Dry adiabats are also straight and have a 45 degree inclination to the left while moist adiabats are curved.|$|E
50|$|Meteorologists use radiosondes {{to measure}} the {{environmental}} lapse rate and {{compare it to the}} predicted adiabatic lapse rate to forecast the likelihood that air will rise. Charts of the environmental lapse rate are known as thermodynamic diagrams, examples of which include Skew-T log-P diagrams and <b>tephigrams.</b> (See also Thermals).|$|R
50|$|Radiosondes (weather balloons) {{measuring}} {{upper air}} temperatures and winds are routinely launched from five stations around New Zealand. At Whenuapai, Paraparaumu and Invercargill they are launched at 1100 and 2300 NZT. At Raoul Island they are launched daily at 1100 NZT. The upper air data are displayed on <b>tephigrams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{main reason}} that <b>tephigrams</b> {{are used by}} the British Met Office, the Meteorological Service of Canada, and Met Éireann (Irish Meteorological Service) is the {{property}} that areas contained by the curves have equal energies for equal areas, leading to better comparisons of CAPE and hence convective systems.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>tephigram</b> {{is one of}} four {{thermodynamic}} diagrams {{commonly used}} in weather analysis and forecasting. The name evolved from the original name [...] "T--gram" [...] to describe the axes of temperature (T) and entropy (...) used to create the plot. Usually, temperature and dew point data from radiosondes are plotted on these diagrams to allow calculations of convective stability or convective available potential energy (CAPE). Wind barbs are often plotted at the side of a <b>tephigram</b> to indicate the winds at different heights.|$|E
50|$|Sir William Napier Shaw FRS, (March 4, 1854 - March 23, 1945), was a British meteorologist. He {{introduced}} the air pressure unit millibar, {{as well as}} the <b>tephigram,</b> a diagram of temperature changes.|$|E
50|$|A skew-T log-P diagram {{is one of}} four {{thermodynamic}} diagrams {{commonly used}} in weather analysis and forecasting. In 1947, N. Herlofson proposed a modification to the emagram that allows straight, horizontal isobars and provides for a large angle between isotherms and dry adiabats, similar to that in the <b>tephigram.</b> It was thus more suitable for some of the newer analysis techniques being invented by the United States Air Force.|$|E
50|$|Raw {{upper air}} data is {{routinely}} ingested by numerical models. Forecasters often view {{the data in}} a graphical format, plotted on thermodynamic diagrams such as Skew-T log-P diagrams, <b>Tephigrams,</b> and or Stüve diagrams, all useful for {{the interpretation of the}} atmosphere's vertical thermodynamics profile of temperature and moisture as well as kinematics of vertical wind profile.|$|R
50|$|However, {{using this}} {{configuration}} sacrifices the equal-area {{of the original}} Clausius-Clapeyron relation requirements between {{the temperature of the}} environment and the temperature of a parcel of air lifted/lowered. Although, it permits to analyze the cloud cover and the stability of the airmass, it thus does not permit to calculate the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). This is why the three other thermodynamic diagrams (Emagrams, <b>tephigrams,</b> and Skew-T log-P diagrams) are most often preferred, the latter in the USA now.|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} {{graphical}} calculators such as intercept charts, trilinear diagrams and hexagonal charts are sometimes called nomograms. Other such {{examples include the}} Smith chart, a graphical calculator used in electronics and systems analysis, thermodynamic diagrams and <b>tephigrams,</b> used to plot the vertical structure of the atmosphere and perform calculations on its stability and humidity content. These {{do not meet the}} strict definition of a nomogram as a graphical calculator whose solution is found by the use of one or more linear isopleths.|$|R
5000|$|Evaluation of {{the nearby}} upper air station <b>tephigram</b> showed a very strong {{convective}} available potential energy (CAPE) and the hodograph had a strong wind shear in the first 4 km above ground, conducive to rotation in the convective clouds, hail, heavy rain downpours, and downbursts. There was {{a thick layer of}} clouds northwest of Montreal, near the frontal zone, but only a thin layer of low clouds further southeast. The analysis of the upper air data led to the prediction of a maximum temperature again above [...] and dew points of [...]|$|E
50|$|An emagram {{is one of}} four {{thermodynamic}} diagrams used {{to display}} temperature lapse rate and moisture content profiles in the atmosphere. The emagram has axes of temperature (T) and pressure (p). In the emagram, the dry adiabats make an angle of about 45 degrees with the isobars, isotherms are vertical and isopleths of saturation mixing ratio are almost straight and vertical. Usually, temperature and dew point data from radiosondes are plotted on these diagrams to allow calculations of convective stability or Convective Available Potential Energy. Wind barbs are often plotted at the side of a <b>tephigram</b> to indicate the winds at different heights.|$|E
50|$|The LCL can {{be either}} {{computed}} numerically, approximated by various formulas, or determined graphically using standard thermodynamic diagrams such as the Skew-T log-P diagram or the <b>Tephigram.</b> Nearly all of these formulations {{make use of the}} relationship between the LCL and the dew point, which is the temperature to which an air parcel needs to be cooled isobarically until its RH just reaches 100%. The LCL and dew point are similar, with one key difference: to find the LCL, an air parcel's pressure is decreased while it is lifted, causing it to expand, which in turn causes it to cool. To determine the dew point, in contrast, the pressure is kept constant, and the air parcel is cooled by bringing it into contact with a colder body (this is like the condensation you see on the outside of a glass full of a cold drink). Below the LCL, the dew point temperature is less than the actual ("dry bulb") temperature. As an air parcel is lifted, its pressure and temperature decrease. Its dew point temperature also decreases when the pressure is decreased, but not as quickly as its temperature decreases, so that if the pressure is decreased far enough, eventually the air parcel's temperature will be equal to the dew point temperature at that pressure. This point is the LCL; this is graphically depicted in the diagram.|$|E
40|$|A <b>tephigram</b> of BOMEX {{averaged}} thermodynamic flux vectors, {{developed from}} two tradewind budgets, is presented. The parametric model, which is utilized {{to represent the}} fluxes in the tradewind layer of the product as a mass flux and a cloud-environment difference, is examined. A table of mean structure and fluxes of a dataset for the BOMEX ship array, and the Bowen ratio and convective mass flux for a nonmixing and a cloud-top mixing model is provided. The fluxes which are displayed in a simple vector format, using the saturation point notation of Betts (1982) reveal a coupling of fluxes {{and the relationship between}} Bowen ratio and height. It is concluded that with good tradewind budget data about the statistics of cloud mixing and radiative-convective coupling can be expressed...|$|E

This evaluation, however, gives no information as to the source from which the released energy is derived; the distribution of temperature and humidity remains unchanged by the thermodynamic process on which the evaluation is based. Margules (2) calculates {{the amount of energy}} free...|$|E
40|$|Though {{the method}} of {{adiabatic}} charts {{has been applied to}} thermodynamical problems in meteorology for a long time, especially in aerology their use has been flourished remarkably during last twenty years, and in this period quick treatments of observational data of aerology and quick calculations of their heights were required, because many aerological observatories were established and at each place aerological observations were carried out several times a day. So far in meteorological circles a well known method by barometric formula has been used as procedures of height calculations for these data. (cf. 1 (i)). About twenty years ago, however, {{in order to reduce the}} complication inherent in these procedures, Stuve proposed a method to utilize adiabatic charts for this purpose, whose adoption has since prevailed quickly in the aerological circles. Moreover a few special adiabatic charts have appeared, suitable to the above requirement about the quick height calculation. At the same time some theories about height calculations on adiabatic charts and the mutual relations among these charts appeared also as below. We shall classify the recent development of these theories into the following four classes. (i) Stuve's theory to reduce the height problem of actual atmosphere on Emagram (T-logp) to that of isothermal atmosphere or dry adiabatic one. (ii) Theories of height calculation on <b>Tephigram</b> by Shaw, Brunt and Arakawa. (iii) Refsdal's theory of Aerogram. (iv) Yamaoka's theory for the transformation of adiabatic charts and his proposition of Taikisendzu (Atmospheric Chart). As shown in the above classification new adiabatic charts such as Aerogram and Taikisendzu have appeared recently, convenient to the height calculation on these diagrams. According to the author's opinion, contrary to the usual considerations about <b>Tephigram,</b> it belongs to the same family of adiabatic charts as Aerogram etc. as regards to the convenience of height calculation. Though the general theories for height calculation are described in the above classification (iii) and (iv), Yamaoka's (iv) is, however, considered to be superior to Refsdal's theory (iii). But there remains some questions to be discussed-their assumptions and mutual relations among these diagrams. In this paper we shall consider mainly these problems, and make good Yamaoka's theory, but in our paper the whole problem is treated quite differently from Yamaoka's. In 1 preliminary notes on fundamental equations and the theory for height calculation so far used are described as fundamentals for the further development of our theory. In 2 conditions to be satisfied for our aim are discussed, as the above coordinates lead to the partial differential equation of Monge-Ampere's type, its general solution being given in 3. In 4 the outline of Yamaoka's theory is described and its results are compared with ours. In 5 mutual relation among Aerogram, Taikisendzu and <b>Tephigram</b> is derived from our general formula and rough sketch of each case is also delivered...|$|E
