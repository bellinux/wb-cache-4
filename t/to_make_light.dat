5|$|The trial opens as {{originally}} scheduled, {{but the two}} Finley & Figg partners prove unequal to the task. During opening statements, Oscar suffers a myocardial infarction. Wally attempts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> of the situation by proclaiming it an example of Krayoxx's side effects. Karros moves for a mistrial and the motion is granted, leading {{to the need to}} pick a new jury and the judge imposes a fine on the already financially strained Finley & Figg. Wally stands in for Oscar as lead attorney while a new jury is seated and for the first day of testimony. The next day, the recovering alcoholic Figg is nowhere to be found although an empty pint bottle of Smirnoff Vodka is.|$|E
5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of Valve's high-dynamic-range {{technology}} adds {{a significant number of}} lighting effects to the engine, aimed at making the game appear more realistic. Bloom shading was introduced, blurring bright edges in the game world and emulating a camera's overexposure to light. This is combined with exposure control to tailor the effect to represent the human eye. For example, as the player exits a dark area into a light area, the new area is initially glaringly bright, but quickly darkens, representing the adjustment of the player character's eyes to the light. New cube mapping techniques allow the reflection cast by an object to correspond with the brightness of the light source, and lightmaps enable light bouncing and global illumination {{to be taken into account}} in the rendering. Refraction effects were added <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> account for the physical attributes of an object and to emulate the way light is reflected by water. The Lost Coast level is specifically designed to showcase these effects. It uses the sea and beach as opportunities to demonstrate water-based effects, the monastery to demonstrate bloom from its whitewash walls, and the sanctuary to provide the means to show refraction through stained glass windows and cube maps on golden urns and candlesticks.|$|E

5|$|This {{game was}} {{designed}} at Nintendo's Research and Development 1 (R) division, while the programming was {{handled by the}} external company Intelligent Systems (known as Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena at the time). The game was developed for the Family Computer Disk System (FDS) because the peripheral's Disk Card media allowed for three times the storage capacity of the Family Computer's (and NES's) console's cartridges. Combined with the possibility to store the players' progress, the floppy disk format enabled the developers to create a longer game with a more extensive game world. Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was Toru Osawa's debut as a video game designer, {{and he was the}} only staff member working on the game {{at the beginning of the}} project. Osawa (credited in the U.S. version as Inusawa) intended <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>Light</b> Myth: Palutena's Mirror an action game with role-playing elements, and wrote a story rooted in Greek mythology, which he had always been fond of. He drew the pixel art, and wrote the technical specifications, which were the basis for the playable prototype that was programmed by Intelligent Systems. After Nintendo's action-adventure Metroid had been finished, more staff members were allotted to the development of Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena.|$|E

Kurt Soccolich was chosen by Maiellaro to voice Rectangular Businessman, who [...] "already had that sort of smooth arrogance in his voice", making him a [...] "perfect" [...] fit for him.

500|$|Theme Hospital was {{released}} in March 1997 (although it was originally due for release in November 1996), and is part of Bullfrog's Designer Series. The game attracted some controversy from NHS managers, the Houses of Parliament, and The Daily Telegraph, who published an article criticising the game as [...] "sick" [...] because the British Medical Association was using it to train management staff. The NHS argued that the game mocked hospital management. Webley was invited to appear on a local radio station; he did not consider the game <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> of real-world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than real ones. Theme Hospital was a commercial success, which surprised Bullfrog and Electronic Arts. It repeatedly appeared {{in the top five}} of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies. In 2014, Molyneux stated that he wanted the game to make a comeback, and described Theme Hospital as [...] "a great game that I and many people remember".|$|E

500|$|Originally, Hollis {{hoped that}} the {{difference}} between light and dark would be a significant feature of the gameplay, and the title was intended to reflect this focus. A flashlight was implemented by Steve Ellis, who had been responsible for much of the multiplayer mode of GoldenEye 007, but it {{was not included in the}} final game due to the limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. Hollis remarked that such aims were overambitious, commenting in 2006 that [...] "Even today, you can see game developers struggle <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> and dark foundational from a gameplay perspective. I suspect it will take a few years before significant and pervasive gameplay innovation occurs here." [...] Although not all these intended features were realised, the game contains more advanced lighting than its predecessor. For example, lights can be shot out to create darkened areas, gunfire and explosions illuminate rooms dynamically, and the player can use infrared and night vision goggles.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show, Simone was played by three actresses: Lena Cardwell (July 5, 1999 to April 16, 2001), Chrystee Pharris (April 17, 2001 to April 2004), and Cathy Jenéen Doe (July 23, 2004 to September 4, 2007). The program made history as the first daytime serial to show two women having sex in bed. She is also the first African-American lesbian {{character}} to appear in a daytime serial. When discussing the decision to portray Simone as a lesbian, Kalouria emphasized [...] "sexual identity isn't a passing fancy" [...] and [...] "this is where [...] is [...] I can assure you we're not going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> of this particular topic." [...] The storyline about Simone's lesbianism, and the representation of her sexuality, received mixed feedback from critics and media outlets, as did Cathy Jenéen Doe's performance. Passions won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality, and her relationship with Rae. Despite the award, Sarah Warn, former editor of entertainment website AfterEllen.com, criticized the lesbian reveal as having [...] "reduced Simone to a one-dimensional character who happened to sleep with a girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Although officially retired, Grimaldi still {{received}} half of {{his former}} small salary from Drury Lane until 1824. [...] Soon after the fee stopped, Grimaldi fell into poverty {{after a number of}} ill-conceived business ventures and because he had entrusted management of his provincial earnings to people who cheated him. Despite his disabilities, he offered his services as a cameo performer in Christmas pantomimes. [...] Along with Bologna, he re-appeared briefly at Sadler's Wells where he gave some acting instruction to the mime artist William Payne, the future father of the Payne Brothers. [...] He also started working for Richard Brinsley Peake, namesake of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who was the dramaturge at the English Opera House. Peake hired Grimaldi to star in Monkey Island alongside his son JS. However, Grimaldi's health deteriorated further and he was forced to quit before the show opened; his scene was cut. [...] The early end to his career, worries about money, and the uncertainty over his son's future made him increasingly depressed. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> of it, he would often joke about his condition: [...] "I make you laugh at night but am Grim-all-day". In 1828, two [...] "farewell" [...] benefit performances were held for him. [...] In the first, he appeared as Hock the German soldier and a drunken sailor in Thomas Dibdin's melodrama The Sixes; or, The Fiends at Sadler's Wells to an audience of 2,000 people. Unable to stand for long periods of time, he sang a duet with JS and finished the evening with a scene from Mother Goose. His last farewell benefit performance on 27 June 1828 was at Drury Lane. Between 1828 and 1836, Grimaldi relied on charity benefits to replace his lost income.|$|E

2500|$|Aspects of Simm's {{portrayal}} of the Master parallel Tennant's Doctor, primarily in his ability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> of tense situations and his rather quirky and hyperactive personality. According to the producers, this was done to make the Master more threatening to the Doctor by having him take one of his opponent's greatest strengths, as well as making the parallels between the two characters more distinctive. This rationale is written into dialogue by the Master in [...] "Utopia", in which he explicitly states, as he is regenerating, that if the Doctor can be young and strong, then so can he. In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential, [...] "Lords and Masters", Russell T Davies also classifies the Master as both a sociopath and a psychopath.|$|E
