5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Newcastle United were linked with a £6 million bid for Brown, as a {{replacement}} for their outgoing captain Kevin Nolan. Brown stated {{that he did not want}} to leave Celtic and that he felt privileged to be the captain. He also said that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a new contract as his current deal was to expire at the end of the season. Internazionale and Juventus were also reportedly looking <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> him on a free transfer if he did not sign a new contract. After protracted talks, Brown announced on 29 August that he was <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a new contract in the next few weeks. Due to his SPL suspension incurred at the end of the 2010–11 season, Brown's first match of the new campaign was Scotland's 2–1 win over Denmark on 10 August. He suffered an ankle injury in this match, but played in the next five games for Celtic and the next international match. He missed Celtic's 4–0 win over Motherwell, on 10 September, due to the injury and then the 2–0 loss to Atlético Madrid five days later.|$|E
