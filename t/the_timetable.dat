5|$|According to the Scottish {{transport}} minister Keith Brown, <b>the</b> <b>timetable</b> allows charter train promoters to run special excursion services {{within the}} hourly evening and Sunday services. Trains with 10:54, 12:54 and 14:24 departures from Edinburgh and 11:59, 13:59 and 15:28 departures from Tweedbank {{may be affected}} by scheduled steam trains.|$|E
5|$|Around 1900, {{there were}} six {{stopping}} trains an hour between Willesden Green and Baker Street. One of these came from Rickmansworth and another from Harrow, the rest started at Willesden Green. There was also a train every two hours from Verney Junction, which stopped at all stations to Harrow, then Willesden Green and Baker Street. <b>The</b> <b>timetable</b> was arranged so that the fast train would leave Willesden Green just before a stopping service and arrived at Baker Street just behind the previous service.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham and Wotton {{were more}} {{reliable}} than the Aveling and Porter engines. With modern locomotives on the Brill–Quainton Road route (the Kingswood branch generally remained worked by horses, and occasionally by the Aveling and Porter engines), traffic rose. The figure for milk traffic rose from 40,000gallons carried in 1875 to 58,000gallons (260,000l; 70,000USgal) in 1879, and in 1877 the Tramway carried 20,994tons (21,331t) of goods. In early 1877 it appeared on Bradshaw maps and from May 1882 Bradshaw listed <b>the</b> <b>timetable.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a solution to}} <b>the</b> school <b>timetabling</b> problem. <b>The</b> <b>timetabling</b> problem involves scheduling a number of tuples, each consisting of class of students, a teacher, a subject and a room, to a fixed number of time slots. A Monte Carlo scheme called simulated annealing is used as an optimisation technique. The paper introduces <b>the</b> <b>timetabling</b> problem, and then describes the simulated annealing method. Annealing is then applied to <b>the</b> <b>timetabling</b> problem. A prototype timetabling environment is described followed by some experimental results. A parallel algorithm which can be implemented on a multiprocessor is presented. This algorithm can provide a faster solution than the equivalent sequential algorithm. Some further experimental results are given. ...|$|R
5|$|The 2nd Brigade landed between 05:30 and 07:00, and {{the reserve}} 1st Brigade landed between 09:00 and 12:00, already putting <b>the</b> <b>timetable</b> behind schedule. The 2nd Brigade, which was {{supposed}} to be heading for Baby 700 on the left, were instead sent to the right to counter a Turkish attack building up there. At 07:20 Bridges and his staff landed; finding no senior officers on the beach to brief them, they set out to locate the 3rd Brigade headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The railway was rebuilt as a non-electrified, largely {{single-track}} line. Several surviving Waverley Route structures, including viaducts and tunnels, {{were rehabilitated}} and reused for the reopened railway. Passenger services run half-hourly on weekdays until 20:00, and hourly until 23:54 and on Sundays. <b>The</b> <b>timetable</b> also allows charter train promoters to run special excursion services, {{and for the}} weeks following the line opening scheduled steam trains were run.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>timetable</b> for January 1883 shows {{a variety}} of {{passenger}}, goods and mixed trains, giving five passenger services down to Amlwch, and six up. The first train of the morning, departing Bangor at 04:20, and the 19:35 from Amlwch also carried mail {{to and from the}} island. The majority of trains still terminated at Gaerwen. As Llangefni held a livestock market on a Thursday, an extra service from Bangor to Llangefni on Thursdays was introduced by the 1896 timetable.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> train <b>timetable</b> dominates <b>the</b> {{rail traffic}} organization. <b>The</b> <b>timetabling</b> quality should be {{evaluated}} to check the work skill of train <b>timetable</b> managers. <b>The</b> values of existing timetable evaluation indexes vary with infrastructure features and traffic flow; therefore, they are not comparable in fact. Furthermore, subjective inputs like expert scores are involved in evaluation; this will lead to unreliable results because the experts may have different opinions. To overcome these shortages, we propose a relative train path efficiency index by taking the train paths as production units. Each unit consumes some transport resources and produces some feedback outputs. A DEA model is applied to compute the train path efficiency. Two statistical functions of train path efficiency are used to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>timetabling</b> quality. We verify our method with real-world timetables. First, we use <b>the</b> Shibantan-to-Xinqiao line <b>timetable</b> to test <b>the</b> relative feature of the index proposed, and {{the results show that}} the train path efficiency value is relative and can reflect whether the stops are evenly distributed or not. Second, we evaluate <b>the</b> <b>timetabling</b> quality of another two <b>timetables</b> of <b>the</b> Qingdao-to-Jinan line with different traffic flows, and the results show that, compared with <b>the</b> 2012 <b>timetable,</b> <b>the</b> <b>timetabling</b> quality decreased in 2013...|$|R

5|$|In January 1983, Consolidated Rail Corporation {{handed over}} {{operation}} of the commuter railroads to New Jersey Transit Rail Operations. On September 20, 2002, {{as part of the}} Montclair Connection, merging the Montclair Branch and Boonton Line, the Arlington station in Kearny was closed, resulting in the lack of a station in Kearny. As a result, a rail shuttle bus was created by the town of Kearny to bus passengers from Arlington station up to Kingsland via Route 76 bus route, giving rail passenger service to New York Penn Station and Hoboken Terminal. Shuttle buses were aligned at that time with the 5:02 AM, 6:03 PM and 7:08 PM. Services were adjusted for <b>the</b> <b>timetable</b> services on September 30, 2002.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Eurotunnel was in discussions with the Intergovernment Commission, which oversees the tunnel, with the aim of amending elements of the safety code governing the tunnel's usage. Most saliently, the requirement that trains be able to split within the tunnel and each part of the train be driven out to opposite ends has been removed. However, the proposal to allow shorter trains was not passed. Eurotunnel Chairman & Chief Executive Jacques Gounon said that he hoped the liberalisation of rules would allow entry into the market of competitors such as Deutsche Bahn. Sources at Eurotunnel suggested that Deutsche Bahn could have entered the market at <b>the</b> <b>timetable</b> change in December 2012. This, however, did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Now Vice President-elect, Johnson {{was anxious}} to {{complete}} the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although <b>the</b> <b>timetable</b> for {{the election of a}} new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.|$|E
50|$|However, on some single tracked lines <b>the</b> <b>timetables</b> may be 30/30 or 60/60 minutes, with <b>the</b> actual <b>timetables</b> being {{asymmetrical}} (such as 20/40 minutes), because {{passing loops}} are not positioned ideally, or alternate connections at either ends {{have to be}} reached.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, a {{study of}} <b>the</b> railway <b>timetables</b> over these last three years shows that {{attempts}} were made to keep these tables up-to-date. <b>The</b> <b>timetables</b> show, in general, a decline in the standard of VR passenger service as war priorities took hold.|$|R
40|$|Timetabling {{manually}} is {{a complex}} activity that is time-consuming and stressful because {{a high number of}} high and soft constraints need to be satisfied; there is therefore the need to automate <b>the</b> <b>timetabling</b> process.

5|$|When I Airborne Corps was {{committed}} to action in Operation Market Garden in September 1944, Browning's rift with Brereton had severe repercussions. Browning was concerned about <b>the</b> <b>timetable</b> put forward by Major-General Paul L. Williams of the IX Troop Carrier Command, under which the drop was staggered over several days, and not to make two drops on the first day. This restricted the number of combat troops available on the first day. He also disagreed with the British drop zones proposed by Air Vice Marshal Leslie Hollinghurst of No. 38 Group, which he felt were too distant from the bridge at Arnhem, but Browning now felt unable to challenge the airmen.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Presiding Officer is {{responsible}} for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate. Convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber, is another of the roles of the Presiding Officer. Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the Presiding Officer and one representative from each political party with five or more seats in the Parliament. Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree <b>the</b> <b>timetable</b> of business in the chamber, establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the Parliament.

5|$|The armored {{task force}} secured Route 9 {{all the way}} to Ban Dong (known to the Americans as A Luoi), 20 {{kilometers}} inside Laos and approximately halfway to Tchepone. By 11 February A Luoi had become the central fire base and command center for the operation. The plan then called for a quick ground thrust to secure the main objective, but South Vietnamese forces had stalled at A Loui while awaiting orders to proceed from General Lãm. Two days later, Generals Abrams and Sutherland flew to Lam's forward command post at Đông Hà in order to speed up <b>the</b> <b>timetable.</b> At the meeting of the generals, it was instead decided to extend the 1st Division's line of outposts south of Route 9 westward to cover the projected advance.

5|$|The {{principal}} {{express services}} were often given nicknames by railwaymen but these names later appeared officially in timetables, on headboards {{carried on the}} locomotive, and on roofboards above {{the windows of the}} carriages. For instance, the late-morning Flying Dutchman express between London and Exeter was named after the winning horse of the Derby and St Ledger races in 1849. Although withdrawn at the end of 1867, the name was revived in 1869– following a request from the Bristol and Exeter Railway– and the train ran through to Plymouth. An afternoon express was instigated on the same route in June 1879 and became known as The Zulu. A third West Country express was introduced in 1890, running to and from Penzance as The Cornishman. A new service, the Cornish Riviera Express ran between London and Penzance– non-stop to Plymouth– from 1 July 1904, although it ran only in the summer during 1904 and 1905 before becoming a permanent feature of <b>the</b> <b>timetable</b> in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Wood Siding {{initially}} had no {{facilities for}} passengers, {{not even a}} platform. In 1894 a low platform and small corrugated iron waiting room were built for passengers. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a buffer stop for the siding, and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. While the original Aveling & Porter locomotive was slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before its arrival, later locomotives were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains. Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the new Chiltern Main Line. Wood Siding was removed from <b>the</b> <b>timetable</b> by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. While Wood Siding station was demolished shortly after closure, the abutments of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact. The porter's hut survives as a nearby garden shed.|$|E
