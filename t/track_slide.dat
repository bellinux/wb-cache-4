40|$|The {{automobile}} seat is {{an important}} and unique device in the automobile system, which directly contacts the human body. The dynamic characteristics of the automobile seat are the key parameters for its vibration security and dynamic performance. Both experiments and finite element simulations are conducted to analyse the fore-and-aft operating modes of {{a new type of}} automobile seat system in this paper. The results and their correlation analysis between the experimental data and the computational models are given. By using finite element simulations, the computational results of the modes with the first 12 orders for the automobile seat are in the range 0 - 100 Hz, including the integral modes and the local modes of the automobile seat. An experimental method was designed to measure the seat frame mode using an impact hammer, a triaxial accelerometer, uniaxial accelerometers and a 24 -channel LMS vibration test system. The experimental data were analysed by estimating the frequency response function and the modal parameters and validated using LMS Test. Lab software. The experimental results for five integral modal parameters of the automobile seat between 0 Hz and 100 Hz are given. The orthogonal experimental method is used to design nine different working states of the automobile seat with variations in the positions of different adjustable devices (the headrest, the height adjuster, the recliner and the <b>track</b> <b>slide).</b> Finally, the influences of the above-mentioned adjustable devices on the fore-and-aft operating mode are analysed by the single-factor analysis method using finite element simulations...|$|E
40|$|A Hydrazine Vapor Area Monitor (HVAM) {{system is}} {{currently}} being field tested as a detector {{for the presence of}} hydrazine in ambient air. The MDA/Polymetron Hydrazine Analyzer has been incorporated within the HVAM system as the core detector. This analyzer is a three-electrode liquid analyzer typically used in boiler feed water applications. The HVAM system incorporates a dual-phase sample collection/transport method which simultaneously pulls ambient air samples containing hydrazine and a very dilute sulfuric acid solution (0. 0001 M) down a length of 1 / 4 inch outside diameter (OD) tubing from a remote site to the analyzer. The hydrazine-laden dilute acid stream is separated from the air and the pH is adjusted by addition of a dilute caustic solution to a pH greater than 10. 2 prior to analysis. Both the dilute acid and caustic used by the HVAM are continuously generated during system operation on an "as needed" basis by mixing a metered amount of concentrated acid/base with dilution water. All of the waste water generated by the analyzer is purified for reuse by Barnstead ion-exchange cartridges so that the entire system minimizes the generation of waste materials. The pumping of all liquid streams and mixing of the caustic solution and dilution water with the incoming sample are done by a single pump motor fitted with the appropriate mix of peristaltic pump heads. The signal to noise (S/N) ratio of the analyzer has been enhanced by adding a stirrer in the MDA liquid cell to provide mixing normally generated by the high liquid flow rate designed by the manufacturer. An onboard microprocessor continuously monitors liquid levels, sample vacuum, and liquid leak sensors, as well as handles communications and other system functions (such as shut down should system malfunctions or errors occur). The overall system response of the HVAM can be automatically checked at regular intervals by measuring the analyzer response to a metered amount of calibration standard injected into the dilute acid stream. The HVAM system provides two measurement ranges (threshold limit value (TLV) : 10 to 1000 parts per billion (ppb) /LEAK: 100 ppb to 10 parts per million (ppm)). The LEAK range is created by dilution of the sulfuric acid/hydrazine liquid sample with pure water. This dual range capability permits the analyzer to quantify ambient air samples whose hydrazine concentrations range from 10 ppb to as high as 10 ppm. The laboratory and field prototypes have demonstrated total system response times on the order of 10 to 12 minutes for samples ranging from 10 to 900 ppb in the lLV mode and is greater than 2 minutes for samples ranging from 100 to 1300 ppb in the LEAK mode. Service intervals of over 3 months have been demonstrated for continuous 24 hour/day, 7 day/week usage. The HVAM is made up of a purged cabinet that contains power supplies, RS 422 signal transmission capabilities, a UPS, an on-site warning system, and a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). The LRU includes all of the liquid flow system, the analyzer, the control/data system microprocessor and assorted flow and liquid-level sensors. The LRU is mounted on a <b>track</b> <b>slide</b> system so it can be serviced inplace or totally removed and quickly exchanged with another calibrated unit, thus minimizing analyzer downtime. Once an LRU is removed from an analyzer enclosure, it can be brought to a laboratory facility for complete calibration and periodic maintenance...|$|E
