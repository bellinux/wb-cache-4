5|$|All of {{the native}} tribes {{experienced}} gradual disillusionment with the U.S. government because of its inability or unwillingness to honor its treaty commitments. The major leaders among the tribes were Wabasha and Little Crow among the Dakota Sioux, Flat Mouth and Hole-in-the-Day among the Ojibwe, and Winneshiek among the Winnebago. The success of treaty negotiations between <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tribes was in great part facilitated by the mixed race families such as the Faribaults and the Renvilles.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution in 1789, most countries and even some cities had their own system of measurement. Although different countries might have used units of measure with the same name, such as the foot, or local language equivalents such as pied, Fuß, and voet, there was no consistency in the magnitude of those units, nor in the relationships with their multiples and submultiples, much like the modern-day differences between <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> UK pints and gallons.|$|E

5|$|Boot {{wrote for}} the CFR through 2010 and 2011 for various {{publications}} such as Newsweek, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Weekly Standard among others. He particularly argued that President Obama's health care plans made maintaining the U.S.' superpower status harder, that withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq occurred prematurely while making another war there more likely, and that the initial U.S. victory in Afghanistan had been undone by government complacency though forces could still pull off a victory. He also wrote op-eds criticizing planned budget austerity measures in both <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> U.K. as hurting their national security interests.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{distributed}} element filters {{began in}} the years before World WarII. A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937. Mason had filed a patent much earlier, in 1927, and that patent may contain the first published design which moves away from a lumped element analysis. Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires – the planar technologies were not yet in use. Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic counter-measures. A good deal of this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, but other laboratories in <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> UK were also involved.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War Era, the {{relationships}} between the First World, Second World and the Third World were very rigid. The First World and Second World were at constant odds with one another via the tensions between their two cores, the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively. The Cold War, by virtue of its name, was a primarily ideological struggle between the First and Second Worlds, or more specifically, <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. Multiple doctrines and plans dominated Cold War dynamics including the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan (from <b>the</b> <b>U.S)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Molotov Plan (from the Soviet Union). The extent of the odds between the two worlds is evident in Berlin—which was then split into East and West. To stop citizens in East Berlin from having too much exposure to the capitalist West, the Soviet Union put up the Berlin Wall within the actual city.|$|E

In 1900, the island was struck by a devastating hurricane. Even post-Hurricane Katrina, this event holds the record as the United States' deadliest natural disaster.|$|E
5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown {{to such an extent}} that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
