5|$|A similar outcome {{followed}} in the 200m World finals. In the semi-final, Gatlin outpaced Bolt – the Jamaican at 19.95 and the American at 19.87. Despite such slow times prior to Beijing, Bolt delivered in the final with his fifth fastest run ever for the 200m at 19.55 seconds. Gatlin failed <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>his</b> early season form and finished almost two-tenths of a second behind Bolt. Bolt's four consecutive wins over 200m at the World Championships was unprecedented and established him clearly as the best ever sprinter at the competition.|$|E

Galland set up a course in late 1943, but it only lasted a few months. Galland {{was quoted as saying}} he thought they could learn the skills while on operations, as he had. This ignored his own talents, and blithely expected other pilots <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>his</b> high standards.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{began the}} season by {{changing}} rackets {{for the first}} time in his career, from his longtime frame of 90 square inches to one measured at 97 square inches. He had long been at a comparative disadvantage in equipment as almost the entire tour, including his top rivals Nadal and Djokovic, used more powerful frames of between 95 and 100 square inches. At the Australian Open, Federer defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Andy Murray <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>his</b> 11th consecutive semifinal in Melbourne, before losing to Rafael Nadal in straight sets.|$|E

5|$|At the US Open, Djokovic beat Federer <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>his</b> third Major final, {{although}} Nadal won {{once again}} to complete his Career Grand Slam. In November, Robin Söderling (who has reached the French Open final) briefly passed Murray to reach fourth place in the ATP rankings, threatening to break the Big Four's run of filling the end-of-year rankings. However, all of the Big Four reached the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals semifinals with Federer defeating Nadal in 3 sets in the final, leading to them achieving their third successive season in the top 4 positions. Again Djokovic and Murray were third and fourth respectively, both reaching one Grand Slam tournament final apiece.|$|E
5|$|At the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{showed no}} signs of this {{fluctuating}} form.

In the final, he faced John Higgins. O'Sullivan established an early lead in the 35-frame final which he never relinquished, and eventually triumphed 18–14 for his first world title (completing his collection of major titles). O'Sullivan dedicated the win to his father. O'Sullivan ended the season by winning the Premier League. After finishing second in the league stage, he defeated Higgins 6–3 in the semi-finals, and Stephen Hendry 9–7 in the final. He was ranked world number 2 {{by the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|David Hudson (February 17, 1761– March 17, 1836) was an American {{businessman}} {{noted for}} founding Hudson Township, the present-day Hudson, Ohio.

He lived in Goshen for many years, owning a farm, marrying Anna Norton in 1783 and raising the oldest seven of their nine children there. In 1789, Hudson joined a group to purchase a parcel of land in the Connecticut Western Reserve. The following year, he left Goshen to survey the parcel and settle it as Hudson Township. Hudson traveled through the state of New York, west along Lake Erie and south along the Cuyahoga River <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>his</b> land.|$|E

Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank.

5|$|From March through May, Raonic {{improved}} on his career-best {{performance at}} five consecutive ATP 1000 events. At the Indian Wells Masters, he beat No. 6 Murray {{to reach the}} quarterfinals, losing to Alexandr Dolgopolov. He lost in {{the quarterfinals of the}} Miami Masters to Nadal. He reached the quarterfinals for the third ATP 1000 tournament in a row at the Monte-Carlo Masters, before falling to Wawrinka. The result garnered Raonic a career-high ranking as world No. 9. Raonic lost in the third round of the Madrid Open to Nishikori. At the Italian Open, Raonic defeated Jérémy Chardy in the quarterfinals <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>his</b> first Masters 1000 semifinal on clay. After winning the first set, he lost his semifinal match to eventual champion Djokovic. Although he had played Djokovic in the 2013 Davis Cup, this was their first ATP match against one another.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{achieved}} {{more success}} as a footballer. In 1937, he followed his brothers Les and Ray and joined the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). The VFA was the second tier of Australian rules football below the Victorian Football League (VFL). A defender, Miller played his first two seasons on the flanks; he was yet <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>his</b> physical peak and lacked the power required to play in central defensive positions until his third season, in 1939.

However, in a rematch {{of the previous year}} final, he was unable to win his first title as he lost in the final to an in-form Novak Djokovic (who won a record-equalling sixth title) in straight sets.

5|$|After strong grass court {{seasons in}} 2012 and 2013, Murray was seeded third for the 2014 Wimbledon Championship, behind Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, who were seeded {{first and second}} respectively.

Murray continued his good form, defeating Roberto Bautista Agut and Kevin Anderson, the 27th and 20th seeds, again in straight sets <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>his</b> seventh consecutive Wimbledon quarterfinal. Murray's defence then came to a halt as Grigor Dimitrov ended his 17 match winning-streak on the grass of Wimbledon (this includes the 2012 Olympics) with a straight sets win, meaning Murray failed to reach the semifinals {{for the first time since}} 2008.
