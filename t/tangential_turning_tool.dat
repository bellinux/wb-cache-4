Currently, most of {{the diamond}} <b>turning</b> <b>tools</b> used for {{precision}} machining are still manually manufactured, the profile accuracy of the diamond cutting edge depends on the operator’s experience and skill, so that the process need to be automated. Therefore in this research, an automated grinding system has been developed for the diamond <b>turning</b> <b>tools,</b> controlled by a vision system. The profile of the diamond <b>turning</b> <b>tools</b> is captured in real time via CCD camera. The deviation from an ideal circle is calculated and feedback to the controller, the grinding system then removes cutting edge of <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> selectively to achieve high quality and high productivity...|$|R
40|$|Turn milling {{is still}} a {{relatively}} un common process for precision manufacturing of axially symmetric components. In this process, chip formation is realized by a combined rotation of the workpiece and the cutting tool. Due to its special kinematics, turn milling offers potential for cutting of difficult-to-machine materials, such as particle reinforced aluminium matrix composites. The heterogeneous microstructure of these materials with comparatively soft matrix and hard ceramic particles causes high dynamic loads on the cutting edges. Furthermore, the cutting edges have to withstand the highly abrasive effect of the hard particles. This requires the application of wear-resistant cutting materials, including particularly diamond-based cutting materials. However, their use as tippings imposes design limitations for the cutting tools. In this investigation, cutting tests on an aluminium alloy reinforced with 15 per cent by volume alumina particles were performed using end mills with different minor cutting edge angles in orthogonal and <b>tangential</b> <b>turn</b> milling. After a short cutting time, during <b>tangential</b> <b>turn</b> milling the flat cutting edge geometry resulted in vibrations of the tool and a poor workpiece surface quality. In contrast, orthogonal turn milling produced no vibrations and enabled higher feed velocities when reducing the minor cutting edge angles from 1 ° to 0 °...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCurrently {{grinding}} {{is commonly}} used as the finishing operation to manufacture seal mating surfaces and bearing surfaces, especially in the automotive industry. It would lead to more resource-efficient production if the cost- and energy-intensive grinding process could be replaced by machining with geometrically defined cutting edges, such as hard turning [1, 2]. However, turning operations usually cause a twist structure on the surface, which can convey lubricants like a pump. Several methods exist to overcome this problem, for example, <b>tangential</b> <b>turning,</b> rotation turning and turn broaching, etc. Due to {{the high costs of}} tools and special machines required by these methods, the industrial application is still limited. This paper describes a more efficient approach by applying a modified feed kinematic. When using this approach, hard turning produces twist-free surfaces. The results of the latest twist test methods have confirmed that the surfaces are free of twist, hence free of conveying effect of lubricant and that they are suitable for application in manufacturing of seal mating surfaces and bearing surfaces. Furthermore, this method requires only minimal investment in any turning machine...|$|R

40|$|Two {{approaches}} for energy saving {{are presented in}} this paper for turning and milling TiAl 6 V 4 workpieces. The major outcome of the cutting trials with the internally cooled <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> is that the tool wear under dry cutting conditions is in between dry and wet machining, whereas the combination of the internally cooled <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> with wet machining leads to strongly increased tool lifetimes. In contrast to this, the energy demand under dry cutting conditions is much lower than under wet cutting conditions. With respect to the environmental protection, the best tool cooling is dry cutting combined with the internally cooled tool. To achieve higher productivity rates or increased tool lifetimes, the combination of wet machining and the internally cooled <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> is the best solution. In comparison to conventional milling, the average effective power consumption of the machine tool under trochoidal cutting conditions is increased by 6 %. Nevertheless, the amount of used energy is decreased by 15 % and the process time is reduced by 35 %. The reasons for this are higher material removal rates, {{due to the fact that}} the cutting time per edge and revolution can be reduced to a minimum. The heat-up phase and the cutting temperatures are small. By increasing the cutting parameters, e. g. cutting speed or feed, it is possible to improve the material removal rate. This enables a higher energy productivity and lower process time. The milling tool was used for both milling strategies. For trochoidal milling the tool has sufficient potential to increase the cutting parameters. For the conventional cutting process, however, the tool works at the load limit...|$|R
