5|$|After the {{initiation}} of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw <b>that</b> <b>program</b> as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency. When that failed as a strategy, the aerial effort was redirected {{to serve as an}} anti-infiltration campaign. After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an end at the direction of President Lyndon B. Johnson on 11 November 1968.|$|E

The Constellation program was funded and construction and testing begun on a staffed spacecraft and launch vehicle, and design studies for a lunar base. However, <b>that</b> <b>program</b> has been cancelled in favor of a staffed asteroid landing by 2025 and a staffed Mars orbit by 2035. India has also expressed its hope to send a staffed mission to the Moon by 2020.|$|E

5|$|On July 26, 1846, Bishop Bourget {{unilaterally}} {{opened the}} noviciate of the Saint-Pélagie Community, {{and placed the}} assembled female staff of the Hospice as novices within <b>that</b> <b>program.</b> This effectively established the Hospice de Saint-Pélagie as a religious community, of which Bourget proclaimed Sophie Raymond to be the superior. It also allowed for women to join the community as postulants, {{with the aim of}} eventually taking religious vows. Bourget designated himself spiritual and canonical director of the novitiate, and delegated a priest, the Abbé Antoine Rey, to be Director of the Hospice. Later that year at the direction of Coadjutor Bishop Jean-Charles Prince (later Bishop of Saint-Hyacinth) the Wolfe Street premises were expanded through the acquisition of the first floor adjacent to the hospice.|$|E
25|$|Share is the {{percentage}} of television sets in use that are tuned to the program.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{tremendous}} amount of research that has been done into the characteristics of <b>programming</b> <b>that</b> reduce the chances of recidivism. However, there has been limited research into how youth experience <b>that</b> <b>programming</b> or how we achieve sustained and meaningful youth engagement in <b>that</b> <b>programming,</b> particularly for youth who are serving custodial dispositions. Using the lens of critical pedagogy, this study analyses interviews held with four focus groups involving 16 youth in custody. Youth identified what they felt was important, both in program content and in program delivery and implementation. The findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> need to be developed and delivered through meaningful engagement with youth, within the context of youth’s individual experiences, and that the content of programs needs to be situated meaningfully within the lived realities of youth who find themselves in custody...|$|R

5000|$|Usually, {{there is}} not a single exit point {{specified}} in a program.
