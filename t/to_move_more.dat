5|$|In August, Wartensleben's {{autonomous}} corps {{united with}} Charles' imperial troops {{and turned the}} tide against the French. The defeat of Jourdan's army at the battles of Amberg (24 August), Würzburg (3 September) and 2nd Altenkirchen (16–19 September) allowed Charles <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> troops to the south, and effectively removed Jourdan from {{the remainder of the}} campaign.|$|E
5|$|As in most Sonic series games, the Chaos Emeralds {{play a major}} role; {{they help}} Shadow {{remember}} his past and allow him to perform Chaos Control and Chaos Blast. Chaos Control allows Shadow <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> quickly in levels and slows time in boss battles, and Chaos Blast creates an explosion that destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform Chaos Control after the player fills the Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform Chaos Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Initially exhibiting {{characteristics}} of a monsoonal low, a mid-level ridge {{to the south of}} Graham caused strong westerly winds that moved the storm slowly east-southeastward. However, a deep trough eroded the ridge, allowing the cyclone <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> towards the south. According to the JTWC, the storm had intensified late on 28 February, though {{at the same time the}} BoM noted the slight weakening of the storm. Graham reached its peak intensity that day while nearing the coast.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 5th Battalion moved {{north of}} Khafji to block Iraqi {{reinforcements}} attempting {{to reach the}} city. This unit was further bolstered by the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support. Although fear of friendly fire forced the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade to pull back the following morning, Coalition aircraft successfully hindered Iraqi attempts <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> soldiers down to Khafji and caused large numbers of Iraqi troops to surrender to Saudi forces.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, Ismael {{produced}} {{waves of}} up to 30feet (9m) in height. Hundreds of fishermen were unprepared for the hurricane, which was expected <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> slowly, {{and as a result}} 52 ships were wrecked, killing 57 fishermen. On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in mainland Mexico and resulted in $26million in damage (1995USD, $ USD). The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000people homeless. Moisture from the storm extended into the United States, causing heavy rainfall and localized moderate damage in southeastern New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June, the French {{suffered}} a defeat at the Battle of Trebbia, and consequently the Austrians were able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> decisively against Mantua. On 4 July the siege {{entered a new}} stage, with Austrian reinforcements arriving, and the besieging force growing from 8,000 to 40,000. The Austrians were commanded by Hungarian general Baron Pal von Kray, an artillery expert. Artillery bombardment was constant. On 24-25 July the assault begun; and the Austrians slowly advanced {{over the next few}} days. On 27 July Foissac-Latour began negotiating surrender terms.|$|E

5|$|Transforming a curve {{with equal}} normal speeds at all points {{has been called}} the grassfire transform. Curves evolved in this way will in general develop sharp corners, the trace of which forms the medial axis of the curve. A closely related curve {{evolution}} which moves straight segments of a polygonal curve at equal speeds but allows concave corners <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> quickly than unit speed instead forms a different type of topological skeleton of the given curve, its straight skeleton.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first formed on August20 {{in the central}} Caribbean Sea from a broad area of low pressure, based on weather reports from weather stations and ships in the vicinity. Moving steadily to the west-northwest towards the western Caribbean, the disturbance slowly intensified, attaining tropical storm strength by 1200UTC the next day. Prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, however, the system was analyzed to be an open trough up until August22. The tropical storm began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> towards {{the west in the}} Gulf of Mexico after clipping the Guanahacabibes Peninsula—the westernmost region of Cuba—late on August22.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E

50|$|Burstall {{earned a}} place in Australian cinema history as the writer and {{director}} of 1969 feature 2000 Weeks. It marked Australia's first locally-made feature film since Charles Chauvel's Jedda in 1955. A commercial failure, savaged by the critics, the film's poor reception would lead Burstall <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> populist works with his next films, Stork and sex comedy Alvin Purple. The film's failure also influenced Bruce Beresford and Phillip Adams <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in a <b>more</b> populist direction {{when they came to}} make early Australian hit The Adventures of Barry McKenzie in 1972.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Ismael {{produced}} 30foot (9m) waves {{over the}} Gulf of California and coastal waters off of Mexico. The hurricane, which was forecast <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> slowly, left hundreds of fisherman unprepared due to deficient communications between the boats and harbor authorities. As a result, 52 boats were wrecked, of which 20 sank. 57 fishermen died offshore, with dozens washing ashore {{as the high}} tides receded. About 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands, sandbars, or disabled fishing boats. Navy rescue teams and other fishermen searched for days off the Mexican coast to find victims and survivors from the storm.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than his}} stays in hospital, Hess {{spent the rest}} of his life in Spandau prison. His fellow inmates Konstantin von Neurath, Walther Funk and Erich Raeder were {{released}} because of poor health in the 1950s; Karl Dönitz, Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer served their time and were released; Dönitz in 1956, Schirach and Speer in 1966. The 600-cell prison continued to be maintained for its lone prisoner from Speer and Schirach's release until Hess's death in 1987, at an estimated cost of DM 800,000. Conditions were far more pleasant in the 1980s than in the early years; Hess was allowed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> freely around the cell block, setting his own routine and choosing his own activities, which included television, films, reading and gardening. A lift was installed so he could more readily access the garden, and he was provided with a medical orderly from 1982 onward.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} feeds {{on a wide}} range of prey, {{particularly}} insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies (adults and maggots), and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, and earthworms. In a rare instance they have been observed foraging along the branches of a banyan tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with cattle and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows farm machinery, but it is forced <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more.</b> In urban situations cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar situations like railway lines.|$|E

5|$|After peaking in intensity, {{the storm}} began {{weakening}} due to increasing easterly wind shear from the ridge to the north, displacing {{the center of}} circulation from the deepest convection. Early on May14, the IMD downgraded the storm to a severe cyclonic storm. Around this time, steering currents slackened, and the cyclone meandered northward over the central Bay of Bengal. By late on May14, convection had largely dissipated, {{with the exception of}} a small area near the center, and the system weakened to minimal cyclonic storm status. Thunderstorm activity continued to wax and wane as the storm turned to the southeastward, though persistent hostile conditions caused the storm to weaken further to a deep depression on May16. As the nearby ridge translated eastward, the depression was able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>more</b> steadily to the east and later to the northeast, passing northwest of the Andaman Islands on May18. On the next day, the deep depression re-intensified into a cyclonic storm, reaching a secondary peak with winds of 85km/h (50mph). At about 10:00UTC on May19, the storm made landfall close to Kyaukpyu, Ramree Island, in western Myanmar. The storm rapidly weakened into a depression and later degenerated into a low pressure area on May20, and was no longer discernible on satellite imagery by the next day.|$|E
