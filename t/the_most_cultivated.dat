In 2007, unemployment reached 30%. Consequently, many unemployed persons began looking into agriculture to earn income. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>cultivated</b> crops are grains, especially barley, followed by lentils and chick peas. A sizable segment of the population raise livestock and 10% breed their own domestic animals. In total, there are 144 cows, 7,000 goats, 14,000 sheep, and 500 beehives.

500|$|Apart from Enesco, he was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>cultivated</b> violinist I {{have ever}} known but while Enesco was a force of nature, Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully {{fashioned}} piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, {{he was a member}} of our jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor's playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion of everything else. For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.|$|E
