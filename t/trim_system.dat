25|$|It has {{the same}} cabin, avionics, and <b>trim</b> <b>system</b> as SpaceShipOne. This means it can flight-qualify almost all {{components}} of SpaceShipOne. It also has a high thrust-to-weight ratio and large speed brakes. These features combined {{allow it to be}} used as a high-fidelity moving platform flight simulator for SpaceShipOne. White Knight is also equipped with a <b>trim</b> <b>system</b> which (when activated) causes it to have the same glide profile as SpaceShipOne; this allows the pilots to practice for landing SpaceShipOne. The same pilots fly White Knight as fly SpaceShipOne.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the engine}} being mounted above the center of gravity, power was highly {{stabilizing}} (addition of power would push the nose down), {{which could have been}} disconcerting to pilots. Initially, Piper designers incorporated an automatic pitch <b>trim</b> <b>system</b> to coordinate horizontal stabilizer angle of incidence with power setting. This system was later replaced by a vectored thrust nozzle, developed by Williams International, which resulted in reduced weight and simplified manufacturing processes.|$|E
25|$|Testing {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} problems, notably a lack of horizontal stability, an underpowered <b>trim</b> <b>system,</b> landing gear {{that could only be}} extended at slow speeds, an unreliable airspeed indicator, and a cramped cockpit. The test pilots also requested that six guns be installed. The stability problem was addressed on the second prototype by adding a triangular fillet {{to the front of the}} vertical stabilizer. The extra guns could not be incorporated due to weight and balance considerations.|$|E
40|$|A superconducting ring {{cyclotron}} {{proposed as}} a booster {{of the existing}} RIKEN Ring Cyclotron (RRC), is composed of six superconducting sector magnets. In each sector mag-net, the pole pieces are placed at 4 K {{to be used as}} a sup-port structure of the coil vessel against large electromag-netic forces and also to enhance magnetic flux efficiently. The field <b>trimming</b> <b>system</b> suitable for such a cyclotron is thought to be a combination of superconducting and nor-mal trim coils. Considering their differing properties, opti-mization of a <b>trimming</b> <b>system</b> has been carried out using numerical methods. The <b>trimming</b> <b>system</b> is required to isochronize the magnetic fields for various ions in a wide range of beam energy. Features of the trim coils and the results of optimization are described. ...|$|R

25|$|According to AgustaWestland, the AW109 Power {{features}} various advanced avionics systems, {{these include}} a three-axis autopilot, an auto-coupled Instrument Landing System, integrated GPS, a Moving Map Display, weather radar, and a Traffic Alerting System. These systems {{are designed to}} reduce pilot workload (the AW109 can be flown under single or dual-pilot instrument flight rules (IFR)) and enable the use of night vision goggles (NVG) to conduct day-or-night operations. The AW109 has a forced <b>trim</b> <b>system</b> which can be readily and selectively activated by the controlling pilot using triggers located on the cyclic and collective which hold the control inputs at the last set position if activated. All critical systems are deliberately redundant for fail-safe operations; the hydraulic system, hydraulic actuators, and electrical system are all dual-redundant, while the power inverters are triple-redundant. The AW109 also has reduced maintenance requirements due to an emphasis on reliability across the range of components used.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plane was}} too badly damaged to {{determine}} a definite cause. Canadian aircraft {{were not required to}} carry voice cockpit recorders or flight data recorders at this point, complicating the investigation into the crash of TCA Flight 831. [...] The official report released in 1965 pointed to problems in the jet's pitch <b>trim</b> <b>system</b> (the device that maintains a set nose-up or -down attitude) as a possibility, since a pitch trim problem caused the similar crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 304, another DC-8, three months later in 1964. [...] Other possible causes were put forward that could not be ruled out: 1) Icing of the pitot system; and 2) Failure of the vertical gyro.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{three minutes}} later, however, at 19:07, {{passengers}} reported smelling {{smoke in the}} cabin again. Two minutes after that the [...] "master breaker" [...] alarm went off in the cockpit, and electrical systems throughout the plane began to fail, including power for the elevator <b>trim</b> <b>system.</b> This made controlling the plane's descent extremely difficult and required great physical exertion from the pilot and first officer. The PA system also failed, leaving the flight attendants unable to communicate efficiently with the passengers; nevertheless, attendants were able to instruct passengers sitting in the exit rows on how to open the doors, a practice that was not standard on commercial airline flights at the time.|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{wind tunnel}} test to evaluate the effects of Individual Blade Control (IBC) on the performance, vibration, noise and loads of a UH- 60 A rotor was recently completed in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel [1]. A key component of this {{wind tunnel test}} was an automatic rotor <b>trim</b> control <b>system</b> that allowed the rotor trim state to be set more precisely, quickly and repeatably than was possible with the rotor operator setting the trim condition manually. The <b>trim</b> control <b>system</b> was also able to maintain the desired trim condition through changes in IBC actuation both in open- and closed-loop IBC modes, and through long-period transients in wind tunnel flow. This ability of the <b>trim</b> control <b>system</b> to automatically set and maintain a steady rotor trim enabled the effects of different IBC inputs to be compared at common trim conditions and to perform these tests quickly without requiring the rotor operator to re-trim the rotor.

40|$|An {{automatic}} rotor <b>trim</b> control <b>system</b> {{was developed}} and successfully used during a wind tunnel test of a full-scale UH- 60 rotor system with Individual Blade Control (IBC) actuators. The <b>trim</b> control <b>system</b> allowed rotor <b>trim</b> to be set more quickly, precisely and repeatably than in previous wind tunnel tests. This control system also allowed the rotor trim state to be maintained during transients and drift in wind tunnel flow, and through changes in IBC actuation. The ability to maintain a consistent rotor trim state was key to quickly and accurately evaluating the effect of IBC on rotor performance, vibration, noise and loads. This paper presents details of the design {{and implementation of the}} <b>trim</b> control <b>system</b> including the rotor <b>system</b> hardware, <b>trim</b> control requirements, and trim control hardware and software implementation.

40|$|There {{are many}} types of excess-air <b>trim</b> <b>systems</b> {{available}} today in what manufacturers view as a boom market catalyzed by inflated oil prices. For the small boiler owner, determining whether low-excess-air (LEA) firing can be cost-justified and what type of system would be appropriate is a difficult decision requiring {{a great deal of}} thought and engineering judgment. And since no two excess-air <b>trim</b> <b>systems</b> are exactly alike in control philosophy, {{it is very important to}} select the one that best suits your particular boiler and payback requirements. Prudent engineers generally recommend an in depth evaluation of boiler and controls before specification. The starting point for any evaluation should be an analysis of existing heat transfer characteristics within your boiler so that a reliable estimate of the efficiency gain from LEA firing can be determined. Recall that heat transfer takes place in three main areas of the boiler-the radiant section, convection bank, and heat recovery equipment (economizers and air heaters). LEA firing alters the normal heat transfer distribution among these three areas...|$|R
