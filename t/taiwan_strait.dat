5|$|Just {{six hours}} after moving inland, Longwang emerged over the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Strait</b> with its {{circulation}} mostly intact; however, weakening continued as it approached eastern China. Remaining over water {{for less than}} 12hours, the typhoon made its second and ultimate landfall in Fujian Province late on October2. The storm quickly degraded over the following day, with winds decreasing below gale-force within 12hours. The former typhoon slowed and turned northward over western Fujian before dissipating late on October3.|$|E

5|$|Early on September19, Typhoon Fanapi made {{landfall}} over eastern Taiwan near Hualien City with {{winds of}} , according to Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. The storm subsequently weakened over land, dipping southwestward as convection diminished over the northern {{portion of the}} storm. However, the storm resumed its westward trajectory and soon moved over the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Strait</b> as a severe tropical storm. The thunderstorms reorganized slightly as Fanapi reached open waters, and a nearby ship reported winds of 120km/h (75mph). Early on September20, the storm made a second landfall on southeastern China near Fujian and weakened further over land, although thunderstorms persisted southeast of the circulation along the coast. Fanapi weakened into a tropical depression later that day and dissipated late on September21.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters at the JTWC {{initially}} projected {{the storm}} to track north of Taiwan on September12 and merge with an approaching frontal system. Contrary to this, Sarah moved {{south of the}} expected path and quickly weakened as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan. The storm eventually struck the island with winds of 165km/h (105mph) late on September11. Unexpectedly, the typhoon executed a counterclockwise loop and briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall 12hours later along the northeastern coast of Taiwan as a tropical storm. Sarah failed to reorganize as it moved over the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Strait</b> and later made its final landfall in Zhejiang, China as a minimal tropical storm on September13. The storm was last noted the following day as dissipating over Eastern China.|$|E
5|$|The {{originally}} proposed route {{would have}} taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make {{the portion of the}} relay in Taiwan appear {{to be part of the}} torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route. This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route, and the two sides of the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Strait</b> subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.|$|E

5|$|General Marshall was Truman's {{principal}} adviser {{on foreign policy}} matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice against offering direct military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist Chinese forces in the Chinese Civil War against their communist opponents. Marshall's opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman's other advisers—Marshall thought propping up Chiang's forces would drain U.S. resources that were needed in Europe to deter the Soviets. When the communists {{took control of the}} mainland, establishing the People's Republic of China and driving the Nationalists to Taiwan, Truman would have been willing to maintain some relationship between the U.S. and the new government but Mao was unwilling. On June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet into the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Strait</b> to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Morakot, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Juaning, brought {{significant}} rainfall to Taiwan before alleviating drought conditions in mainland China in August2003. The tenth named storm in the western Pacific that year, Morakot spawned from an area of disturbed weather in the Philippine Sea on July31. Tracking northwest, favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical storm strength on August2. Morakot reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85km/h (50mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 992mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). This intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system; {{this was followed by}} Morakot making landfall on southern Taiwan on August3. Subsequently, the storm weakened and moved into the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Strait</b> before making its final landfall near Quanzhou, China the next day. The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese mainland, and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Babs was a {{powerful}} typhoon that struck the Philippines (where it was locally known as Typhoon Loleng) just days after Typhoon Zeb hit the same area. The seventh typhoon of the 1998 season, Babs formed on October14 between the Philippines and Guam. The storm moved westward initially, failing to intensify initially due to the outflow from Typhoon Zeb to the northwest. Babs slowed and briefly turned to the south before advancing to the northwest, whereupon it rapidly intensified into a strong typhoon. On October20, the official Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated peak 10‑minute winds of 155km/h (100mph), while the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (155mph), making Babs an unofficial super typhoon. The storm struck the Philippine island of Catanduanes at that intensity and weakened slightly before hitting Luzon. Babs turned northward once in the South China Sea, later weakening due to unfavorable conditions and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October27 in the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Strait.</b>|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Longwang, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Maring, was the deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone to impact China during the 2005 Pacific typhoon season. Longwang was first identified as a tropical depression on September25 north of the Mariana Islands. Moving along a general westward track, the system quickly intensified and reached typhoon status on September27. After reaching Category4-equivalent intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, adverse atmospheric conditions along with internal structural changes resulted in temporary weakening. The structural change culminated in Longwang becoming an annular typhoon and prompted re-intensification. The storm attained peak strength with winds of 175km/h (110mph) and a pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg) on October1 as it approached Taiwan. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island and further structural changes caused some weakening before the typhoon made landfall near Hualien City early on October2. Crossing the island in six hours, Longwang emerged over the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Strait</b> before moving onshore again later that day, this time in Fujian Province, China as a minimal typhoon. Once over mainland China, the storm quickly weakened and ultimately dissipated late on October3.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Sarah, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Openg, was a {{powerful}} typhoon that caused extensive damage along an erratic path across the Western Pacific in September 1989. Originating from a disturbance within a monsoon trough in early September, Sarah was first classified as a tropical depression near the Mariana Islands on September5. Moving quickly westward, the depression soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Sarah. On September8, the storm abruptly turned southward and temporarily attained typhoon status. Following a series of interactions with secondary areas of low pressure, the storm turned northward the following day. By September11, Sarah entered a region favoring development and underwent a period of explosive intensification. At {{the end of this}} phase, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category4equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The typhoon subsequently weakened rapidly and made two landfalls in Taiwan by September12. After moving over the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Strait,</b> Sarah made its final landfall in Eastern China on September13 before dissipating the following day.|$|E
5|$|At 1800UTC on August29, Omar {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} with 10‑minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg) as estimated by the JMA; this intensity was maintained for 24hours before a steady weakening trend began. The JTWC estimated higher 1‑minute winds of around 240km/h (150mph), making Omar a super typhoon. Two days later, the typhoon came {{close enough to the}} Philippines to warrant monitoring from PAGASA, who named the storm Lusing. By 1500UTC on September3, the JMA downgraded Omar to a tropical storm, although the JTWC maintained its typhoon intensity through the next day. Heading generally westward, the storm made landfall on the east coast of Taiwan near Hualien City on September4. After traversing the island in seven hours, Omar exited the coast of Yunlin County and emerged into the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Strait.</b> The storm crossed the body of water and moved ashore in eastern China near Xiamen, Fujian, on September5. Inland, Omar quickly degenerated into a tropical depression before turning west-southwest. It proceeded across southern China while heavily weakening, and completely dissipated over northern Vietnam on September9.|$|E
