5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of {{emergency}} room doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed that they lacked the resources to deal with large increases in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients.</b> The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured patients.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robert Roswell, a {{previous}} VA Undersecretary of Health and now Professor of Medicine at the University of Oklahoma, said that an appropriate measure of VHA performance was not patient wait times, which were largely outside {{the control of}} the staff, because VHA employees do not control <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> seeking care. A better measure of performance, would for example, measure the efficient use of VHA resources, such as the number of no-show appointments.|$|E
5|$|In October 2000, Dr John Ryan, an Accident & Emergency {{consultant}} at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton criticised <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> visiting the department for minor ailments without first contacting their GP. Ryan attributed this phenomenon to patients viewing Holby City and American medical drama ER, and falsely perceiving hospitals as glamorous. A three-year Belgian research project, presented at a British Psychological Society meeting in September 2008, claimed that watching Holby City and similar medical dramas such as Casualty and ER had a subliminal influence on fear of illness. 1,300 teenagers were questioned on their viewing habits, {{and those who}} watched more medical dramas {{were found to be}} up to 10% more fearful about their health, with females more affected than males. Dr Jan Van Mierlo of Hasselt University stated that further research was needed into the long-term impact of television.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E

30|$|The {{incidence}} of cervical cancer is falling and hence <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> operations performed {{is less than}} previously.

25|$|The waiver, {{which can}} be granted after the {{completion}} of an eight-hour course, is required for outpatient treatment of opioid addiction with Subutex and Suboxone. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> each approved physician could treat was limited to ten. This was eventually modified to allow approved physicians to treat up to a hundred patients with buprenorphine for opioid addiction in an outpatient setting. This limit was recently increased by the Obama administration, raising <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> to which doctors can prescribe to 275. Still, due to this patient limit and the requisite eight-hour training course, many continuing patients can find it very difficult to get a prescription, despite the drug's effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|AIM. In {{a context}} of {{predominant}} infectious diseases, some non communicable diseases of children like diabetes are still of little interest for the health care system. Thus a child affected has a little life expectancy in absence of proper management. Although some initiatives of providing free insulin to African children, the management of children affected is still poor, data are scarce and initiatives of advocacy are rare on the continent. We questioned in this paper the implication of Cameroonian pediatricians {{in the management of}} disease with the aim of describe their practices, and to evaluate their interest on that issue.

40|$|According to {{official}} returns {{there was a}} total of 20, 079 persons suffering from mental illness under care on 31 st December, 1950. These patients were on the registers of District and Auxiliary Mental Hospitals and Private, Private Charitable and Authorised Institutions; in Public Assistance institutions; in Court care in unregistered houses, and detained in the Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum, Dundrum. The following table shows <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> in each type of establishment on 31 st December, 1950, as compared with those within official cognisance on 31 st December, 1949. <b>The</b> total <b>number</b> recorded on 31 st December, 1950, showed a net increase of 155 over the figure {{at the end of}} the previous year.

25|$|During World War I Martin Hospital was {{converted}} to an auxiliary army hospital {{and used for}} treating wounded soldiers. As the war progressed and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> increased, the hospital undertook rapid expansion to accommodate them. After the war, with increasing population the hospital again needed to expand, and in 1923 a new surgical building was constructed. However as beds were still insufficient, the authorities resorted to buying adjacent private residences to alleviate the shortage. In 1934 the Department of Gynecology was completed.|$|E
25|$|The Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP) was a UK {{care pathway}} (excluding Wales) {{covering}} palliative care options for {{patients in the}} final days or hours of life. It was developed to help doctors and nurses provide quality end-of-life care. Now discredited, the LCP was widely abused as a 'tick box exercise', with patients being casually assessed as terminal, heavily sedated, and denied water so the diagnosis became self-fulfilling. Hospitals were also provided cash incentives to achieve targets for <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> killed on the LCP.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide, about 3,500 heart transplants are {{performed}} annually. The {{vast majority of}} these {{are performed}} in the United States (2,000–2,300 annually). Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, currently is the largest heart transplant center in the world, having performed 132 adult transplants in 2015 alone. About 800,000 people have NYHA Class IV heart failure symptoms indicating advanced heart failure. The great disparity between <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> needing transplants {{and the number of}} procedures being performed spurred research into the transplantation of non-human hearts into humans after 1993.

25|$|The {{hospital}} itself, however, is {{the busiest}} dental {{hospitals in the}} city.
