5|$|In February 1832 Etty began a {{campaign}} of writing to local York newspapers urging <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the walls, and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention. Although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation {{in light of the}} damage their demolition would do to the tourist trade, many locals—whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry—remained hostile to the preservation campaigns. A proposal in 1838 by the York and North Midland Railway to cut an archway through the walls to allow access to a railway station within the walls galvanised Etty, and he delivered two lectures on <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the walls during visits to York in 1838–39, and made four paintings of the Bars. Etty's words went unheeded and the archway was duly cut in the walls, much to his dismay, although the station was soon moved to its current location outside the walls to allow through the running of trains to both north and south. While the walls were eventually saved in 1889, many years after Etty's death, Etty is sometimes credited with their salvation. It is open to debate how significant his part was. Some authors feel that his interventions had no impact and <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the walls was the result of decisions made by the Corporation and lobbying by local newspapers, while others feel that the Corporation would not have made these decisions had Etty and other like-minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so.|$|E

The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort for <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the Mediterranean monk seal.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{sufficient}} condition for <b>the</b> positive <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> boundary curves for each edges of bicubic rectangular Said-Ball patches will be discussed. With {{the use of}} polynomial solution of fourth order linear PDEs, these curves are defined on rectangular grid for the purpose <b>of</b> enhancing <b>the</b> positivity <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interpolating surface. Through an independent adjustment of the lower boundary of edge Said-Ball ordinates, a {{sufficient condition}} on boundary curves for individual edge of bicubic rectangular Said-Ball patches is derived. By employing two well recognized test functions, finding reveals that the approach proposed is appropriate with regard to positive <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> boundary curves {{and that there is}} improvement in <b>the</b> positive <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole interpolating surfaces...|$|R

5|$|The power {{stations}} {{were among the}} last remaining heavy industrial buildings in modern Tyneside, and their demolition was felt by many Tynesiders to have {{marked the end of}} industrial Tyneside.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the Talyllyn Railway {{by volunteers}} was the {{inspiration}} for the 1953 film The Titfield Thunderbolt, an Ealing Studios comedy about a group of villagers attempting to run a service on a disused branch line after closure. T. E. B. Clarke, the script writer for the film, had heard about <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the Talyllyn and spent a day on the railway in 1951, and some of the early incidents in preservation were incorporated into the film. In the book Railway Adventure Tom Rolt recalled that he had hoped the film might be produced on the Talyllyn, but it was eventually filmed on the recently closed Camerton branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway branch line along the Cam Brook valley in Somerset.|$|E
