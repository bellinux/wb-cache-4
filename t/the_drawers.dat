500|$|The final straw {{for many}} regular {{officers}} was Prime Minister Robert Menzies' announcement that all commands in the Second AIF {{would go to}} Militia officers, which Berryman considered [...] "a damn insult to the professional soldier, calculated to split the Army down the centre. We were to be the hewers of wood and <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> of water. We, {{the only people who}} really knew the job, were to assist these Militia fellows." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Noah and the flood, the third {{play in the}} Chester cycle, was {{originally}} performed by the city's Guild of <b>the</b> <b>Drawers</b> of Dee, otherwise known as the water-carriers. A feature of this play, observed by the historian Rosemary Woolf, is the depiction of Noah's wife, and by implication women generally, as disobedient, obdurate and finally abusive, {{in contrast to the}} [...] "grave and obedient" [...] Noah and his patient sons.|$|E
500|$|The troops nicknamed him [...] "Mr Chips", {{after the}} title {{character}} of the best selling 1934 novel Goodbye, Mr. Chips and the subsequent 1939 film, a reference to his peacetime profession, {{but also to the}} impression he gave of being cool, reserved and strict. Some of his staff had reservations about him. Colonel Alan Vasey, his Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General, asserted that Mackay lacked the ruthlessness to remove Militia officers who were not performing well. Vasey fumed about [...] "that bloody schoolteacher who wants to dot every 'i' and cross every 't'". Many regular officers were embittered by years of slow promotion followed by Prime Minister Robert Menzies ordering that commands in the 6th Division be given to Militia officers. Colonel Frank Berryman considered this [...] "a damn insult to the professional soldier, calculated to split the Army down the centre. We were to be the hewers of wood and <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> of water. We, the only people who really knew the job, were to assist these Militia fellows". Berryman, who worked closely with Mackay as his chief of staff, held him in high regard. [...] "For moral and physical courage", said Berryman, [...] "few equalled him—none ever surpassed him. He was an educated and most knowledgeable soldier... and extremely patient". His Commander, Royal Australian Artillery, a reservist, Brigadier Edmund Herring, considered Mackay [...] "a most competent and able commander in North Africa and Greece, but a bit old... Modest, dignified, shy and scholarly... In action he never knew the meaning of fear..." ...|$|E

2500|$|By the 8th century {{there is}} {{evidence}} of the wearing in Europe of two layers of trousers, especially among upper-class males. The under layer is today referred to by costume historians as [...] "drawers", although that usage did not emerge until the late 16th century. Over <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> were worn trousers of wool or linen, which in the 10th century began to be referred to as breeches in many places. Tightness of fit and length of leg varied by period, class, and geography. (Open legged trousers can be seen on the Norman soldiers of the Bayeux Tapestry.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara deduced {{from the}} {{separate}} mention of [...] "all {{the men of}} Israel," [...] "your stranger," [...] and [...] "the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water" [...] in [...] that Moses meant to decree that the hewers of wood and <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> of water (whom the Gemara deduced from [...] were Gibeonites) were to be considered neither Israelites nor converts in that generation. The Gemara further deduced that in [...] Joshua extended that decree of separation for the period during which the Sanctuary existed, and in [...] David extended the decree for all generations.|$|E

Having delivered her message for Clarissa she leaves and Pippa reappears eating a bun and carrying a book she has bought which she mysteriously describes as a [...] "recipe book" [...] although it strangely speaks of candles. Asked by Jeremy if she likes living at Copplestone Court, Pippa enthuses over the house and shows Jeremy a hidden door {{at the back of the}} room which leads to a small recess. This in turn has another hidden door at the back which leads to the library.|$|E

5000|$|An {{advantage}} to <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> of using cheques instead of debit card transactions, {{is that they}} know <b>the</b> <b>drawer's</b> bank will not release the money until several days later.

2500|$|Hague has {{a widely}} known {{reputation}} for corruption and bossism {{and has been}} called [...] "the grandaddy of Jersey bosses." [...] By {{the time he left}} office in 1947, he enjoyed palatial homes, European vacations, and a private suite at the Plaza Hotel. His wealth has been estimated to have been over $10 million {{at the time of his}} death, although his City salary never exceeded $8,500 per year and he had no other legitimate source of income. His desk, according to legend, had a specially designed lap drawer which could be pushed outward towards the person with whom he was meeting. This allowed his [...] "guests" [...] to discreetly deliver bribes in the form of envelopes containing large amounts of cash. [...] However, according to New Jersey preservationist John Hallanan, <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> were a traditional feature of 19th century partners desks and that [...] "he last thing [...] would need to do is take a bribe personally." [...] As of September 2013, the desk was in storage awaiting restoration.|$|E
2500|$|As he praises Mackintosh's {{impressive}} {{talents and}} intellect, however, Hazlitt also brings out his limitations. In demolishing his adversaries, including Godwin and the reformers {{in his famous}} lectures, Mackintosh [...] "seemed to stand {{with his back to}} <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> in a metaphysical dispensary, and to take out of them whatever ingredients suited his purpose. In this way he had an antidote for every error, an answer to every folly. The writings of Burke, Hume, Berkeley, Paley, Lord Bacon, Jeremy Taylor, Grotius, Puffendorf, Cicero, Aristotle, Tacitus, Livy, Sully, Machiavel, Guicciardini, Thuanus, lay open beside him, and he could instantly lay his hand upon the passage, and quote them chapter and verse to the clearing up of all difficulties, and the silencing of all oppugners." [...] But there is a fatal flaw in all this impressive intellectual [...] "juggling" [...] (which, Tom Paulin notes, alludes to Hazlitt's earlier contrast between the deft but mechanical [...] "Indian jugglers" [...] and representatives of true genius): his performances were [...] "philosophical centos", the thoughts of others simply stitched together. [...] "They were profound, brilliant, new to his hearers; but the profundity, the brilliancy, the novelty were not his own." [...] For all his impressive erudition, Mackintosh's writing and speaking are entirely unoriginal.|$|E
2500|$|Javed Akhtar narrates: [...] "Kamal sahab {{gave me a}} job {{and helped}} me. My salary was Rs.50 {{and even in the}} 60s, you could not rent a house with that amount of money. I used to sleep {{in a corner of the}} studio. I started living in the costume room of the studio. I didn't have enough money to even go out to have a meal. In the evenings I would just potter around in <b>the</b> <b>drawers.</b> There were many {{cupboards}} filled with costumes of Pakeezah; sherwanis, dresses, shoes. One day I opened a drawer and found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar in India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings I would come back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in front of the mirror, acting how I would accept it if I were to receive it. The first trophy I held in my hand was that of Meena Kumari! I was an eighteen-year-old boy who had no home, no money, no food, but these trophies encouraged me to achieve my dreams, and for this, I will be always thankful to Meena-ji." ...|$|E
