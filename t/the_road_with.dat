5|$|The layout {{was unique}} {{within the city}} of Napa, {{and may have been}} unique within California. The site {{differentiated}} from most agricultural sites by facing away from <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>with</b> no distinct difference between middle-class and workers' houses, in size, finishing, or location. Many of the buildings shared walls or were built abutting each other, and two of the houses were built over a single basement.|$|E

In the last game of March, Benfica faced Campomaiorense on <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>With</b> a 1–1 draw, the team avoided losing all of their matches in March. However, their need to get points was aggravated, especially if they wanted to qualify for the European competitions.|$|E
5|$|Between 1943 and 1951, fictional collie Lassie was the {{inspiration}} for seven MGM feature films. With completion of the seventh film in 1951, the studio planned no further films for the Lassie character or Pal, the dog actor who portrayed the character. In lieu of $40,000 back pay owed him by MGM, Pal's owner and trainer Rudd Weatherwax took all rights to the Lassie trademark and name, and hit <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>with</b> Pal to perform at fairs, rodeos, and other venues.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Angel, Islington, {{sits at the}} {{far east}} end of Pentonville Road, at its junction with Islington High Street. It was named after the Angel of the Annunciation that appeared on its sign.

The site was cut in two by the construction of <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>with</b> the inn remaining on the north side. A new building was constructed in 1899, later becoming a Lyons Corner House. It closed in 1959, and was threatened with demolition as a plan to improve junction improvements around Pentonville Road, but survived and is now partly occupied by a branch of The Co-operative Bank.|$|E

In 1970, he married Joann Barthe, with whom he had two children, Jacques and Mélanie. During his early career Villeneuve took his family on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>with</b> him in a motorhome during the racing season, a habit which he continued to some extent during his Formula One career. He often claimed to have been born in 1952.

5|$|Waterfall Gully Road is {{meandering}} and in {{some parts}} quite narrow. This has led to concerns regarding safety, as the road is frequented by both pedestrians and cyclists. After {{the death of a}} cyclist in 2007, calls for the repair and resurfacing of the road intensified, with two petitions being tabled in parliament. The accident also led to a safety audit being conducted by TransportSA, and although the results were not released to the public at the time, it called for an investigation of {{the entire length of the}} road. As of mid-2008, there has been no clear plan released for the future of <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>with</b> the road missing out on funding in the 2008 state budget.|$|E
5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F.

This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been completed, with the ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will also add four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|E

5|$|Between 1952 and 1954, 398 armored {{vehicles}} were destroyed, 84% {{of them from}} mines and booby traps. Typically, the Viet Minh ambushed convoys by obstructing <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>with</b> a fallen tree or pile of boulders, and then destroying {{the first and last}} vehicles of the halted convoy with remote mines. Caltrops, mines and the steep cliff faces naturally found at the road side aided in funneling the target convoy into a small area, where machine guns, mortars and recoilless rifles were trained. Viet Minh Regiment 95 repeatedly deployed these tactics, inflicting severe losses on the French forces passing along Route One, which led to its French nickname of la rue sans joie ("the Street Without Joy"). Regiment 95 was, along with regiments 18 and 101, part of the Viet Minh Division 325, commanded by General Tran Quy Ha. The division was formed in 1951 from pre-existing units in Thừa Thiên just north of Route One, and became operational in the summer of 1952.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood played Frank Horrigan in the Secret Service thriller In the Line of Fire (1993), {{directed}} by Wolfgang Petersen and co-starring John Malkovich and Rene Russo. Horrigan is a guilt-ridden Secret Service agent haunted by {{his failure to}} save John F. Kennedy's life. The film was among the top10 box office performers in that year, earning $102million in the United States alone. Later in 1993, he directed and co-starred alongside Kevin Costner in A Perfect World. Set in the 1960s, Eastwood plays a Texas Ranger in pursuit of an escaped convict (Costner) who hits <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>with</b> a young boy (T.J. Lowther). Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film marked the highest point of Eastwood's directing career, and the film has since been cited {{as one of his}} most underrated directorial achievements.|$|E
5|$|Elwell {{advanced}} inland {{rapidly and}} was soon also engaged, losing one killed and two wounded in a brief skirmish. During the advance the Australians had also uncovered and defused a large pipe mine the Germans had buried under a narrow track and set to detonate using a command wire. These mines had been laid beneath <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>with</b> wires leading to an electric battery and a firing key {{at the bottom of}} a lookout tree. By 13:00 however, Hill's position was reached and the Australians—now under Elwell's overall command—launched another flanking attack on the main trench blocking the road. Despite suffering heavy casualties they pressed their attack, forcing the defenders to surrender after charging the trench with fixed bayonets. A German officer and 20Melanesians were captured. Four Australians were killed, including Elwell who died leading the charge with his sword drawn, and another five were wounded.|$|E
