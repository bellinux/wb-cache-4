5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the {{citizens}} of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake,</b> which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E
5|$|Among the top predators {{of adult}} Carolina wrens are {{domestic}} cats, and snakes {{such as the}} <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake.</b> Raccoons and black rat snakes also feed on wren eggs and nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The ratings also do {{not reflect}} state-specific {{population}} conditions. For instance, for the Texas horned lizard, much of eastern Texas has lost the animal. Nevertheless, based on healthy populations {{in other parts of}} the West, especially New Mexico, the IUCN rates the animal Least Concern. For the <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (West Virginia), the IUCN notes the animal as losing range in many parts of the northeastern U.S., but because the animal is numerous in the southern Appalachians, it is also Least Concern.|$|E
50|$|Some {{places in}} the area have been {{reported}} to have <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eastern screech owls, <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes,</b> bobcats, broad-banded copperheads, American mink, weasels, {{and striped}} skunks are known predators.|$|R
50|$|During the winter, <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> brumate in dens, in {{limestone}} crevices, often {{together with}} copperheads and black rat snakes.|$|R
5|$|Other hazards include venomous snakes, {{including}} the Eastern <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> and copperhead, which are common along the trail. Both snakes are generally found in drier, rockier {{sections of the}} trail; the copperhead's range extends north to around the New Jersey–New York state line, while rattlesnakes are commonly found along the trail in Connecticut and have been reported, although rarely, {{as far north as}} New Hampshire. Other large mammals commonly sighted include deer; elk, reintroduced in the Smoky Mountains; and moose, which may be found in the vicinity of Massachusetts and northward.|$|E
5|$|Still {{other animals}} seem to thrive {{regardless}} of the maturity of the forest or {{the presence of the}} understory. Common animals found in Quehanna include chipmunks, porcupine, and beaver, omnivores such as the black bear and raccoon, and predators like bobcat, red fox, and coyote (which has been in Pennsylvania since the 1930s). Many of the streams in Quehanna Wild Area are known for trout (brook, brown and rainbow); some populations are wild and others are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association. The wild area is also home to <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake,</b> eastern garter snake, and spring peeper (a type of frog), as well as butterflies like great spangled fritillary, monarch, red-spotted purple, and black, eastern tiger, and spicebush swallowtails. Any of these mammals, especially the white-tailed deer, can carry ticks, and such tick-borne diseases as Lyme disease are a health concern for hikers.|$|E
25|$|Vermont {{contains}} {{one species}} of venomous snake, the <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake,</b> which {{is confined to}} a few acres in western Rutland County.|$|E
50|$|Much of the mountain, being {{shattered}} rock, is home {{to large}} populations of <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes.</b> There are also black bears, turkeys, and deer, as well as vultures and raptors.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife on North Fork Mountain {{includes}} whitetail deer, wild turkey, black bear, Coyotes, bobcats, gray foxes, <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes,</b> eastern newts, and {{a variety}} of other bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species.|$|R
50|$|<b>Timber</b> <b>Rattlesnakes</b> {{have already}} gone extinct in Maine and Rhode Island {{and only one}} {{population}} remains in New Hampshire. They are protected {{in many of the}} Appalachian states but their populations continue to decline.|$|R
25|$|Kings Gap is {{suitable}} habitat {{for a variety}} of reptiles, including the box turtle, the five-lined skink (one of Pennsylvania's few lizards), the northern copperhead and the <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake.</b> Sightings of these reptiles are not uncommon in the summer months. In the Mansion Day Use Area, copperheads and rattlesnakes are sometimes seen hunting rodents along the stone walls of the mansion patio and garden. Although these snakes are venomous and should be respected, in their natural habitats they retreat when threatened. The <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> is classified as a candidate species in Pennsylvania, which means it could receive endangered or threatened status in the future. For additional information on these reptiles, contact the center office.|$|E
25|$|The <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> can {{be found}} in the area of the {{original}} Thirteen Colonies. Its use as a symbol of the American colonies can be traced back to the publications of Benjamin Franklin. In 1751, he made the first reference to the rattlesnake in a satirical commentary published in his Pennsylvania Gazette. It had been the policy of Great Britain to send convicted criminals to the Americas, so Franklin suggested that they thank the British by sending rattlesnakes to England.|$|E
25|$|The cave is {{populated}} {{by both the}} brown bat and northern long ear bat. The cave stream contains fish known as sculpin. Snakes of the surrounding area include the copperhead, <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake,</b> rat snake, and kingsnake. Over 115 species of birds have been identified by researchers at Russell Cave, a site on the North Alabama Birding Trail. Although the site is now below the southern boundary of their range, porcupine bones {{have been found in}} digs at the earliest occupational levels. The peccary, also hunted by the occupants, is no longer found in this region.|$|E
50|$|Their prey {{are mainly}} small mammals, but may include small birds, frogs, mice, other small animals, or other snakes. Although capable of {{consuming}} other rattlesnakes, {{the most common}} snakes they eat are garter snakes. Like most <b>rattlesnakes,</b> <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> are known to utilize chemical cues to find sites to ambush their prey and will often strike their prey and track them until they can be consumed. <b>Timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> are known to use fallen logs as a waiting site for prey to pass by, giving them an elevated perch from which to effectively strike their prey, which is almost entirely terrestrial rather than arboreal (even arboreal prey such as squirrels tends to be caught {{when they come to}} the ground). The primary foods by genera of <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> were as follows: Peromyscus (33.3%), Microtus (10.9%), Tamias (qv) (10.6%), Sylvilagus (10.4%), Sigmodon (5.3%) and Sciurus (4.2%). Based on examination of the snout-to-vent length, it was found that juvenile <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> differed slightly in dietary preferences from adult rattlesnakes, being more likely to consume smaller prey such as shrews (averaging 8 g and unable to attack subadult eastern cottontail rabbits (averaging 500 - 1000 g but Peromyscus was the number one prey item for both young and adult rattlesnakes. Several birds, although always secondary to mammals, are also known to be hunted, mainly ground-dwelling species such as bobwhites, but also a surprising number of passerines.|$|R
5000|$|Part of Glastonbury {{resides in}} an area called [...] "Kongscut Mountain", locally called [...] "Rattlesnake Mountain", {{because it has a}} small {{population}} of <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes.</b> Since that area is sparsely developed and mostly in a state forest, the snakes don't pose much of a threat.|$|R
50|$|Chrysosporium {{has been}} {{identified}} as an emerging infectious disease, first in Canada affecting reptiles at around 1995. It infected eastern massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus). By 2011, it had affected northern copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix mokasen), <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes,</b> black rat snakes, black racer snakes and eastern garter snakes in New Jersey.|$|R
25|$|Dominant fauna of the Escarpment are {{the species}} found {{elsewhere}} in the Catskills: white-tailed deer, porcupine, fisher, black bear and snowshoe hare. There have been some rare bobcat sightings up on the ridge. Bird species like the rare Bicknell's thrush and ruffed grouse nest in the boreal forests. A few <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> dens are known to exist on the rocky ledges of Overlook {{at the southern end}} of the range. The paucity of water on the ridgetops and the slopes means that there are few major fish or amphibian species in the Escarpment, save around North-South Lake.|$|E
25|$|Beginning at mile 50.7 of the Skyline Drive {{near the}} Byrd Visitor Center, Dark Hollow Falls Trail leads {{downhill}} beside Hogcamp Branch to Dark Hollow Falls, a 70-foot cascade. The {{distance from the}} trailhead {{to the base of}} the falls is 0.7 mile, although the trail continues beyond that point, crossing the creek and connecting with the Rose River fire road. Various fauna can be viewed along the trail, including occasional sightings of black bear and <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake.</b> While the trail is relatively short, parts of it are steep and may prove challenging to some visitors. There is no view from the brink of the falls, and slippery rocks make it inadvisable to leave the trail.|$|E
25|$|The Holyoke Range hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak {{and a variety of}} understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be more similar to the adjacent Berkshire plateau containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak-hickory forest forest types. Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in Massachusetts. Because the traprock ridges generate such varied terrain, they are the home of several plant and animal species that are state-listed or globally rare, such as the <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake.</b>|$|E
50|$|While black bears, bobcats and <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> {{can present}} dangers, {{it is only}} if one is foolish or very unlucky. When bears and people cross paths in the wild, usually the bear just wishes to leave the area. Very rarely will a bear act hostile towards people. (See Bear danger).|$|R
25|$|The Pine Barrens {{is home to}} {{at least}} 39 species of mammals, over 300 species of birds, 59 reptile and {{amphibian}} species, and 91 fish species. At least 43 species are considered threatened and endangered by the NJ Division of Fish and Wildlife, including the rare eastern <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus horridus) and bald eagles.|$|R
50|$|Cash {{prizes and}} trophies are often given out to {{participants}} in categories like heaviest, longest, or most snakes. These incentives result in all {{size classes of}} snakes being targeted equally. Most roundups target the western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), though some events target prairie <b>rattlesnakes</b> (C. viridis), <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (C. horridus), or the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (C. adamanteus).|$|R
500|$|West Virginia {{named the}} <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> as its state reptile in 2008. A 2009 article, [...] "West Virginia's state reptile", {{in the state}} {{wildlife}} magazine drew {{a connection to the}} older American rattlesnake symbol: ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{there is}} no {{official}} reptile of the United States, {{some of the state}} reptiles have had previous appearances in American politics. [...] In particular, the <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (West Virginia) has had close association with American independence.|$|E
500|$|Before {{their formal}} {{designation}} as state reptiles, Florida's alligator, Maryland's terrapin, and Texas's horned lizard were all mascots {{of a major}} in-state university. [...] West Virginia's <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> was an early American flag element dating back to 1775.|$|E
50|$|Species {{with long}} periods of brumation tend to have much lower {{reproductive}} rates than those with shorter brumation periods, or {{those that do not}} brumate all. Female <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> in high peaks in the Appalachian Mountains of New England reproduce every three years on average; the lance-headed rattlesnake (C. polystictus), native to the warm climate of Mexico, reproduces annually.|$|R
5000|$|Snake Hill - Stillwater. An outcrop on {{the east}} side of the lake named for <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> that denned there until their {{extirpation}} in the mid-1800s. This was the only known rattlesnake den to have ever occurred in Saratoga County. The county placed a bounty on rattlesnakes from 1948 to 1950, after the snakes were extirpated.|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of doing botanical survey work in 2003, box turtles, painted turtles, and black racers were found. Given anecdotal evidence, {{available}} habitats, and historical records, {{it is likely that}} the entire area of the Partners’ properties is used by northern copperheads and <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes.</b> There is also the possibility of a few den sites of copperheads on the properties.|$|R
500|$|Benjamin Franklin, {{writing as}} an {{anonymous}} person, submitted {{the following statement}} concerning the disposition of the <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> to the Pennsylvania Journal in 1775: [...] "She never begins an attack, nor, when once engaged, ever surrenders: She is therefore an emblem of magnanimity and true courage...she never wounds ‘till she has generously given notice, even to her enemy, and cautioned him against the danger of treading on her." ...|$|E
500|$|A United States flag with a <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> predates {{the stars}} and stripes flag. [...] In 1775, Christopher Gadsden {{developed}} an emblem with a coiled rattlesnake with the words [...] "Don't tread on me" [...] on a yellow background. [...] Versions of the Gadsden flag were used by the Continental Navy's first commodore, early Marines, and minutemen and regular army units in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.|$|E
500|$|Mammals {{typically}} found in Brown County State Park include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern gray squirrels, and chipmunks. [...] The larger sycamore trees are sometimes {{the home of}} raccoons and flying squirrels. [...] Red bats live in the park's Ten O'Clock Line nature preserve. [...] Other animals include the American toad, the eastern box turtle, the spotted salamander, and the red-backed salamander. [...] At least two species of snakes live in the park: the <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> and the copperhead. [...] The two lakes contain bass and bluegill.|$|E
50|$|The snakes {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter underground or in deep crevices. They may congregate in the same dens with other species of snakes, such as copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix), black racers (Coluber constrictor), and <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus horridus). In Northern climes, the snakes are active from late April to October and mate in May or June. It is active earlier in the South.|$|R
5000|$|The {{males of}} some species, such as <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (C. horridus), {{fight each other}} during the mating season, in {{competition}} over females. These fights known as [...] "combat dances" [...] consist of the two males intertwining the anterior portion of their bodies, often with their heads and necks held vertically. The larger males usually end up driving the smaller males away.|$|R
40|$|Snakes {{are often}} {{regarded}} as the least social of all vertebrate groups, but this assumption {{stems from the fact}} that they are secretive and difficult to observe in nature, rather than direct evidence. Recent studies have revealed a surprising degree of social complexity in snakes. Here, I examine the ability of captive-raised <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus horridus) to recognize siblings by measuring the mean separation distance and frequency of contact between pairs of individuals housed together. The results show that female siblings associate more closely with each other than nonsibling pairs. Previous studies have shown that <b>timber</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> occupying the same hibernacula have higher relatedness than snakes using neighbouring hibernacula, and frequently form social aggregations. Rattlesnakes exhibit other characteristics consistent with advanced sociality, including group defence, conspecific alarm signals and maternal defence of young. These findings reinforce the notion that, rather than being solitary and asocial, some snake species may form family groups...|$|R
