5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even trying to take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E
5|$|His dispositions for {{the battle}} are {{described}} as a clear mistake leaving the right far <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> and the left much too weak. Only the fact that Bagration and Barclay were to cooperate fully saved the Russian army and did much to mitigate the bad positioning. Nothing would be more damning than 300 artillery pieces standing silent on the Russian right.|$|E
5|$|The club's first {{experience}} of Europe came in 1966–67 season when, {{helped by a}} clutch of Scandinavian players, United defeated Inter-Cities Fairs Cup holders FC Barcelona both home and away.

5|$|Traditionally, lard {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although clarified butter {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E
5|$|When Blackbird {{learned of}} this, he ordered {{an attack on}} the Kitkehahkis. The Omahas descended upon the band's village, burned and plundered many of the lodges, and killed about one hundred Pawnees at the cost of about fifteen of their own men. The {{remaining}} Kitkehahkis had withdrawn into four lodges, occupying a position <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> for the Omahas to reach them and massacre them without unacceptable losses.|$|E
5|$|Again the defences were {{strengthened}} in September, {{in advance}} of a second siege which began on 16 October. By this stage only ten per cent of Edinburgh's inhabitants remained in the city. The besiegers under Regent Mar had only seven guns, and while they did manage to breach the Flodden Wall, the inner defences were <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> for an assault. By 21 October the siege was once again lifted. A blockade of the town was continued until July 1572 when a truce was agreed. Grange retreated into the castle and handed over the town to the Regent's party. The siege of Edinburgh Castle continued until May 1573, when it was finally reduced by a battery of guns shipped from England.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{the balance}} of power {{appeared}} to move slightly in Matilda's favour. Robert of Gloucester besieged Stephen in 1143 at Wilton Castle, an assembly point for royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the Battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved <b>too</b> <b>strong,</b> and for a moment it appeared that Stephen might be captured for a second time, before finally managing to escape. Later in the year Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Earl of Essex, rose up in rebellion against Stephen in East Anglia. Geoffrey based himself from the Isle of Ely and began a military campaign against Cambridge, with the intention of progressing south towards London. Ranulf of Chester revolted once again in the summer of 1144.|$|E
5|$|Big Huge Games added {{multiple}} {{new features}} {{to the game}} during its development, {{in an attempt to}} fix issues with the original version. In an interview with GameSpot, executive producer Tim Train explained the development of the expansion pack. He stated how some nations were previously either too weak or <b>too</b> <b>strong,</b> and so features were added to balance gameplay. One way they did this is armed caravans and merchants were added to the Dutch nation, in order to weaken raids initiated by other players who rush their opponent. He said Big Huge Games brought in professional players in order to get suggestions on how to improve the game.|$|E
5|$|British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby {{decided to}} push his {{advantage}} after scattering Irvine's troops. He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church, located on a hillock. Howe arrived a short while later, and ascended {{to the top of}} the church's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions. Deciding the American defenses were <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> to attack with his present force, he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire; however, his guns did not have the range to hit Washington's defenses. His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night, and planned a new way of attack for the following day.|$|E

5|$|For the new attack, Nelson was to {{take three}} ships of the line, three frigates, {{including}} Emerald, and 200 marines, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, a combination of strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> and the British had to ask for an honourable withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|In May 1638, {{fresh from}} his defeat over Kent Island, Claiborne {{received}} a commission from the Providence Land Company, who were advised by {{his old friend}} Maurice Thomson, {{to create a new}} colony on Ruatan Island off the coast of Honduras in the Caribbean Sea. At the time, Honduras itself was a part of Spain's Kingdom of Guatemala, and Spanish settlements dominated the mainland of Central America. Claiborne optimistically called his new colony Rich Island, but Spanish power in the area was <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> and the colony was destroyed in 1642.|$|E
5|$|In November 1979, Brock met Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering, Inc. Concerned that Fechter's {{animatronics}} {{would be}} <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> a competition for Bushnell’s work, Brock requested that Bushnell release {{him from the}} co-development agreement, citing misrepresentation. In December 1979, Brock and Fechter formed “Showbiz Pizza Place Inc”, severing Brock's business relationship with Bushnell. ShowBiz Pizza Place was conceptually identical to Pizza Time Theatre in all aspects except for animation, which would be provided by Creative Engineering. Showbiz Pizza Place opened its first location on March 3, 1980, in Kansas City, Missouri.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fluid {{flow and}} heat {{transfer}} of viscoelastic materials in noncircular duct are complicated subject because of nonlinear behavior of rheological properties. In this paper flow and heat transfer of CEF fluids are studied with numerical modeling. Numerical solution {{is based on}} the artificial compressibility method and by using staggered mesh. The effect of secondary flows on the forced and natural heat convection is studied and dis tribution of velocity, temperature, pressure and secondary flows are shown. The CFD code was used in this research work is written by authors. In this paper, it is shown that the buoyancy has <b>too</b> <b>stronger</b> effect on secondary flows generation and heat transfer than the second normal stress difference.

5|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the regiment supported first the 6th, {{and then the}} 5th Brigades in their attacks on Orsogna, {{as part of the}} Moro River Campaign. The tanks struggled to break into Orsogna and although the infantry made some gains, the German defences were <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> and the attack soon faded into a stalemate, with a number of back and forth actions as winter set in. These movements saw many of the regiment's tanks become stuck in the sodden ground. Offensive operations around Orsogna ceased in late December and the New Zealanders withdrew from the area on 13 January 1944.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{fought it}} out with McCarthy in the primaries, as Humphrey used {{favorite}} son stand-ins to help him win delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Kennedy was assassinated, leaving Humphrey as McCarthy's main challenger. But Humphrey's organization was <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> for McCarthy to overcome, and his anti-war campaign was split after the late entrance of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota {{just ahead of the}} Democratic National Convention. Despite winning the popular vote, McCarthy lost to Humphrey at the convention amidst protests and riots.|$|E
5|$|Leech {{was named}} in the Olympic squad and the Australian Swimming Union {{exempted}} her from travelling to the national training camp in Townsville so she could train with Froelich, who understood her special dietary requirements. She joined the squad for the final race trials in Melbourne in October before the Olympics. Fraser and Crapp were <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> in the 100-metre freestyle, with Leech finishing second and third in the two races. After combining with Fraser, Crapp and Margaret Gibson to break the world record for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay, Leech was selected as one of Australia's three entrants in the 100-metre freestyle events and one of six swimmers for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay squad for the Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Many species forage {{for food}} in the canopy of trees, taking {{advantage}} of serotiny (the storage of a large supply of seed in cones or gumnuts by plant genera such as Eucalyptus, Banksia and Hakea), a natural feature of the Australian landscape in dryer regions. These woody fruiting bodies are inaccessible to many species and harvested in the main by parrots, cockatoos and rodents in more tropical regions. The larger cones can be opened by the large bills of cockatoos but are <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits lie {{on the end of}} small branches which are unable to support the weight of the foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself and holds it with its foot.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 May, in {{response}} to Belgian pressure and necessity, the Royal Air Force and the Armée de l'Air undertook several air attacks on the German-held Maastricht and Meuse bridges to prevent German forces flowing into Belgium. 74 sorties had been flown by the Allies since 10 May. On 12 May, eleven out of eighteen French Breguet 693 bombers were shot down. The RAF Advanced Air Striking Force, which included the largest Allied bomber force, was reduced to 72 aircraft out of 135 by 12 May. For the next 24 hours, missions were postponed as the German anti-aircraft and fighter defences were <b>too</b> <b>strong.</b>|$|E
5|$|Overnight, the 1st and 3rd Parachute battalions had skirted as {{far south}} as 2nd Parachute Battalion's {{original}} route into the city, hoping to follow them into Arnhem centre. They approached the German line before light and for several hours attempted to fight through the German positions. Spindler's force—being continually reinforced—was <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> to penetrate, and by 10:00 the British advance was stopped. A more coordinated attack followed in the afternoon, but it too was repulsed. Urquhart attempted to return to his Divisional Headquarters at Oosterbeek but became cut off and was forced to take shelter in a Dutch family's loft with two fellow officers. Lathbury was injured and also forced into hiding.|$|E

40|$|In {{mixed reality}} (MR) system, it is {{important}} to add shading and shadows of virtual objects correctly in order to adjust the view of the virtual objects with the real scene. To achieve the photometric consistency, we need to estimate the illumination distribution of the real scene. At this time, it is preferable to be able to estimate the illumination distribution from a background image without any extra devices. This paper describes a method to estimate the illumination distribution from a single image using shadows for outdoor mixed reality (MR) system. In previous works, particular reference objects or two input images with/without a reference object are required. There is also a difficulty in stably estimating surrounding light distributions because the sun light is <b>too</b> <b>stronger</b> than the sky light. We propose a method to obtain the shadow information from a single image using an illumination invariant value. Moreover, the uniform sky model is applied to estimate the surrounding light distribution stably. The experimental results show the accuracy and the stability of our method in comparison to the conventional methods...|$|R
