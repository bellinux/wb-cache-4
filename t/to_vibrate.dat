5|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} for a mechanical part <b>to</b> <b>vibrate</b> {{in a number of}} different modes, however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the straightforward longitudinal mode some others which are used include flexural mode, torsional mode, radial mode and drumhead mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had <b>to</b> <b>vibrate</b> up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E
5|$|In {{their shared}} hotel room Walter keeps Peter awake by reciting the {{chemical}} formula for root beer. The next morning Peter expresses his unhappiness with the arrangement to Olivia (Anna Torv) and tells her {{he wants to}} leave. She can't let him do that, telling him that Walter refuses to work without him. The Fringe Team investigates the object that arrived in Brooklyn, a cylinder that is determined <b>to</b> <b>vibrate</b> at a particular frequency. In {{the course of the}} investigation, Walter assaults and forcibly sedates Junior Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) in order to hide the cylinder. He later meets with the bald man at a diner.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{cortical}} reorganization after long time exposure <b>to</b> hand-held <b>vibrating</b> tools, we investigated 10 dental technicians with sensory neuropathy after long time exposure <b>to</b> <b>vibrating</b> tools and 10 controls for cortical changes using functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} at 3 T. The activated volumes corresponding to individual fingers in the hand area of S 1 were significantly larger in the neuropathy group than in controls. Activation in the primary motor cortex did not differ significantly from controls. These changes are likely the result of cortical reorganization following long-term non-physiological sensory input and they can partly explain the symptoms seen in vibration-induced neuropathy...|$|R
50|$|Commands {{from the}} {{joystick}} are relayed to the missile along the trailing wires, these commands are amplified {{by a small}} transistor circuit in the missile and are routed <b>to</b> <b>vibrating</b> spoilers on {{the trailing edge of}} the missile's four wings based on the direction of the command and the gyro-sensed orientation of the missile.|$|R
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it <b>to</b> <b>vibrate.</b> The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways <b>to</b> <b>vibrate</b> the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it <b>to</b> <b>vibrate.</b> As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
50|$|The {{deaf and}} {{hard of hearing}} are often unable to {{perceive}} auditory alarms when asleep. They may use specialized alarms, including alarms with flashing lights instead of or in addition to noise. Alarms which can connect <b>to</b> <b>vibrating</b> devices (small ones inserted into pillows, or larger ones placed under bedposts to shake the bed) also exist.|$|R
50|$|Wireless home safety {{solutions}} are available that link carbon monoxide detectors <b>to</b> <b>vibrating</b> pillow pads, strobes or a remote warning handset. This allows those with impediments such as hard of hearing, partially sighted, heavy sleepers or the infirm the precious minutes {{to wake up}} and get out in the event of carbon monoxide in their property.|$|R

It ceased, and another began.|$|R
5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum <b>to</b> <b>vibrate</b> and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability <b>to</b> <b>vibrate</b> at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E

50|$|The low {{amount of}} power {{required}} to run a gyratory screener enables an overall low cost of operation for this machine. This {{is due to the}} relatively lower energy required for gyratory motion compared <b>to</b> <b>vibrating</b> a massive frame. The low running cost as well as the low purchasing cost of gyratory equipment make it one of the more commonly used machines for solid-solid mechanical separation.|$|R

25|$|The {{feedback}} is essentially incompressible; {{the speed of}} sound, although finite, is sufficiently large {{that it can be}} considered infinite. This action may be called near field or hydrodynamic feedback. There are a number Class I devices. The feedback that causes a stick in a water stream <b>to</b> <b>vibrate,</b> or a flag to wave, is due to hydrodynamic feedback.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recommended}} if using adhesive-backed paper labels that the labels be specially made for CD-Rs. A balanced CD vibrates only slightly when rotated at high speed. Bad or improperly made labels, or labels applied off-center, unbalance the CD {{and can cause}} it <b>to</b> <b>vibrate</b> when it spins, which causes read errors and even risks damaging the drive.|$|E

25|$|After {{investigators}} recovered {{all four}} bolts, sleeves, and pins, {{they found that}} the parts that were not replaced were counterfeit and were incorrectly heat-treated during manufacture. Those bolts each could bear only about 60% of their intended breaking strength, making them less than practical to use on the aircraft. The fake bolts and sleeves wore down excessively, causing the tail <b>to</b> <b>vibrate</b> for 16 completed flights and the accident flight.|$|E
25|$|Slab track {{can also}} {{generate}} significantly more noise pollution and cause more vibration than traditional ballasted track. While {{this is partly}} attributable to slab track's decreased sound absorption qualities, a more significant factor is that slab track typically uses softer rail fasteners to provide vertical compliance similar to ballasted track, and these can lead to more noise, because they permit the rail <b>to</b> <b>vibrate</b> over a greater length.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to detect land mines by directing sound waves at the area to be demined, which causes the land mines <b>to</b> <b>vibrate,</b> and then using a laser to search for vibrations on the surface {{by means of the}} Doppler shift - this technique is termed scanning laser doppler vibrometry.
