500|$|Fincher and Savides {{used the}} {{photographs}} of William Eggleston, Stephen Shore's work from the early Seventies, and actual photos from the Zodiac police files. The two men worked hard to capture {{the look and feel}} of the period as Fincher admitted, [...] "I suppose there could have been more VW bugs but I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> show is a pretty good representation of the time. It is not technically perfect. There are some flaws but some are intended." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle was built in the old post office in the Terminal Annex Building in downtown Los Angeles. A building on nearby Spring Street subbed for the Hall of Justice and the San Francisco Police Department. Production began on September 12, 2005. The filmmakers shot for five weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of the time in Los Angeles, bringing the film in under budget, wrapping in February 2006. The film took 115 days to shoot.|$|E
500|$|Neither brother married. Wilbur once quipped {{that he did}} {{not have}} time for both a wife and an airplane. Following a brief {{training}} flight he gave to a German pilot in Berlin in June 1911, Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, [...] "When we <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose." [...] Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters. Wilbur urged American cities to emulate the European – particularly Parisian – philosophy of apportioning generous public space near every important public building. He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would [...] "come home white".|$|E

2500|$|In {{reference}} to his own work Kelly {{said in an interview}} in 1996: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> all want from art is a sense of fixity, a sense of opposing the chaos of daily living. This an illusion, of course. Canvas rots. Paint changes color. But you keep trying to freeze the world as if you could make it last forever. In a sense, what I've tried to capture is the reality of flux, to keep art an open, incomplete situation, to get at the rapture of seeing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reports of the {{collapse}} of this part of the Union line caused great consternation at Grant's headquarters, leading to an interchange that is widely quoted in Grant biographies. An officer accosted Grant, proclaiming, [...] "General Grant, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously. I know Lee's methods well by past experience; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan, and cut us off completely from our communications." [...] Grant seemed to be waiting for such an opportunity and snapped, [...] "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command, and try to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article aims to vindicate the commonsensical {{view that}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> affects <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do. In {{order to show}} that mental {{properties}} like believing, desiring and intending are causally explanatory, I propose a nonreductive, materialistic account that identifies beliefs and desires by their content, and that shows how differences in the contents of beliefs and desires can make causal differences in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do. Key-words: mental causation; causal explanation; intentional properties; supervenience; counterfactuals. It is a truism that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> affects <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do. We all suppose that we can change the way that people act by changing their minds. Otherwise, people would not spend {{billions of dollars on}} education, propaganda, advertising, fund-raising drives, political campaigns, or market research. As obvious as this point is, there lurks a philosophical scruple that makes reflective people stand back and wonder how it is possible that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> has any causal bearing on <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do. The problem is that deep-seated contemporary assumptions about the nature of reality seem to leave no room for our ordinary convictions such as “what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> affects <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do. ” This is th...|$|R

60|$|BRAIN, n. An {{apparatus}} {{with which}} we <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> think.

A man of great wealth, or one who has been pitchforked into high station, has commonly such a headful of brain that his neighbors cannot keep their hats on.
