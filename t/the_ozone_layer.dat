5|$|Since the 1970s an {{important}} focus of {{study has been}} <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> in the atmosphere above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at Halley Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf discovered {{the existence of a}} hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the Montreal Protocol of 1989, climate projections indicate that <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} {{photosynthesis}} in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy {{to be harvested}} to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer.</b> The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer.</b> None of them can be made from directly reacting the elements.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{secondary}} <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> of <b>the</b> TLE {{is shown}} in Fig. 4 c, d. As {{in the case of}} the rotating Earth (PDE), <b>the</b> secondary <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> is only present during night-time. The formation mechanism of <b>the</b> secondary <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> on <b>the</b> TLE is similar to that of <b>the</b> observed night-time <b>ozone</b> <b>layers</b> present in both the Earth’s mesosphere and the upper atmosphere of Venus (Montmessin et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|We can, therefore, {{conclude}} {{that the use of}} an inaccurate SST in a tidally locked Earth-like exoplanet may significantly affect <b>the</b> secondary <b>ozone</b> <b>layer,</b> while <b>the</b> primary <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> remains almost unaffected.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> primary <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> O 3 VMR is {{altered by}} 1.8 % on the dayside and by 1.27 % on the nightside. <b>The</b> {{secondary}} <b>ozone</b> <b>layer,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, is altered by 40.5 %. The generation mechanism is currently {{an open question}} and under investigation.|$|R
5|$|Wesley, aware the Enterprise is in orbit, {{arranges}} for {{the children}} to passively resist. When the Aldeans request Picard's help to resolve the issue with the children, the crew finds a way to beam through the shield, allowing Commander Riker and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to sneak onto the planet. Data manages to disable the Custodian, disrupting the Aldean's transporter and planetary shield. Dr. Crusher explains to the Aldeans that their shield has weakened <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> of their planet, exposing the inhabitants to ultraviolet radiation that has left them unable to bear children. The radiation would likely have the same effects on the children from the Enterprise. Without the planetary shield, <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> will naturally return, allowing the Aldeans to reproduce again. The Aldeans recognize the error of their ways and return the children to the Enterprise. They accept Starfleet's help to correct their ancient systems and recognize that they will have to forgo their invisibility to continue their society.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. <b>The</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon {{is known as the}} greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E
30|$|A {{comparison}} between the middle atmospheres of the PDE and TLE reveals that <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> distribution of <b>the</b> TLE is greatly altered due to the reduced Coriolis force and {{the breakdown of the}} Brewer–Dobson circulation. The TLE simulation shows an upwelling centred over the day side and a downwelling centred over the night side. <b>The</b> primary <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> is enhanced on the day side and depleted on the night side compared to its PDE equivalent. <b>The</b> secondary <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> is enhanced on the night side, while the day side remains relatively unchanged and <b>the</b> tertiary <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> disappears.|$|R

5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} is {{the region}} above the ionosphere that {{is defined by}} the extent of the Earth's magnetic field in space. It extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space, protecting the Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} {{close enough to}} the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer,</b> a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, {{are more susceptible to}} the effects of loss of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer.</b> Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{is a key}} factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. <b>The</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> {{plays an important role in}} depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{magnetic}} field serves to deflect {{most of the}} solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. One stripping mechanism is for gas {{to be caught in}} bubbles of {{magnetic field}}, which are ripped off by solar winds. Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The {{cannibalism}} of {{the frog}} {{has been speculated}} to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other postulated causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due to the hole in <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer,</b> global warming, and increased drought. The first theory was tested {{and the results were}} inconclusive. Global warming is not thought to be a credible cause, as the extremities of the frog's range have not changed, while declines in population have occurred in both dry and wetter areas.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer.</b> Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>the</b> {{nighttime}} secondary <b>ozone</b> <b>layer,</b> located {{in both cases}} in the 85 – 110 km altitude range, is significantly affected. On Earth, <b>the</b> secondary <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> appears only during nighttime. On the daytime hemisphere, the strong UV radiation destroys any ozone molecules that might form shortly after their creation. On <b>the</b> nightside, <b>ozone</b> is generated and accumulated on the nightside by recombination of atomic and molecular oxygen.|$|R

5|$|Poisonous {{bromomethane}} {{was widely}} used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete <b>the</b> <b>Ozone</b> <b>Layer</b> scheduled the phase {{out for the}} ozone depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumigation they {{have been replaced by}} such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes, fungi, weeds and other soil-borne diseases.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} organochlorides, though not all, have {{significant}} toxicity to plants or animals, including humans. Dioxins, produced when organic matter is {{burned in the}} presence of chlorine, and some insecticides, such as DDT, are persistent organic pollutants which pose dangers when they are released into the environment. For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid 20th century, also accumulates in food chains, and causes reproductive problems (e.g., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species. Due to the ready homolytic fission of the C–Cl bond to create chlorine radicals in the upper atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons have been phased out due to the harm they do to <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The region's climate {{has been}} dry since the Tertiary. The area around Licancabur is {{dominated}} by year-round high pressure caused by the South Pacific High, giving it a very sunny climate. Because {{of the lack of}} moisture, solar radiation energy is dissipated primarily by wind. In the Llano de Chajnantor area, wind generally reaches its maximum strength during the day. Its prevailing direction is from the west, except in summer when winds are more variable. Because of the area's tropical location (where <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> is thinner) and high altitude, it receives a large amount of ultraviolet radiation. The world's highest level of ultraviolet radiation was reported from Licancabur, although the high irradiation might have caused measurement artifacts.|$|E
