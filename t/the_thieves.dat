5|$|In 1902, {{the famous}} French {{vaudeville}} singer and dancer, and the vedette of the Folies Bergère, Eugénie Fougère, who was performing at the Salone Margherita a café-chantant in Naples, contacted Alfano {{to get back}} her stolen jewelry. Within a few days, Alfano tracked <b>the</b> <b>thieves</b> and restored the jewelry. The case hit the news headlines and Alfano was arrested for complicity with <b>the</b> <b>thieves</b> but was absolved.|$|E
5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. <b>The</b> <b>thieves</b> tried {{to break into the}} Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. <b>The</b> <b>thieves</b> {{had a change of heart}} and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to know that they were guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. <b>The</b> <b>thieves</b> were reformed and became devotees of Rama.|$|E
5|$|The Grey Cup {{has been}} stolen on two occasions: it {{disappeared}} {{for three days}} in 1967 when it {{was taken from the}} Hamilton Tiger-Cats as a prank, and in December 1969 it was stolen from the offices of the Ottawa Rough Riders at Lansdowne Park. <b>The</b> <b>thieves</b> attempted to ransom the trophy, but the CFL refused to pay and made plans to replace it with a duplicate. An anonymous phone call led to the trophy's recovery two months later in a locker at Toronto's Royal York Hotel. <b>The</b> <b>thieves</b> were never found.|$|E

5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the {{thousands}} of pages of evidence gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite <b>the</b> <b>thieves</b> being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the finial, <b>the</b> <b>thieves</b> passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe <b>the</b> <b>thieves</b> were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tintin {{personally}} warns the King {{about the}} plot; whereupon Tintin and Muskar rush to Kropow Castle, where the sceptre is kept, {{to find that}} the imposter Alembick has smuggled it out of the building to his accomplices. With the aid of Thomson and Thompson, who have recently arrived in Syldavia, Tintin pursues <b>the</b> <b>thieves,</b> and is able to prevent the sceptre being carried over the border into neighbouring Borduria. A letter obtained from one of <b>the</b> <b>thieves,</b> reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by Müsstler, a political agitator who means Borduria to annex the country. In Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and flies to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down. He continues to Klow on foot, and (with the help of Snowy), restores the sceptre to the King.|$|E
5|$|Another story {{involving}} Kaali is her escapade {{with a band}} of thieves. <b>The</b> <b>thieves</b> {{wanted to}} make a human sacrifice to Kaali, and unwisely chose a saintly Brahmin monk as their victim. The radiance of the young monk was so much that it burned the image of Kaali, who took living form and killed the entire band of thieves, decapitating them and drinking their blood.|$|E

5|$|From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy {{was awarded}} to the World Cup winning team. It was {{originally}} simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 {{and has never been}} recovered, apparently melted down by <b>the</b> <b>thieves.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 1933, Briskin's {{home was}} burglarized, <b>the</b> <b>thieves</b> {{absconding}} with $24,000 (in 1933 dollars) in jewels. Also in 1933, Briskin was appointed as the studios' {{representative for the}} producers-actors code committee. In February 1934 Briskin was named {{as the chairman of}} the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). The following month Briskin was also appointed to the finance committee overseeing the Research Council. By 1934, Briskin's brother, Irving, was one of the Columbia's unit producers.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation {{took control}} of the case {{on the grounds that the}} artwork could likely cross state lines. They have {{conducted}} hundreds of interviews with probes stretching across the world involving Scotland Yard, Japanese and French authorities, private investigators, museum directors, and art dealers. The FBI believes <b>the</b> <b>thieves</b> were members of a criminal organization based in the mid-Atlantic and New England, and that the stolen paintings were moved through Connecticut and the Philadelphia area in the years following the theft. Some of the art may have been offered for sale in Philadelphia in the early 2000s, including The Storm on the Sea of Galilee; however, their knowledge of what happened to the works after the attempted sale is limited. The FBI stated it believed to know the identity of <b>the</b> <b>thieves</b> in 2013, but in 2015 announced that they were now deceased. They have declined to identify the individuals.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, <b>the</b> <b>thieves</b> realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{they are}} short of money, {{a group of}} four robbers decide to execute a bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. As soon as they reach an isolated road, the robbers force the chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a ditch. The robbers then drive {{the car to the}} bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to force the bank vault open. <b>The</b> <b>thieves</b> steal as much money as possible and make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover the unconscious body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police.|$|E

Suddenly, Burnett, having survived falling into the frozen lake, rides into town on horseback and shoots Loco in the head, allowing Silence to kill the remaining bounty killers. Burnett frees the outlaws as Pauline takes the bandages on Silence's burnt right hand off, revealing a gauntlet that he used for protection, before applying bandages to his wounded left hand. As Burnett takes <b>the</b> <b>thieves</b> to the local jail to await their amnesty, he asks Silence to become his deputy, which he accepts with a smile.|$|E

5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} {{pieces were}} stolen {{at an estimated}} loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. One of the paintings, The Concert, was Gardner's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It {{is thought to be}} the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting, with a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, is Rembrandt's only known seascape.
