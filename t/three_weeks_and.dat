Plants are typically watered {{once every two}} or <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>and</b> kept nearly dry during the winter months. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are relatively disease resistant, but susceptible to pests such as mealworms. Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa, Mammillaria haasii, and Mammillaria virginis.|$|E
5|$|Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three {{bottlenose}} dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they {{elevate the}} upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>and</b> the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.|$|E

Due to several pivotal {{moments of the}} series being filmed in the prefecture, Akita soon experienced a surge of Korean tourists going on tours tailored to followers of the show.

5|$|By 1896, {{the company}} {{produced}} one new car {{every two to}} <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> built vehicles on order for $2,000. As the orders increased, the company formally incorporated as Haynes-Apperson on May 5, 1898, with $25,000 in capital from stock issued to Portland and Kokomo businessmen. At {{the end of that}} year the company relocated to a large factory it had built in Kokomo. Two new models were designed and the workforce expanded as production increased. Haynes-Apperson ran advertisements in area newspapers and demonstrated cars at county fairs and other exhibitions. Demand for the vehicles grew rapidly from five cars produced in 1898 to thirty in 1899, 192 in 1900, and 240 in 1901. The work kept the factory open 24 hours a day, and two shifts totaling more than 350 workers were needed to keep the factory running at capacity by 1902. Sales totaled over $400,000 that year.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched the idea to Vertigo Films, who suggested he watch In Search of a Midnight Kiss, a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{left the}} failed mining {{operation}} in 1899, and travelled to London. Just after he arrived, the Second Boer War broke out, and the British government called for volunteers to join an expeditionary force. The only qualifications required {{were that the}} recruit could ride and shoot, and Hastings immediately applied to join the Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry. He was accepted, and {{after two weeks of}} training the regiment were given horses and boarded the S.S. Goth Castle to South Africa. The ship reached Cape Town after <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>and</b> the regiment disembarked. Their horses were considered too weak to be ridden, and so they were instead discharged and either put down or given to other soldiers. Hastings did not enjoy his time in the army; the weather was poor, the orders given were confusing and they were provided with minimal equipment.|$|E
5|$|It {{is active}} {{throughout}} the year, primarily at night. Gestation is about <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>and</b> the female has {{a litter of}} three or four young. Nests in the wild, built from shredded bark, are in a tunnel or under a log. Marsh shrews typically live about 18 months, and males are not thought to reach sexual maturity during their first summer. Since their lifespan is short, they apparently breed for only one season. Although no breeding data exist for British Columbia, the breeding season elsewhere is from late January to late August; most young are born in March. The number of litters a female rears is unknown.|$|E

5|$|The voyage {{from the}} United Kingdom took {{approximately}} <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> on 7 November 1942 Awatea arrived at its assigned station {{off the coast}} near the harbour of Algiers. At 10:15pm No. 6 Commando took to their landing craft. The launch did not go smoothly. From the outset they were hampered by the inexperience of the crews lowering the landing craft {{into the water and}} this, along with other factors that arose later including poor weather, breakdowns and navigational errors meant that the majority of No. 6 Commando's landing craft missed the rendezvous with the motor launch that was to guide them to the landing beaches. As a result, many landed at the wrong spot and the schedule was ruined. In the end the first landings took place at 3:00am on 8 November, two hours later than planned, while the last wave came ashore in broad daylight at 6:30am.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Harold Elliot, the {{battalion}} was brigaded with the 5th, 6th and 8th Battalions to form the 2nd Brigade under Brigadier James Whiteside McCay. Elliott took personal control over the recruitment process, selecting only those officers that he had known from his service in the Citizens Forces as his company commanders, who he in turn entrusted with choosing their own subordinates. Recruitment was conducted {{over a period of}} <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> {{by the end of the}} period the process had been so successful that the battalion was over establishment. Initially, the battalion was organised into eight companies, designated 'A' to 'H', while recruitment and initial training was undertaken at Broadmeadows, however, this was later reduced to the standard four companies, designated 'A' to 'D'.|$|E
