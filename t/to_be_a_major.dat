5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{continues}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> business, if {{no longer}} a major employer because of mechanisation.

5|$|Pollution, {{floods and}} {{development}} of the watershed and the surrounding county have blighted the water quality and wildlife of the creek since the 1960s, when residential suburban development of the eight cities in the watershed began.

25|$|A {{desire for}} {{successful}} assertive action against {{terrorism in the}} Reagan administration was further spurred {{by the memory of}} the political cost born by President Jimmy Carter for a lack of the same (his inability to free American hostages seized by student demonstrators in Iran <b>was</b> held <b>to</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> factor in his failed 1980 reelection bid). Despite covert CIA searches, the Reagan administration had also been frustrated in its inability to find American hostages held being in the Lebanon hostage crisis that had began in 1982, nor had they had an opportunity for decisive action in the recent TWA hijacking.|$|R

5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> contributor to the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Although airpower was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{factor in}} the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to {{about a quarter of the}} USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E
5|$|Although ecplised by Scots Baronial and Gothic forms, Neo-classicism {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> style {{into the}} nineteenth century. William Henry Playfair (1790–1857) was the designer {{of many of}} Edinburgh's neoclassical landmarks in the New Town. Two of his finest works are the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy, which are situated in the centre of Edinburgh. However, the figure most associated with the classical style was Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75). Working mainly in Glasgow, {{he turned away from}} the Gothic style toward that of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, {{as can be seen in}} the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856).|$|E
5|$|Common ixodid ticks {{collected}} from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus has proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, {{as they can}} lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming {{needed to keep the}} tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.|$|E
