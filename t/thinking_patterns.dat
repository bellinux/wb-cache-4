25|$|A third gain in {{cognitive}} ability involves thinking about thinking itself, a process {{referred to as}} metacognition. It often involves monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process. Adolescents' improvements in knowledge of their own <b>thinking</b> <b>patterns</b> lead to better self-control and more effective studying. It is also relevant in social cognition, resulting in increased introspection, self-consciousness, and intellectualization (in the sense of thought about one's own thoughts, rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism). Adolescents are much better able than children to understand that {{people do not have}} complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism, which results in two distinct problems in thinking: the imaginary audience and the personal fable. These likely peak at age fifteen, along with self-consciousness in general.|$|E

The oral cavity state of students who have edentulous was inspected. The study finds that only 3 men and 27 women had edentulous, all of them did not use denture. However, more than 96 % of the edentulous and not-edentulous groups said that edentulous need denture, due to aesthetic factor. The reasons for not using denture are, for example, not enough time, not disturbed by the absence of denture, and its cost. It can be concluded that the 2005 batch students of Faculty of Dentistry (FKG) UNHAS had shown a good understanding about edentulous replacement. Their views on the profits and detriments using denture are the main reasons to determine whether they will use denture. </span...|$|R
25|$|Double {{depression}} {{occurs when}} a person experiences a major depressive episode {{on top of the}} already-existing condition of dysthymia. It is difficult to treat, as sufferers accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their life that is outside of their control. The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment. When and if such people seek out treatment, the treatment may not be very effective if only the symptoms of the major depression are addressed, but not the dysthymic symptoms. Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal. This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition. Additionally, cognitive therapies can be effective for working with people with double depression in order to help change negative <b>thinking</b> <b>patterns</b> and give individuals a new way of seeing themselves and their environment.|$|E

We examined extremist groups from a diverse range of continents, cultures, and political and religious orientations. We compared statements by (and, to some degree, statements about) these groups and formulated 16 themes common to the militant-extremist mindset. Among these themes are perceptions of a crisis involving violations of posited sacred values, along with justifications {{for the use of}} violence to remediate such problems. There are indications that such themes are not infrequent in the general population. For example, research participants failed to strongly disassociate themselves from the sentiments and framings found in the fanatical items, which undercuts the notion that militant-extremist thinking represents bizarre ideation. Militant-extremist thinking appears to represent a major, aggressive form of fanaticism affected by both dispositional and situational factors. Key themes in this <b>thinking</b> <b>pattern</b> might fit together to construct a potentially compelling narrative, which may be {{a key part of the}} ideological appeal of salient militant-extremist groups...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} of care is usually {{based on the}} structure of "the person who cares for [...] the person who is cared for". However, this structure is variable in an actual {{relationship of}} care. We cannot really explain this structure of variable in the relationship of care {{as long as we have}} a <b>thinking</b> <b>pattern</b> that mutual communication between individuals makes a relationship. This <b>thinking</b> <b>pattern</b> is based on a unit of existence of the individual. Conversely, we must think that the relationship comes before the individual, that is, the active relationship produces a unit of existence of the individual. Indeed, this idea originates in the pratītyasamutpāda (Japanese: Engi 縁起) thought of Buddhism. The pratītyasamutpāda thought argued that all living things influence and depend on each other. This is exactly the relationship thought. According to the pratītyasamutpāda thought, especially, Huayan (Japanese: Kegon 華厳) philosophy as its completed form, the relationship reaches full growth with four aspects that proceed step by step. Therefore, the relationship of care also would reach full growth with four stages based on these four aspects...|$|R

In Study 2, Euro-Canadians were more likely than Chinese to predict outcomes consistent with a basketball player’s streaks (a linear <b>thinking</b> <b>pattern),</b> suggesting greater susceptibility to the hot hand fallacy.

40|$|By {{historical}} {{review on}} integrative research of syndrome differentiation and disease differentiation and considering the scientific research method of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the syndrome {{is the key}} subject of clinical study on TCM. During the recent 10 years or more, many new diseases and diagnostic approaches have been found and developed in Western medicine, while in TCM, the advances in research on syndrome can {{not keep up with}} the requirements of clinical practice. This problem was caused by three matters as follows: (1) Syndrome differentiation and its classification have been conservative and lack of new discovery; (2) The <b>thinking</b> <b>pattern</b> of clinical practice has been focused on disease differentiation, and only complemented by syndrome differentiation; (3) The treatment has been concentrated on the disease instead of on the syndrome. Considering these problems, the author has put forward the <b>thinking</b> <b>pattern</b> of clinical research, that is "to differentiate diseases from syndromes and to differentiate syndromes from diseases". In this way, many new syndromes and diseases will be discovered with the improvement of disease and syndrome differentiations.
