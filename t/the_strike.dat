5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> and the public was, by and large, opposed to <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> as well. Several of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> and in maintaining the calm during <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|The UMWA used {{civil disobedience}} to attract {{attention}} {{to the needs of}} the miners. The union stressed that all actions of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> must remain peaceful. However, many miners still used violent methods during <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> gained the media's attention. People came from all across the country to support the UMWA's cause, and around 50,000 people went to southwest Virginia during the course of <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} {{influence the}} stepped leader movement {{has on the}} value of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance is studied. The numerical values of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distances are most frequently verified from the lightning channel photos. There is some explanations for dispersion of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance which usually appear on tall structures. Unusually long striking distance may be influenced by the positive space charge or prior upward flashes. One more parameter which may have influence in estimation of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance is a complex charge motion in the leader channel. Through introduction of two types of charge motions, possible shortening is shown of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance seen on the lightning channel photos...|$|R

In addition to the Government’s transport plan, these groups also protested against the lack of collective bargaining.|$|R
5|$|All Islanders were {{required}} to work 30 hours each week, and up until the 1960s no wages were paid for this work. The catalyst for <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> was the attempted deportation of Indigenous inmate Albie Geia who committed the offence of disobeying the European overseer. <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> continued for five days and was broken with dawn raids to remove the families involved by boat to the mainland.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} devised by clockmakers to enable striking clocks to correctly count out the hours. The earlier, which appeared in <b>the</b> first <b>striking</b> clocks in <b>the</b> 14th century, is called [...] "countwheel striking". This uses a wheel that contains notches on its side, spaced by unequal, increasing arc segments. This countwheel governs the rotation of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> train. When <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> train is released by the timekeeping train, a lever is lifted from a notch on the countwheel; the uneven notches allow <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> train to move only far enough to sound the correct number of times, after which the lever falls back into the next notch and stops <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> train from turning further.|$|R

The melody heard before <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> is played alone {{once on the}} first quarter hour, twice on the half-hour, and three times on the third quarter hour. The phrase is played four times on the full hour, {{followed}} by <b>the</b> <b>strikes.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>strikes,</b> sometimes an additional tune is played; usually a short phrase from the national anthem.|$|R
50|$|Regulator - A {{device to}} prevent <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> train from running too fast, and control <b>the</b> speed of <b>striking.</b> If it wasn't present, <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> train when {{released}} {{would run out}} of control under {{the force of the}} spring or weight. In most clocks it is a simple fly fan (or fan fly) (K), a flat piece of sheet metal mounted on the fastest turning gear shaft. When <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> train turns, this beats the air, and the air friction limits the speed of <b>the</b> train. <b>Striking</b> watches and some modern clocks use a centrifugal governor instead.|$|R
5|$|In 1921, a labour strike {{erupted in}} the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This strike was led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress. <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> lasted for over six months during which around 10,000 workers struck work. A {{crackdown}} was ordered. Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired to return to work while another wished to continue <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who wished to continue <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> were mostly caste Hindus while those who desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941, black mine {{workers at}} various sites in Katanga Province, {{including}} Jadotville and Élisabethville, went on strike, demanding that their pay be increased from 1.50 francs to 2 francs {{to compensate for}} rising living costs. <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> started on 3 December, and {{by the next day}} 1,400 workers had downed tools. All UMHK sites were affected by 9 December. <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> was also fuelled by other grievances against the colonial order and segregation.|$|E
5|$|In June 1985, {{three months}} after the miners {{admitted}} defeat and ended their strike, Benn introduced the Miners' Amnesty (General Pardon) Bill into the Commons, which would have extended an amnesty to all miners imprisoned during <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> This would have included two men convicted of murder (later reduced to manslaughter) for the killing of David Wilkie, a taxi driver driving a non-striking miner to work in South Wales during <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E

5|$|In March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) {{proposed}} to close 20 of the 174state-owned mines and cut 20,000jobs out of 187,000. Two-thirds of the country's miners, {{led by the}} National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) under Arthur Scargill, downed tools in protest. However, Scargill had refused to hold a ballot on <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> having previously lost three ballots on a national strike (in January and October 1982, and March 1983). This led to <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> being declared illegal.|$|E

5|$|More than 30,000 workers {{walked off}} {{their jobs in}} May 1919 in {{what came to be}} known as the Winnipeg general strike. <b>The</b> <b>strike</b> was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the {{activity}} of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became the New Democratic Party.|$|E

5|$|On August 4 limited {{transportation}} service resumed but largely dwindled {{as the day}} progressed. Hayes and his staff warned the strikers about the severe penalties provided by the SmithConnally Act for disruption of the war production: the instigators could {{be subject to a}} fine of $5,000, one year in prison, or both. This prospect was made more real when the United States Attorney General Francis Biddle started an inquiry into possible violations of federal laws by <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> organizers. On August 4 <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> committee again voted to continue <b>the</b> <b>strike,</b> but, in view of the possible SmithConnally Act penalties, told the workers to make up their own minds and follow the committee if they chose.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} determination {{based upon}} a critical charge criterion and ionization processes is presented of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance rs at which the upward leader is initiated from a struck object. <b>The</b> <b>striking</b> distance is shown to be leader-current dependent in the form rs ∝ i 2 / 3. Comparisons are made with earlier, more numerically based models, which used an alternative equivalent-radius approach. The altitude dependence of <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance is also investigated. Since pressure, absolute humidity and temperature decrease with increasing altitude, the variation of streamer properties with altitude can be inferred from laboratory experiments. Calculations on this basis show that <b>the</b> <b>striking</b> distance increases significantly with increasing altitude, causing a corresponding increase {{in the risk of}} lightning strikes for given structures in mountain or aviation environments...|$|R
