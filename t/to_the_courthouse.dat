5|$|This time Robespierre did {{not defend}} Custine. Custine's lovely daughter-in-law came daily <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> {{to sit at}} his feet; eventually, the {{prosecutors}} accused the judges of postponing a verdict {{so that they could}} continue to gaze at her. The Revolutionary Tribunal convicted him of treason and he was executed by guillotine on the following day, 28 August 1793.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> building, {{the public}} square contains several outbuildings and sites that are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Oregon Commercial Historic District, including a sculpture by Lorado Taft and a cast-iron fountain. The courthouse joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration. The courthouse no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county; its successor is located directly across the street.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, in 1919, {{the city}} {{was caught up in}} the Red Summer riots when {{thousands}} of whites marched from South Omaha <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> to lynch a black worker, Willy Brown, a suspect in an alleged rape of a white woman. The mob burned the Douglas County Courthouse to get the prisoner, causing more than $1,000,000 damage. They hanged and shot Will Brown, then burned his body. Troops were called in from Fort Omaha to quell the riot, prevent more crowds gathering in South Omaha, and to protect the black community in North Omaha.|$|E
50|$|On March 28, Nash, Cazabat, Hadnot {{and other}} white Fusionists called for armed whites <b>to</b> retake <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> on April 1. Whites were {{recruited}} from nearby Winn and surrounding parishes to join their effort. The Republicans Shaw, Register, and Flowers and others began to collect a posse of armed blacks <b>to</b> defend <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bonds {{were issued}} for $30,000 to fund {{courthouse}} construction, and architect J. C. Clancy of Antigo, Wisconsin was engagesd <b>to</b> design <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> It {{was constructed in}} 1890-92 by Louis A. Webber of Menasha, Wisconsin, who bid $26,470. However, Webber was unable <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> work, and the county hired another contractor <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> entailing a revised total cost of about $40,000.|$|R
50|$|It {{replaced}} <b>the</b> Old <b>Courthouse</b> as <b>the</b> city's court {{building and}} its construction prompted the descendents {{of the founding}} father Auguste Chouteau <b>to</b> unsuccessfully sue <b>the</b> city <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> Old <b>Courthouse</b> back since <b>the</b> stipulation {{was that it was}} <b>to</b> always be <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b>|$|R
5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body {{and he was not}} wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E
5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
50|$|Although some {{citizens}} believed Bowling Green was {{no longer}} the most practical or logical site for a new <b>courthouse,</b> <b>the</b> commissioners quickly decided <b>to</b> build <b>the</b> third <b>courthouse</b> on <b>the</b> site of the previous one in Bowling Green. Built of brick, at a cost of $11,000, and very similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>courthouse,</b> <b>the</b> new <b>Courthouse</b> began serving <b>the</b> county in the Fall of 1853.|$|R

50|$|The {{centerpiece}} is <b>the</b> Fayette County <b>Courthouse,</b> {{completed in}} 1912. The two-story, Neoclassical structure {{sits in the}} middle of a park with memorials and monuments scattered throughout. A tree-lined sidewalk leads from <b>the</b> street <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse's</b> portico, which features four Ionic columns supporting a triangular pediment. The building is topped with a columned dome, the front face of which is adorned with a clock.|$|R
5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, {{if only because}} they could more easily get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, when Winchester was {{no longer}} a safe {{location}} for the storage of Hampshire County's records and they again risked destruction by Union Army forces, White's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal. When Front Royal became endangered by advancing Union Army forces, Captain White had the records moved to Luray Caverns where they remained for several months. In the fall of 1864, the county's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops {{were in the process of}} destroying them. Captain White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon, and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina. Had White not separated the records and sent the bound volumes away for safekeeping, Hampshire County would have lost all its records during the course of the war, as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|White's father, Hampshire County Clerk of Court John Baker White, {{learned of}} the {{advancement}} of Union Army forces on Romney, and became concerned {{for the safety of}} the county's records.

50|$|<b>The</b> Washington County <b>Courthouse</b> {{is located}} at 205 Putnam Street in Marietta, Ohio. <b>The</b> <b>courthouse</b> is {{constructed}} of rusticated stone blocks for the foundation with smooth blocks rising <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roofline. <b>The</b> <b>courthouse</b> is <b>the</b> third for <b>the</b> county. <b>The</b> <b>courthouse</b> was designed and constructed by Samuel Hannaford & Sons, the same architects on <b>the</b> Monroe County <b>Courthouse.</b> <b>The</b> <b>courthouse</b> {{is included in the}} Marietta Historic District which was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Register on 1974-12-19.|$|R
50|$|Because {{much of the}} {{original}} sandstone was replaced in 1932, the classically designed exterior displays elements of stylized modern classicism. Broad granite steps lead from <b>the</b> street <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse's</b> main entrance, along its east elevation. Flanking the steps are granite railings with streamlined detailing and eagles with outstretched wings. Atop the bronze entry doors are elaborate decorative grilles of bronze and aluminum.|$|R
25|$|The Northern Ireland Environment Agency {{has given}} it a grade A listed {{building}} status because of its architectural and historical significance.

25|$|A {{few blocks}} away on Greenwood Avenue, members of the black {{community}} gathered to discuss the situation at the courthouse. Given the recent lynching of Belton, a white man accused of murder, they believed that Rowland was greatly at risk. The community was determined to prevent the lynching of the young black man, but divided about tactics. Young World War I veterans were preparing for a battle by collecting guns and ammunition. Older, more prosperous men feared a destructive confrontation that likely would cost them dearly. O. W. Gurley walked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> where the sheriff assured him {{that there would be no}} lynching. Returning to Greenwood, Gurley tried to calm the group, but failed. About 7:30pm, a mob of approximately 30 black men, armed with rifles and shotguns, decided to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> and support the sheriff and his deputies to defend Rowland from the mob. Assuring them that Rowland was safe, the sheriff and his black deputy, Barney Cleaver, encouraged the men to return home.|$|E

25|$|County Sheriff Jim Clark {{had issued}} {{an order for}} all white males in Dallas County {{over the age of}} twenty-one to report <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> that morning to be deputized. Commanding officer John Cloud told the demonstrators to disband at once and go home. Rev. Hosea Williams tried to speak to the officer, but Cloud curtly {{informed}} him there was nothing to discuss. Seconds later, the troopers began shoving the demonstrators, knocking many to the ground and beating them with nightsticks. Another detachment of troopers fired tear gas, and mounted troopers charged the crowd on horseback.|$|E
25|$|In Greenwood, rumors {{began to}} fly – in particular, {{a report that}} whites were {{storming}} the courthouse. Shortly after 10pm, a second, larger group of approximately 75 armed black men decided to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> They offered their support to the sheriff, who declined their help. According to witnesses, a white man {{is alleged to have}} told one of the armed black men to surrender his pistol. The man refused, and a shot was fired. That first shot may have been accidental, or meant as a warning; it was a catalyst for an exchange of gunfire.|$|E
50|$|Generally pro-Confederate {{during the}} American Civil War, the county saw little fighting, {{although}} both armies passed through it repeatedly. Several skimishes did place there, and <b>the</b> county <b>courthouse</b> was burned by Confederate Brigadier General Hylan B. Lyon during his raid across western Kentucky in December 1864. Lyon's men, all Kentuckians, burned {{a total of}} seven <b>courthouses,</b> since <b>the</b> Union Army was using them for barracks. The Confederates allowed <b>the</b> locals <b>to</b> remove <b>the</b> records before setting fire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouses.</b>|$|R

25|$|On July 6, 1964, {{one of the}} two {{registration}} {{days that}} month, John Lewis led 50 black citizens <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> but County Sheriff Jim Clark arrested them all rather than allowing them to apply to vote. On July 9, 1964 Judge James Hare issued an injunction forbidding any gathering of three or more people under the sponsorship of civil rights organizations or leaders. This injunction made it illegal for more than two people at a time to talk about civil rights or voter registration in Selma, suppressing public civil rights activity there for the next six months.|$|E
25|$|Dr. King {{decided to}} make a {{conscious}} effort to get arrested, for the benefit of publicity. On February 1, King and Ralph Abernathy refused to cooperate with Chief Baker's traffic directions on the way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> calculating that Baker would arrest them, putting them in the Selma city jail run by Baker's police, rather than the county jail run by Clark's deputies. Once processed, King and Abernathy refused to post bond. On the same day, SCLC and SNCC organizers took the campaign outside of Dallas County for the first time; in nearby Perry County 700 students and adults, including James Orange, were arrested.|$|E
