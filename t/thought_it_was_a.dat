5|$|In the United States it was {{imported}} {{very early}} in the 18th century and cultivated for its medicinal and piscicide properties. By 1818, it had begun spreading so much that Amos Eaton <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> native plant. In 1839 it was already reported in Michigan and in 1876, in California. It is now found commonly in all the states. In Canada, it is most common in the Maritime Provinces as well as southern Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, with scattered populations in between.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the alien nest were shot at the {{decommissioned}} Acton Lane Power Station in Acton, London. The crew <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> perfect place to film because of its grilled walkways and numerous corridors, but had to spend money to remove asbestos from the station. The Atmosphere Processor set was not dismantled after filming, and was reused in 1989 as the Axis Chemicals set for Batman (1989).|$|E

5|$|Deathrow {{received}} largely favorable reviews. Reviewers {{praised the}} game's fast-paced action, and surround sound, but complained {{of its high}} difficulty curve, generic soundtrack, and lack of online multiplayer. Some critics felt the game's use of profanity was excessive, while others <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> highlight. Reviewers considered the game's concept and mechanics similar to other series, specifically Speedball. IGN and TeamXbox both named Deathrow an Editor's Choice. The game won the TeamXbox 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and the IGN 2002 Best Game Nobody Played. IGN later reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to the original's low revenue. Southend dissolved in 2013.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 2012, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was driving}} her {{daughter}} to school in Morelia at around 8:30a.m. when a vehicle ran them off the road. Two armed men descended from their vehicle and forced {{her out of her}} car as onlookers watched. Gorrostieta Salazar pleaded with her abductors to let her daughter go unharmed, and then agreed to go with the kidnappers. The family of the former mayor initially <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> ransom kidnapping. After not hearing from Gorrostieta Salazar or her abductors for two days, they notified the police. On 15 November, police identified the body after farm workers from the rural community of San Juan Tararameo in Cuitzeo found the corpse on their way to work.|$|E

5|$|The first naturalists who {{investigated}} Megalosaurus mistook it for {{a gigantic}} lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded {{that it was no}} longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing Megalosaurus with its direct relatives in the Megalosauridae, were able to obtain a more accurate picture. Megalosaurus was about seven metres long, weighing about 1.1 tonnes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. Megalosaurus had a rather large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.|$|E
5|$|This {{evidence}} that giant reptiles had lived on Earth {{in the past}} caused great excitement in scientific circles, and even among some segments of the general public. Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive mammal, Phascolotherium, that {{was found in the}} same strata as Megalosaurus. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield mammal, was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> marsupial, but Buckland later realized it was a primitive placental mammal. Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did not believe it invalidated the overall pattern of an age of reptiles, when the largest and most conspicuous animals had been reptiles rather than mammals.|$|E
5|$|Though Fox was {{initially}} worried about an entire episode {{set in the}} other universe, they soon came to appreciate the storyline. The episode included the first appearances of guest actors Andre Royo and Amy Madigan, who would both appear in several later episodes. It first aired in the United States on Fox in September 23, 2010, receiving almost all positive reviews due to the combination of emotional storylines, suspense, action, and humor. Many <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good indicator of {{what the rest of}} the season had to offer, while others appreciated the numerous popular culture references that set the two universes apart.|$|E

5|$|When the African river {{martin was}} first {{discovered}} in the 19th century, Gustav Hartlaub <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> roller, and later authors either placed it in its own family, or with the woodswallows. Study of the anatomy revealed that the species was closest to the swallows and martins, but that it possessed a number of distinctive features, such as its robust legs and feet and stout bill. These indicated {{that it should be}} placed in a separate subfamily. The two river martin species are usually considered to belong to a single genus, Pseudochelidon, due to their having a number of structural similarities. However, Brooke proposed that the white-eyed river martin be placed in a separate monotypic genus Eurochelidon.|$|E
5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
5|$|Richard Vines, whilst {{writing for}} Bloomberg, advised readers {{to not be}} put off the hype; and while the courses are not as life {{changing}} as those served at The Fat Duck, there are stand out dishes such as the meat fruit and the tipsy cake. He {{also noted that the}} meat fruit was a favourite of Pierre Koffmann. Marina O'Loughlin visited the restaurant twice for the Metro newspaper, once just after opening and again several months later to compare how it had settled in. She <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> well-oiled operation, but a little too much so, and questioned the originality of it as a version of the meat fruit had previously been available at the restaurant Amber in another Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong and little touches as the years of origin which appear next to the menu items have been used before by Marco Pierre White. Jan Moir for The Daily Mail thought that the ice cream trolley was a sensation, along with the meat fruit, but could not understand the reason behind recreating the salamagundy dish.|$|E

500|$|... "The Same Old Story" [...] first {{aired in}} the United States on September 16, 2008 on Fox. An {{estimated}} 13.272 million viewers watched the episode, a 45 {{percent increase from}} the series premiere. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics – reviewers <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot contrivances.|$|R
5|$|The Madagascan sunset moth {{was first}} {{described}} by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had {{the head of a}} different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> different species than the complete specimen described by Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. VIII Corps {{had arrived}} in the United Kingdom in December 1943, and was {{commanded}} by Major General Emil F. Reinhardt, who Middleton had known for many years. While he was an able commander, his lack of combat experience resulted in his being replaced by Middleton (though Reinhardt would later command a division in the European fighting). Middleton's first stop in Europe before assuming command of VIII Corps was to confer with his friend and commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower had asked Middleton about his views on making Patton the commander of an army. Middleton <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good idea since Patton was such an able fighter. Eisenhower agreed, but was concerned about Patton's propensity to embarrass the Army by things he said to the press. Following this Patton was given command of the Third Army, which was headquartered north of London during the preparation for the invasion of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} Prison Break—a man deliberately getting himself {{sent to prison}} {{in order to help}} someone escape—was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who wanted to produce an action-oriented series. Although Scheuring <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good idea, he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show. He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series. Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds. Thus, the miniseries never materialized. Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24, Fox decided to back the production in 2004. The pilot episode was filmed a year after Scheuring wrote the script.|$|E
50|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, ether was in vogue as a {{recreational}} drug in some places, becoming especially popular in Ireland, as temperance campaigners <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> acceptable alternative to alcohol.

50|$|Among Western orientalists and travellers, the {{structure}} was first observed by Eugène Flandin and Pascal Coste, who noted its uniqueness in Iranian architecture. Prior to Ernst Herzfeld studies of {{the structure}}, Terbal was mistakenly thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> descendant of the ziggurat, while some <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fire temple, with the Holy Fire being put at its top to avoid contamination with dust.|$|R
5|$|The {{quarries}} at Stonesfield, {{which were}} worked until 1911, continued to produce Megalosaurus bucklandii fossils, mostly single bones from the pelvis and hindlimbs. Vertebrae and skull bones are rare. In 2010, Roger Benson counted {{a total of}} 103 specimens from the Stonesfield Slate, from a minimum of seven individuals. It has been contentious whether this material represents just a single taxon. In 2004, Julia Day and Paul Barrett claimed {{that there were two}} morphotypes present, based on small differences in the thighbones. In 2008 Benson favoured this idea, but in 2010 concluded the differences were illusory. A maxilla fragment, specimen OUM J13506, was, in 1869 assigned, by Thomas Huxley, to M. bucklandii. In 1992 Robert Thomas Bakker claimed it represented a member of the Sinraptoridae; in 2007, Darren Naish <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> separate species belonging to the Abelisauroidea. In 2010, Benson pointed out that the fragment was basically indistinguishable from other known M. bucklandii maxillae, to which it had in fact not been compared by the other authors.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Daspletosaurus torosus (CMN 8506) is a partial skeleton including the skull, the shoulder, a forelimb, the pelvis, a femur {{and all of}} the vertebrae from the neck, torso and hip, as well as the first eleven tail vertebrae. It was discovered in 1921 near Steveville, Alberta, by Charles Mortram Sternberg, who <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> new species of Gorgosaurus. It was not until 1970 that the specimen was fully described by Dale Russell, who made it the type of a new genus, Daspletosaurus, from the Greek δασπλής (dasples, stem and connective vowel resulting in daspleto~) ("frightful") and σαυρος/sauros ("lizard"). The type species is Daspletosaurus torosus, the specific name torosus being Latin for 'muscular' or 'brawny'. Aside from the type, there is only one other well-known specimen, RTMP 2001.36.1, a relatively complete skeleton discovered in 2001. Both specimens were recovered from the Oldman Formation in the Judith River Group of Alberta. The Oldman Formation was deposited during the middle Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, from about 77 to 76 Ma (million years ago). A specimen from the younger Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta has been reassigned to Albertosaurus sarcophagus.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> safer community. At {{the time of the}} abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E
