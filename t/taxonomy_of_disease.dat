30|$|Developments in {{genetics}} and molecular biology {{have provided a}} vast amount of data and information to support the view that most human diseases have a significant genetic component. Characterization of the genetic determinants <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> provides remarkable opportunities for clinical medicine through an improved understanding of pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapeutic options. An understanding of the genetic basis <b>of</b> human <b>disease</b> has opened the way forward for a new <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> human <b>disease</b> that will be free from limitations and bias in developing diagnostic criteria related to events which are often secondary and peripheral to its cause (Bell 2003).

Similarly, a number of genetically determined molecules and pathways have been characterized that are crucial in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. It is now widely believed that a clearer understanding of the mechanisms and pathways <b>of</b> a <b>disease</b> will assist us in delineating distinct disease subtypes, and may resolve many questions relating to variable disease symptoms, progression and response to therapy. This might help in revising the current diagnostic criteria. Eventually, genetics may contribute to a new <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> human <b>disease</b> for clinical practice.|$|R

The <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> morphed as we moved from symptoms to anatomy to molecular biology to genomics and metabolo-mics. A penchant for naming is intrinsic to the human mind. Hippocrates categorized disease into the 4 humors: black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. Linnaeus, the 18 th-century Swedish scientist known for the naming and classi-fication of plant species, developed 11 categories of disease, including painful disease, motor disease, and blemishes. Tibetans distinguish 404 diseases divided into 4 causes: karmic disease originating in past lifetimes, disease resulting from infl uences in early life, disorders involving spirits, and superfi cial disorders resulting from diet and behavior.

40|$|Background—Comparing disease {{management}} programs {{and their effects}} is difficult because of wide variability in program intensity and complexity. The purpose of this effort was to develop an instrument {{that can be used}} to describe the intensity and complexity of heart failure (HF) {{disease management}} programs. Methods and Results—Specific composition criteria were taken from the American Heart Association (AHA) <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> management and hierarchically scored to allow users to describe the intensity and complexity of the domains and subdomains of HF disease management programs. The HF Disease Management Scoring Instrument (HF-DMSI) incorporates 6 of the 8 domains from the taxonomy: recipient, intervention content, delivery personnel, method of communication, intensity/complexity, and environment. The 3 intervention content subdomains (education/counseling, medication management, and peer support) are described separately. In this first test of the HF-DMSI, overall intensity (measured as duration) and complexity were rated using an ordinal scoring system. Possible scores reflect a clinical rationale and differ by category, with zero given only if the element could potentially be missing (eg, surveillance by remote monitoring). Content validity was evident as the instrument matches the existing AHA taxonomy. After revision and refinement, 2 authors obtained an inter-rater reliability intraclass correlation coefficient score of 0. 918 (confidence interval, 0. 880 to 0. 944, P 0. 001) in their rating of 12 studies.

40|$|In the {{majority}} of cases, asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are two clearly distinct disease entities. However, in some patients there may be significant overlap between the two conditions. This constitutes an important area of concern because these patients are generally excluded from randomised controlled trials (mostly because of smoking history in the case of asthma or because of significant bronchodilator reversibility in the case of COPD). As a result, their pathobiology, prognosis and response to therapy are largely unknown. This may lead to suboptimal management and can limit the development of more personalised therapeutic options. Emerging genetic and molecular information coupled with new bioinformatics capabilities provide novel information that can pave the way towards a new <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> airway <b>diseases.</b> In this paper we question the current value of the terms 'asthma' and 'COPD' as still useful diagnostic labels; discuss the scientific and clinical progress made {{over the past few years}} towards unravelling the complexity <b>of</b> airway <b>diseases,</b> from the definition of clinical phenotypes and endotypes to a better understanding of cellular and molecular networks as key pathogenic elements <b>of</b> human <b>diseases</b> (so-called systems medicine); and summarise a number of ongoing studies with the potential to move the field towards a new <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> airways <b>diseases</b> and, hopefully, a more personalised approach to medicine, in which the focus will shift from the current goal <b>of</b> treating <b>diseases</b> as best as possible to the so-called P 4 medicine, a new type of medicine that is predictive, preventive, personalised and participatory...|$|R

40|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) follow a slowly progressing dysfunctional trajectory, with a large presymptomatic component and many comorbidities. Using preclinical models and large-scale omics studies ranging from genetics to imaging, {{a large number of}} processes that might be involved in AD pathology at different stages and levels have been identified. The sheer number of putative hypotheses makes it almost impossible to estimate their contribution to the clinical outcome and to develop a comprehensive view on the pathological processes driving the clinical phenotype. Traditionally, bioinformatics approaches have provided correlations and associations between processes and phenotypes. Focusing on causality, a new breed of advanced and more quantitative modeling approaches that use formalized domain expertise offer new opportunities to integrate these different modalities and outline possible paths toward new therapeutic interventions. This article reviews three different computational approaches and their possible complementarities. Process algebras, implemented using declarative programming languages such as Maude, facilitate simulation and analysis of complicated biological processes on a comprehensive but coarse-grained level. A model-driven Integration of Data and Knowledge, based on the OpenBEL platform and using reverse causative reasoning and network jump analysis, can generate mechanistic knowledge and a new, mechanism-based <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> Finally, Quantitative Systems Pharmacology is based on formalized implementation of domain expertise in a more fine-grained, mechanism-driven, quantitative, and predictive humanized computer model.

Molecular biology has a potential partnership with molecular imaging. As recently addressed by the ESR [7], imaging biomarkers can be used in all these steps, if our community is able to solve the challenge of standardization and reproducibility [8]. The relation between imaging features and genomics (radiogenomics) is adding more value to this patient-centred approach [9]. Biobanks and imaging biobanks will also play a role [10]. Potential exists for a future integrated diagnostics framework including both imaging and pathology, the latter of which has just become digital, as imaging is since many years.|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} of asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{in the same}} patient, which is designated as mixed asthma-COPD phenotype or overlap syndrome (ACOS), remains a controversial issue. This is primarily because many conflicting aspects in the definition of ACOS remain, and it is extremely difficult to summarize the distinctive features of this syndrome. Furthermore, we are realizing that asthma, COPD, and ACOS are not single diseases but rather syndromes consisting of several endotypes and phenotypes and, consequently, comprising a spectrum <b>of</b> <b>diseases.</b> The umbrella term ACOS blurs the lines between asthma and COPD and allows an approach that simplifies therapy. However, this approach contradicts the modern concept according to which we must move toward more targeted and personalized therapies to treat patients with these diseases.

Introduction Rare skeletal metabolic diseases comprise a group <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> {{commonly associated with}} severe clinical consequences. In recent years, {{the description of the}} clinical phenotypes and radiographic features of several genetic bone disorders was paralleled by the discovery of key molecular pathways involved in the regulation of bone and mineral metabolism. Including this information in the description and classification <b>of</b> rare skeletal <b>diseases</b> may improve the recognition and management of affected patients. Methods IOF recognized this need and formed a Skeletal Rare Diseases Working Group (SRD-WG) of basic and clinical scientists who developed a <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> rare skeletal <b>diseases</b> based on their metabolic pathogenesis. Results This <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> rare genetic metabolic bone disorders (RGMBDs) comprises 116 OMIM phenotypes, with 86 affected genes related to bone and mineral homeostasis. The diseases were divided into four major groups, namely, disorders due to altered osteoclast, osteoblast, or osteocyte activity; disorders due to altered bone matrix proteins; disorders due to altered bone microenvironmental regulators; and disorders due to deranged calciotropic hormonal activity. Conclusions This article provides the first comprehensive <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> rare metabolic skeletal diseases based on deranged metabolic activity. This classification will help in the development of common and shared diagnostic and therapeutic pathways for these patients and also in the creation of international registries <b>of</b> rare skeletal <b>diseases,</b> the first step for the development of genetic tests based on next generation sequencing and for performing large intervention trials to assess efficacy of orphan drugs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Technological leaps in genome {{sequencing}} {{have resulted in}} a surge in discovery <b>of</b> human <b>disease</b> genes. These discoveries have led to increased clarity on the molecular pathology <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> and have also demonstrated considerable overlap in the genetic roots <b>of</b> human <b>diseases.</b> In light <b>of</b> this large genetic overlap, we tested whether cross-disease research approaches lead to faster, more impactful discoveries. Methods We leveraged several gene-disease association databases to calculate a Mutual Citation Score (MCS) for 10, 853 pairs <b>of</b> genetically related <b>diseases</b> to measure the frequency of cross-citation between research fields. To assess the importance of cooperative research, we computed an Individual Disease Cooperation Score (ICS) and the average publication rate for each disease. Results For all disease pairs with one gene in common, we found that the degree of genetic overlap was a poor predictor of cooperation (r 2 = 0. 3198) and that the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> pairs (89. 56 %) never cited previous discoveries of the same gene in a different <b>disease,</b> irrespective <b>of</b> the level of genetic similarity between the diseases. A fraction (0. 25 %) of the pairs demonstrated cross-citation in greater than 5 % of their published genetic discoveries and 0. 037 % cross-referenced discoveries more than 10 % of the time. We found strong positive correlations between ICS and publication rate (r 2 = 0. 7931), and an even stronger correlation between the publication rate and the number <b>of</b> cross-referenced <b>diseases</b> (r 2 = 0. 8585). These results suggested that cross-disease research may have the potential to yield novel discoveries at a faster pace than singular disease research. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the frequency of cross-disease study is low despite the high level of genetic similarity among many human diseases, and that collaborative methods may accelerate and increase the impact of new genetic discoveries. Until we have a better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> human <b>diseases,</b> cross-disease research approaches should become the rule rather than the exception. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a highly}} heterogeneous disease, and prior attempts to develop genomic-based classification for HCC have yielded highly divergent results, indicating difficulty in identifying unified molecular anatomy. We performed a meta-analysis of gene expression profiles in data sets from eight independent patient cohorts across the world. In addition, aiming to establish the real world applicability of a classification system, we profiled 118 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from an additional patient cohort. A total of 603 patients were analyzed, representing the major etiologies of HCC (hepatitis B and C) collected from Western and Eastern countries. We observed three robust HCC subclasses (termed S 1, S 2, and S 3), each correlated with clinical parameters such as tumor size, extent of cellular differentiation, and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. An analysis {{of the components of}} the signatures indicated that S 1 reflected aberrant activation of the WNT signaling pathway, S 2 was characterized by proliferation as well as MYC and AKT activation, and S 3 was associated with hepatocyte differentiation. Functional studies indicated that the WNT pathway activation signature characteristic of S 1 tumors was not simply the result of beta-catenin mutation but rather was the result of transforming growth factor-beta activation, thus representing a new mechanism of WNT pathway activation in HCC. These experiments establish the first consensus classification framework for HCC based on gene expression profiles and highlight the power of integrating multiple data sets to define a robust molecular <b>taxonomy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>disease...</b>|$|R
