Rivera had to turn in a petition with 1,000 signatures in order to qualify <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot and turned in 1,500 signatures on July 26. Sonia Negrete Winn, a Democrat, also sought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot to replace Giron, but failed to obtain the required signatures to be a candidate. In Morse's district, Republican Bernie Herpin announced his interest in replacing Morse and submitted sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is stable once formed and will {{continue}} to cool almost indefinitely, eventually to become a black dwarf. Assuming that the Universe continues to expand, it is thought that in 1019 to 1020 years, the galaxies will evaporate as their stars escape into intergalactic space.,§IIIA. White dwarfs should generally survive galactic dispersion, although an occasional collision between white dwarfs may produce a new fusing star or a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf which will explode in a Type Ia supernova.,§IIIC,IV. The subsequent lifetime of white dwarfs is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> order of the lifetime of the proton, known to be at least 1034–1035 years. Some grand unified theories predict a proton lifetime between 1030 and 1036 years. If these theories are not valid, the proton may decay by complicated nuclear reactions or through quantum gravitational processes involving a virtual black hole; in these cases, the lifetime is estimated to be no more than 10200 years. If protons do decay, the mass of a white dwarf will decrease very slowly with time as its nuclei decay, until it loses enough mass to become a nondegenerate lump of matter, and finally disappears completely.,§IV.|$|E
5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E
5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E

5|$|Attempts to {{synthesize}} elements 119 and 120 push {{the limits of}} current technology, due to the decreasing cross sections of the production reactions and their probably short half-lives, expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> order of microseconds. Heavier elements, beginning with element 121, would likely be too short-lived to be detected with current technology, decaying within a microsecond before reaching the detectors. Where this one-microsecond border of half-lives lies is not known, and this may allow the synthesis of elements 121 through 124, with the exact limit depending on the model chosen for predicting nuclide masses. The nuclides 296Uue, 296,299Ubn, 300Ubu, 300,303Ubb, 304Ubt, and 304Ubq, continuing up a possible narrow one-microsecond alpha-decaying corridor, could conceivably be produced in the reactions of projectiles of 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe with targets of 248Cm, 249Bk, and 249Cf.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2007–08 season began, Andrea Bargnani, {{the number}} one pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was slated to start at center and Bosh at power forward to form a strong Toronto frontcourt and Jason Kapono, a three-point specialist, was {{acquired}} via free agency from the Miami Heat to add offensive firepower; however, as the season unfolded, neither plans materialized as hoped. Bosh himself had a slow start to the season, but as mid-season approached, his form picked up and he was named Player of the Week for {{the second week of}} January. On January 31, 2008, he was selected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Conference team for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. Bosh missed 15 games throughout the season, but the Raptors still managed to conclude the regular season with a 41–41 record, thus clinching the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 NBA Playoffs. However, they were defeated by the Orlando Magic in the first round, losing 4–1.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E

The Coalition lost government at the 10 May 1941 election and Bruxner would never again serve in government. The rest of Bruxner's parliamentary career was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposition benches, leading the Country Party through five more elections and through the instability of the larger opposition parties that eventually united as the Liberal Party of Australia. On 6 May 1958, Bruxner formally resigned as Leader of the Country Party, having served continuously in that role since 1932. He continued to serve {{in his capacity as}} Member for Tenterfield for one more term before retiring from politics before the 1962 election. Bruxner was Knighted as a KBE in 1962 and thereafter served in various capacities on boards and continued his passion for horses before his death aged 88 on 28 March 1970.|$|E
5|$|By February, Candice Michelle had {{announced}} {{that she was going}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cover of the April edition of Playboy magazine, and tension began to grow between Candice Michelle and Torrie Wilson. After winning a number one contender's Diva battle royal on Raw in which she first eliminated Wilson and then Mickie James and Ashley at the same time, Candice Michelle received her first singles WWE Women's Championship match, but she lost to champion Trish Stratus on February 27. After the match, Candice Michelle slapped Wilson, blaming her, in storyline, for the loss. As a result of the tension between the women, Wilson became a fan favorite, while Candice Michelle and Victoria continued to act as villains on-screen.|$|E
5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of the platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E

5|$|Eric Sundwall, Chair of the New York Libertarian Party, was the Libertarian {{candidate}} for the seat. However, he {{was removed from the}} ballot on March 25, after 3,786 of the 6,730 signatures his campaign had collected were ruled invalid. Under state election law, independent congressional candidates must collect at least 3,500 valid signatures <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot. Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6,000 of Sundwall's signatures; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him removed from the ballot. The vast majority of the rejected signatures were from voters who put down their mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived. Votes for Sundwall on absentee ballots, which were mailed out before he was removed from the ballot, were voided. On March 27, Sundwall announced that he would vote for Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{residents}} were stranded in Hatteras following {{the formation of}} the new inlet created by rising waters. Many parts of North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed or damaged, which slowed recovery efforts and the return of homeowners in the Outer Banks. Sections of the highway were closed to one lane. The ferry between Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island was temporarily closed due to damage after the hurricane, though a small passenger ferry remained available for Hatteras Village residents and emergency workers. People who were not residents were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Outer Banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions. When visitors were allowed to return, many ventured to see the new inlet, despite a 1-mile (1.6km) walk from the nearest road.|$|E
