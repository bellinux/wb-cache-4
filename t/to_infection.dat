5|$|The {{immune system}} is {{affected}} by sleep and rest, and sleep deprivation is detrimental to immune function. Complex feedback loops involving cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α produced in response <b>to</b> <b>infection,</b> appear to {{also play a role}} in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus the immune response <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> may result in changes to the sleep cycle, including an increase in slow-wave sleep relative to REM sleep.|$|E
50|$|Infants {{and young}} {{children}} with mannose-binding lectin deficiency {{seem to be more}} susceptible <b>to</b> <b>infections,</b> but adults can also develop recurrent infections. In addition, affected individuals undergoing chemotherapy or taking drugs that suppress the immune system are especially prone <b>to</b> <b>infections.</b>|$|R

5|$|Armillaria gallica {{can produce}} cyclobutane-containing {{metabolites}} such as arnamiol, a natural {{product that is}} classified as a sesquiterpenoid aryl ester. Although the specific function of arnamiol is not definitively known, similar chemicals present in other Armillaria species are thought {{to play a role}} in inhibiting the growth of antagonistic bacteria or fungi, or in killing cells of the host plant prior <b>to</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Battling the Flood, Covenant, {{and human}} forces are the Sentinels: robotic drones {{designed}} by an extinct race called the Forerunners {{to protect their}} structures and prevent Flood outbreaks. Sentinels are able to hover around in enclosed spaces and produce an energy shield when under attack. They lack durability, but use powerful laser beam weapons and are immune <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> by the Flood.|$|E
5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host {{cells to}} replicate, they {{are difficult to}} eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccinations to provide immunity <b>to</b> <b>infection,</b> and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with viral replication.|$|E

5|$|Common ailments in {{domestic}} guinea pigs include respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, scurvy (vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness), abscesses due <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> (often in the neck, due to hay {{embedded in the}} throat, or from external scratches), and infections by lice, mites, or fungus.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is defined}} as {{vomiting}} or diarrhea due <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> of the small or large bowel. The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while {{the ones in the}} large bowel are inflammatory. The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for Cryptosporidium) to as many as 108 (for Vibrio cholerae).|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} announced {{findings that}} sublethal exposure to imidacloprid rendered honey bees significantly more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> by the fungus Nosema, thereby suggesting a potential link to CCD, given that Nosema is increasingly considered {{to contribute to}} CCD.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people are}} {{resistant}} to certain strains of HIV. For example, people with the CCR5-Δ32 mutation are resistant <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> with R5 virus, as the mutation stops HIV from binding to this coreceptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} seasonality {{may also}} be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically children at school. There is some controversy {{over the role of}} low body temperature as a risk factor for the common cold; the majority of the evidence suggests that it may result in greater susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E

5|$|VP7 is a {{glycoprotein}} {{that forms}} the outer surface of the virion. Apart from its structural functions, it determines the G-type of the strain and, along with VP4, is involved in immunity <b>to</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead <b>to</b> <b>infection,</b> particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E

50|$|When {{diagnosing}} a sinus infection, one {{can identify}} which sinus cavity the infection {{is located in}} by the term given to the cavity. Ethmoiditis refers <b>to</b> an <b>infection</b> in the ethmoid sinus cavity/ies, frontal sinusitis refers <b>to</b> an <b>infection</b> occurring in the frontal sinus cavity/ies, antritis is used to refer <b>to</b> an <b>infection</b> in the maxillary sinus cavity/ies whilst spenoiditis refers <b>to</b> an <b>infection</b> in the sphenoid sinus cavity/ies.|$|R
5|$|Air can {{be trapped}} {{under the skin}} in necrotizing infections such as gangrene, {{occurring}} as a late sign in gas gangrene, {{of which it is}} the hallmark sign. Subcutaneous emphysema is also considered a hallmark of fournier gangrene. Symptoms of subcutaneous emphysema can result when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation. When emphysema occurs due <b>to</b> <b>infection,</b> signs that the infection is systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.|$|E
5|$|All known prion diseases, collectively called {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal. However, {{a vaccine}} developed in mice may provide insight into providing a vaccine to resist prion infections in humans. Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> by scrapie prion protein. In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.|$|E
5|$|Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds {{appear to}} be immune <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> and {{therefore}} are {{not considered to be}} a T. cruzi reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals {{that are part of the}} ancient, sylvatic (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.|$|E
