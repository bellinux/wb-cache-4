5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>for</b> each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or else they will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski {{on the wrong side of}} the flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.|$|E

Arbroath holds the world record for the largest winning margin in a senior football match, 36–0, in their Scottish Cup match against Bon Accord (a scratch team from Aberdeen) on 12 September 1885.

Arbroath are nicknamed the Red Lichties, owing to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the harbour (Lichtie being a Scots word for light). Arbroath and the surrounding areas are home to several amateur senior and junior teams competing in the various amateur leagues, such as Arbroath Victoria and Arbroath SC.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if commercially produced art and aesthetic education packages are quality products and if art and aesthetic education packages meet selected <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> art education. This study was limited to packages developed for preschool, kindergarten, and elementary children. To initiate the study, various avenues were explored in order to discover sources of commercially produced art and aesthetic education packages. A list of 72 publishers and suppliers of art and aesthetic education packages was compiled. From this list, a sample of 14 packages was selected. The first portion of the study pertained to the individual analysis of each package. To assess the packages comprising the sample, "An Instrument for the Assessment of Instructional Materials," developed by Maurice Eash (1972) was selected as the evaluation instrument. This instrument is divided into five sections: (a) objectives, (b) organization of material, (c) methodology, (d) evaluation, and (e) overall assessment. The second portion of the study pertained to the relationship of the package to <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> art education. Various art educators have listed <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> art education; moreover, <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> listed by <b>the</b> National Art Education Commission on Art Education (1977) were selected as <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> to be used in this study. A group of trained evaluators assessed the individual packages. The findings revealed that only two packages received mean and median scores of 5. 0 or higher on a rating scale of 1 through 7. This included the assessment of all five areas included in the evaluation instrument. The other 12 packages received mean and median scores of 2. 5 or less on a rating scale of 1 through 7. In comparing the. packages to <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> art education, two packages met all of <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> art education. These two packages were the same ones which received the highest ratings on the evaluation instrument. Two other packages met two of <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> art education. All of the other packages met only one of <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> art education. <b>The</b> majority of the packages met one of two goals, either "art education as a means of developing creative and flexible forms of thinking" or "art education as a means of helping students understand and appreciate art.
