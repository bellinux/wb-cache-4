5|$|The JNA tasked the 2nd Titograd Corps and the 9th Boka Kotorska Military-Maritime Sector (VPS)both {{of which}} were {{elements}} of the 2nd Operational Groupwith cutting off and capturing the Dubrovnik area. The 2nd Titograd Corps deployed the 1st Nikšić Brigade while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS employed the 5th and the 472nd Motorized Brigades. The Corps boundary running north-to-south near Dubrovnik was set. The 2nd Operational Group also commanded the 16th Border Patrol Detachment and 107th Coastal Artillery Group, and mobilised <b>Territorial</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>units</b> from Herceg-Novi, Kotor, Tivat, Budva, Bar, Mojkovac, Bijelo Polje and Trebinje. Strugar was in overall command of the 2nd Operative Group while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS was commanded by Vice Admiral Miodrag Jokić. Jokić replaced Admiral Krsto Đurović, {{who had died in}} uncertain circumstances hours before the offensive began. Major General Nojko Marinović, once commanding the 472nd Motorized Brigade and subordinate of Đurović, said that the JNA had killed the admiral because he opposed the offensive. Marinović resigned his post on 17 September and joined the Croatian ZNG. The JNA 2nd Operational Group initially deployed 7,000 troops and maintained similar troop levels throughout the offensive.|$|E
5|$|By late June and {{throughout}} July, northern Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but no actual combat. Nonetheless, the increasing {{intensity of the}} conflict in the region and elsewhere in Croatia led to the preparation of bomb shelters in Zadar by city officials. Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (SAO Krajina) authorities called up three <b>Territorial</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>units</b> in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July, one day after another fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area, while the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps conscripted the local Serb population in Benkovac to strengthen its ranks {{by the end of the}} month. In late July, a paramilitary group, led by Miro Barešić and formally subordinated to the Croatian Ministry of Defence, conducted several sabotages in the Benkovac area. On 1 August, Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG 4th Guards Brigade to Kruševo near Obrovac. Two days later they engaged in combat against the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence and police forces, marking the first such engagement of the Croatian War of Independence in the region. On 26 August, the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps openly sided with the SAO Krajina forces as they jointly attacked Kijevo, expelling all Croats from the village. Another significant setback for Croatia in the region was JNA capture of the Maslenica Bridge on 11 September. That severed the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia. On 1113 September, an attack in the area of Skradin cut water and power supply to Šibenik.|$|E

Estimates show that 40,000 Bosniaks were expelled from the Zvornik district. It was the second city in Bosnia and Herzegovina that was forcefully taken over by Serb forces during the Bosnian War. A total of 3,936 people were killed or went missing in the Zvornik municipality between 1992 and 1995, according to the Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo.|$|E

5000|$|He first gained {{prominence}} in 1991 {{at the beginning}} of the Yugoslav wars, most specifically the Croatian War of Independence, with the song [...] "Bojna Čavoglave" [...] ("Čavoglave battalion"). Perković was not a professional singer, nor had the band yet been formed. It was reportedly composed as an anthem for the <b>territorial</b> <b>defence</b> <b>unit</b> hastily formed by natives of Čavoglave, at that time under JNA and Chetnik attacks. He released it under his own battle name, Thompson. The song starts with [...] "Za dom - Spremni!", a phrase which, although of earlier origin, is best known as the official salute of the Ustaše, the Croatian Nazi ally of the World War II Axis forces.|$|R
500|$|Serbian sources {{disagree}} with this assessment. General Andrija Biorčević, the former {{commander of the}} Novi Sad corps, has said there were [...] " [...] more than 1,500 killed on our side." [...] The Serbian journalist Miroslav Lazanski, who has close links with the Serbian military, wrote in the Belgrade newspaper Večernje novosti that [...] "on {{the side of the}} JNA, <b>Territorial</b> <b>Defence</b> and volunteer <b>units,</b> exactly 1,103 members were killed." [...] He cited losses of 110 armoured vehicles and two combat aircraft shot down, plus another destroyed due to technical failure. General Života Panić, in an interview with Serbian weekly news magazine Vreme, said that 1,503 members of the JNA were killed in the battle. Colonel Milisav Sekulić stated that 1,180 JNA soldier and TO personnel were killed. According to military historian Norman Cigar, the actual number may have been considerably greater as casualties were consistently underreported during the war.|$|R

Albanians felt that their status as a [...] "minority" [...] in Yugoslavia had made them second-class citizens in comparison with the [...] "nations" [...] of Yugoslavia and demanded that Kosovo be a constituent republic, alongside the other republics of Yugoslavia. Protests by Albanians in 1981 over the status of Kosovo resulted in Yugoslav <b>territorial</b> <b>defence</b> <b>units</b> being brought into Kosovo and a state of emergency being declared resulting in violence and the protests being crushed. In {{the aftermath}} of the 1981 protests, purges took place in the Communist Party, and rights that had been recently granted to Albanians were rescinded– including ending the provision of Albanian professors and Albanian language textbooks in the education system.|$|E
