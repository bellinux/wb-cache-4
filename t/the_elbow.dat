5|$|As {{they came}} to <b>the</b> <b>elbow,</b> on the 494-yard run-in to home, Cahervillahow, Romany King, The Committee and Esha Ness {{remained}} tight and vying for position. But it was 50/1 shot Esha Ness, ridden by John White and trained by Jenny Pitman, who crossed the line first, in the second-fastest time in Grand National history. Cahervillahow came home second despite trailing in fourth at <b>the</b> <b>elbow,</b> Romany King was third and The Committee fourth. Givus A Buck completed in fifth, with On The Other Hand and Laura's Beau completing the seven finishers of the National that never was.|$|E

5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs {{which seem to}} have been vestigial. The bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% of the length of the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held straight, and <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> joint was immobile.|$|E

50|$|As one of {{the most}} basic postures, jōdan-no-kamae is common to {{virtually}} all schools of kenjutsu. The primary attribute of jōdan-no-kamae is always the weapon lifted above the head of the practitioner. One of the only significant variations is the relative position of <b>the</b> <b>elbows.</b> Some styles, such as aiki-ken, prefer <b>the</b> <b>elbows</b> to be as far inward as possible. Many others insist on <b>the</b> <b>elbows</b> being open.|$|R
5|$|Djokovic {{announced}} in late July {{that he would}} be skipping the rest of the 2017 season to recover from <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> injury that forced him to retire at Wimbledon, while Murray pulled out of both the Rogers Cup and Cincinnati Masters due to the hip injury he sustained at Wimbledon.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to make an overview that can be useful in determining which type and brand of prosthesis a patient has when visiting the emergency department or outpatient clinic with a periprosthetic fracture, dislocation, or implant failure. The commonly used prostheses in Europe are opted for this list. The radiographs used for this list are obtained either from the company or from our own patients. This list contains <b>the</b> Coonrad/Morrey total <b>elbow</b> prosthesis, <b>the</b> Nexel total <b>elbow</b> prosthesis, <b>the</b> GSB III <b>Elbow</b> Prosthesis, <b>the</b> iBP Total <b>Elbow</b> System, <b>the</b> Discovery <b>Elbow</b> System, <b>the</b> NESimplavit <b>Elbow</b> System, <b>the</b> Latitude <b>Elbow</b> prosthesis, <b>the</b> Solar <b>Elbow,</b> and <b>the</b> Souter–Strathclyde total <b>elbow.</b> <b>The</b> characteristics of each prosthesis are described.|$|R
25|$|The first {{theory for}} {{targeting}} {{is based on}} the proximity of the arms in relation to the body. It is said that when <b>the</b> <b>elbows</b> are pulled back behind the body, this targets the long head more. To target the short head, <b>the</b> <b>elbows</b> should be in front of the body.|$|R
5|$|The uniform worn for {{practicing}} aikido (aikidōgi) {{is similar}} to the training uniform (keikogi) used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton tops are used. Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below <b>the</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> and foreleg, running from <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E
5|$|During spring {{training}} in 2014, Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson decided that Corbin would start on Opening Day. However, Corbin felt arm tightness during a {{spring training}} start. An MRI revealed {{damage to his}} ulnar collateral ligament of <b>the</b> <b>elbow.</b> He underwent Tommy John surgery, and missed the entire 2014 season. The Diamondbacks placed Corbin on the 15-day disabled list on March 30, and transferred him to the 60-day disabled list on April 4, in order to open a roster spot for Roger Kieschnick, who they claimed off waivers.|$|E

50|$|The Red-Tiger Bulldog's {{shoulders}} are moderately to heavily loaded with muscle and have moderate to maximal definition. Their upper arms are of sufficient length and angulation {{to ensure that}} <b>the</b> <b>elbows</b> are set under the body.

5|$|In {{osteochondritis}} dissecans, {{fragments of}} cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation. These fragments are {{sometimes referred to}} as joint mice. OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or <b>the</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nevin in 2002 played first base, {{which was}} {{considered}} his strongest defensive position. But injuries shortened his 2002 and 2003 seasons. In 2002, he missed {{time with a}} strained left elbow. Three games after returning from <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> injury, he broke his arm diving for a ground ball, causing him to miss another six weeks. After being heckled by a fan during a September 2002 game, Nevin gave the fan the finger, for which he apologized.|$|E
5|$|On April 8, 2015, Nathan {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list due to a strained right elbow. During a rehab start with the Toledo Mud Hens on April 22, Nathan re-injured his elbow after throwing only 10 pitches. The same night, Nathan underwent MRIs, which tested positive revealing tears in his ulnar collateral ligament of <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> and his pronator teres muscle, and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending Nathan's 2015 season. Sources projected that this surgery could end Nathan's career, but he was not planning to retire yet.|$|E

Heston, in a DVD commentary track for the film, mentions that a third urban legend claims that he wore a wristwatch during the chariot race, but points out that he wore leather bracers up to <b>the</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|E
5|$|While OCD {{may affect}} any joint, the knee—specifically the medial femoral condyle in 75–85% of knee cases—tends {{to be the}} most {{commonly}} affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. <b>The</b> <b>elbow</b> (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|E
5|$|Due to her 2000 injury, Carter lost {{considerable}} mobility in {{her right}} arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine, and nine operations were required to treat <b>the</b> <b>elbow.</b> After her comeback in 2008, she played for the Dandenong Rangers in the Australian Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League (WNWBL), the team she had played for before her injury. That year she received a player award from the Dandenong Rangers and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in her 1-point disability classification in the WNWBL and {{was named to the}} league's All Star Five. The Rangers won back-to-back WNWBL titles in 2011 and 2012, and she was again named the WNWBL MVP 1 Pointer and to the league's All Star Five in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Fernández {{started his}} sophomore {{campaign}} as the Opening Day starter for the Marlins, {{making him the}} youngest Opening Day starting pitcher since Dwight Gooden in 1986. Fernández recorded nine strikeouts while walking none, and he joined Bob Gibson, Steve Carlton, Ferguson Jenkins, Walter Johnson, and Cy Young as the only pitchers to do so on Opening Day. On May 12, Fernández {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list due to a right elbow sprain. An MRI revealed that <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> had a torn ulnar collateral ligament, which prematurely ended Fernández's 2014 season. He underwent Tommy John surgery on May 16. He made eight starts, going 4–2 with a 2.44 ERA and 70 strikeouts in 2014.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at <b>the</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1961, {{there were}} violent {{confrontations}} between NOI members and police in South Central Los Angeles, and numerous Muslims were arrested. They were acquitted, but tensions had been raised. Just after midnight on April27, 1962, two LAPD officers shoved and beat several Muslims outside Temple Number 27 without provocation. A large crowd of angry Muslims came outside from the mosque. The officers attempted to intimidate the crowd. One officer was disarmed by the crowd; his partner {{was shot in}} <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> by a third officer. More than 70 backup officers arrived. They raided the mosque and randomly beat NOI members. Police officers shot seven Muslims, including William X Rogers, who {{was hit in the}} back and paralyzed for life, and Ronald Stokes, a Korean War veteran, who was shot from behind while raising his hands over his head to surrender, killing him.|$|E
