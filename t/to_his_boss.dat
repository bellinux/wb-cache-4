Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E

25|$|Before {{his career}} in films, Suriya worked at a garment exports factory for eight months. To avoid nepotism, he did not reveal himself <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>boss</b> as Sivakumar's son, but his boss {{ultimately}} learnt the truth himself. He was initially offered the lead role by Vasanth in his film Aasai (1995), but he rejected the offer citing {{a lack of interest}} in an acting career. He later debuted in Vasanth's own 1997 film Nerrukku Ner, produced by Mani Ratnam when he was 22 years of age. The stage name Suriya was bestowed to him by Ratnam to avoid a clash of names with established actor Saravanan. The name Suriya was frequently used for characters in Ratnam's films. Vijay, who would also go on to become a leading contemporary actor in Kollywood, co-starred with him in the film. This was followed by a series of roles in commercially unsuccessful films in the late 1990s. In 2001, he starred in Siddique's comedy film Friends, also co-starring Vijay.|$|E
25|$|The {{quicksort}} algorithm {{was developed}} in 1959 by Tony Hoare while in the Soviet Union, as a visiting student at Moscow State University. At that time, Hoare worked in a project on machine translation for the National Physical Laboratory. As {{a part of the}} translation process, he needed to sort the words of Russian sentences prior to looking them up in a Russian-English dictionary that was already sorted in alphabetic order on magnetic tape. After recognizing that his first idea, insertion sort, would be slow, he quickly came up with a new idea that was Quicksort. He wrote a program in Mercury Autocode for the partition but couldn't write the program to account for the list of unsorted segments. On return to England, he was asked to write code for Shellsort as part of his new job. Hoare mentioned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>boss</b> that he knew of a faster algorithm and his boss bet sixpence that he didn't. His boss ultimately accepted that he had lost the bet. Later, Hoare learned about ALGOL and its ability to do recursion that enabled him to publish the code in Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery, the premier computer science journal of the time.|$|E

500|$|It was {{revealed}} in a flashback in the episode that Smithers was briefly {{married to a}} woman, but the two split up when he devoted too much time <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>boss</b> Mr. Burns. Smithers's relationship with Mr. Burns {{has long been a}} running joke on The Simpsons. His sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a [...] "Burns-sexual" [...] and only attracted <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>boss,</b> while others maintain that he is, without a doubt, gay. Matthew Henry wrote in the book Leaving Springfield that this episode is [...] "perhaps the best" [...] example of an attempt to portray an actual gay lifestyle on the show. Henry added that the flashback is a [...] "wonderfully rendered parody of scenes from two of Tennessee Williams's most famous plays, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire. To fully appreciate it, one must know something of not only the two plays cited but also of Williams himself, of his own struggles with both heterosexual and homosexual desires {{and the way in which}} these struggles were incorporated into his art. The creators of The Simpsons offer what I think is a perfect parallel for the relationship between Smithers and Mr. Burns by combining Williams's two most notable male characters and their defining characteristics: the suppressed homosexual desire of Brick and desperate dependence of Stanley." ...|$|E
50|$|Mrs Thatcher's {{fall from}} grace with her {{parliamentary}} party is dated to a speech by her Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe, whose wife Elspeth took {{a leading role in}} publicising the homelessness campaign and is widely credited with writing the speech that her husband delivered in Parliament leading <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>boss's</b> political demise.|$|R

500|$|Pei took to {{the project}} with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had {{recently}} recruited to the firm, William Pedersen and Yann Weymouth. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a trapezoid of land {{at the intersection of}} Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>boss</b> that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: [...] "No compromises." ...|$|E

Krumnow's colleague Wagenpfohl found an SS doctor's paybook on the second body identifying him as Dr. Ludwig Stumpfegger. He gave the paybook <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>boss,</b> postal chief Berndt, who turned it over to the Soviets. They in turn destroyed it.

500|$|In 1982, the 24-year-old Madonna {{was living}} in New York and {{trying to set up}} her music career. She was joined by her boyfriend from Detroit, Steve Bray, who became the drummer of her band, The Breakfast Club, which {{generally}} played hard-rock music. After that, however, they abandoned playing songs in the hard-rock genre and got signed by a music management company called Gotham Records with the plan of pursuing a new musical direction. They decided to pursue the funk genre but the record company was not happy with their musical abilities, hence they were dropped, and Madonna and Bray left the band. Meanwhile, Madonna had written and developed some songs on her own. She carried rough tapes of three of the songs, namely [...] "Everybody", [...] "Ain't No Big Deal" [...] and [...] "Burning Up".

500|$|Smithers' {{relationship}} with Mr. Burns {{has long been}} a running gag on The Simpsons. Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns. There have often been strong hints about Smithers' true feelings for his boss, with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode [...] "The Telltale Head". Smithers' sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a [...] "Burns-sexual" [...] and only attracted <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>boss,</b> while others maintain that he is, without a doubt, gay. During the Bill Oakley/Josh Weinstein era, they still tried to keep his sexuality mysterious and there was debate among the writers about his orientation. Al Jean, who thinks of Smithers as being a [...] "Burns-sexual", felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman, then Smithers would not be gay. David Silverman, a former supervising director has said, [...] " [...] seems to be focused on one particular human, as opposed to anything beyond that. , he's sort of 'Burns-sexual.'" [...] In a 2006 study conducted by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, it was determined that nine of the 679 lead and supporting characters on scripted broadcast television were gay or lesbian, but Smithers was not included. [...] A list published in 2008 by the same organization included Smithers; Patty Bouvier, Marge Simpson's lesbian sister, was included on both lists.|$|E
