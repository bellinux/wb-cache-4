50|$|The B38 {{features}} direct injection, an 11:1 compression ratio, {{variable valve}} timing (dual-VANOS) and a single-scroll turbocharger with the world's first aluminium <b>turbine</b> <b>housing,</b> manufactured by Continental.|$|E
5000|$|It {{utilizes}} {{a single}} turbocharger with a <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> size of 1.15 A/R. In 1999, an air-to-air intercooler {{was added to}} cool the charged air from the turbo for increased air density. With the new cooler, denser air would increase the horsepower potential of the engine, while also reducing exhaust gas temperatures (EGT). Eventually, the <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> was changed to a [...]84 A/R and a wastegate was added. With larger injectors, the HPOP output was increased by utilizing a 17° swash plate angle {{to meet the requirements}} of the new, higher flowing injectors.|$|E

50|$|The planned {{capacity}} of Belo Monte is listed at 11,233 MW. It {{is composed of}} the main Belo Monte Dam, and its <b>turbine</b> <b>house</b> with an installed {{capacity of}} 11,000 MW. The Pimental Dam which also includes a <b>turbine</b> <b>house</b> would have an installed capacity of 233.1 MW, containing 25.9 MW bulb turbines. The generation facility is planned to have twenty Francis turbines with a capacity of 550-611 MW each.|$|R
50|$|This {{version of}} the K engine uses a Mitsubishi TD04HL-15T {{turbocharger}} with a dual path <b>turbine</b> <b>housing,</b> optimizing low end response while allowing better high end flow. Stock boost pressure: 0.9 bar. Comes mated to a {{version of the}} Honda longitudinal 4 cylinder, 5 speed automatic and optional SH-AWD.|$|E
50|$|The {{variable}} geometry Turbine {{is actuated}} via a linkage connecting the controller to vanes inside the <b>Turbine</b> <b>housing.</b> In the full-boost position, air {{is allowed to}} pass over the Turbine impeller. In the no boost position the vanes block exhaust gasses from acting on the impeller and route them down the exhaust pipe.|$|E
50|$|Plastigauge is a {{measuring}} tool used for measuring plain bearing clearances, {{such as in}} engines.

50|$|The 4N13 1.8-liter engine uses a Variable Geometry (VG) {{turbocharger}} with {{a variable}} vane turbine, which provides optimal boost pressure control for different driving conditions. The 4N14 2.3-liter engine also uses a VG turbocharger plus a Variable Diffuser (VD) that uses both variable geometry vanes in the <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> and a compressor with variable vanes in the diffuser passage, further improving combustion efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{turbocharger}} was {{a reverse}} rotation Mitsubishi TD04LR-15Gk with a 6 cm2 turbine inlet. Tight packaging forced some creative {{thinking on the}} turbocharger. The TD04 compressor has a compressor bypass valve built right into the compressor housing. The exhaust manifold and <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> were cast in one piece by Mitsubishi from high-nickel Ni-Resist steel. The one-piece design improved flow, reduced size and reduced thermal mass for quicker cat light-off. The turbine discharge was {{also part of the}} manifold/turbine housing casting, and it looped back around and hit the manifold again {{on its way to the}} catalytic converter. Where they met, there was a wastegate valve; keeping the wastegate valve away from the <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> improved flow where it mattered most. Maximum boost in stock form was around [...] Piston velocities and valve-train components force a rev limit of 6240 rpm although MOPAR upped the ante with their Stage 2 and 3 kits which have a rev limit of 6500 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Diversion of {{exhaust gases}} regulates the turbine speed, {{which in turn}} regulates the {{rotating}} speed of the compressor. The primary function of the wastegate is to regulate the maximum boost pressure in turbocharger systems, to protect the engine and the turbocharger. One advantage of installing a remote mount wastegate to a free-float (or non-WG) turbo includes allowance for a smaller A/R <b>turbine</b> <b>housing,</b> resulting in less lag time before the turbo begins to spool and create boost.|$|E

500|$|Tiger had two paired sets of Brown-Curtis {{direct-drive}} steam <b>turbines</b> <b>housed</b> {{in separate}} engine-rooms. Each set consisted of high-pressure ahead and astern turbines driving an outboard shaft and low-pressure ahead and astern <b>turbines,</b> <b>housed</b> {{in the same}} casing, driving an inner shaft. Her three-bladed propellers were [...] in diameter. The turbines were powered by 39 Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers in five boiler rooms at a working pressure of [...] The turbines were designed to produce a total of [...] and a maximum of [...] when forced, but only achieved [...] during her sea trials, although she managed to exceed her maximum designed speed of [...] by over a knot.|$|R
50|$|The Mk.9 was {{designed}} around the FIA's Group 6 regulations for sports prototypes, {{allowing for a}} completely custom mid-engine layout that was only limited in terms of engine sizes available to competitors. Closed cockpit bodywork with gullwing doors {{was designed}} by Bob McKee to shroud the mid-engine layout. Standard double wishbone suspension with coil springs were used with disc brakes on each wheel. A 32 gal fuel tank was placed between the cockpit and <b>turbine,</b> <b>housing</b> Jet A fuel.|$|E
5000|$|... 509 A-2: Version for the Messerschmitt Me 163B-1a. Weighing only 100 kg complete, this engine {{consisted}} of two main assemblies, the roughly-cubical shape framed forward assembly comprising the <b>turbine</b> <b>housing,</b> the fuel pumps geared to the turbine shaft, the control box, a pressure-reducing valve and the electric starter motor, with the aft assembly {{made up of the}} combustion chamber, connected to the fore unit by a cylindrical [...] "thrust-tube" [...] containing pipes which carried fuel to the combustion chambers individual injector jets. The thrust was adjustable between 200 kp (2 kN) and a maximum of 1700 kp (16.7 kN).|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common {{implementations}} include {{a ring of}} aerodynamically-shaped vanes in the <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> at the turbine inlet. In general, for light-duty engines (passenger cars, race cars, and light commercial vehicles), the vanes rotate in unison to vary the gas swirl angle and the cross sectional area. In general, for heavy-duty engines, the vanes do not rotate, but instead the axial width of the inlet is selectively blocked by an axially sliding wall (either the vanes are selectively covered by a moving slotted shroud or the vanes selectively move vs a stationary slotted shroud). Either way, the area between {{the tips of the}} vanes changes, leading to a variable aspect ratio.|$|E
50|$|Energy {{generated}} {{through the}} four 21 MW low head high efficiency Kaplan bulb <b>turbines,</b> <b>housed</b> in a semi submerged powerhouse complex, is evacuated through an in-out connecting {{arrangement with the}} double circuit 132 kVA Mangla/Kharian transmission line, which passes over the Project site. No right-of-way acquisition was needed since connection facility has been built within the Project site.|$|R
50|$|In 1909 Grassington {{received}} its first electricity from a hydroelectric plant at Linton Falls, which continued to operate until 1948 when the National Grid {{arrived in the}} area. In March 2012 a new hydroelectric power plant was opened using the same but restored <b>turbine</b> <b>house,</b> which provides 500,000 kWh of electricity a year, using two Archimedean screws.|$|R
50|$|It {{was planned}} to have two cooling towers per reactor, as was typical with such Soviet designs. The <b>turbine</b> <b>house</b> was {{connected}} to the reactor buildings and each reactor had its own turbine and cooling towers in the designs. Several operating plants today have such a design, notably the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant in the Czech Republic.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth-generation}} engine uses {{a proprietary}} CT15B turbocharger. This generation {{was used in}} the 1997-2002 ST215 Caldina GT-T AWD Wagon. The exhaust housing is actually cast into the cylinder exhaust manifold, rather than the normal practice of a separate <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> after the cylinder exhaust manifold. Due to this, the CT15 is backwards compatible with the third-generation 3S-GTE cylinder head only, not either the first or second generation. Intake charge was cooled by an air-to-air top-mounted intercooler fed through a new side-feed intake manifold. This generation utilizes a coil-on-plug ignition system and 550cc injectors. Boost remains at 13-14psi, however overboost fuel cut is increased to 21psi. Compression is increased to 9:1 and produces 260PS (256 hp) and 324N·m (239 lb-ft).|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, Porsche {{introduced}} the Turbo S. The 944 Turbo S {{had a more}} powerful engine (designation number M44/52) with [...] and 258 lb·ft Nm torque (standard 944 Turbo [...] and 243 lb·ft Nm). This higher output was achieved by using a larger K26-8 <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> and revised engine mapping which allowed maintaining maximum boost until 5800 rpm, compared to the standard 944 Turbo the boost would decrease from [...] at 3000 rpm to [...] at 5800 rpm. In June 1988, Car and Driver tested the 944 Turbo S (with the advantage of shorter final drive gear) and achieved a 0-60 mi/h km/h time of 5.5 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 13.9 seconds at 101 mi/h km/h. Top speed was factory rated at 162 mi/h km/h.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of the second generation Volvo S40 in 2003 another update to the engine family took place. The new engine was called RNC, the C standing for compact to emphasise the decrease in overall dimensions. Compared to the previous generation the new engine was 200mm slimmer and 25mm shorter. On turbocharged engines the exhaust manifold and <b>turbine</b> <b>housing</b> were now combined into one part; all engines were equipped with plastic intake manifolds and continuously variable valve timing (CVVT).The RN engines remained in production alongside the RNC engines and were slowly phased out, beginning with {{the introduction}} of the second generation Volvo S80 in 2006. The new SI6 engine family was introduced to replace the 6-cylinder variants of the Volvo Modular Engine at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The <b>turbine</b> <b>house</b> is a steel framed, {{aluminium}} clad building 380 feet (115.8 metres) long, 160 feet (48.8 metres) {{wide and}} 90 feet (27.4 metres) high, with a reinforced concrete basement 26 feet (7.9 metres) deep. The foundations {{are provided by}} isolated bases and strip footings with a designed maximum bearing pressure of 3 tons per square foot.|$|R
5000|$|In 1892 John Fulton {{installed}} one of {{the first}} hydroelectric plants in Ayrshire, generating electricity for Broadlie House. The dam still exists (2008) and can be seen on the Putyan Burn close to a pedestrian bridge that gave views of the installation to visitors. The water was carried downstream to a <b>turbine</b> <b>house</b> through a cast iron pipe.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the mill}} {{consisted}} of three large buildings, two for grinding wheat and corn and the third for malting barley. The fire in the 1860s left just the malting house extant. The main mill is an eleven-bay 7 storey structure, and has a crenellated parapet. When the building was recommissioned in the 1990s to produce electricity a concrete block <b>turbine</b> <b>house</b> was added.|$|R
