25|$|Mendis {{recorded}} {{a string of}} poor scores on New Zealand's tour of the island in 1984, only passing 20 once in six Test innings. By this time, however, he was established as {{the captain of the}} side, and still picked for the Test match in England that English summer. Mendis made his third Test century as Sri Lanka smashed 491 for 7 batting first amid <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first Test century by a Sri Lankan captain while in office. Sri Lanka drew that Test. A poor World Series Cup in 1984–85 followed, where Sri Lanka only won one out of ten ODIs, and Mendis was out in single figures four times.|$|E

25|$|In an {{incredible}} finish to the knock-out quarter-final between Surrey Lions and Warwickshire Bears, the match was tied, so the players had {{to resort to}} a bowl-off - cricket's version of a penalty shootout, in which five players have two attempts at bowling at unguarded stumps, and if the stumps fall down, that was one point for their team. Surrey opened the batting in this match at The Oval, having been put in to bat by the Bears' captain Nick Knight. It was a shaky effort, often interrupted by wickets, and part-timer Jonathan Trott snared two wickets for 19 - admittedly tail-enders Ian Salisbury and Tim Murtagh. Mark Ramprakash, however, hit an unbeaten run-a-ball 34 to guide Surrey to 149 for 8, well below a par score. Warwickshire's innings then began under heavy cloud cover that assisted the Surrey swing bowlers. After Neil Carter went first ball, Warwickshire struggled in <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bad weather eventually stopped play just before five overs was played - so that, if the players couldn't return, the match would be declared a no-result. However, the rain gave way reasonably quickly, and quick hitting from Trevor Penney in particular - who made 20 off 12 balls before being caught off a ball from Rikki Clarke closed down the deficit.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{said that}} Donen's {{impulsive}} marriage to Coyne showed an emotional immaturity {{and lack of}} good judgment, and stated that [...] "Jeannie's marriage to Stanley was doomed from the start. Because every time Stanley looked at Jeannie, he saw Betsy, whom he loved; and every time Jeannie looked at Stanley, I guess she saw me. One way or another it was all pretty incestuous." [...] Kelly's marriage to Blair ended in 1957, after which he moved in with Coyne. They married in 1960 and had two children together. Coyne died of leukemia in 1973. In November 2012 the musical What A Glorious Feeling depicted both the making of Singin' in <b>the</b> <b>Rain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> love triangle between Donen, Kelly and Coyne.|$|E

In his review for Telugu Swatantra magazine, writer Aarudhra praised the film's sound designing by Krishnan and Koteswara Rao stating, [...] "Heavy rain with winds lashed outside as 's mother converses with her husband Nagappa. Their conversation is clearly audible along {{with the sound of}} <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind. Even the flutter of the towel on Nagappa's shoulder is heard clearly". In The Hans India, Aruna Ravikumar surmised that, for the song [...] "Akasha Veedhilo", Krishnasastri had borrowed the image of a cloud as messenger between lovers from the poem [...] "Meghasandesam" [...] by Indian Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa. Rajeswara Rao considered Malliswari to be his best work after S. S. Vasan Chandralekha (1948). He especially liked [...] "Akasha Veedhilo" [...] and performed it numerous times at events he attended.|$|E

500|$|The {{portion of}} the story set on New Earth {{challenges}} the reader to question their own relationship to Earth: Le Guin uses the colonists' ignorance of common words to demonstrate common assumptions. The story's characters go from {{an environment in which}} their continued existence was entirely in their control, to one where it depended on the wind, <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun. The colonists suffer from headaches and other ailments because of pollen and other substances in the air, making Luis realize their total dependence on the planet. Le Guin thus points out human beings' dependence on the real planet Earth. After the Discovery departs from New Earth, the story remains with Hsing and Luis on Hsin Ti Chiu, rather than with the ship. According to Payne, this narrative choice indicates that Le Guin sees Hsing and Luis's choice as the correct – albeit more difficult – path to take.|$|E
500|$|In {{the lower}} ground {{west of the}} Passchendaele Ridge, three months of {{constant}} shelling had blocked the watercourses that normally provided drainage. On the night of 4 October, it began to rain and continued intermittently {{for the next three}} days. Much of the battlefield again became a quagmire, making movement extremely difficult. Had the German defence collapsed during the Battle of Poelcappelle on 9 October, the reserve brigades of II Anzac Corps were to have passed through later in the day, to continue the attack {{to the far side of}} Passchendaele village and the Goudberg spur to the north. On 7 October, this afternoon attack had been cancelled by Haig, because of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> final details of the plan for the renewed attack of 12 October, were decided on the evening of 9 October. Plumer had received misleading information about the progress of the attack that day and believed that [...] "a sufficiently good jumping-off line" [...] had been achieved, passing the erroneous information back to Haig. The decision was made to continue the offensive, to gain more favourable winter positions on higher ground, to assist the French with their attack due on 23 October (the Battle of La Malmaison) and to hold German troops in Flanders during the preparations for the Battle of Cambrai.|$|E

So, it's strange to think what it'd be like not to make or record music. It seems unnatural!". When reviewing his 1996 CD Festival, Melody Maker described him as [...] "grand-meister of contemporary British improv, spiritual son of Eddie Prevost and Maddy Prior; gentle manipulator of English hymn-notics and religious incantations; protege, challenger and radicaliser of folk, blues, rock, minimalism and improvisation; translator for the sea and <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky; ambassador to war and peace, to love and anguish".|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Data on the {{reproductive}} {{rhythm of the}} grass rat, Arvicanthis abyssinicus, were collected in a bush area and a crop field at the Entoto Mountain for a one-year period from August 2000 to July 2001. Very few individ-uals of Arvicanthis were captured from the bush area. The number of captures from the crop field, however, was much higher. Higher percentages of reproductively active males and females were recorded during <b>the</b> <b>rains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> couple of months that followed. Breeding decreased in the dry months. The presence of cereals on the field {{did not seem to}} augment breeding during the dry months. The outcome of the present study is consistent with most previous results where breeding in Arvicanthis sp. primarily occurs during <b>the</b> <b>rains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> few months that follow. It is rec-ommended that physiological studies should be conducted for a better understanding of {{the reproductive}} timing of Arvicanthis in an eco-physiological context...|$|R

2500|$|One of the {{dominant}} geographical influences of Spanish viticulture is the vast plateau known as the Meseta Central that covers much of central Spain. Several of Spain's principal rivers {{that are at the}} heart of many Spanish wine regions flow to the sea from that central area. These include the eastward flowing Ebro river that runs through the Rioja and several Catalan wine regions; the Duero which flows westward through the Ribera del Duero region in Spain before crossing the border into Portugal's Douro Valley which is at the heart of Port wine production; the Tajo which runs through the La Mancha region; Guadalquivir which flows into the Atlantic at the Sherry producing village of Sanlúcar de Barrameda. In addition to the Meseta Central, several mountain ranges known as cordilleras serve to isolate and influence the climate of several Spanish wine regions. These include the Cantabrian Mountains that spur westward from the Pyrenees and protect regions like the Rioja from <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cool of westerlies coming from the Bay of Biscay. The Cantabrian Mountains act as a rain shadow with the coastal regions of the Basque Country receiving an average of [...] while the winemaking region of Rioja, near Haro, around [...] away receives only [...] In Galicia on the northwest coast, the region receives annual rainfall that ranges from [...] on the coast to [...] near the mountainous border of Castile and León.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{requested}} close air support, {{calling for}} the waiting aircraft to drop napalm across 11 Platoon's eastern frontage. The Phantoms soon arrived; however, due to the rain and low cloud {{they were unable to}} observe the coloured smoke thrown by the Australians to mark their position through the trees. Stanley was forced to halt the artillery while the aircraft flew overhead, yet with Smith unable to establish communications with the forward air observer he wanted them out of the area so it could resume firing. Townsend directed the aircraft drop their payloads on the forward slopes of Nui Dat 2 instead, believing it the location of the Viet Cong command element. With the artillery beginning to fall again and D Company still heavily outnumbered, it proved critical in preventing them being overrun as the Viet Cong formed assault waves. Major Harry Honnor—officer commanding 161st Battery, RNZA attached to 6 RAR in direct support—served as Townsend's artillery advisor at Nui Dat and during the battle controlled the fires of the three field batteries, as well as directing the American medium artillery against depth targets. On the ground Stanley would call down the fire himself or would relay the direction of the assault, from which Honnor would select targets and order the fire, which was then adjusted by Stanley using sound ranging to bring it closer. Despite <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> soft ground reducing the impact of the artillery, its effectiveness was aided by otherwise favourable technical conditions, including the location of the infantry between the guns and the assaulting Viet Cong, the convenient range of [...] at which the engagement occurred, good communications afforded by the newly issued PRC-25 radios, the air burst effect created by rounds exploding in the trees, and the large supply of rounds stock-piled at Nui Dat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rest of the}} {{division}} crossed the river during the night. The 1st Light Horse Brigade, providing flank protection for 60th Division, went north to locate the track to Es Salt, which is [...] north-east of Jericho but at an altitude [...] higher. Leading {{the remainder of the}} force, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade advanced to Amman in the east. At 11:00, several hundred Turkish cavalry were sighted east of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. The GOC Ryrie and the 6th Light Horse Regiment attempted to cut them off but they escaped in the rugged terrain. At 15:00, the brigade regrouped and set out for the Hekr spring on the plain. Finding the tracks unsuitable for wheeled transport, {{the division}}'s artillery and supply train had to remain behind. This caused a delay while essential stores were transferred to camels. The advance resumed at 21:30; at times the troopers had to dismount and lead their horses along the tracks, through heavy rain which began to fall at 02:00 on 25 March. The first troops reached Ain el Hekr at 04:00 and waited {{for the rest of the}} division to arrive, and at 19:30 the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved out again across the plateau. Even on the flat progress was slow, the camels slipping in <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wet conditions, slowed the horsemen. Soon after observing a Turkish convoy in the distance, the 5th Light Horse Regiment was ordered to attack. The convoy of nineteen lorries, three cars, one armoured car and several other vehicles was captured along with twelve prisoners. Another patrol from the 6th Light Horse Regiment captured sixty-one prisoners at Suweile. Just before dawn, the 7th Light Horse Regiment leading met up with the New Zealand Brigade, which had travelled independently via the Shunet Nimrin road. The New Zealanders route had been easier than that used by the main force. Chaytor, aware that his men had not rested for three days and nights, postponed the assault for twenty-four hours.|$|E
