500|$|The album debuted at No. 122 on the Billboard 200 chart {{with first}} week sales of just under 10,000 units. Since its release in May 2003, We've Come For You All sold about 62,000 copies in the United States. Apart from {{entering}} the French Albums Chart at number 95, the record did not manage to chart in any other country. Referring to the low record sales, Ian posted {{a message on the}} band's official web site saying: [...] "That's more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it would do after five years away.

500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Green Day {{released}} Insomniac, {{which did}} not perform as well commercially as the band's breakthrough major-label debut Dookie (1994). Speaking of Insomniac, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong noted, [...] "It did a lot better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it was going to}} do...From the sound of it, we knew it wasn't going to sell as much as Dookie." [...] The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote Insomniac in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. [...] The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, [...] "We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas. [...] It was beginning to be not fun anymore." ...|$|E

500|$|San Martín made a brief {{reconnaissance}} of the royalist army, {{and noticed}} several flaws in their organization. Feeling secure of victory, {{he claimed that}} [...] "Osorio is clumsier <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> Today's triumph is ours. The sun as witness!". The battle began at 11:00 am. The patriot artillery on the right fired on the royalist infantry on the left. Manuel Escalada led mounted grenadiers to capture the royalist artillery, turning them against their owners. Burgos' regiment severely punished the patriot left wing, mainly composed of emancipated slaves, and took 400 lives. San Martín ordered the mounted grenadiers led by Hilarión de la Quintana to charge against the regiment. The firing suddenly ended and royalists began to fight with sword bayonets, under the cries [...] "Long live the king!" [...] and [...] "Long live the homeland!" [...] respectively. Finally, the royalists ended their cries and began to disperse.|$|E
500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{begins with}} quivering reverb and a plaintively plucked guitar setting a somber mood for about fifteen {{seconds before the}} beats begin {{alongside}} Beyoncé's voice. Her vocals set a hushed and morbid tone on the song as she bring doses of edge and grit, singing: [...] "I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time / Know {{there was something that}} meant something that I left behind / When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets / I'll leave something to remember, So they won't forget". She further sings throughout the song, [...] "The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leaved that I made a difference". Watery synths shimmer in the background before Beyoncé adopts an authoritative tone to chant the chorus lines: [...] "I was here / I lived, I loved / I was here / I did, I've done / Everything that I wanted / And it was more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it would be / I will leave my mark so everyone will know / I was here".|$|E
500|$|... "Galentine's Day" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez said, [...] "The show {{managed to}} cram more character development into 22 minutes <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> possible. Almost every couple {{had a major}} milestone of sorts last night." [...] Gonzalez complimented the acting of Aziz Ansari during his moments with Wendy, and praised the [...] "touching moment" [...] between Ron and Leslie when {{she realized she had}} to break up with Justin. Steve Kandell of New York magazine appreciated that Leslie was correct about Frank, and that Justin was the ignorant one. Kandell said the senior dance served as a [...] "poignant backdrop" [...] for the episode's romantic subplots, but said the most intriguing show's relationship is between Leslie and Ron. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode was funny, but focused more attention on advancing various romantic subplots. Sepinwall said the scenes about Ann and Mark were [...] "a nice reaction to the general blandness of that relationship", but found it [...] "frustrating" [...] that the episode left the reason for Wendy and Tom's resolution unclear in [...] "Galentine's Day".|$|E

500|$|Dan Casey {{writing for}} Nerdist felt the episode was [...] "the most dramatic, tense hour of {{television}} we’ve seen from" [...] the series, stating that [...] "One of the show’s biggest problems {{has been its}} general lack of depth, particularly {{in terms of the}} characters and making them feel like real people rather than glossy superspies with a seemingly endless wellspring of one-liners" [...] and decided that the episode [...] "made significant steps towards fixing this problem, thanks to some wonderful character interactions and an exploration of Fitz/Simmons’ past". James Hunt of Den of Geek said [...] "whether this episode continues the show's upwards trend, that's debatable. It could've been worse, but there wasn't the leap forward that we saw from episode three to four, or four to five. I'll say this for an episode: it was better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> a Fitz & Simmons episode would be. That's progress, of a sort." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., criticized the scope and scale of the episode, but praised the character development for Coulson, feeling it brought his character closer to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents of the comics.|$|E
500|$|The case {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be going badly for Marshall-Hall. An inept cross-examination on his part weakened his argument, and an illness made him irritable and short-tempered. On {{the advice of his}} clerk, he asked Birkett to make the closing address before the court, which turned the mood of the courtroom completely and an initially hostile jury decided to disregard the agreement of Mr. Dennistoun to pay ancillary relief to his former wife. Birkett's performance made the front pages of many evening newspapers, including The Daily Mail which described Birkett as [...] "the greatest legal discovery of the year" [...] and called his speech [...] "a brilliant piece of advocacy". His work for this case and the newspaper coverage of it brought him to the attention of many London solicitors, and led to him earning £8,000 in the first seven months of 1925. In that year he made £12,000 overall, an amount which rose to £16,500 in 1926 and peaked in 1929 when he earned £33,500. On meeting Miles Malleson, an old friend from his time at Cambridge, he said in surprise [...] "did you know, Miles, that I am making more money <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> existed in the world!" ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you get to know the person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track and it all started coming out, melodies and everything...

500|$|Since {{its initial}} reception, Illmatic {{has been viewed}} by music writers {{as one of the}} quintessential hip hop {{recordings}} of the 1990s, while its rankings near the top of many publications' [...] "best album" [...] lists in disparate genres have given it {{a reputation as one of}} the greatest hip hop albums of all time. Jon Pareles of The New York Times cited Illmatic as a [...] "milestone in trying to capture the 'street ghetto essence'". The album has been described by a number of writers and critics as [...] "classic". Chris Ryan, writing in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), called Illmatic [...] "a portrait of an artist as a hood, loner, tortured soul, juvenile delinquent, and fledgling social critic," [...] and wrote that it [...] "still stands as one of rap's crowning achievements". Similar to The Sources initial sentiment, XXL later gave the album a classic [...] "XXL" [...] rating in a retrospective review. In a retrospective review for MSN Music, Christgau said the record was [...] "better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> at the time for sure—as happens with aesthetes sometimes, the purists heard subtleties principled vulgarians like me were disinclined to enjoy", although he still found it inferior to The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album Ready to Die (1994).

500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Sony and Capcom greenlit a Resident Evil {{film with}} George A. Romero {{signed on as}} the film's {{director}} and screenplay writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the Resident Evil video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an ad campaign for Biohazard 2 (Resident Evil 2) in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studios' Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. [...] Romero's screenplay {{was based on the}} first Resident Evil game and included characters from the video games. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker were to also appear. [...] The ending to the film would have been {{similar to that of the}} best ending to the first Resident Evil game. Romero's script was disapproved of and production was placed into development hell. Capcom producer Yoshiki Okamoto explained to the editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly that [...] "Romero's script wasn't good, so Romero was fired". [...] In February 2000, Romero revealed in an interview with DGA magazine that [...] "I don't think they were into the spirit of the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie, something heavier <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it should be. So I think they just never liked my script." [...] As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise.|$|E

He did many, many things. He was a true Renaissance Man."

However, she said they shouldn't detract from her political track record.
