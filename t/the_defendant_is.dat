5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> expected to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
50|$|In Smith v Hughes (1960), <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> charged under <b>the</b> Street Offences Act 1959 {{which made}} it an offence to solicit {{prostitution}} in a public place. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> soliciting from within private premises (windows or on balconies) {{so they could be}} seen by the public without entering into the streets. The court applied the mischief rule holding that the activities of <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> within <b>the</b> mischief of the Act, and soliciting from within a house, is soliciting and molesting of the public. Therefore it is the same as if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> outside on <b>the</b> street.|$|R
2500|$|The case {{then went}} to the Exchequer of Pleas, where it was heard between 3 and 5 May 1865. It was heard on two points. Firstly, whether <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> liable for <b>the</b> actions of the {{contractors}} and secondly, whether <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> liable for <b>the</b> damage regardless of their lack of negligence. They decided for the first point that <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> not liable, but more split on the second point. Pollock CB, Martin B and Channell B held that <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> not liable, as since a negligence claim could not be brought there was no valid case. Bramwell B, dissenting, argued that the claimant had the right to enjoy his land free of interference from water, and that as a result <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> guilty of trespass and the commissioning of a nuisance. He stated that [...] "the general law in matters wholly independent of contract" [...] should <b>be</b> that <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> liable, [...] "on the plain ground that <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> have caused water to flow into the 's mines, which but for <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> act would not have gone there".|$|R
50|$|Additionally, some jurisdictions add the {{question}} of whether or not <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> in control of their behavior at the time of the offense. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> compelled by some aspect of their mental illness to commit the illegal act, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> could <b>be</b> evaluated as not in control of their behavior at the time of the offense.|$|R
5|$|While a {{defendant}} {{is entitled to}} a fair cross section in the venire, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury. Yet, the equal protection clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges {{in the selection of}} the petit jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{authorized}} {{and actual}} sentence, upon demand, a criminal defendant {{has a right}} to trial by jury. The defendant does not have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution. If <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, the defendant {{has a right to}} a jury. Further, the defendant has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. contempt of court).|$|E
5|$|Non-aggravated {{offences}} involving damage {{valued at}} less than £5,000 are triable only summarily by magistrates and the maximum sentence is three months' imprisonment and a fine of £2,500. If {{the value of the}} property damaged exceeds £5,000, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> entitled to claim trial on indictment by a jury, but if tried summarily, may be sentenced to up to six months in jail and a £5,000 fine. Where the value of the property is unclear, the court may hear representations as to value, but may also offer the defendant the option of summary trial, with limited penalties.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence against <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> <b>was</b> mainly circumstantial. Nonetheless, twenty-four of <b>the</b> twenty-six <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{sentenced to}} death by hanging on 18 January 1911, and <b>the</b> {{remaining}} two <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> sentenced to 8 years and 11 years respectively for violation of explosives ordinances.|$|R
50|$|The Court, in a {{unanimous}} opinion by Justice Brennan, {{held that the}} collateral order doctrine {{does not apply to}} a forum selection clause. This was not a case where <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> claiming a right not to be tried at all, like a sovereign immunity case, which would be disposed of before <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> even subject to the discovery process. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> acknowledging that it could be sued, but merely disputing the appropriate forum for the suit.|$|R
50|$|Official {{documents}} {{verify that}} <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> eligible for farmland {{distributed by the}} government under the Farming Land Reform Act and, therefore, did not defraud the government as alleged. Although most of <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> cleared of suspicion, the government conducted a second investigation to punish them.|$|R
5|$|Tran {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in Sacramento County Superior Court on November 6, 2015, charged of the attempted murder of Stone with an allegation of using a dangerous weapon, a knife. He did not enter a plea, was ordered to be held without bail, and was scheduled to return to court December 1, 2015. On December 1, 2015, Tran again appeared in the Sacramento Superior Court for a bail review hearing. This was subsequently postponed, with Tran held without bail. On January 7th, 2016, Tran was again denied bail, and another preliminary hearing was set for February 26th, 2016. At the February 26th hearing, Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz informed Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Goodman that his department plans to amend the original criminal charges against Tran, to include gang involvement in the assault. A gang involvement charge in California provides for additional penalties if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> found guilty. Judge Goodman ordered another hearing to be held on March 30, 2016, {{to determine whether or}} not prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with the charges against Tran.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> {{accused of}} having knowingly and willfully participated in {{enterprises}} involving fatal medical experiments upon subjects without their consent.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> a {{licensed}} physician that wrote prescriptions to Willie King for 150 grains of heroin, 360 grains of morphine, and 210 grains of cocaine {{as part of}} a maintenance treatment. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> indicted under <b>the</b> Harrison Act, but the district court dismissed the indictment.|$|R
25|$|In the end, all <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> acquitted.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> {{previously}} {{convicted of}} another murder.|$|R
25|$|In general, if a {{defendant}} is found incompetent {{to proceed to}} trial, the criminal proceedings are suspended. In those cases, where the charges are petty, the charges are often dropped or a plea bargain may be made in which the charges are nolle prossed if the defendant agrees to seek treatment. Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> usually committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> restored to competency, {{at which point the}} trial will proceed.|$|E
25|$|Any sexual {{intercourse}} {{with a person}} under 16 years of age is prohibited unless <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> less than 4 years older than the victim except when married to the person {§14‑27.2, 14‑27.4 & 14‑27.7A}.|$|E
25|$|Nominal damages {{consist of}} a small cash amount where the court concludes that <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> in breach but the {{plaintiff}} has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution of Brazil {{provides}} that only willful crimes against life, namely full or attempted murder, abortion, infanticide and suicide instigation, {{be judged by}} juries. Seven jurors vote in secret to decide whether <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> guilty or not, and decisions are taken by majority.|$|E
25|$|Nebraska is {{the only}} state in which the {{sentence}} is decided by a three-judge panel. If one of the judges on the panel opposes death, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> sentenced to life imprisonment. Montana {{is the only}} state where the trial judge decides the sentence alone.|$|E
25|$|A {{statistical}} test procedure {{is comparable to}} a criminal trial; a defendant is considered not guilty {{as long as his}} or her guilt is not proven. The prosecutor tries to prove the guilt of the defendant. Only when there is enough charging evidence <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> convicted.|$|E

25|$|The 14th Amendment {{provides}} {{protection against}} inconvenient litigation, typically {{described in terms}} of “reasonableness” or “fairness”: “Does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” The relationship between the defendant and forum must be “reasonable.” The burden on <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> to be balanced against other factors, including the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief.|$|E
25|$|Burden {{of proof}} refers most {{generally}} to {{the obligation of}} a party to prove its allegations at trial.

Each party has the burden of proof of its allegations.|$|E
