5|$|Punk cited {{his health}} {{as the main}} reason he left WWE, {{describing}} that in his final months in the company, {{he had been working}} through an untreated and potentially fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, and multiple concussions including one at the Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to him, he found a lump on his back in November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused to remove it despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife April Mendez convinced him to get <b>the</b> <b>lump</b> checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated and he was on stronger medication, he was able to sleep better than he had in weeks.|$|E
5|$|De Gray's {{ability to}} raise money made him useful to John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500knights during a period when Philip II was {{threatening}} to invade England, bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England. In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, {{and part of the}} settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal. The settlement was sealed with a treaty, to which de Gray was one of the witnesses. After John settled with the papacy, de Gray {{was not included in the}} general pardon, and had to go to Rome to be pardoned. While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered <b>the</b> <b>lump</b> sum that had to be paid before Innocent would lift the interdict. After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as Bishop of Durham in 1213; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at Saint-Jean-d'Angély in Poitou. He was buried in Norwich Cathedral, but his tomb has not survived.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we develop, test, and {{implement}} a methodology that is able to perform, in an automated manner, lumping of a high-dimensional, discrete dynamical system onto a lower-dimensional space. Our aim is to develop an algorithm which, without any assumption {{about the nature of}} the systems slow dynamics, is able to reproduce accurately the long-time dynamics with minimal loss of information. Both the original and <b>the</b> <b>lumped</b> systems conform to master equations, related via <b>the</b> <b>lumping</b> analysis introduced by Wei and Kuo Ind. Eng. Chem. Fundam. 8, 114 (1969), and have the same limiting equilibrium probability distribution. The proposed method can be used in a variety of processes that can be modeled via a first order kinetic reaction scheme. Lumping affords great savings in the computational cost and reveals the characteristic times governing the slow dynamics of the system. Our goal is to approach <b>the</b> best <b>lumping</b> scheme with respect to three criteria, in order for <b>the</b> <b>lumped</b> system to be able to fully describe the long-time dynamics of the original system. The criteria used are: (a) <b>the</b> <b>lumping</b> error arising from the reduction process; (b) a measure of the magnitude of singular values associated with long-time evolution of <b>the</b> <b>lumped</b> system; and (c) the size of <b>the</b> <b>lumped</b> system. <b>The</b> search for <b>the</b> optimum <b>lumping</b> proceeds via Monte Carlo simulation based on the Wang-Landau scheme, which enables us to overcome entrapment in local minima in the above criteria and therefore increases the probability of encountering the global optimum. The developed algorithm is implemented to reproduce the long-time dynamics of a glassy binary Lennard-Jones mixture based on the idea of inherent structures, where the rate constants for transitions between inherent structures have been evaluated via hazard plot analysis of a properly designed ensemble of molecular dynamics trajectories. © 2011 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

25|$|Above we {{have used}} the {{standard}} mathematical formula for the sum of a geometric series. (Or if ireal =0 then the series in braces sums to p since it then has p equal terms). As an example, assume that S=60,000 per year {{and that it is}} desired to replace Rrepl=0.80, or 80%, of pre-retirement living standard for p=30 years. Assume for current purposes that a proportion z prop=0.25 (25%) of pay was being saved. Using ireal=0.02, or 2% per year real return on investments, the necessary lump sum is given by the formula as (1-0.25)*0.80*60,000*annuity-series-sum(30)=36,000*22.396=806,272 in the nation's currency in 2008–2010 terms. To allow for inflation in a straightforward way, it is best to talk of the 806,272 as being '13.43 years of retirement age salary'.

25|$|In 'Nick', Nick {{struggles to}} find {{money to pay}} for Russian gangsters to smuggle Matty back into England, all the while {{struggling}} with his feelings for Franky. After emotionally pouring his heart out to her during an argument in a nightclub toilet, he subsequently blows the deal. But, to his happiness, Franky finally reciprocates his feelings, and they form a relationship. In 'Alo', Alo is finally forced to grow up when, in his effort to put his failed relationship with Mini behind him, he has sex with a girl named Poppy Champion (Holly Earl) who he did not initially know to be underage. Poppy reports him to the police when he breaks up with her. Although charges are eventually dropped, he and Mini are forced further apart than ever before. 'Liv' focuses on Liv's isolation. Since meeting Alex, she has been 'dealing' with Grace's death by going out, partying, drinking, and staying at Alex's house instead of her own home. Alex leaves Bristol one weekend, and Liv finds that—aside from her sister Maude—she has truly drifted from her friends, and Mini in particular. Moreover, she begins to have intense pains and feels a large lump on her side, which she worries might be ovarian cancer. Ultimately however, <b>the</b> <b>lump</b> {{turns out to be a}} grief-induced hallucination; responding to this, Liv takes a step towards dealing with Grace's death by placing flowers next to her tombstone alongside Rich, Doug, and Maude. While Mini's mum tries to convince her to give her child for adoption once it is born, and Franky is conflicted after Matty returns to Bristol, in 'Franky & Mini', both girls decide to leave everything behind and abscond. Soon, however, Mini wishes to return home, despite Franky's insistence. Alo learns of Mini's pregnancy and to her surprise—in the end—vows to take care of her no matter what. In the finale, Franky attempts to track down her mother, but instead finds her biological sister who declares their mother has died. At Alex's house party to celebrate leaving Bristol behind, she tells both Matty and Nick she loves them but cannot be with them. In the conclusion, Mini goes into labour, while Franky's sister takes her to see her mother—who is not dead after all. Nick and Matty bond once again, and the latter turns himself in to the police. In the final scene, playing in parallel, Alex leaves Bristol for Thailand; Alo and Liv are beside Mini as she gives birth; Franky lays eyes on her mother; and Rich, outside the room where Mini is giving birth, looks at the camera and says 'bye'.|$|E
