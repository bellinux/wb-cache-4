5|$|In 1986, {{the first}} local short feature film {{to be shot}} on video was released.

2500|$|The {{conservative}} {{watchdog group}} Judicial Watch publicized CIA and U.S. Defense Department documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, and alleged that [...] "unusual access to agency information" [...] was granted to <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers.</b> But, {{an examination of}} the documents showed no evidence that classified information was leaked to <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers.</b> In addition, CIA records did not show any involvement by the White House in relation to <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>filmmakers</b> have said they were not given access to classified details about Osama bin Laden's killing.|$|R

5|$|In the sixties, Ray visited Japan {{and took}} {{particular}} pleasure in meeting <b>the</b> <b>filmmaker</b> Akira Kurosawa, {{for whom he}} had very high regard.

5|$|In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres {{dismissed}} Coppola's claim. Although Torres {{agreed that}} Sagan violated some {{terms of the}} contract, he explained that Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit, {{taking it to the}} California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that <b>the</b> <b>filmmaker</b> thought about suing over Contact.|$|E

50|$|It's {{only when}} they {{investigate}} further that <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> begin to doubt Anthony's accounts of his past. Tensions noticeably rise as <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> continue to confront Anthony on his conflicting stories and ever-changing philosophies. During an awkward interview, <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> interview Merle, <b>the</b> father {{of a young girl}} who was abducted and never found. This abduction was Anthony's first child victim.

5|$|As {{the son of}} <b>the</b> <b>filmmaker</b> Rakesh, Roshan {{faced the}} media {{spotlight}} from a young age. Discussing nepotism in Bollywood, Shama Rana views {{him as one of}} several actors who managed film careers with the help of family relations in the industry. On the other hand, Roshan is acknowledged in the media {{as one of the most}} talented Indian actors of his generation, for his devotion to his work and for his ability to commit heavily to each role. He insists on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts himself, and is particularly known for his professionalism. The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming Mohenjo Daro despite several injuries and being in a troubled state of mind. Zoya Akhtar, who considers Roshan her favourite actor, and directed him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, remarks on his ability to display a range of emotions on screen.|$|E
5|$|His first post upon {{returning}} to his home country was an advisory position with the Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) in Ottawa, where he battled Canada's private broadcasters, especially CTV, over new Canadian content regulations. This lasted {{for only a few}} months, before in August 1970 he became the new Government Film Commissioner, the Chairman of the National Film Board of Canada, returning to the same institution for which he had worked in the 1940s. In this role, he experienced considerable problems in Quebec resulting from {{the fact that he did}} not speak French, at a time when the NFB's French Program branch was attracting young Quebec nationalist filmmakers. Some staff members also felt that he had been away from the NFB for too long, while <b>the</b> <b>filmmaker</b> Denys Arcand felt that Newman did not understand Quebec culture.|$|E
50|$|Alice Terry sued <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> for $750,000 {{complaining}} she was {{depicted in}} the film as carrying out an illicit love affair while still being married.

50|$|In early 2009 <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> {{announced}} that <b>the</b> film had been slated for release by New Yorker Films but was indefinitely delayed {{due to the}} bankruptcy of the distributor.

5|$|Kurosawa's next film, for Shochiku, was The Idiot, an {{adaptation}} of the novel by the director's favorite writer, Fyodor Dostoyevsky. <b>The</b> <b>filmmaker</b> relocated the story from Russia to Hokkaido, but it is otherwise very faithful to the original, a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work. A studio-mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawa's original cut of 265 minutes (nearly four-and-a-half hours) to just 166 minutes, making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow. It is widely considered today {{to be one of}} the director's least successful works. Contemporary reviews were very negative, but the film was a moderate success at the box office, largely because of the popularity of one of its stars, Setsuko Hara.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>filmmaker</b> Derek Jarman {{adapted the}} Marlowe play into a film in 1991, {{creating}} a postmodern pastiche of the original, depicting Edward as a strong, explicitly homosexual leader, ultimately overcome by powerful enemies. In Jarman's version, Edward finally escapes captivity, following the {{tradition in the}} Fieschi letter. Edward's current popular image was also shaped by his contrasting appearance in Mel Gibson's 1995 film Braveheart, where he is portrayed as weak and implicitly homosexual, wearing silk clothes and heavy makeup, shunning the company of women and incapable of dealing militarily with the Scots. The film received extensive criticism, both for its historical inaccuracies and for its negative portrayal of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In early 1973, the Soviet studio Mosfilm {{approached}} <b>the</b> <b>filmmaker</b> {{to ask if}} {{he would}} be interested in working with them. Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev's autobiographical work Dersu Uzala. The book, about a Goldi hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization, was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s. In December 1973, the 63-year-old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides, beginning a year-and-a-half stay in the country. Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia, with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding. The picture wrapped in April 1975, with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June. Dersu Uzala had its world premiere in Japan on August 2, 1975, and did well at the box office. While critical reception in Japan was muted, the film was better reviewed abroad, winning the Golden Prize at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, as well as an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Today, critics remain divided over the film: some see it as an example of Kurosawa's alleged artistic decline, while others count it among his finest works.|$|E

50|$|The {{crowdfunding}} campaign received unprecedented support. While <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> had {{an initial}} goal of $20,000, {{they went on}} to receive a staggering $120,000, nearly 600% over their target. This was the largest crowdfunding campaign of its kind in India, hosted by <b>the</b> <b>filmmakers</b> on their own platform.|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, the {{development}} team spent five days and four nights {{in a place called}} the Capcom Manor to work on the game; this was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>filmmaker</b> Akira Kurosawa, who would gather scriptwriters in a hotel room to create the scripts for his films. During their stay in the manor, they discussed the game's plot and the new gameplay system, finalized the direction, and created rough sketches for most characters in the game. For the new character Hakari Mikagami, Iwamoto used a female saint as the main image for her design, and imagined her as being an older woman he could look up to. Another new character, Yumihiko Ichiyanagi, was Eshiro's favorite minor character in the series because of his character arc and how he grows throughout the game. The game was developed for the Ace Attorney series' tenth anniversary; because of this, several characters from previous games in the series made cameo appearances, including Frank Sahwit and Will Powers.|$|E

5|$|To provide authenticity, Luttrell {{moved into}} Berg's home {{for one month}} while Berg was writing the script. Luttrell acted as a consultant, {{detailing}} to Berg his eyewitness account {{of the events that}} unfolded during Operation Red Wings. Berg later embedded with a Navy SEAL team—becoming the first civilian to do so—and lived with them for a month in Iraq while he continued writing the screenplay. In re-enacting the injuries and deaths of the fallen Navy SEAL servicemen, Berg relied on Luttrell's eyewitness accounts from the book, as well as autopsy reports of the deceased and after-action reports. The United States Navy provided incident reports related to the mission, as well as archival military training footage, which is shown during the film's opening credits sequence.
