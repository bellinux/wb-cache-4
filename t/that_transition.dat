5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger <b>that</b> <b>transition.</b>|$|E
5|$|When The Tower of Babble was {{released}} in April 2012, a little over {{one and a half}} years had elapsed since its author Richard Stursberg left the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), in August 2010. Stursberg had been recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch, as his vice-president in charge of English services. Stursberg had previously worked in the media business, most recently as the director of Telefilm Canada (2001–2004). He entered CBC in October 2004, to replace the retiring Harold Redekopp, with the idea of changing the network's direction, away from its focus on high arts and towards popular content. Though Rabinovitch supported him, Stursberg understood how difficult <b>that</b> <b>transition</b> would be and that he would face resistance and criticism. Stursberg's vision was not supported by Rabinovitch's successor, Hubert Lacroix, who eventually replaced Stursberg with Kirstine Stewart. The 63-year-old Stursberg left CBC in August 2010 and by October 2011 publisher Douglas & McIntyre acquired the world rights to his memoir. Douglas & McIntyre's parent company, D Publishers, filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, still owing Stursberg $13,000.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{historian}} of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade: Ada saw something that Babbage {{in some sense}} failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw—what Ada Byron saw—was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation—to general-purpose computation—and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for <b>that</b> <b>transition,</b> then <b>that</b> <b>transition</b> was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.|$|E

25|$|For nearby {{objects in}} the universe, {{spectral}} absorption lines are very sharp, as only photons with energies just sufficient to cause an atomic transition can cause <b>that</b> <b>transition.</b> However, the distances between quasars and the telescopes which detect them are large, {{which means that the}} expansion of the universe causes light to undergo noticeable redshifting. This means that as light from the quasar travels through the IGM and is redshifted, wavelengths which had been above the Lyman Alpha limit are stretched, and will in effect begin to fill in the Lymann absorption band. This means that instead of showing sharp spectral absorption lines, a quasar's light which has traveled through a large, spread out region of neutral hydrogen will show a Gunn-Peterson trough.|$|E

The French police, having already started using open-source software in 2005 by replacing Microsoft Office with OpenOffice.org, decided to transition to Ubuntu from Windows XP after the release of Windows Vista in 2006. By March 2009, the Gendarmerie Nationale had already switched 5000 workstations to Ubuntu.

The Government of Kerala adopted Ubuntu for the legislators in Kerala and the government schools of Kerala began to use customized IT@School Project Ubuntu 10.04 which contains specially created software for students.

500|$|... "Complexity {{in ecology}} is {{of at least}} six {{distinct}} types: spatial, temporal, structural, process, behavioral, and geometric."

Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems <b>that</b> <b>transition</b> to multiple shifting steady-states directed by random fluctuations of history.

Another example is the Hubbard Brook study, which has been in operation since 1960.|$|E

500|$|Graded by {{a medical}} board as only being fit for {{administrative}} duties, Kippenberger still harboured hopes {{of returning to}} the 2nd Division. However, he was named to replace Brigadier James Hargest, {{who had been killed}} in France in August, as commander of the New Zealand Reception Group. This organisation had been formed to arrange accommodation as well as social and medical services for New Zealand military personnel who were expected to be released from prisoner of war camps in Germany when the war ended. These personnel were to be evacuated to England to await repatriation to New Zealand. It was recognised <b>that</b> <b>transition</b> from the harsh life as a captive to normal life may be difficult for some, and the Reception Group provided much needed support for these individuals.

500|$|The {{habitat of}} a species {{describes}} the environment over which a species is known to occur {{and the type of}} community that is formed as a result. More specifically, [...] "habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly (e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal." [...] For example, a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a montane or alpine ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population {{of a species}} of tropical lizards (Tropidurus hispidus) has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental life history of amphibians, and in insects <b>that</b> <b>transition</b> from aquatic to terrestrial habitats.
