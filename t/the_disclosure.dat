40|$|How did the U. S. and Canadian {{news media}} cover privacy {{following}} <b>the</b> Snowden <b>disclosures</b> in 2013 ? What were the dominant frames used in portraying <b>the</b> <b>disclosures</b> {{and to what}} extent did the media mention privacy? Were there any prominent differences between Canadian and U.

This study also draws comparisons between Canadian and American overlapping perspectives on corporations increasing collection of consumer data.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first {{research}} to utilise <b>the</b> broker <b>disclosures</b> relating to sell-side analyst recommendations which were introduced following modifications to NASD Rule 2711 in 2002. <b>The</b> <b>disclosures</b> are intended to enable investors to assess the credibility of a recommendation upon its announcement and {{can be considered a}} proxy for the likely bias affecting the recommendations of analysts affiliated with investment banks. This thesis tests the market reaction to <b>the</b> <b>disclosures</b> to determine whether investors find them to be useful in the short-term and investigates the association between <b>the</b> broker <b>disclosures</b> and analyst recommendation performance and accuracy over the long-term. The evidence suggests that <b>the</b> <b>disclosures</b> contain incremental information to the recommendation event.
