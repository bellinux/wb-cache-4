This paper presents initial results from our studies of backpacker culture and identifies gaps where future technologies could assist backpackers in existing situations. Our research included contextual interviews with backpackers, tours of hostel accommodation, and reviews of online discussion and blogging sites. Results so far indicate the need for mobile devices which can help a social, distributed community to connect and coordinate. To address this, we have developed methods of depicting community interaction and context of use, and prototype mobile <b>travel</b> <b>assistants...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some of {{the challenges}} involved in providing computer-based integrated personalised travel services through a medium such as the Internet. Further, a software agent {{solution to this problem}} is presented, and an agent-based <b>travel</b> <b>assistant</b> demonstrator described, which was developed using the ZEUS collaborative agent building tool-kit. 1. Introduction Consider, for example, the following scenario [...] - a traveller wishes to arrange a trip from a town outside London to a city on the eastern coast of the USA. Ideally these requirements could be submitted once to an on-line <b>travel</b> <b>assistant,</b> that could use its knowledge of the travel industry to plan an appropriate itinerary. This hypothetical <b>travel</b> <b>assistant</b> would consult the global flight schedules to determine which airlines serve the chosen destination, and the airports from which they depart. Information from the national UK rail timetables could then be used to determine what time the traveller would need to leave home to reach the airport with adequate time to check in. The assistant could also arrange hotel accommodation {{for the duration of the}} traveller's stay, and provide a list of local attractions that might interest them. When the required services are booked, the assistant could then be instructed to monitor news sources for any events that might conceivably delay or jeopardise the journey, such as adverse weather or strikes by air-traffic controllers. To implement such a hypothetical personal <b>travel</b> <b>assistant,</b> three significant issues need to be considered.. Personalisation The assistant needs to learn about its user's interests and preferences in order to personalise the services it books. Such learning could be performed by adaptive profiling [1], whereby machine learning techniques ar [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} research {{question that was}} addressed with the project is whether a simple, continuously collected GPS sequence {{can be used to}} accurately measure human behavior. We applied Hybrid Dynamic Mixed Network (HDMN) modeling techniques to learn behaviors given an extended GPS data stream. This research project was designed to be an important component of a much larger effort. Unfortunately, the promised funding from a commercial sponsor for the larger project did not materialize, and so we did not have the resources to deploy a prototype personal <b>travel</b> <b>assistant</b> system. Work focused on developing the HDMN model. The learning and inference steps using the HDMN model were much slower than would be acceptable in an operational Personal <b>Travel</b> <b>Assistant</b> (PTA) system. We conducted research into alternate formulations that would improve convergence, handle noisy data more robustly and reduce the need for human intervention.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Web has encouraged {{the development of new}} information gathering techniques. In order to retrieve Web information, it is necessary to integrate different sources. Planning techniques have been used for this purpose in the field of information gathering. A plan for information gathering is the sequence of actions that specify what information sources should be accessed so that some characteristicts, like access efficiency, are optimised. MAPWeb is a multiagent framework that integrates Planning Agents and Web Information Retrieval Agents. In MAPWeb, planning is not only used to integrate and to select information sources, but also to solve actual planning problems with information gathered from the Web. For instance, in an <b>travel</b> <b>assistant</b> domain, plans represent the sequence of actions an user has to follow to perform his/her trip.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} <b>Travel</b> Blog <b>Assistant</b> System that {{facilitates}} the travel blog writing by automatically selecting for each blog paragraph written by the user the most relevant images from an uploaded image set. In order to do this, the system first automatically adds metadata to the traveler’s photos based both on a Generic Visual Categorizer (visual keywords) and by exploiting cross-content web repositories (textual keywords). For a given paragraph, the system ranks the uploaded images according to the similarity between the extracted metadata and the paragraph. The technology developed and presented here has potential beyond travel blogs, which served just as an illustrative example. Clearly, the same methodology {{can be used by}} professional users in the fields of multimedia document generation and automatic illustration and captioning. ...|$|R
