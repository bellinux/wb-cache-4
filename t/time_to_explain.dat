25|$|When the Guardian {{arrives on}} Venus, the Exo Stranger {{describes}} the Vex as an evil so dark it despises other evil. She tells {{them about the}} Black Garden, a city where the Vex are born, and implores the Guardian to find it and rip out its heart, {{as it is the}} only way the Traveler will begin to heal. Ghost says that they need to speak to the Awoken, who lurk out in the Reef and refuse to take sides in the galaxy's wars. The Exo Stranger then leaves as she did not have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> things further. Once the Guardian arrives at the Reef, they meet the Queen of the Reef, Mara Sov, and her brother, Prince Uldren Sov, who tells the Guardian that they will help them locate the Black Garden if they bring them the head of a Vex Gate Lord. The Guardian travels back to Venus, where they uncover the Archive, which reveals secrets about the Vex, including the location of a place called the Vault of Glass, and pathways across the galaxy. After defeating Draksis, a Fallen Kell of the House of Winter, the Guardian confronts the Vex Gate Lord, claims its head, and returns to the Queen, who tells them to take its eye to the Meridian Bay on Mars, where it can be used to enter the Black Garden.|$|E

Commenting on the difficult process of adapting his book into a screenplay, McBride stated, “As a novelist, you tend to think internally. You can guide what the character says and you can explore what he or she is thinking. Movies don't have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain.</b> You have to get right to the muscle.” ...|$|E
500|$|Season two delved {{deeper into}} Lex's darker moments, {{from the time}} he wavers to save his father's life, to his {{outburst}} at Jonathan for what he feels is unfair treatment. These moments play into Lex's psyche. Season three's [...] "Memoria" [...] finally explained the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of Lex's infant brother, Julian. Gough explains that they had known the story of Julian Luthor back in season one, when the character was first mentioned in [...] "Stray", but they wanted to find the right <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the situation. The creative team wanted the audience to think that Lex was responsible for Julian's death as an infant, before finally revealing that Lex was merely covering for his mother.|$|E

2500|$|In the huddle, the Giants were incredulous {{when the}} call came in. [...] "Don't give me the ball", begged fullback Larry Csonka, the former Dolphins star. Other players asked Pisarcik to change the play, but he demurred. Gibson had berated him for {{changing}} a play the week before and threatened to have him waived if he ever did so again. Gibson {{did not take the}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> his decision to Pisarcik. As a result, the rest of the offense simply viewed Gibson's call as a power trip. Because he was a second-year starting quarterback who still had not totally proven himself, in the era before free agency, Pisarcik lacked the stature to prevail in this kind of dispute.|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2006 {{edition of}} the ABC News program Nightline, Parker {{expressed}} his views on religion, stating that he believes in [...] "a God" [...] and that [...] "there is knowledge that humanity does not yet possess" [...] while cautioning {{that it would take}} a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> exactly what he meant by his belief in God. Parker believes all religions are [...] "silly". He states that [...] "All the religions are superfunny to me… The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent his only son. Why could God only have one son and why would he have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really terrible in about the second act." [...] Parker further remarked, Basically… out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous—the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah… there's this big giant universe and it's expanding, it's all gonna collapse on itself and we're all just here just 'cause… just cause. That, to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever.|$|E
2500|$|On April 1, 2007, Morissette {{released}} a tongue-in-cheek cover of The Black Eyed Peas's selection [...] "My Humps", which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied {{only by a}} piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively {{with a group of}} men and hits the ones who attempt to touch her [...] "lady lumps", had received 16,465,653 views on February 15, 2009. Morissette did not take any interviews for a <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the song, and it was theorized that she did it as an April Fools' Day joke. Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacy [...] "Fergie" [...] Ferguson responded by sending Morissette a buttocks-shaped cake with an approving note. On the verge of the release of her latest album, she finally elaborated on how the video came to be, citing that she became very much emotionally loaded while recording her new songs one after the other and one day she wished she could do a simple song like [...] "My Humps" [...] in a conversation with Guy Sigsworth and the joke just took {{a life of its own}} when they started working on it.|$|E

2500|$|In 1948 Hendrik Casimir {{showed that}} one {{consequence}} of the zero-point field is an attractive force between two uncharged, perfectly conducting parallel plates, the so-called Casimir effect. At the time, Casimir was studying the properties of [...] "colloidal solutions". These are viscous materials, such as paint and mayonnaise, that contain micron-sized particles in a liquid matrix. The properties of such solutions are determined by van der Waals forces – long-range, attractive forces that exist between neutral atoms and molecules. One of Casimir's colleagues, Theo Overbeek, realized that the theory that was used at the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> van der Waals forces, which had been developed by Fritz London in 1930, did not properly explain the experimental measurements on colloids. Overbeek therefore asked Casimir to investigate the problem. Working with Dirk Polder, Casimir discovered that the interaction between two neutral molecules could be correctly described only if the fact that light travels at a finite speed was taken into account. Soon afterwards after a conversation with Bohr about zero-point energy, Casimir noticed that this result could be interpreted in terms of vacuum fluctuations. He then asked himself {{what would happen if}} there were two mirrors – rather than two molecules – facing each other in a vacuum. It was this work that led to his famous prediction of an attractive force between reflecting plates. The work by Casimir and Polder opened up the way to a unified theory of van der Waals and Casimir forces and a smooth continuum between the two phenomena. This was done by Lifshitz (1956) in the case of plane parallel dielectric plates. The generic name for both van der Waals and Casimir forces is dispersion forces, because both of them are caused by dispersions of the operator of the dipole moment. The role of relativistic forces becomes dominant at orders of a hundred nanometers.|$|E

50|$|Goldacre {{provides}} an overview of the origins of Homeopathy (its ‘invention’ by Samuel Hahnemann in the late eighteenth century) and the basic ideas that characterise it: ‘like cures like’, the increase in potency by dilution, succussion, proving, and the collation of remedies in a reference book. He shows that the levels of dilution used in preparing homeopathic remedies are so high, that the final ‘medicine’ contains no active ingredient. He dismisses the idea of ‘water memory’, which has been used in more recent <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> why homeopathic remedies still work, in spite of extreme dilution.|$|R
