He filed for several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 May 1910, with later additions to the existing patents.|$|E
5|$|Horton Hatches the Egg was {{published}} to immediate critical acclaim and financial success and has remained {{popular with the}} general public. The book has also been {{used as the basis}} for academic articles on a variety of topics, including economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption.

5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|E

5|$|The Comet 4 was {{a further}} {{improvement}} on the stretched Comet 3 with even greater fuel capacity. The design had progressed {{significantly from the}} original Comet 1, growing by 18ft 6in (5.64m) and typically seating 74 to 81 passengers compared to the Comet 1's 36 to 44 (119 passengers could be accommodated in a special charter seating package in the later 4C series). The Comet 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher cruising speed and higher maximum takeoff weight. These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Comet 1's Ghosts. Deliveries to BOAC began on 30 September 1958 with two 48-seat aircraft, which were used to initiate the first scheduled transatlantic services.|$|E
5|$|According to Piers Jackson, <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{design was}} {{to produce a}} title that could {{showcase}} the full abilities of the PlayStation Portable, including its built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Jackson also asserted that Resurrection was an entirely different game from the original; whilst the studio had taken the basic story {{and some of the}} locations from the original game, all the code, graphics and voice actors were changed. New additions to Resurrection included an expanded plot, added mini-games, multiplayer facilities and a cloud save function. During late stages of development, the studio attempted to preserve ideas that they thought worked well in the original, though their uses were altered or repositioned to keep the game fresh even to those who had played the original. The addition of the 'Anubis Stone' sub-plot was to strengthen the story arc and the creation of Al-Zalam was to act as Dan's internal monologue as well as the player's guide.|$|E
25|$|Another {{feature of}} Amery's outlook was a {{significant}} distrust of the administration of US President Franklin Roosevelt because of <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, to use all of his influence to pressure Canada to oppose imperial free trade, perhaps Amery's most important project. While the pressure was unsuccessful as long as Canadian Conservative Prime Minister Richard Bedford Bennett was in power, after he lost the 1935 election, his Liberal successor, William Lyon Mackenzie King, adopted a more pro-American stance.|$|E

25|$|In later-period {{additions}} to the Mosque of Córdoba, the basic architectural design was changed: Horseshoe arches were now used for the upper row of arcades, which is now supported by five-pass arches. In sections which now supported domes, additional supporting structures were needed to bear <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cupolas. The architects solved this problem by the construction of intersecting three- or five-pass arches. The three domes spanning the vaults above the mihrab wall are constructed as ribbed vaults. Rather than meeting {{in the center of}} the dome, the ribs intersect one another off-center, forming an eight-pointed star in the center which is superseded by a pendentive dome.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} Il-22 {{was rapidly}} assembled and {{made its first}} flight on 24 July 1947. It proved to have docile handling characteristics, but was severely underpowered as the TR-1 engines produced only 80% of the required thrust. During {{the latter part of}} the manufacturer's flight tests the Il-22 made the first-ever Soviet jet-assisted takeoff on 7 February 1948 with a pair of SR-2 boosters. As <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engines could not be increased in a timely manner Ilyushin made the decision not to submit the bomber for state acceptance trials as its performance did not meet the requirements laid down for it in 1946.|$|E
25|$|The Warrant Design showed {{external}} buttresses on {{the ground}} floor level.These were not a classical feature and were one of the first elements Wren changed. Instead he made the walls of the cathedral particularly thick to avoid the need for external buttresses altogether. The clerestorey and vault are reinforced with flying buttresses, which were added at a relatively late stage in the design to give extra strength. These are concealed behind the screen wall of the upper storey which was added to keep the building's classical style intact, to add sufficient visual mass to balance the appearance of the dome and which, by its weight, counters <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buttresses on the lower walls.|$|E

25|$|Afterburning Olympus: As {{early as}} 1952, Bristol had {{considered}} {{the use of}} reheat, or afterburning, to augment <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Olympus. Initially, a system called Bristol Simplifed Reheat was devised which was tested on a Rolls-Royce Derwent V mounted in an Avro Lincoln. Later it was tested on an Orenda engine in Canada and on an Olympus Mk 100 in the Avro Ashton test bed. Fully variable reheat became possible after {{an agreement with the}} Solar Aircraft Company of San Diego which manufactured bench units for the Olympus Mks 101 and 102. An afterburning Olympus was just one proposal for the Vulcan Phase 6, a 350,000 lb aircraft with a 13/14 hour endurance.|$|E
25|$|Realising {{that any}} {{talks on the}} {{sovereignty}} issue would be derailed {{if it did not}} meet with the islanders' wishes, the British and Argentine Governments enacted a series of measures designed to encourage dependence on Argentina. In 1971, following secret talks between the two Governments (and without consulting the islanders), the communications agreement was signed. <b>The</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreement was the establishment of direct air and sea links between the islands and Argentina, together with agreements on postal and telephony services. Following the agreement the subsidised shipping link with Montevideo ended, a passenger and cargo ship service to the mainland (that would ameliorate any dependence on Argentina) was promised by the British but never provided.|$|E
25|$|In essence, Kant’s {{remarks in}} the preface prepare the reader for <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideas {{he goes on to}} develop in the Groundwork. The purpose of the Groundwork is to prepare a {{foundation}} for moral theory. Because Kant believes that any fact which is grounded in empirical knowledge must be contingent, he can only derive the necessity that the moral law requires from a priori reasoning. It is with this significance of necessity in mind that the Groundwork attempts to establish a pure (a priori) ethics. Such an ethics explains the possibility of a moral law and locates what Kant calls the “supreme principle of morality.” The aim of the following sections of the Groundwork is to explain what the moral law would have to be like if it existed and to show that, in fact, it exists and is authoritative for us.|$|E

50|$|The above {{equation}} {{applies only}} for air-breathing jet engines. It {{does not apply}} to rocket engines. Most types of jet engine have an air intake, which provides <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluid exiting the exhaust. Conventional rocket engines, however, do not have an intake, the oxidizer and fuel both being carried within the vehicle. Therefore, rocket engines do not have ram drag and <b>the</b> gross <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocket engine nozzle is <b>the</b> net <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> characteristics <b>of</b> a rocket motor are different from that of an air breathing jet engine, and <b>thrust</b> is independent <b>of</b> velocity.|$|R

25|$|Another {{departure}} from the usual plan is that found in Albi Cathedral (1350), {{in which there are}} no aisles, their place being taken by chapels between the buttresses which were required to resist <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave vault, the widest in France. The cathedral is built in brick and externally has the appearance of a fortress. At the cathedrals in southwest France, where the naves are covered with a series of domes - as at St. Barthélemy in Saint-Étienne in Cahors, the cathedral of Angoulême and St. Front de Périgueux - the immense piers required to carry them made it necessary to dispense with aisles. The cathedral of Angouléme consists of a nave covered with three domes, a transept of great length with lofty towers over the north and south ends, and an apsidal choir with four chevet chapels. In St. Front de Périgueux (1150), based on St. Mark's at Venice, the plan consists of nave, transept and choir, all of equal dimensions, each of them, as well as the crossing, vaulted over with a dome, while originally there was a simple apsidal choir.|$|E
25|$|As {{the walls}} {{carrying}} these vaults were also built in concrete with occasional bond courses of brick, the whole structure was homogeneous. One {{of the important}} ingredients of the mortar was a volcanic deposit found near Rome, known as pozzolana, which, when the concrete had set, not only made the concrete as solid as the rock itself, but {{to a certain extent}} neutralized <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vaults, which formed shells equivalent to that of a metal lid; the Romans, however, do not seem to have recognized the value of this pozzolana mixture, for they otherwise provided amply for the counteracting of any thrust which might exist by the erection of cross walls and buttresses. In the tepidaria of the Thermae and in the basilica of Constantine, in order to bring the thrust well within the walls, the main barrel vault of the hall was brought forward on each side and rested on detached columns, which constituted the principal architectural decoration. In cases where the cross vaults intersecting were not of the same span as those of the main vault, the arches were either stilted so that their soffits might be of the same height, or they formed smaller intersections in {{the lower part of the}} vault; in both of these cases, however, the intersections or groins were twisted, for which it was very difficult to form a centering, and, moreover, they were of disagreeable effect: though every attempt was made to mask this in the decoration of the vault by panels and reliefs modelled in stucco.|$|E
500|$|Ward's {{trial began}} at the Old Bailey on 28 July. He was charged with living off the {{earnings}} of Keeler, Rice-Davies and two other prostitutes, and with procuring women under 21 {{to have sex with}} other persons. [...] <b>The</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosecution's case related to Keeler and Rice-Davies, and turned on whether the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments they had given to Ward while living with him amounted to his living off their prostitution. Ward's approximate income at the time, from his practice and from his portraiture, had been around £5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time. In his speeches and examination of witnesses, the prosecuting counsel Mervyn Griffith-Jones portrayed Ward as representing [...] "the very depths of lechery and depravity". The judge, Sir Archie Marshall, was equally hostile, drawing particular {{attention to the fact that}} none of Ward's supposed society friends had been prepared to speak up for him. Towards the end of the trial, news came that Gordon's conviction for assault had been overturned; Marshall did not disclose to the jury that Gordon's witnesses had turned up and testified that Keeler, a key prosecution witness against Ward, had given false evidence at Gordon's trial.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, Roberts {{published}} Tito, Mihailović, and the Allies, 1941–1945 {{which included}} {{information about the}} German–Partisan negotiations of March 1943. The publishing of the book disturbed the Yugoslav government, which lodged {{a complaint with the}} US Department of State. <b>The</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yugoslav complaint was that the book equated the Partisans with the Chetniks. Roberts denied this, stating that his book did not equate the two or accept the Partisan mythology of the Partisans as a [...] "liberation movement" [...] or the Chetniks as [...] "traitorous collaborators". The book also identified Đilas as the main negotiator. In 1977, Đilas confirmed his involvement in his book Wartime, but stated that he would not have disclosed the details of the negotiations if it had not already been known through Roberts' book. In 1978, Tito admitted that the negotiations occurred, but characterised their purpose as [...] "solely to obtain German recognition of belligerent status for the Partisans". In 1985, after Tito's death, Leković was able to publish the results of his investigation that had started in 1967, in Martovski pregovori 1943 (The March Negotiations 1943). In 1989, Popović gave his version of events in Aleksandar Nenadović's Razgovori s Kočom (Conversations with Koča), followed by Velebit in Mira Šuvar's Vladimir Velebit: svjedok historije (Vladimir Velebit: Witness to History) in 2001, and in his own Tajne i zamke Drugog svjetskog rata (Secrets and Traps of the Second World War) the following year.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{have felt that}} the [...] "Mature" [...] rating is too broad; video game {{journalist}} Ben Kuchera noted that Halo 3—a sci-fi first-person shooter whose level of violence was, in his opinion, comparable to a Star Wars film, had received an M rating for [...] "Blood and Gore," [...] "Mild Language" [...] and [...] "Violence". He argued that [...] "having a game like Halo 3 share the same rating as Saints Row IV, which carries the 'Blood,' Intense Violence,' 'Partial Nudity,' 'Sexual Content,' 'Strong Language' and 'Use of Drugs' descriptors was always silly, and it weakened <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ratings system." [...] Likewise, {{he felt that the}} tone and content of the PG-13 rated film The Dark Knight was relatively harsher to children than that of the Saints Row series due to the latter's light-hearted tone, but still noted that [...] "as parents we know what's right and what isn't for our kids, and being aware of the content they consume is a large part of our job as parents." [...] , the most recent installment in the franchise, received a [...] "Teen" [...] rating instead of [...] "Mature". Microsoft Xbox division executive Aaron Greenberg argued that consumers had been [...] "surprised" [...] by the M rating on previous installments [...] "given the style of the game and the lack of real graphic violence and things like that", but that the [...] "Teen" [...] rating would theoretically enable the game to reach a broader audience of younger players.|$|E
