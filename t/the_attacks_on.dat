5|$|Following the 29 August raid, the British {{learned from}} Ultra signals {{intelligence}} that Tirpitz had not sustained any significant damage during Operation Goodwood. In public statements the Royal Navy {{claimed to have}} damaged or sunk 19 German warships during <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> Kaafjord, but did not report damage to Tirpitz.|$|E

5|$|Pope's notes call Cibber a hypocrite, and {{in general}} <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> Cibber are {{conducted}} in the notes added to the Dunciad, {{and not in the}} body of the poem. As hero of the Dunciad, Cibber merely watches the events of Book II, dreams Book III, and sleeps through Book IV.|$|E
50|$|The events between <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> van and <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} (approximately 30 minutes) {{were not}} captured on the leaked video footage. The military {{did not include}} <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> building in their report.|$|R
50|$|Two further thousand-bomber raids were {{conducted}} over Essen and Bremen, but neither so utterly shook both sides as {{the scale of}} the destruction at Cologne and Hamburg. The effects of the massive raids using a combination of blockbuster bombs (to blow off roofs) and incendiaries (to start fires in the exposed buildings) created firestorms in some cities. The most extreme examples of which were caused by Operation Gomorrah, <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Hamburg, (45,000 dead), <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Kassel (10,000 dead), <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Darmstadt (12,500 dead), <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Pforzheim (21,200 dead), <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Swinemuende (23,000 dead) and <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Dresden (25,000 dead).|$|R
50|$|During the Chesapeake {{campaign}} the 3rd Battalion {{participated in}} the Battle of Bladensburg, <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Washington, and <b>the</b> Battle of Baltimore. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Washington cost <b>the</b> Navy one man killed and six wounded.|$|R
5|$|The 17 {{ships in}} the Japanese carrier force that raided Darwin in 1942 sank nine ships and killed 251 people {{for the loss of}} four aircraft. A further 14 sailors and civilians were killed in the sinking of HMAS Patricia Cam and <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> Period and Islander in 1943 and 88 people were killed during the raid on Broome in 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had {{maintained}} <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> airfields in south-western England {{which they had}} started the previous day. On 12 August, most of the Kentish airfields had been attacked; and on 13 August, the Germans concentrated on the second line airfields south of London. The concentration on Detling and Eastchurch was a failure, as both were Coastal Command stations and bore no relation to Fighter Command. The Germans may have reasoned that if bases such as Manston, Hawkinge and Lympne were neutralised through <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> 12 August, then Fighter Command may have had to move onto these airfields. In fact, the bombing of 12 August had failed to knock out these strips, and Adlertag had failed to destroy or render Detling or Eastchurch nonoperational. Owing to poor intelligence, weather conditions, and RAF resistance, attacks on other targets had failed or been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> the Take Ichi convoy blunted the 32nd and 35th Divisions' {{fighting}} power. The 32nd Division's combat {{elements were}} reduced from nine to five infantry battalions and {{from four to}} {{one and a half}} artillery battalions. Only four of the six 35th Division infantry battalions which sailed in the convoy reached Halmahera and much of the division's artillery was lost.|$|E

5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were within range of escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy casualties attempting to attack factories further north in daylight. Still, <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> the southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that the Viet Cong still had the strength to continue <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it {{may not be enough to}} drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E
5|$|CeeCee Lyles {{was one of}} {{the flight}} attendants on board. In 2003, a statue of Lyles was {{unveiled}} in her hometown of Fort Pierce, Florida, which has since gained national recognition as one of the many monuments to <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> <b>On</b> August 9, 2007, a portion of U.S.219 in Somerset County, near the Flight 93 National Memorial, was co-signed as the Flight 93 Memorial Highway. At the National September 11 Memorial, the names of the 40 victims of Flight 93 are inscribed on Panels S-67 and S-68 at the South Pool.|$|E
2500|$|It {{emerged during}} the German trial of Hughes, McGuire, Hick and Harte that the AK47 assault rifle used to kill Major Dillon-Lee had also been used in <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Islanias. An AK47 was also used in <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Hazell.|$|R
50|$|Though {{eventually}} successful, <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fortifications of El Caney {{had proved}} to be of little real value. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> two strongly defended points at both El Caney and San Juan diluted the strength of American forces, resulting in delays and additional casualties.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 20th {{train was}} <b>the</b> only <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> a Holocaust train from Belgium during the war, {{as well as}} the only {{transport}} from Belgium to experience a mass breakout.|$|R
5|$|Dutthagamani's army {{attacked}} {{all four}} {{gates of the}} city simultaneously. He led the main assault on the southern gate with Nandimithra, Suranimala and the elephant Kandula, while <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> the northern and western gates were led by Bharana, Khanjadeva, Phussadeva and Labhiyavasabha. The eastern gate was attacked by Mahasona, Gothaimbara, Theraputthabhaya and Velusumana. The defenders of the eastern gates were routed by Velusumana after a cavalry attack, and Elara's forces withdrew into the city.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the {{corporate}} {{administrator for the}} RDA mining operation. While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary, and the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.|$|E
5|$|Hood's {{withdrawal}} to Barbados {{had left}} St Lucia exposed, and on 10May, the whole French fleet, less two ships-of-the-line landed 1200 troops at Gros Islet, a village {{at the northern}} end of the island. On the same day, the remaining two ships from the French fleet and 1300 troops sailed for Tobago. The British were able to repel <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> St Lucia so deGrasse decided to reinforce his attack on Tobago, diverting his fleet there on 25May and sending 3000 more troops from Martinique.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, a {{delegation}} of Supreme Council officers met with President Calvin Coolidge to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico during its revolution, which had considered the Church part of a corrupt establishment to be overthrown. The Order subsequently launched a $1 million campaign to educate Americans about <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> Catholics and the Church in the Cristero War. Twenty-five martyrs from the conflict would eventually be canonized, including six knights.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Rodríguez had {{returned}} to Chile before the crossing, and began a guerrilla war in Santiago de Chile against the royalists, {{in support of the}} upcoming army. He was supported in the south {{of the city and the}} countryside. The strategy was to occupy nearby villages, seize the royalists' weapons and flee. <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> Melipilla and San Fernando, and a failed one at Curicó, demoralized the royalists.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kondo ordered Abe's Vanguard {{force to}} race ahead {{to try to}} {{intercept}} and engage the U.S. warships. Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at maximum speed so that Junyōs aircraft could join in <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> the U.S. ships. At 08:10, Shōkaku launched a second wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 19 dive bombers and eight Zeros, and Zuikaku launched 16 torpedo bombers at 08:40. Thus, by 09:10 the Japanese had 110 aircraft {{on the way to}} attack the U.S. carriers.|$|E
50|$|After the Six-Day War, the {{activity}} in northern Israel where Golani was based was mostly limited to raids against fedayeen (guerrilla) bases in Jordan, Lebanon and the West Bank (now under Israeli control). The objectives of these raids was {{to undermine the}} fedayeen bases {{in order to prevent}} <b>attacks</b> against Israelis. <b>The</b> three main raids against Jordan during this period were: <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> village Wadi al-Yabis across the river from Tirat Tzvi; <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cones Position across from Ashdot Ya'akov; and <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jordanian Ghor canal and defensive line.|$|R

5|$|Task Group 111.2 sailed from Manus Island on 12 June. While {{en route}} to Truk, its orders were broadened to also include a cruiser {{bombardment}} of Japanese positions at Truk. This change was made as the cruisers {{were expected to be}} used against shore targets during future operations. In preparation for these bombardments, the Task Group conducted gunnery exercises during its voyage north. Ahead of <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> Truk, a US Navy submarine took up position near the atoll to rescue any British airmen who crashed into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{complicated}} in execution, requiring {{coordination of}} air and naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, Taxable {{did not appear to}} have the desired effect and failed to elicit any significant response from the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> the bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of RAF Bomber Command, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific response from the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the adverse conditions and complexity of the operations contributed to the limited enemy response.|$|E
5|$|The Allied bombing {{campaign}} {{was one of}} the main factors which influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender in mid-August 1945. However, there has been a long-running debate over the morality of <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> Japanese cities, and the use of atomic weapons is particularly controversial. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from the raids is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. There are a number of other estimates of total fatalities, however, which range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, the raids contributed to a large decline in industrial production.|$|E
