5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous {{estimates of the}} tsunami hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the risk to the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events {{along the coast of}} Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative {{to the size of the}} tsunami that followed.|$|E

They are made of many illegal constructions not connected to electricity and water supply, which are passed from a generation to the other. Topaana, located close to the Old Bazaar, is a very old area: it was first mentioned as a Roma neighbourhood {{in the beginning of}} the 14th century. It has between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. Šuto Orizari, located on the northern edge of the city, is a municipality of its own, with Romani as its local official language. It was developed after the 1963 earthquake to accommodate Roma who had lost their house.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} often {{confused}} with the copperhead, A. contortrix. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> juveniles, but differences exist. A. piscivorus has broad, dark stripes {{on the sides of}} its head that extend back from the eye, whereas A. contortrix has only a thin, dark line that divides the pale supralabials from the somewhat darker color of the head. The watersnakes of the genus Nerodia are also similar in appearance, being thick-bodied with large heads, but they have round pupils, no loreal pit, a single anal plate, subcaudal scales that are divided throughout, and a distinctive overall color pattern.|$|E

25|$|Different taekwondo {{styles and}} {{associations}} (ATA, ITF, GTF, WT, etc.) use different taekwondo forms.

25|$|Italy has {{the richest}} {{concentration}} of Late Antique and medieval mosaics in the world.

25|$|Pottery in Metepec and {{the rest}} of the Toluca Valley began in the pre Hispanic period during which both {{utilitarian}} and decorative/ritual items were made. Pottery in the Valley of Toluca shows strong Nahua influence, especially Aztec. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> urns, braziers, cups and plates.

25|$|The correlatives, {{although}} clearly cognate with European languages (for example, kiel, tiel with French quel (which), tel (such); ĉiu with Italian ciascun (each), and -es {{with the}} German genitive -es, etc.), have been analogically leveled {{to the point}} that they are often given as examples of Esperanto innovations. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the indefinite forms like io (something), which were devised by iconically removing the consonant of the ki- and ti- forms. Likewise, the restriction of the Italian and Greek masculine noun and adjective ending -o to nouns, and the feminine noun and adjective ending -a to adjectives and the article la, is an Esperanto innovation using existing forms.|$|E
25|$|Current {{biological}} {{research has}} suggested that testosterone differences can affect sexual orientation, gender identity, and personality. For example, girls with increased prenatal testosterone levels, due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), show more male-typed behaviors than the average female. This may cause a decrease in empathy levels, which is proven to be higher in the average women than men, and an increase in physical aggression, typically higher in men than women. Furthermore, multiple twin studies have also shown that homosexual traits displayed greater congruence in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins displaying genetic contributions. Further studies reveal that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> girls' gender-typed values. Similarly, other studies have summarized that the prevalence of cross-gender behavior a highly heritable trait where MZ twins display the same cross-gender behaviors more so than DZ twins.|$|E
25|$|To {{combat the}} decline of its pottery making traditions, {{municipal}} and state authorities have implemented a number of measures. Metepec has acknowledged the importance of its pottery tradition by erection monumental clay sculptures such as trees of life, fountains and more on various plazas and streets. The municipal government created a handcraft market in the town in 1998 to bring together families that make baskets, leather goods, glass and more as well as pottery. One effort by the State of Mexico to promote the craft has been to install monumental Trees of Life in each of Mexico’s embassies worldwide. The Metepec government works to promote the municipality’s pottery and to ensure buyers obtain authentic pieces. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> Trees of Life. Tree of life sculptures of Metepec now have a collective registered trademark, one of only four in Mexico. This means that artisans of Metepec may now add special hologram decals and registration numbers to their work to prove authenticity.|$|E
