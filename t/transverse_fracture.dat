40|$|Abstract—Volume {{fracturing}} {{aiming to}} induce a complicated fracture network {{is a key}} measure to acquire commercial productivity in tight formation where the selection of optimal cluster spacing is important and essential. Therefore，most numerical simulation is mainly used to obtain the optimal cluster spacing, but not often considered with the effect from <b>transverse</b> <b>fractures</b> interference. Based on a new analytical solution methodology for multiple equally spaced stage/cluster <b>transverse</b> <b>fractures,</b> this paper presents a simple and efficient approach added the interference (like flow rate interference, stiffness interference, fluid loss interference) among multiple <b>transverse</b> <b>fractures</b> to acquire the optimal cluster spacing {{with the goal of}} maximizing the oil production. Meanwhile, it results that adequate big cluster spacing is not good to create complex fracture network and much less one easily results in strong effect on production due to fractures interference. The paper provides references for optimizing volume fracturing design and planning rational development strategies in this area.

Cowan missed Stevenage's 4-2 win over Rochdale on 3 September due to a delay in confirming his international clearance. After two weeks of waiting, {{it was announced that}} international clearance was granted for Cowan on 13 September 2011, and that his undisclosed five-figure fee transfer had been completed. Cowan suffered a number of [...] "niggling injuries" [...] that prevented him from making any first-team appearances for Stevenage during his first two months with the club, although the player was an unused substitute on four separate occasions. He finally made his first-team debut on 17 December 2011, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in a 2-1 home victory against Tranmere Rovers. Cowan made his first start in Stevenage's next match, playing 57 minutes in a 6-1 away victory at Colchester United. During the game, Cowan was pivotal in the first two goals, linking up well with Stevenage striker Chris Beardsley on both occasions. He scored four of Stevenage's five goals in the club's 5-0 Herts Senior Cup victory over Barnet on 31 January 2012, all of which were scored {{in the first half of}} the match.

40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness at crack initiation were determined for bovine cortical bone under tension (mode I), shear (mode II), and tear (mode III). A total of 140 compact tension specimens, compact shear specimens and triple pantleg (TP) specimens {{were used to}} measure {{fracture toughness}} under tension, shear, and tear, respectively. Multiple-sample compliance method was utilized to measure the critical strain energy release rate (G(c)) at the a/W= 0. 55 (crack length, a, to specimen width, W, ratio). The critical stress intensity factor (K(c)) was also calculates from the critical loading (P(c)) of the specimens at the a/W= 0. 55. The effect of the anisotropy of bone on its resistance to crack initiation under shear and tear loading was investigated as well. Fracture toughness of bone with precrack orientations parallel (designed as longitudinal fracture) and Vertical (designed as <b>transverse</b> <b>fracture)</b> to the longitudinal axis of bone were compared. In longitudinal fracture, the critical strain energy release rate (G(c)) of cortical bone under tension, shear, and tear was 644 +/- 102, 2430 +/- 836, and 1723 +/- 486 N/m, respectively. In <b>transverse</b> <b>fracture,</b> the critical strain energy release rate (G(c)) of cortical bone under tension, shear, and tear was 1374 +/- 183, 4710 +/- 1284, and 4016 +/- 948 N/m, respectively. An unpaired t-test analysis demonstrated that the crack initiation fracture toughness of bone under shear and tear loading were significantly greater than that under tensile loading in both longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>fracture</b> (P < 0. 0001 for all). Our results also suggest that cortical bone has been ''designed'' to prevent crack initiation in <b>transverse</b> <b>fracture</b> under tension, shear, and tear. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A.

5000|$|Fractures of the humerus are {{classified}} {{based on the}} location of the fracture and then by the type of fracture. There are three locations that humerus fractures occur: at the proximal location, which is the top of the humerus near the shoulder, in the middle, which is at the shaft of the humerus, and the distal location, which is the bottom of the humerus near the elbow. Proximal fractures {{are classified}} into one of four types of fractures based on the displacement of the greater tubercle, the lesser tubercle, the surgical neck, and the anatomical neck, which are the four parts of the proximal humerus, with fracture displacement being defined as at least one centimeter of separation or an angulation greater than 45 degrees. One-part fractures involve no displacement of any parts of the humerus, two-part fractures have one part displaced relative to the other three; three-part fractures have two displaced fragments, and four-part fractures have all fragments displaced from each other. Fractures of the humerus shaft are subdivided into <b>transverse</b> <b>fractures,</b> spiral fractures, [...] "butterfly" [...] fractures, which are a combination of <b>transverse</b> and spiral <b>fractures,</b> and pathological fractures, which are fractures caused by medical conditions. Distal fractures are split between supracondylar <b>fractures,</b> which are <b>transverse</b> <b>fractures</b> above the two condyles {{at the bottom of the}} humerus, and intercondylar fractures, which involve a T- or Y-shaped fracture that splits the condyles.|$|R

40|$|The Hubbert and Willis (1957) [1] {{fracture}} criterion {{has been}} widely adopted to predict longitudinal fracture initiation in vertical or horizontal wellbores.

It is shown in this paper that the axial stress {{is not a good}} predictor of <b>transverse</b> <b>fracture</b> initiation, because it remains constant during hydraulic pressurization. The magnitude of the most tensile principal stress in the wellbore wall should always be compared with the tensile strength of the rock to predict hydraulic fracture initiation based on elastic theory.

40|$|Background: Open {{reduction}} and internal fixation with tension band wire {{is the standard}} treatment for displaced <b>transverse</b> patellar <b>fractures.</b> Recently, some minimally invasive techniques have been proposed as possible alternative methods. This retrospective study compared a newly reported percutaneous osteosynthesis with conventional open method {{for the treatment of}} displaced <b>transverse</b> patellar <b>fractures.</b> Methods: The minimally invasive technique was performed by percutaneous osteosynthesis with modified Carpenter’s (POMC) technique, using figure-eight wiring through two-paired cannulated screws under the control of arthroscopy and fluoroscopy. The conventional open surgery was performed with open modified anterior tension band (OMATB) technique. Totally 60 displaced <b>transverse</b> <b>fractures</b> were included in our study. Twenty were treated with percutaneous technique and 40 with open method. Outcome assessment included analysis of radiographic images, range of motion, Lysholm scores, complications, and reoperations. Results: Mean follow-up was 37. 3 months. Comparison of POMC and OMATB groups showed statistically significant results as follows: shorter surgical time, 70. 4  ±  12. 5 minutes for POMC group; greater degrees of flexion, 140. 4  ±  6. 1 for POMC group; better total range of motion, 139. 6  ±  8. 2 for POMC group; higher Lysholm scores, 93. 6  ±  3. 1 for POMC group. Frequencies of total complications and reoperations were significantly lower in POMC group. Conclusion: POMC method was a reproducibly reliable method, offering better functional outcome, lower incidence of complications, and reoperations, as compared with standard OMATB group for <b>transverse</b> patellar <b>fractures.</b> Nevertheless, it is not recommended for severely comminuted fractures...|$|R

Twelve synthetic clavicles with simulated midshaft <b>transverse</b> <b>fractures</b> were repaired with a 3. 5 -mm locking reconstruction plate in the anteroinferior or the superior position. The clavicles were randomly assigned to 2 groups (6 per group). Each repaired clavicle was tested in cantilever bending by using the universal testing machine. The maximal load and the displacement of the specimens at a load of 40 N were recorded for each group. Results. The anteroinferior plating osteosynthesis with a 3. 5 -mm locking reconstruction plate could bear an average maximal load of 183. 3 N (SD, 11. 3); the corresponding load for the superior plating osteosynthesis with the identical implants was 444. 8 N (SD, 102. 3), and the mean displacement was 1. 5 mm (SD, 0. 5) and 0. 7 mm (SD, 0. 2), respectively.
