2500|$|On December 2, 2013, Christie {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that Democrats were just playing {{politics}} by holding hearings into lane closures. [...] "Just because [...] John Wisniewski is obsessed with this, and [...] Loretta Weinberg, it just shows that <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> nothing to do," [...] Christie said. Christie later credited the e-mail documents subpoenaed by the hearings as the first information he had that his staff was involved. When reporter Matt Katz asked, [...] "Governor, did you {{have anything to do with}} these lane closures in September outside the GW Bridge? Have you spoken to--" [...] Christie dismissively joked [...] "I worked the cones, actually, Matt. Unbeknownst to everybody I was actually the guy out there. I was in overalls and a hat. You really are not serious with that question." ...|$|E
2500|$|From October 5–7, 2006, the Ressikan flute {{was one of}} {{the items}} up for bid at the Christie's {{official}} studio auction of Star Trek memorabilia. The prop flute, which cannot actually be played, was originally estimated to have a sale price of US$300. Auction directors admitted that their estimates for many items did not [...] "factor in that emotional fury generated around this kind of material". The estimate was later raised to $800–$1,200 on Christie's web site. In {{the days leading up to}} the auction, Denise Okuda, former Trek scenic artist and video supervisor, as well as co-writer of the auction catalog, said: [...] "That's the item people say <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to have, because it's so iconic to a much-beloved episode." [...] The final bid for the flute at the auction was US$40,000. Including the additional 20% fee Christie's collected on all items from the winning bidder, the total price for the flute was $48,000.|$|E

2500|$|Initial {{reaction}} to the album from music critics was highly favorable. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "Naturally, {{there is quite a}} bit of roiling darkness here -- they're Cure-loving metalheads, it's in their blood -- but there's shade and light, control of texture, with the band deepening rather than expanding." [...] Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press also awarded the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "Unlike their alleged 'peers' (do <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> any?), Deftones learned years ago that a whisper can be more terrifying than a scream and power isn't always about BPMs and downstrokes per minute." [...] He also added that Diamond Eyes [...] "belongs in a pantheon of amazing albums born from tragedy". BBC writer Mike Diver was also impressed, and opined that the album [...] "knocks every pretender to the band's throne into the middle of next week". He praised the band for playing to their strengths, and summarized: [...] "Eros is reportedly their excursion into weirdness, while this is a statement of consolidation, a neatly segued set that finds Deftones playing to their well-established strengths." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{hospitality}} of England {{has become}} {{famous in the}} world, and, I think, with reason.

6000|$|For certain purposes, {{literary}} productions {{through all}} the recorded ages may be roughly divided into two classes. The first consisting of only a score or two, perhaps less, of typical, primal, representative works, different from any before, and embodying in themselves their own main laws and reasons for being. Then the second class, books and writings innumerable, incessant--to be briefly described as radiations or offshoots, or more or less imitations of the first. The works of the first class, as said, have their own laws, and may indeed be described as making those laws, and amenable only to them. The sharp warning of Margaret Fuller, unquell'd for thirty years, yet sounds in the air: [...] "It does not follow that because the United States print and read more books, magazines, and newspapers than {{all the rest of}} the world, that <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>have,</b> therefore, a literature." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{person who}} planned {{the murder of}} Commodus is still a debated topic. Some sources name Pertinax as the mastermind of the {{assassination}} because he obtained imperial rule once Commodus was killed.

60|$|A {{mistake that}} proved {{fortunate}} for Billy Byrne caused the penitentiary authorities to expect {{him and his}} guard by a later train, so no suspicion was aroused when they failed to come upon the train <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> started upon.

6000|$|The {{books for}} young people say {{a great deal about}} the {{selection}} of Friends; it is because <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> nothing to say about Friends. They mean associates and confidants merely. [...] "Know that the contrariety of foe and Friend proceeds from God." [...] Friendship takes place between those who have an affinity for one another, and is a perfectly natural and inevitable result. No professions nor advances will avail. Even speech, at first, necessarily has nothing to do with it; but it follows after silence, as the buds in the graft do not put forth into leaves till long after the graft has taken. It is a drama in which the parties have no part to act. We are all Mussulmen and fatalists in this respect. Impatient and uncertain lovers think that they must say or do something kind whenever they meet; they must never be cold. But they who are Friends do not do what they think they must, but what they must. Even their Friendship is to some extent but a sublime phenomenon to them.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the main}} I adhere to my {{positions}} in [...] "Democratic Vistas," [...] {{and especially to}} my summing-up of American literature as far as to-day is concern'd. In Scientism, the Medical Profession, Practical Inventions, and Journalism, the United States have press'd forward to the glorious front rank of advanced civilized lands, as also in the popular dissemination of printed matter (of a superficial nature perhaps, but that is an indispensable preparatory stage,) and have gone in common education, so-call'd, far beyond any other land or age. Yet the high-pitch'd taunt of Margaret Fuller, forty years ago, still sounds in the air: [...] "It does not follow, because the United States print and read more books, magazines, and newspapers than {{all the rest of}} the world, that <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> therefore a literature." [...] For perhaps it is not alone the free schools and newspapers, nor railroads and factories, nor all the iron, cotton, wheat, pork, and petroleum, nor the gold and silver, nor the surplus of a hundred or several hundred millions, nor the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, nor the last national census, that can put this Commonweal high or highest on the cosmical scale of history. Something else is indispensable. All that record is lofty, but there is a loftier.|$|E
6000|$|Half {{the controversies}} about {{the freedom of}} the will would have had no existence, if this pithy {{paragraph}} had been well pondered by those who oppose the doctrine of necessity. For they rest upon the absurd presumption that the proposition, [...] "I can do as I like," [...] is contradictory to the doctrine of necessity. The answer is; nobody doubts that, at any rate within certain limits, you can do as you like. But what determines your likings and dislikings? Did you make your own constitution? Is it your contrivance that one thing is pleasant and another is painful? And even if it were, why did you prefer to make it after the one fashion rather than the other? The passionate assertion of the consciousness of their freedom, which is the favourite refuge of the opponents of the doctrine of necessity, is mere futility, for nobody denies it. What <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to do, if they would upset the necessarian argument, is to prove that they are free to associate any emotion whatever with any idea whatever; to like pain as much as pleasure; vice as much as virtue; in short, to prove, that, whatever may be the fixity of order of the universe of things, that of thought is given over to chance.|$|E

60|$|In {{saying that}} the time-order which events seem to have {{is the same as}} the time-order which <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>have,</b> it is {{necessary}} to guard against a possible misunderstanding. It must not be supposed that the various states of different physical objects have the same time-order as the sense-data which constitute the perceptions of those objects. Considered as physical objects, the thunder and lightning are simultaneous; that is to say, the lightning is simultaneous with the disturbance of the air in the place where the disturbance begins, namely, where the lightning is. But the sense-datum which we call hearing the thunder does not take place until the disturbance of the air has travelled as far as to where we are. Similarly, it takes about eight minutes for the sun's light to reach us; thus, when we see the sun we are seeing the sun of eight minutes ago. So far as our sense-data afford evidence as to the physical sun they afford evidence as to the physical sun of eight minutes ago; if the physical sun had ceased to exist within the last eight minutes, that would make no difference to the sense-data which we call 'seeing the sun'. This affords a fresh illustration of the necessity of distinguishing between sense-data and physical objects.|$|E
6000|$|But {{though it}} is quite true that all those groups we call species may, {{according}} to the known laws of reproduction, have descended from a single stock, and {{though it is}} very likely <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> done so, yet this conclusion rests on deduction and can hardly hope to establish itself upon a basis of observation. And the primitiveness of the supposed single stock, which, after all, is the essential part of the matter, is not only a hypothesis, but one which has not a shadow of foundation, if by [...] "primitive" [...] be meant [...] "independent of any other living being." [...] A scientific definition, of which an unwarrantable hypothesis forms an essential part, carries its condemnation within itself; but even supposing such a definition were, in form, tenable, the physiologist who should attempt to apply it in Nature would soon find himself involved in great, if not inextricable difficulties. As we have said, it is indubitable that offspring tend to resemble the parental organism, but it is equally true that the similarity attained never amounts to identity, either in form or in structure. There is always a certain amount of deviation, not only from the precise characters of a single parent, but when, as in most animals and many plants, the sexes are lodged in distinct individuals, from an exact mean between the two parents. And indeed, on general principles, this slight deviation seems as intelligible as the general similarity, if we reflect how complex the co-operating [...] "bundles of forces" [...] are, and how improbable it is that, in any case, their true resultant shall coincide with any mean between the more obvious characters of the two parents. Whatever be its cause, however, the co-existence of this tendency to minor variation with the tendency to general similarity, is of vast importance in its bearing {{on the question of the}} origin of species.|$|E
6000|$|Why {{care for}} these dead bodies? <b>They</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> no friends but the worms or fishes. Their owners {{were coming to}} the New World, as Columbus and the Pilgrims did,--they were {{within a mile of}} its shores; but, before they could reach it, they emigrated to a newer world than ever Columbus dreamed of, yet one of whose {{existence}} we believe that there is far more universal and convincing evidence--though it has not yet been discovered by science--than Columbus had of this; not merely mariners' tales and some paltry drift-wood and sea-weed, but a continual drift and instinct to all our shores. I saw their empty hulks that came to land; but they themselves, meanwhile, were cast upon some shore yet further west, toward which we are all tending, and which we shall reach at last, it may be through storm and darkness, as they did. No doubt, we have reason to thank God that they have not been [...] "shipwrecked into life again." [...] The mariner who makes the safest port in Heaven, perchance, seems to his friends on earth to be shipwrecked, for they deem Boston Harbor the better place; though perhaps invisible to them, a skillful pilot comes to meet him, and the fairest and balmiest gales blow off that coast, his good ship makes the land in halcyon days, and he kisses the shore in rapture there, while his old hulk tosses in the surf here. It is hard to part with one's body, but, no doubt, it is easy enough to do without it when once it is gone. All their plans and hopes burst like a bubble! Infants by the score dashed on the rocks by the enraged Atlantic Ocean! No, no! If the St. John did not make her port here, she has been telegraphed there. The strongest wind cannot stagger a Spirit; it is a Spirit's breath. A just man's purpose cannot be split on any Grampus or material rock, but itself will split rocks till it succeeds.|$|E
