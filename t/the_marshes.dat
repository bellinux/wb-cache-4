5|$|Salah {{presented}} {{his plan to}} Maj. Gen. Khalid {{on the morning of}} October 13. Khalid authorized the attack and informed Second Army. The 103rd Sa'iqa Battalion spent the night of October 12/13 and October 14 preparing for the attack; reconnoitering the area around the fort by means of patrol groups and aerial photographs, as well as studying routes of approach through <b>the</b> <b>marshes.</b> The attacking forces began moving to their positions at 19:00 on October 14, taking advantage of the darkness. The secondary attack force took up position east of Port Fouad while the main force reached its position east of the fort through <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> in four waves. The march was extremely difficult to cross {{due to the nature of}} the terrain and the high concentration of salt, which meant the soldiers had to traverse <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> barefoot. Towards midnight, the Egyptians began harassing the fort's garrison with artillery fire using a range of calibers, along with Katyusha rockets launched from a naval vessel.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians, {{under heavy}} and {{effective}} {{fire from the}} Israelis inside the bunkers, ceased entering the fort. The Sa'iqa company to the east, under concentrated Israeli tank fire and aerial bombardment, was finally overwhelmed by the Israeli reinforcements, which proceeded towards the fort, opening fire on the main force. Consequently, all Egyptian forces east of the fort attempted to retreat through <b>the</b> <b>marshes.</b> The Israelis attempted to hamper the retreat by dropping smoke capsules over the area from four A-4 Skyhawks. The lack of visibility caused injuries as men tripped and were trampled during the retreat through <b>the</b> <b>marshes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Saline di Margherita di Savoia is a salt <b>marsh</b> in <b>the</b> {{province}} of Foggia in Apulia. <b>The</b> <b>marsh</b> is on <b>the</b> coast of Italy bordering the Gulf of Manfredonia in the Adriatic Sea. <b>The</b> <b>marsh</b> consists of several canals running longitudinally and transversely {{relative to the}} coast. Two channels connect <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> to <b>the</b> Carapelle River.

It {{is clear}} from Equation 5 that {{concentration}} and hence deposition rate decrease along the flow path on <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> platform and therefore with distance from <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> edge (e.g., French et al. 1995; Leonard 1997; Reed et al. 1999; Temmerman et al. 2003). In fact the flow path on <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> platform often coincides with the direction perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> edge (Rinaldo et al. 1999; Marani et al. 2003). Peak flow velocities on <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> surface tend to be small and do not vary much with tidal elevation or location on <b>the</b> <b>marsh.</b> Therefore settling velocity and flow depth are the primary controls of {{how much of the}} sediment entering <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> is deposited.|$|R

5|$|Adar is {{predominantly}} inhabited by the Dinka people, who mainly cultivate crops and raise cattle.

5|$|Behind the sea wall, <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> were drained {{after the}} war, and reverted to farmland, but {{the bank was}} {{breached}} in the North Sea flood of 1953, returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by sea aster.

5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested that the area continued to be exploited. It {{is easy to see}} why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point, {{like most}} of the {{northern}} part of <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> in this area, is part of the parish of Cley next the Sea. The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne. It is approximately 6.4km (4mi) long, and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20m (65ft) in width and up to 10m (33feet) high. It has been estimated that there are 2.3millionm3 (82millionft3) of shingle in the spit, 97per cent of which is derived from flint.|$|E

5|$|Bridgwater is {{mentioned}} {{both in the}} Domesday Book and in the earlier Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dating from around 800, owing its origin as a trade centre to its position {{at the mouth of}} the chief river in Somerset.

In a legend of Alfred the Great, he burnt some cakes while hiding in <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> of Athelney near Bridgwater, after the Danish invasion in 875, while in 878 the major engagement of the Battle of Cynwit may have been at nearby Cannington.|$|E
5|$|During the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, Jaywick was flooded, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 35 people. Since then, sea defences have been put in place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a £9.4million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest risk of flooding in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase the risk to human life in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The area {{would be the first to}} be hit by floods in the event of a tidal surge over <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> surrounding St Osyth.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of <b>the</b> <b>marshes,</b> and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found.

5|$|Historically, the East End {{is arguably}} conterminous with the Manor of Stepney. This manor {{was held by}} the Bishop of London, in {{compensation}} for his duties in maintaining and garrisoning the Tower of London. Further ecclesiastic holdings came about from the need to enclose <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> and create flood defences along the Thames. Edward VI passed the land to the Wentworth family, and thence to their descendants, the Earls of Cleveland. The ecclesiastic system of copyhold, whereby land was leased to tenants for terms as short as seven years, prevailed throughout the manor. This severely limited scope for improvement {{of the land and}} new building until the estate was broken up in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili caused great {{environmental}} damage to <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> and barrier islands in Louisiana. Huge fish kills {{were observed in}} marshes near the landfall point, and in the Atchafalaya Swamp. The barrier islands {{to the east of}} the landfall point, those subjected to the highest surge, were severely eroded. Sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes, burying vegetation. The freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge, some of them completely destroyed. The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico, which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, 1832, {{between two}} attacks that {{occurred}} at Fort Blue Mounds, {{a party of}} Native Americans crossed over from {{the west side of}} the Mississippi River near Galena. The group continued up the Apple River, looting and stealing horses along the way, including an incident about ¾ of the way up the Apple River in which about a dozen horses were stolen from a small stockade. The Sauk raiding parties were mostly stealing food and supplies for Black Hawk's band of 1,000 men, women and children which were camped in <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> of southwestern Wisconsin. A similar incident a few days later, though without injury or death, prompted a reaction from the white militia in the area.|$|E
