40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{time-dependent}} behavior of <b>the</b> <b>director</b> following <b>the</b> step-rotation of a nematic sample subject to a static magnetic field. <b>The</b> <b>director</b> orientation has been monitored using ESR spectroscopy, and we have developed a model-independent analysis of the spectra to yield the distribution function for <b>the</b> <b>director</b> {{with respect to the}} magnetic field. This reveals that immediately following <b>the</b> step-rotation <b>the</b> <b>director</b> is uniformly aligned parallel to the field and then adopts a range of orientations before returning to a state of uniform alignment with <b>the</b> <b>director</b> at <b>the</b> step-rotation angle to the field. This unusual behavior of <b>the</b> <b>director</b> is compared with the predictions of nematodynamic theory by employing an exact treatment of the Leslie-Ericksen equations to calculate the time and space dependence of <b>the</b> <b>director</b> orientation...|$|R
