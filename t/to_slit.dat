5|$|October 3, 2001: At {{approximately}} 4:15a.m. local time, a passenger, Damir Igric, assaulted {{the driver}} of his bus, attempting <b>to</b> <b>slit</b> his throat, and causing the bus to crash near Manchester, Tennessee, killing Igric himself and five other passengers and injuring 32 others. Since the incident occurred {{three weeks after the}} September 11 terrorist attacks, Greyhound temporarily suspended all schedules as soon as the company learned of the incident for fear that it may have been part of a larger co-ordinated attack. After investigation by the company and the FBI, it was confirmed that Igric had acted alone and service resumed later that afternoon. After the incident, Greyhound bus stations increased security, though not nearly to the same level as airports or train stations.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted <b>to</b> <b>slit</b> his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

30|$|When {{there are}} slits, the slits change {{the path of}} air flow and mass flow rate, and change the {{temperature}} of microclimate. The air in {{the back side of}} the cylinder flowed through lower-back <b>slit</b> <b>to</b> the outside, followed by, the mid-back and shoulder slits. Most of the air in the back side flowed to the lower-back slit; the other air that didn’t flow <b>to</b> the lower-back <b>slit</b> moved <b>to</b> the mid-back <b>slit.</b> <b>To</b> compare each <b>slit,</b> the flow rate was in the order of lower-back slits (39.17 %)[*]>[*]mid back slit (30.90 %)[*]>[*]shoulder slits (29.93 %) (Table  3). Even though the low back slits have the same size <b>to</b> the shoulder <b>slit,</b> the air flow was about 10 % higher. This explains that the air flow is higher when the openness is near to the inlet. Yoo and Kim (1996) and Chu (2000) showed that ventilation rate was affected by the distance from the opening; the shorter the distance from the opening, the more robust the ventilation effect. Shoulder slits were almost same <b>to</b> the mid-back <b>slit</b> even though the slits are away from the inlet. This is due to the air that comes from the front; the heated air that goes up to the neck and part of the air flows <b>to</b> the <b>slit</b> at the back.|$|R

When he succeeds, taking her virginity, both of them find out, leaving Ivy upset with her mother.

25|$|In {{the seventh}} and final book, Hermione accompanies Harry on his quest to destroy Voldemort's {{remaining}} Horcruxes. Before leaving on the quest, she helps {{ensure the safety of}} her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, making them think they are Wendell and Monica Wilkins, whose lifetime ambition is to move to Australia. She inherits Dumbledore's personal copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which allows her to decipher some of the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so she is able to fill the infinite depths of the bag with materials they will need. Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, although the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are captured by Snatchers, who are on the hunt for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring his face with a Stinging Jinx. She also attempts to pass herself off as former Hogwarts student Penelope Clearwater and a half-blood to avoid persecution, but is later recognised and taken to Malfoy Manor where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her with the Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Even under torture, Hermione is able to use her quick thinking to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others are able to escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens <b>to</b> <b>slit</b> Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.|$|E

When Scott sedated Lamb and questioned him on the latter incident, the boy said he had just been trying to annoy the guard on duty. Scott once again noted his concern that Lamb was developing a hypomanic condition, a mania of low intensity, and on 18 March committed him to Kingston Psychiatric Hospital for a month. Scott wrote in his report to the hospital that he was not sure whether Lamb's condition was genuine or whether he was just putting on an act.|$|E

Mrs. Paddock takes her bracelet and uses it as part of a spell that causes Shannon <b>to</b> <b>slit</b> her wrists. When Ausbury learns that the other faculty members plan to use Shannon as a scapegoat, he admits the sect's existence to Mulder.
