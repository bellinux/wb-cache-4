2500|$|The final part of Isac's {{career was}} marked by the {{politicization}} of his writing, in line with Socialist Realism and its Romanian literary avatar. His poetry pieces for Veac Nou are seen by academic Letiţia Constantin as evidence that Isac had a satisfactory political background from the communist point of view. Constantin describes them as agitprop pieces, stylistically [...] "pastiches" [...] of Soviet poetry. The importance Isac had for the new literary mainstream, shaped in the 1950s by censorship and waves of political repression, was underlined by communist poet Dan Deşliu in a 1956 report for the Writers' Union of Romania: [...] "after World War I {{and especially in the}} period of our country's fascization, [...] the flame of poetry continued to burn, lighting the way of <b>tomorrow.</b> <b>With</b> different intensities, its rays are the creation of poets who have long since entered Romanian literary history, such as: G. Topîrceanu, A. Toma, Emil Isac, G. Bacovia or maestro Tudor Arghezi, whom we presently take joy in counting among the active members in our ranks".|$|E

He was like a professor to me. What education I have, I owe to him.” [...] Haggard said he was driven by a desire to play guitar and have total knowledge of it.
