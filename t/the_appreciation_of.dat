5|$|Argentina {{fell into}} a deep {{recession}} {{in the second half of}} 1998, triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, <b>the</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> the US dollar, to which the peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E

5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check <b>the</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> its currency, must work within the {{constraints}} of the prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E

Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space, a 2015 biography of the astronaut by Lynn Sherr, discussed Ride's attendance at the 2009 White House Astronomy Night and commented that she enjoyed speaking with youngsters about the possibility of humans visiting Mars in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposition}} of Rodrigo's body became {{a subject of}} dispute. A possible cremation and transport of the ashes to the Córdoba province was denied by judicial authorities in case a future autopsy was needed. The idea of a burial at the Lanús Municipal Cemetery was rejected by his mother due to concerns about vandalism. Instead, she decided to place the body in Las Praderas Cemetery in Monte Grande. Since the investigation into Bueno's death was still open and further tests might be performed, his body {{was placed in a}} container by the Justice Ministry. In 2005, five years after his death, the case was closed and the burial was authorized. The body was placed in a marble mausoleum. His mother, manager and friends attended a memorial service where they placed a trophy over the marble grave, symbolizing <b>the</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> his relatives, fans and friends.|$|E

Thus it is the structure of the organization rather than the employees, alone, which holds the key to improving the quality of output.|$|E

40|$|While it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that music evokes moods, there is disagreement over whether music-induced moods are relevant to <b>the</b> aesthetic <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> music as such. The arguments against the aesthetic relevance of music-induced moods are: (1) moods cannot be intentionally directed at the music and (2) music-induced moods are highly subjective experiences {{and are therefore a}} kind of mind-wandering. This paper presents a novel account of musical moods that avoids these objections. It is correct to say that a listener’s entire mood is not relevant to <b>the</b> aesthetic <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> music. However, <b>the</b> experience of mood consists of having different feelings. Music induces feelings that are intentionally directed at the music and clusters of these feelings can be recognized as typical of a specific mood. Therefore, mood-feelings are relevant to <b>the</b> aesthetic <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> music...|$|R

The fourth step is to attain the love of wisdom, and then from this to <b>the</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> the absolute and divine beauty (the Form of Beauty).|$|E
25|$|As a historian, he {{has been}} criticised as overly didactic, but he played an {{important}} role in establishing the use of epigraphy as a historiographic technique.
