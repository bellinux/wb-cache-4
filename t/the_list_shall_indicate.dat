40|$|This report {{provides}} an overall review on the technology status of Hybrid Laminar Flow Control systems {{especially of the}} research in the recent past. In Braslow (1999) or in Joslin (1998), literature and project as well as flight test reviews concentrate on the research until that time. Therefore, focus of this report is the newer research progress from 2000 until today. Openly available key literature is identified and sources for further reading are stated. This review clearly gives an overview, what {{has already been done}} in the past years of HLFC research both in the US and in Europe. With this information at hand it is possible to distinguish between the successful approaches and the less successful or outdated approaches in HLFC research. Furthermore, the technology status shall try to produce first estimations regarding the mass, power consumption and performance of HLFC systems as well as estimations regarding maintenance requirements and possible subsystem definitions. The report shall help justifying decisions in the following development process for the flight test driven development of an HLFC system. The last objective of this report is <b>the</b> stakeholder <b>list</b> in <b>the</b> context of research institutions. <b>The</b> stakeholder <b>list</b> <b>shall</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> research institutions or companies, which were working in different areas of HLFC research in the past {{as well as in the}} present. Furthermore <b>the</b> stakeholder <b>list</b> may be able to provide contacts to gain further sources on specific topics and issues...|$|R

See 33 U. S. C. § 1313 (d). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has promulgated implementing regulations for this listing aspect of section 303 (d), which mirrors and expands the requirement of States to identify “water quality-limited segments ” for which neither federal effluent limitations, more stringent state or local effluent limitations, nor any other existing federal, state or local pollution control requirements are stringent enough to implement water quality standards applicable to such waters. See 40 CFR § 130. 7 (b) (1) (i) -(iii). Those federal regulations place the following requirements upon State-generated 303 (d) lists: The term “water quality standard applicable to such waters ” and “applicable water quality standards ” refer to those water quality standards established under section 303 of the Clean Water Act, including numeric criteria, narrative criteria, waterbody uses, and antidegradation requirements.
