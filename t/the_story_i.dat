The post was accompanied by the message [...] "It's not that I've been dishonest, it's just that I loathe reality." [...] James Montgomery of MTV News compared the scene—known as [...] "The Prelude Pathétique"—to the 1975 drama film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and the 1980 horror film The Shining. Gaga teased a two-minute opening sequence of the music video on November 17,2011, after her performance at Children In Need Rocks Manchester.|$|E
500|$|Following an {{argument}} with Janice and Les, Toyah ran away to London to find her real father, Ronnie. However, she was [...] "led on" [...] by Neil Flynn (Tim Dantay), a stranger pretending to be Ronnie, and was later abducted by him. Taylor said the storyline {{was one of the}} hardest she had to film: [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>I</b> come down to London to track down my real father and things go badly wrong. Toyah hitchhikes all the way and just leaves herself so wide open. She is so naive and trusting and open to being used and abused." [...] The storyline was filmed on location in the city of London in early August. An hour long episode focusing on Janice and Les' search for Toyah was broadcast a month later.|$|E
500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network.

I told <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>I</b> wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E

Spoto wrote that Hitchcock made [...] "an overt sexual proposition that she could neither ignore nor answer casually." [...] Hedren alleged in Spoto's 2009 book, Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies, that Hitchcock actually asked her to [...] "make myself sexually available and accessible to him – however and whenever and wherever he wanted." [...] Spoto was the first person Hedren told her story to. She said: [...] "It was embarrassing and insulting—there were a lot of reasons why I didn’t want to tell <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>I</b> didn’t want it to be taken advantage of, twisted, turned and made into an even uglier situation than it was. It wasn’t until years later that I told Donald the story. (...) He is absolutely true and honest in this book." [...] She previously said, in 1973, while Hitchcock was still alive, that a major life-style difference caused a split in their relationship. [...] "He was too possessive and too demanding. I cannot be possessed by anyone. But, then, that's my own hangup." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came {{up with a way to}} tell <b>the</b> <b>story....</b> <b>I</b> was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'" ...|$|E
500|$|On 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series (although seventh film Bond overall). A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat. Craig had based his acceptance of the role on the strength of the script for the first film, Casino Royale; he later recalled that [...] "once I sat down and read <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>I</b> just thought that I wanted to tell ... I'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents". Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest. Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed. Many disparagingly called him [...] "James Blonde", believing the [...] blond-haired blue-eyed rugged Craig to be far fitting from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him. The Daily Mirror ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Name's Bland – James Bland.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>I</b> was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Ansen of Newsweek {{said the}} film [...] "is lushly, impeccably mounted—perhaps too much so.

2500|$|Many of Fassbinder's films {{deal with}} homosexuality, {{in keeping with}} his {{interest}} in characters who are social outsiders, but he drew away from most representations of homosexuals in films. In an interview at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, Fassbinder said about Fox and His Friends: [...] "It is certainly the first film in which the characters are homosexuals, without homosexuality being made into a problem. In films, plays or novels, if homosexuals appear, the homosexuality was the problem, or it was a comic turn. But here homosexuality is shown as completely normal, and the problem is something quite different, it's a love story, where one person exploits the love of the other person, and that's <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>I</b> always tell".|$|E

The Pussycat Dolls are neither – they're a brand, not a band. [...] 2005's multi-platinum PCD finds lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger in the spotlight, and she's no Beyoncé." [...] Scherzinger has claimed that she was responsible for both lead and backing vocals on the group's songs, with hardly anything sung by the other members.

The photo shoot was taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz. The full photograph was published with an accompanying story on The New York Times website on April 27, 2008. On April 29, 2008, The New York Times clarified that though the pictures left an impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bedsheet and was actually not topless.

That September, ABC announced that Vaughan had decided to leave to explore other opportunities, and that Jackson would be reprising the role. However, Vaughan announced via Twitter that it was the network that decided to let him go. Jackson stated upon returning: [...] "It was a tough situation.
