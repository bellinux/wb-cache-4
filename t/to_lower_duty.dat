40|$|The {{literature}} on antidumping (AD) has documented {{various aspects of}} this protectionist tool. However, a peculiar feature of AD has not received much attention: these measures are endogenous to {{the behavior of the}} exporting firms, which can adjust the dumping margin by changing their export price and ask the authority to amend the AD measures accordingly. The objective {{of this paper is to}} fill part of this gap in the literature by analyzing the AD reviews conducted by the European Union for affirmative petitions initiated in 1980 - 2009. To this end, a novel dataset of all such reviews has been assembled. Summary statistics reveal that more than a third of all petitions concluded with the imposition of AD measures are reviewed at least once before their expiration and most reviews lead <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> AD <b>duties</b> (still, almost 20 % of the firms investigated through interim reviews see their duties increase). There are significant differences in the outcome of the reviews depending on the party requesting them (i. e., reviews lodged by European producers are less likely <b>to</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> <b>duties).</b> These conclusions are confirmed by the econometric analysis, which also shows that Chinese firms see their duties reduced significantly less than those of firms from other countries...|$|R

40|$|Post-combustion CO 2 capture (PCC) {{plant for}} a typical 600 MW natural gas fueled thermal power plant was {{designed}} as a trade-off between operability and mitigation of the efficiency penalty. Two modified PCC plant configurations with low efficiency penalty were selected. The methodology for designing PCC plants was adapted by incorporating design constraints based on operability and the construction of absorbers. This was applied in sizing the equipment of the plants. Two configurations of absorbers were analyzed based on flue gas flow rate at full-load condition and at time-average of an assumed load variation of a power plant operating flexibly. It was found that the absorber designed at time-average load provided a reduction of approximately 4 % in the purchased cost of absorbers. The performance of the designed plants under power plant load variation, flow maldistribution and variable capture ratio was analyzed using off-design condition simulations. The absorber designed at full-load condition was found <b>to</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> reboiler <b>duty</b> in order to maintain a similar capture rate to that of the other absorber during part-load operation.

On the other hand, Hokkaido now faces many critical problems such as an aging labor force, a lack of successors, a decline of soil productivity, and a heavy debt carried by many farmers.

40|$|Low-power-listening MAC {{protocols}} {{were designed}} to reduce idle listening, {{a major source of}} energy consumption in energy starved wireless sensor networks. Low-powerlistening is a MAC strategy that allows nodes to sleep for ti s (the “inter-listening ” time) when there is no activity concerning them. It follows that a node has to occupy the medium for at least ti s to guarantee that its destination will probe the channel {{at some point during the}} transmission. Low-power-listening protocols have evolved with the introduction of new radios, and the most recent contributions propose to interrupt communication between the sender and the receiver after the data packet has been successfully received and acknowledged. This results in significant energy savings because a sending node does not need to send for full ti periods. We propose a new and simple approach to synchronize nodes on a slowly changing routing tree so that energy consumption is further reduced at the sending node, and the delay is considerably less. Our method allows the nodes <b>to</b> use a <b>lower</b> <b>duty</b> cycle, at no cost of overhead in most cases.

60|$|So grave {{a crisis}} {{could only be}} met by daring remedies. With the highest courage, moral courage no less than political, Peel {{resolved}} to ask parliament to let him raise four or five millions a year by income-tax, in order <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> the <b>duties</b> on the great articles of consumption, and by reforming the tariff both to relieve trade, and to stimulate and replenish the reciprocal flow of export and import. That he at this time, or perhaps in truth at any time, had acquired complete mastery of those deeper principles and wider aspects of free trade of which Adam Smith had been the great exponent--principles afterwards enforced by the genius of Cobden with such admirable still, persistency, and patriotic spirit--there was nothing to show. Such a scheme had no originality in it. Huskisson, and men of less conspicuous name, had ten years earlier urged {{the necessity of a}} new general system of taxation, based upon remission of duty on raw materials and on articles of consumption, and upon the imposition of an income-tax. The famous report of the committee on import duties of 1840, often rightly called the charter of free trade, and of which Peel, not much to his credit, had at this moment not read a word,[154] laid the foundations of the great policy of tariff reform with which the names of Peel and Gladstone are associated in history. The policy advocated in 1830 in the admirable treatise of Sir Henry Parnell is exactly the policy of Peel in 1842, as he acknowledged. After all it is an idle quarrel between the closet strategist and the victorious commander; between the man who first discerns some great truth of government, and the man who gets the thing, or even a part of the thing, actually done.|$|R

40|$|The voluminous {{literature}} on the U. S. antidumping laws has a curious lacuna. There is little in this literature {{about the effects of}} antidumping duties on the volume of subject imports. One reason this key question has not frequently been investigated is the lack of data. U. S. antidumping duties are firm specific, while information about U. S. imports is collected by commodity and country, but not by firm. This paper avoids this problem by examining a sample of U. S. antidumping orders for which the duties were the same for all firms from a given country, or for which there was only one foreign firm exporting the product from the foreign country in question. Using this sample, the present paper is the first study of which the author is aware that investigates the relation between antidumping duties and subject imports using accurate information about the level of antidumping duties. The paper is also unique in accurately measuring the quantity of imports affected by the antidumping duties. The study uses import quantity data reported by the USITC in its Sunset Review reports, rather than using ten-digit HTUSA categories, which sometimes do not match antidumping product definitions precisely. The price of using this unique dataset is that the current study is restricted to a sample of only 32 of the approximately 350 antidumping orders originating during the relevant years, of which about 188 are still in effect. Some evidence is presented suggesting that the sample of orders used may be representative of the larger universe. For the sample examined, the paper finds an elasticity of subject imports with respect to U. S. antidumping duties of roughly 0. 9. The paper also finds some evidence that age of the antidumping order may be a factor in explaining reduction in volume of subject imports. Study of this effect may be {{complicated by the fact that}} the initial level of all U. S. antidumping <b>duties</b> was <b>lower</b> during the early 1980 s than in the early 1990 s; so older orders tend <b>to</b> have <b>lower</b> <b>duties.</b> The study finds inconclusive evidence about the effect of antidumping orders on the price received by the foreign suppliers of subject imports. ...|$|R
