40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} second English {{translation}} of Simone de Beauvoir’s Le Deuxième Sexe, {{with the objective}} to contribute to bridging the gap between Gender Studies and Translation Studies. My contention is that foreignization, often presented in the literature as a more ethical approach to translation (see Venuti for instance), {{is not necessarily the}} most adequate translation strategy to render texts of feminist philosophy. Therefore, the main research question which the thesis investigates {{is the extent to which}} translation can help or otherwise impede on the reception of feminist philosophy. The study is specifically based on the case study of Simone de Beauvoir’s Le Deuxième Sexe, which was first translated into English in 1953, then retranslated in 2009. De Beauvoir’s magnum opus is a model of feminist philosophy and widely influenced the field, so that having an accurate English translation of her work is critical. The case study analyses the translation of some key features of the text, such as core Existential terminology, along with gender-related terms, as well as the treatment of intertextuality in the latest English translation. It also describes the overall translators’ project as presented through paratext, arguing that a domestication approach can be a beneficial approach to translate feminist philosophy. Chapter One will present introductory background information on Simone de Beauvoir’s work in Le Deuxième Sexe, namely the main ideas developed in the book, as well as an overview of the story of the first English translation, and its reception. Dealing with reception will lead us to question the notion of reception in Literary Studies and Translation Studies and the central role of the translator in Chapter Two, which will be narrowed down to faithfulness, a prevalent if somewhat contested notion in translation criticism, in Chapter Three. Chapter Four will examine the latest English translation, before sketching the frameworks of Contrastive Linguistics and Intertextuality in Chapter Five. Finally, Chapter Six will concentrate on the data analysis through a systematic comparison of relevant categories. This chapter findings will lead us <b>to</b> put <b>forward</b> <b>comments</b> and proposed strategies to deal with feminist and philosophical translation...|$|R

This guide {{was developed in}} collaboration among the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Divisions of Chapter and District Relations, Community-based Initiatives, and Corporate and Foundation Relations, and was partially supported by the Dyson Foundation. The purpose of the guide is to assist AAP members, AAP chapters, and other child health advocates to seek funding for local initiatives. It is the Academy's hope that this guide will help bring support to the many community-based programs that aim to provide a medical home to all children in their community, and to further the Academy’s mission to attain the optimal physical, mental, and social health for all infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. Many pediatricians and child health advocates are new {{to the art of}} grant writing. A Pediatrician’s Guide to Proposal Writing will provide you with the foundation to help start you on your way.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the monographs which have been published recently by the working group "Drug Monitoring” of the Swiss Society of Clinical Chemistry (SSCC) [1 - 3], new monographs have been written. The aim of these monographs is to provide an overview on the information which {{is important for the}} request and interpretation of the results. Therefore, the targeted readers are laboratory health professionals and the receivers of the reports. In this series, several antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs are presented. It is worth noting that the monograph on the antipsychotic clozapine has already been published in 2005 [1]. Information on the indications for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), protein binding, metabolic pathways and enzymes involved, elimination half-life time and elimination route(s) of the parent drug and therapeutic or toxic concentrations is provided. Because pre-analytical considerations are of particular importance for therapeutic drug monitoring, information regarding the optimal point in time for the determination of drug concentrations and achievement of steady-state concentrations after changing the dose is given. Furthermore, the stability of the drug and its metabolite(s) after blood sampling is described. For readers with a specific interest, references to important publications are provided. The number of the monographs will be continuously increased. The updated files are presented on the homepage of the SSCC (www. sscc. ch). We hope that these monographs are helpful for the better handling of therapeutic drug monitoring and we are looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>comments</b> by the reader...|$|R

40|$|In today’s world digital {{technology}} is a given for most young people. But {{if they are to}} contribute to a rapidly changing and complex global society, they need to understand how digital technologies work. Young people need the skills of content creation, collaboration and communication so they can use digital technologies to solve problems and express themselves. Digital making is the creative process of making a product or digital artefact - from websites, apps, games, and 3 D animations to physical objects driven by microcontrollers. Digital making will often mean using coding and programming skills as well as the creative use of digital tools to make new products. Digital making skills are fundamentally underpinned by an understanding of computational thinking but may also include things like creative teamwork, problem solving, engineering and design in order to build new technologies. However, the role of {{digital technology}} for learning and the place of making all come with different (often competing) traditions and educational practices. As such, understanding how we best support young people as digital makers is a complex challenge and one which requires careful consideration – something this report sets out to do. As we continue to work with partners such as Nesta and Mozilla to support a generation of digital makers, I look <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> your <b>comments</b> and hope we can work together to address the issues set out in this document. - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to shed light on how two {{fundamental}} corporate macro processes (Human Resources Management – HRM - and Voluntary Disclosure - VD) contribute to Risk Management (RM) and Value Creation (VC) in financial institutions. In general, the copious literature produced of recent years on shareholder value creation and risk management, while emphasising aspects related to human resources management (and compensation systems in particular) and the importance of disclosure, still tend to discuss these topics at a fairly superficial level, in both theoretical and empirical terms. From the empirical point of view, this is partly understandable, given the lack of public data on HRM practices within banks, and the contents and modes of disclosure (especially voluntary forms of reporting, focusing on parameters not completely expressed in monetary terms), leading to the use of indirect measurements of some drivers which may explain the creation of value or the ability to deal with risks. We are thinking, for example, of customer satisfaction, and the adequacy of the organisational structure and management accounting systems. In the area of theory, and the consequent opportunity for new perspectives for research and innovation, this superficiality is less justifiable. Is it acceptable to provide only partial explanations of phenomena, simply because there are plenty of other studies with which my findings can be compared? Are the results researchers produce in this way of help for the actions managers and authorities, for example, have to take to improve the conditions for the implementation of value creation and risk management strategies? We will attempt <b>to</b> put <b>forward</b> <b>comments</b> and research hypotheses on the factors, linked to HRM and VD, which affect value creation and risk management in banks, starting from two research frameworks which have not been widely used when discussing financial institution management topics related to value creation and risk management, but that we think are very useful in clarifying the real situation behind value creation (for shareholders and other stakeholders) and risk management. These research frameworks are Intellectual Capital and Stakeholder Management. We believe that these managerial frameworks can offer useful theoretical and practical contributions to Risk Management and Value Creation issues in bank management. Risk Management issues are normally analysed (and managed) through measurement approaches that are above all, financial and quantitative, and are linked to the first and (partially) the second pillar of the Basel 2 Accord, and Value Creation is scrutinized under financial measurement approaches, the usage of which is widespread at the top management and board of directors level. Our aim is to demonstrate that to achieve better Risk Management and Value Creation, financial institutions must also consider some different perspectives, especially with regard to specific kinds of risk (i. e. operational, compliance, reputational), and the recommendations embedded in the managerial frameworks of analysis of financial institutions. We illustrate the case of Human Resource Management practices and Voluntary Disclosure...|$|R
