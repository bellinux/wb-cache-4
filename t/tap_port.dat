40|$|ITC/USA 2015 Conference Proceedings / The Fifty-First Annual International Telemetering Conference and Technical Exhibition / October 26 - 29, 2015 / Bally's Hotel & Convention Center, Las Vegas, NVDigital data {{distribution}} systems {{are widely used}} in Aerospace and Defense products to allow devices to communicate with one another. In many cases it is desirable to monitor the data traffic flowing between two points in a copper or fiber based Operational or Onboard Network System (ONS) for Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) purposes because these ONS systems may carry important data {{which can be used}} without duplicating/installing a specific FTI data acquisition system to receive this data. The two types of network taps that can be used are Inline Network Taps and network end-point taps. This paper examines the usage of Inline Network Taps for FTI applications and how they can support network access strategies and objectives. An Inline Network Tap is a hardware device which allows access to data flowing across a network. These devices are typically active/powered and have a number of ports: a first <b>tap</b> <b>port,</b> a second <b>tap</b> <b>port,</b> and one or more mirror ports. An in-line network tap inserted {{between the first and second}} <b>tap</b> <b>port</b> passes all data traffic through unimpeded but also copies that same data to one or more mirror ports. Some Inline Network Tap devices may also pass packets when the tap is not powered or a malfunction is detected on the device via an integrated by-pass function. If the Inline Network Tap device goes offline the unit automatically bypasses the tap connection and data traffic is directed through the bypass directly to network devices. This capability is crucial for inline usage on mission critical network segments that cannot afford the risk of losing the network connection. An in-line network tap can either be based on copper or fiber technology and as a "filterable" network tap can also provide advanced packet filtering capabilities. These filterable network taps can selectively pass data, e. g., based on VLAN ID or other parameters, to a mirror port for deep analysis, monitoring and recording. Another advanced tap function that is presented in this paper is the support for inserting time stamps at the tap level in monitored packets which provides a reference time when the data content of a given packet was generated at a data source. This capability is a significant feature for FTI applications as most ONS systems do not provide time stamped data...|$|E

This motivated us to repeat the experiment, which was primary done by J. Zhiang and A. Moore, and evaluate existing passive monitoring techniques TAP and Port- mirroring in more detail. We have done a qualitative experiment in the laboratory and we noted that Port-mirror used a significant amount of the Central Processor Unit (CPU) during the process. White papers introduced Port-mirroring as a passive network monitoring method without affecting the performance, but our results showed it does have an effect. Also, can confirm, that Port-mirroring was reordering packets, had process delay and in case of congestion it dropped packets. TAP operated without packet loss. The packets sequence does not change, so saves operating time and is fully passive. Captured packets contain such information as the source address, destination address, and different protocols information.

40|$|Abstract — The {{behaviour}} {{of systems}} on chip (SOC) is complex because they contain multiple processors that interact through concurrent interconnects, such as networks on chip (NOC). Debugging such SOCs is hard. Based on a classification of debug scope and granularity, we propose that debugging should be communication-centric {{and based on}} transactions. Communication-centric debug focusses on the communication and the synchronisation between the IP blocks, which are implemented by the interconnect using transactions. We define and implement a modular debug architecture, based on NOC, monitors, and a dedicated high-speed event-distribution broadcast interconnect. The manufacturing-test scan chains and IEEE 1149. 1 test access <b>ports</b> (<b>TAP)</b> are re-used for configuration and debug data read-out. Our debug architecture requires only small changes to the functional architecture. The additional area cost {{is limited to the}} monitors and the event distribution interconnect, which are 4. 5 % of the NOC area, or less than 0. 2 % of the SOC area. The debug architecture runs at NOC functional speed and reacts very quickly to debug events to stop the SOC close in time to the condition that raised the event. The speed at which data is retrieved from the SOC after stopping using the TAP is 10 MHz. We prove our concepts and architecture with a gate-level implementation that includes the NOC, event distribution interconnect, and clock, reset, and TAP controllers. We include gatelevel signal traces illustrating debug at message and transaction levels. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFume and hygiene hoods {{are widely}} used to prevent {{fugitive}} emissions from charge <b>ports,</b> <b>tap</b> holes and many other openings in mineral processing and smelting vessels. The highly buoyant nature of the fume combined with often complex geometries {{make the design of}} these hoods difficult with traditional engineering tools. However, by combining the traditional engineering approach with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, a clear understanding of the shortfalls of an existing system can be obtained, and an optimised hood design can be achieved. This paper reports on a combined engineering and CFD analysis of a fume extraction system for a zinc slag fumer charge port. The engineering model revealed that the existing plant components (bag house and fan) were not capable of capturing the required amount of fume, and that the original hood design was flawed. The CFD model was then used to predict the fume capture and emission from the existing hood. CFD model predictions showed that increasing the draft flow rate by an order of magnitude would only give a marginal improvement in fume capture. Using findings of both the models enabled a new fume capture hood to be designed. CFD analysis of the new hood revealed that a significant improvement in fume capture is possible. Construction and installation of the hood has been performed and a 65 % reduction in fume emission was achieved, thus significantly mitigating a long-standing emission problem...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{capture and}} {{analysis}} {{is key to}} many domains including network management, security and network forensics. Traditionally, it is performed by a dedicated device accessing traffic at a specific point within the network through a link <b>tap</b> or a <b>port</b> of a node mirroring packets. This approach is problematic because the dedicated device must be equipped with {{a large amount of}} computation and storage resources to store and analyze packets. Alternatively, in order to achieve scalability, analysis can be performed by a cluster of hosts. However, this is normally located at a remote location with respect to the observation point, hence requiring to move across the network a large volume of captured traffic. To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm to distribute the task of capturing, processing and storing packets traversing a network across multiple packet forwarding nodes (e. g., IP routers). Essentially, our solution allows individual nodes on the path of a flow to operate on subsets of packets of that flow in a completely distributed and decentralized manner. The algorithm ensures that each packet is processed by n nodes, where n can be set to 1 to minimize overhead or to a higher value to achieve redundancy. Nodes create a distributed index that enables efficient retrieval of packets they store (e. g., for forensics applications). Finally, the basic principles of the presented solution can also be applied, with minimal changes, to the distributed execution of generic tasks on data flowing through a network of nodes with processing and storage capabilities. This has applications in various fields ranging from Fog Computing, to microservice architectures and the Internet of Things...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Pain {{control in}} the morbidly obese can be {{especially}} challenging because of increased sensitivity to opioid-induced respiratory depression. The subcostal transversus abdominis plane block {{is associated with a}} large area of spread (T 7 -L 1). The aim {{of the study was to}} test the hypothesis that US-guided TAP blocks can reduce opioid consumption during the first 24  h after of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in comparison with port site local anesthetic infiltration and systemic analgesia. Method: Sixty-three ASA II/III adult patients listed for elective laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were randomly allocated in one of three groups: Group I (OSTAP) received bilateral OSTAP block. Group II (Local) received local anesthetic infiltration at trocar port sites. Group III (Control) placebo group received <b>TAP</b> block and <b>port</b> site infiltration by same volumes of sterile normal saline. Twenty-four hours postopetrative morphine consumption, the dose of fentanyl (μg) required during surgery, equivalent morphine dose in the recovery unit (PACU) and first morphine dose were recorded. The quality of analgesia is assessed by Visual Analogue Scale for 24  h at rest and movement. Results: The mean opioid consumptions in PACU showed significant difference between the three groups, P =  0. 02. The mean 24  h morphine consumption showed statistically significant difference between groups (P value <  0. 001). Significant differences were found between both OSTAP and Local groups with control group (P <  0. 001) and also between OSTAP and Local groups (P =  0. 02). Pain score of OSTAP group was significantly lower than local infiltration group at 6 and 4  h at rest and movement respectively. OSTAP group had faster extubation time than other groups. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were not significant between groups. No signs or symptoms of local anesthetic systemic toxicity or complications were detected. Conclusion: Oblique subcostal TAP block is a good alternative for providing analgesia during the postoperative period. The block is easily performed using ultrasound guidance. It is safe, provides effective analgesia with significant morphine-sparing effect with reduced side-effects of opioids...|$|R

SOCs for the mobile phone and tablet market have the unique challenge of short product development windows, at times less than six months, and low cost board and platform that limits physical access to test access <b>ports</b> (<b>TAP).</b> This dissertation presents the architecture of a reusable built-in self-test (BIST) engine called converged pattern generator and checker (CPGC) that was developed to address the above challenges. It {{is used in the}} critical path of millions of x 86 SOC for DDR 3, DDR 4, LP-DDR 3, LP-DDR 4 IO initialization and link training. The CPGC is also an essential BIST engine for IO and memory defect detection, and in some cases, the automatic repair of detected memory defects. The software and hardware infrastructure that leverages CPU L 2 /L 3 cache to enable cache based testing (CBT) and the parallel execution of the CPGC Intel BIST engine is shown to improve test time 60 x to 170 x over conventional TAP based testing. In addition, silicon results are presented showing that CPGC enables easy debug of inter symbol interference (ISI) and crosstalk issues in silicon and boards, enables fast IO link training, improves validation time by 3 x, and in some instances, reduces SOC and platform power by 5 % to 11 % through closed loop IO circuit power optimization. This CPGC BIST engine has been developed into a reusable IP solution, which has been successfully designed into at least 11 Intel CPUs and SOCs (32 nm- 14 nm), with seven of these successfully debugged, tested, and launched into the market place. Ultimately has led to over 100 million CPUs being shipped within one quarter using this architecture...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of molecular diagnostics and microfluidics {{has the potential}} to revolutionise human health care. The continuous discovery of genetic markers that correspond to particular cancer types and subtypes offers a large potential for non-invasive patient screening. Early and accurate diagnosis {{has the potential to}} lead to tailored treatments and a better patient prognosis. The research undertaken here at the Stokes Institute aims to develop a diagnostic tool through current advancements in genomics and microfluidics, for the accurate and early diagnosis of paediatric leukaemia. Applying microfluidics to the current molecular diagnostic protocols offers a decrease in costs through a reduction in consumable reagents and an increase in speed and consistency through {{integration of}} all the functional steps of qPCR. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the hydrodynamics of biphasic flow. Encapsulating the genetic material and PCR reagents into a micro-reactor (microfluidic plug) allows for individual and contamination-free processing. The pressure drop of individual plugs under a range of operational conditions is measured and presented. An analysis of the effect of the concentration of surfactant that is employed has on the biphasic hydrodynamics is examined. The data is subsequently analysed and compared to a theoretical approximation that is present in the literature. The ratio of biphasic fluidic resistance to single phase fluidic resistance is presented as a means to measure empirically the effect a second immiscible phase has on the hydrodynamics. A train of immiscible plugs is shown to have a lower pressure drop than a single plug of similar total length when the inter-plug spacing is sufficiently large. Three microfluidic manifolds were tested as microfluidic circuit elements. Fluidic manifolds provide a controllable means of distributing a single flow across numerous microfluidic capillaries and circuit elements. Two prototype manifolds were designed and compared to a commercially available product. The sensitivity of a manifold to changes in fluidic resistance and air contamination is also presented. Liquid bridges were employed as circuit elements and pressure taps. This is, to the best knowledge of the author, the first use of liquid bridges as pressure taps. The liquid bridges isolated the aqueous plugs from the pressure <b>port</b> <b>taps</b> preventing sense line contamination. A pressure transient analysis was carried out to determine the effect of the liquid bridges on biphasic flow. The incorporation of the three microfluidic elements into a single circuit was analysed under biphasic flow conditions. Two analytical models of microfluidic circuits are presented for the queuing and mixing of aqueous plugs prior to processing. The pressure drop data was used to validate the employment of a modified single phase analytical model for the design of biphasic microfluidic circuits for low Capillary and Reynolds number flows...|$|R

In an effort to improve submicrometer interconnect performance, to increase packing density, and to reduce chip area and power consumption, the semiconductor industry is focusing on three-dimensional (3 D) integration. However, volume production and commercial exploitation of 3 D integration are not feasible yet due to significant technical hurdles. At the present time, interposer-based 2. 5 D integration is emerging as a precursor to stacked 3 D integration. All the dies and the interposer in a 2. 5 D IC must be adequately tested for product qualification. However, since the structure of 2. 5 D ICs {{is different from the}} traditional 2 D ICs, new challenges have emerged: (1) pre-bond interposer testing, (2) lack of test access, (3) limited ability for at-speed testing, (4) high density I/O ports and interconnects, (5) reduced number of test pins, and (6) high power consumption. This research targets the above challenges and effective solutions have been developed to test both dies and the interposer. The dissertation first introduces the basic concepts of 3 D ICs and 2. 5 D ICs. Prior work on testing of 2. 5 D ICs is studied. An efficient method is presented to locate defects in a passive interposer before stacking. The proposed test architecture uses e-fuses that can be programmed to connect or disconnect functional paths inside the interposer. The concept of a die footprint is utilized for interconnect testing, and the overall assembly and test flow is described. Moreover, the concept of weighted critical area is defined and utilized to reduce test time. In order to fully determine the location of each e-fuse and the order of functional interconnects in a test path, we also present a test-path design algorithm. The proposed algorithm can generate all test paths for interconnect testing. In order to test for opens, shorts, and interconnect delay defects in the interposer, a test architecture is proposed that is fully compatible with the IEEE 1149. 1 standard and relies on an enhancement of the standard test access <b>port</b> (<b>TAP)</b> controller. To reduce test cost, a test-path design and scheduling technique is also presented that minimizes a composite cost function based on test time and the design-for-test (DfT) overhead in terms of additional through silicon vias (TSVs) and micro-bumps needed for test access. The locations of the dies on the interposer are taken into consideration {{in order to determine the}} order of dies in a test path. To address the scenario of high density of I/O ports and interconnects, an efficient built-in self-test (BIST) technique is presented that targets the dies and the interposer interconnects. The proposed BIST architecture can be enabled by the standard TAP controller in the IEEE 1149. 1 standard. The area overhead introduced by this BIST architecture is negligible; it includes two simple BIST controllers, a linear-feedback-shift-register (LFSR), a multiple-input-signature-register (MISR), and some extensions to the boundary-scan cells in the dies on the interposer. With these extensions, all boundary-scan cells can be used for self-configuration and self-diagnosis during interconnect testing. To reduce the overall test cost, a test scheduling and optimization technique under power constraints is described. In order to accomplish testing with a small number test pins, the dissertation presents two efficient ExTest scheduling strategies that implements interconnect testing between tiles inside an system on chip (SoC) die on the interposer while satisfying the practical constraint that the number of required test pins cannot exceed the number of available pins at the chip level. The tiles in the SoC are divided into groups based on the manner in which they are interconnected. In order to minimize the test time, two optimization solutions are introduced. The first solution minimizes the number of input test pins, and the second solution minimizes the number output test pins. In addition, two subgroup configuration methods are further proposed to generate subgroups inside each test group. Finally, the dissertation presents a programmable method for shift-clock stagger assignment to reduce power supply noise during SoC die testing in 2. 5 D ICs. An SoC die in the 2. 5 D IC is typically composed of several blocks and two neighboring blocks that share the same power rails should not be toggled at the same time during shift. Therefore, the proposed programmable method does not assign the same stagger value to neighboring blocks. The positions of all blocks are first analyzed and the shared boundary length between blocks is then calculated. Based on the position relationships between the blocks, a mathematical model is presented to derive optimal result for small-to-medium sized problems. For larger designs, a heuristic algorithm is proposed and evaluated. In summary, the dissertation targets important design and optimization problems related to testing of interposer-based 2. 5 D ICs. The proposed research has led to theoretical insights, experiment results, and a set of test and design-for-test methods to make testing effective and feasible from a cost perspective.
