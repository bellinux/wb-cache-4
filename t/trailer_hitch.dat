50|$|The {{downside}} is that the hitch takes up room in the cargo bed {{regardless of whether the}} <b>trailer</b> is <b>hitched</b> or not. The hitch can be unbolted from the bed but this takes a lot more time and effort than the unhitch operation.|$|R
5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the tow vehicle that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the <b>trailer's</b> <b>hitch</b> weight from the towing vehicle's rear axle to the towing vehicle's front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the tow vehicle. Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch. Tow vehicles often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|R

5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that the cannon had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 hackers, of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring the cannon disguised as construction contractors, the hackers had run-ins with a Caltech security guard and physical plant worker, to whom they explained that they were moving the cannon in preparation for the pouring of a concrete pedestal. Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised cannon. On the way to the shipping company, the <b>trailer's</b> <b>hitch</b> cracked, necessitating a slow trip on surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove the cannon from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the services of a company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|R
50|$|On April 1, 1929 Consolidated Freightways {{was founded}} by Leland James as a single truck LTL {{operation}} in Portland, Oregon. The company realized expanded growth rather quickly. James was an innovator, and purchased his custom power units from Freightways Manufacturing Company. Always striving to haul more product on a truck/trailer combination, James helped design the first C.O.E. (Cab Over Engine) cab-over power units the United States had ever seen. The power units were lightweight and short, allowing for an additional freight box {{mounted on the frame}} of the truck behind the cab (single trailer units). With the short cab-overs, short <b>trailers</b> (<b>hitched</b> as doubles) could be lengthened, allowing for more freight as well. Length laws were stringent in the 1930s, so if a company were to survive they had to be innovative. In Nov. 1951, Consolidated Freightways went public, opening on the New York Stock Exchange at $1.80. The stock was valued at $38.00/share in 1981. In 1981, CF won a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp.. The court found that Iowa's length restriction on tractor-trailers violated the Dormant Commerce Clause.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{function}} of a trailer jack is to lift the trailer to a height that allows the <b>trailer</b> to be <b>hitched</b> or unhitched {{to and from the}} towing vehicle. Trailer jacks are also used for leveling the trailer during storage. The most common types of trailer jacks are A-frame jacks, swivel jacks, and drop-leg jacks. Some trailers, such as horse trailers, have a built-in jack at the tongue for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|A lunette ring {{is a type}} of <b>trailer</b> <b>hitch</b> {{that works}} in {{combination}} with a pintle hook on the tow vehicle. A pintle hook and lunette ring makes a more secure coupling, desirable on rough terrain, compared to ball-type trailer hitches. It is commonly seen in towing applications by agriculture, industry and the military.|$|E
50|$|A 'fifth-wheel' is {{a travel}} trailer {{supported}} by a hitch {{in the center of}} the bed of a pickup truck instead of a hitch at the back of a vehicle. The special hitch used for fifth-wheels is a smaller version of the one used on 18-wheeler trucks and can be connected by simply driving the tow vehicle under the trailer. Fifth wheel trailers are popular with full-time recreational vehicle enthusiasts, who often live in them for several months in one place, using their pickup truck tow vehicle for local errands. A fifth wheel trailer tows more securely than a traditional travel <b>trailer</b> because the <b>hitch</b> weight sits directly over the pickup truck's rear tires. Since part of a fifth wheel sits over the bed of the pickup, it also reduces the overall length of the vehicle/trailer package while allowing the same room as a comparable length travel <b>trailer.</b> Additionally, the <b>hitch's</b> location in the pickup's bed reduces the risk of jackknifing and allows for more maneuverability when backing. Because of the greater room available on the roads in North America, these vehicles are more popular in the United States and Canada than in Europe or other parts of the world. For uneven terrain a gooseneck hitch is an option to fifth-wheel.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{kinematic}} {{model of}} an {{autonomous mobile robot}} system consisting of a chain of steerable cars and passive <b>trailers</b> with axle-to-axle <b>hitching</b> is examined and converted into a multi-input chained form using dynamic state feedback.

Key Words. Motion planning, nonholonomic systems, dynamic feedback, mobile robots, chained forms. 1. INTRODUCTION In this paper the motion planning problem is solved for a multi-steering trailer system; that is, a car-like mobile robot pulling a combination of n passive trailers and m Γ 1 steerable car-like robots. The controls available to the system are the velocity of the lead car and the steering velocities of all m car-like robots.

40|$|The {{so-called}} "general two-trailers system" is a nonholonomic system {{composed of}} a controlled unicycle-like vehicle and two passive <b>trailers</b> with off-axle <b>hitching.</b> It is not differentially flat and cannot be transformed into the chained form system. Methods developed for this latter class of systems thus do not apply. The Transverse Function (TF) approach is here used to solve the trajectory tracking problem for this system. The proposed control solution yields practical stabilization of any reference motion, whether it {{is or is not}} feasible. Practical stabilization of non-feasible trajectories in the case of non-differently flat systems is of particular interest due partly to the difficulty of planning and calculating desired feasible state reference motions. The method is illustrated by simulation results which show that, in addition to the unconditional practical stabilization property evoked above, asymptotic stabilization of feasible and persistently exciting motions can also be achieved with the same performance as local stabilizers derived from a linear approximation of the tracking-error equations...|$|R
