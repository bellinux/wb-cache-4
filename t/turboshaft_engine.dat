5|$|Lockheed {{worked on}} modifying the AH-56 design {{to address the}} {{vibration}} and other issues. As a precaution, Cheyenne #9 (s/n 66-8834) was fitted with an ejection seat for the pilot after the March accident. The downward firing ejection seat {{was placed in the}} forward seat in place of the gunner's station. This prototype would be used for all remaining envelope expansion flights. Prototype #9 also received an upgraded transmission and drivetrain, and a hinged rear canopy in place of the original sliding canopy around 1970. The new transmission allowed the T64-GE-16 <b>turboshaft</b> <b>engine</b> output to be increased from a derated 3,435horsepower (2,561kW) to 3,925horsepower (2,927kW). The new canopy eliminated the canopy vibrations.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Boeing {{conceptualized}} an Apache upgrade {{prior to}} the introduction of the U.S. Army's anticipated attack version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft, forecast to replace the Apache by 2040. The conceptual AH-64F would have greater speed via a new 3,000 shp <b>turboshaft</b> <b>engine</b> from the improved turbine engine program, retractable landing gear, stub wings to offload lift from the main rotor during cruise, and a tail rotor that can articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust. In October 2016, the Army revealed they would not pursue another Apache upgrade to focus on funding the FVL; the Army will continue buying the Apache through the 2020s until Boeing's production line ends in 2026, then FVL is slated to come online in 2030.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 <b>turboshaft</b> <b>engine.</b> Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E

25|$|The Nimbus is a <b>turboshaft</b> <b>engine</b> {{comprising}} a {{gas generator}} section, {{which consists of}} a three-stage compressor, (two axial stages and one centrifugal stage), driven by a two-stage turbine in conjunction with an annular combustion chamber, and a power output section consisting of a single-stage free turbine driving an output shaft via a two-stage reduction gearbox.|$|E
25|$|A GTEL uses a turbo-electric {{drivetrain}} {{in which}} a <b>turboshaft</b> <b>engine</b> drives an electrical generator or alternator via a system of gears.

25|$|Continental began {{development}} of the Tiara series in 1965. At the time, CAE, Continental Motor's turbine engine subsidiary, had developed the T65, a small <b>turboshaft</b> <b>engine</b> which was being considered by Bell for its new Model 206 helicopter. Faced with having to fund the production tooling for the T65 {{in order to keep}} the price reasonable, or funding the Tiara series, Continental's corporate management chose to invest in the Tiaras.|$|E
25|$|The four-seat XH-39 was {{powered by}} one Continental CAE XT51-T-3 400 shp (298kW) <b>turboshaft</b> <b>engine,</b> a license-built {{development}} of the Turbomeca Artouste. It was developed from a previous Sikorsky model, the H-18 (company model S-52), and had the same layout. It differed in using retractable landing gear, modified tail rotor, and four-blade main rotor. In the end, the U.S. Army selected the Bell XH-40, prototype of the UH-1 Huey. Two YH-18As were modified into XH-39s; one for flight testing {{and the other for}} static test.|$|E
25|$|The only actual turbine powered Batmobile in {{existence}} is {{a replica of}} the 1989 film car. It is powered by a military Boeing <b>turboshaft</b> <b>engine</b> driving the rear wheels through a 4 speed semi-automatic transmission and is street registered. This car was designed and constructed by Casey Putsch of Putsch Racing in 2011. Putsch Racing also created a V8 powered replica complete with retractable firing machine guns, automated canopy, internet, GPS, police/military scanner, etc.. That car was also street registered in the United States.|$|E
