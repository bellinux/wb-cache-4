5|$|In late 1942, German {{forces were}} {{defeated}} in the second battle of El Alamein, thwarting Hitler's plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East. Overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, Hitler became distrustful of his Army High Command and began to interfere in military and <b>tactical</b> <b>planning,</b> with damaging consequences. In December 1942 and January 1943, Hitler's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th Army. Over 200,000 Axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner. Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk. Hitler's military judgement became increasingly erratic, and Germany's military and economic position deteriorated, as did Hitler's health.|$|E

5|$|On Hitler's orders, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) (the {{intelligence}} {{branch of}} the SS), who had commanded the operation to rescue Mussolini in September 1943, was independently involved in intelligence gathering in the lead-up to the raid. Skorzeny acted {{on behalf of the}} SD, and after obtaining information from a Partisan deserter that pinpointed Tito's headquarters at the cave, he proposed a plan to infiltrate Drvar {{with a small group of}} soldiers to assassinate Tito. Skorzeny soon discovered that the plan to eliminate Tito had been compromised, and had nothing further to do with the operation. It appears that he did not pass on the useful intelligence he had gathered to SS-Hauptsturmführer Kurt Rybka, the commander of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion, who was responsible for planning the critical airborne aspects of the operation. Largely due to interservice rivalry and competition, the three organisations did not share the intelligence they gathered, which had a significant effect on the <b>tactical</b> <b>planning</b> and execution of the operation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the literature, <b>tactical</b> <b>plans</b> of {{elective}} patients aim {{at increasing}} hospital efficiency through a better resource utilisation, although hospitals claim that patient satisfaction, usually {{measured by the}} waiting time, is also important. In this regard, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to show how patient satisfaction can be associated with any <b>tactical</b> <b>plan,</b> by developing a method to compute exact waiting time distributions. We also present a procedure to calculate the exact levels of resource utilisation. Therefore, with our procedures, hospital managers can determine the operational performance of their <b>tactical</b> <b>plan.</b> We then explore two strategies to improve <b>tactical</b> <b>plans</b> in terms of waiting time: slack planning and smooth allocation. A case study based on data from a Dutch cardiothoracic surgery centre shows that slack planning leads to a trade-off between waiting time and hospital efficiency. When slack planning is combined to smooth allocation, additional improvements of the waiting time can be reached...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAdmission {{policies}} for elective inpatient services mainly {{result in the}} management of a single resource: the operating theatre as it is commonly considered as the most critical and expensive resource in a hospital. However, other bottleneck resources may lead to surgery cancellations, such as bed capacity and nursing staff in Intensive Care (IC) units and bed occupancy in wards or medium care (MC) services. Our incentive is therefore to determine a master schedule of a given number of patients that are divided in several homogeneous categories in terms of the utilization of each resource: operating theatre, IC beds, IC nursing hours and MC beds. The objective is to minimize the weighted deviations of the resource use from their targets and probabilistic lengths of stay in each unit (IC and MC) are considered. We use a Mixed Integer Program model to determine the best admission policy. The resulting admission policy is a <b>tactical</b> <b>plan,</b> as it is based upon the expected number of patients with their expected characteristics. On the operational level, this <b>tactical</b> <b>plan</b> must be adapted to account for the actual arriving number of patients in each category. We develop several strategies to build an operational schedule that leansupon the <b>tactical</b> <b>plan</b> more or less closely. The strategies result from the combination of several options to create a feasible operational schedule from the <b>tactical</b> plan: over <b>planning,</b> flexibility in selecting the patient groups to be operated and updating the <b>tactical</b> <b>plan.</b> The strategies were tested on real data from a Thoracic Surgery Centre over a 10 -year simulation horizon. The performance was assessed by the average waiting time for patients, the weighted target deviations and some indicators of the plan changes between the <b>tactical</b> <b>plan</b> and the operational schedule. Simulation results show that the best strategies include over planning, a limited flexibility and infrequent updates of the <b>tactical</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-stage planning procedure for master planning of elective and emergency patients while allocating at best the available hospital resources. Four types of resources are considered: operating theatre, {{beds in the}} medium and {{in the intensive care}} units, and nursing hours in the intensive care unit. A <b>tactical</b> <b>plan</b> is obtained by minimizing the deviations of the resources consumption to the target levels of resources utilization, following a goal programming approach. The MIP formulation to get this <b>tactical</b> <b>plan</b> is specifically designed to account for emergency care since it allows for the reservation of some capacity for emergency patients and possible capacity excess. To deal with the deviation between actually arriving elective patients and the average number of patients on which the <b>tactical</b> <b>plan</b> is based, we consider the possibility of planning a higher number of patients than the average to create operating slots in the <b>tactical</b> <b>plan</b> (slack planning). These operating slots are then filled in the operational plan following several flexibility rules. We consider three options for slack planning that lead to three different <b>tactical</b> <b>plans</b> on which we apply three flexibility rules to get finally nine alternative weekly schedules of elective patients. We then develop an algorithm to modify this schedule on a daily basis so as to account for emergency patients' arrivals. Scheduled elective patients may be cancelled and emergency patients may be sent to other hospitals. Cancellation rules for both types of patients rely on the possibility to exceed the available capacities. Several performance indicators are defined to assess patient service and hospital efficiency. Simulation results show a trade-off between hospital efficiency and patient service.

25|$|The over is a {{fundamental}} consideration in the <b>tactical</b> <b>planning</b> of the fielding side. Since a single bowler has only six legal balls to bowl before he must hand the ball to another bowler, he typically plans to use those six balls {{to set up a}} pattern of play designed to get a batsman out. For example, he may bowl the first few balls with the same line, length, or spin. He intends to tempt the batsman into scoring runs by providing balls that are relatively easy to hit. If the batsman takes the bait, the bowler can then follow up with a variation designed to hit the wicket, or a ball that is intended to induce a mistake from a batsman who is still in aggressive run-scoring mode, which will result in him being caught out.|$|E

40|$|Freight {{transportation}} {{is a complex}} large scale system that operates under a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. Due to the scale {{and complexity of the}} system, a highly interdependent set of decisions are made across multiple planning levels. The interaction between tactical level decisions and execution level decisions largely determines the overall effectiveness of the system. This thesis aims to provide an analysis of how the interaction between the degree of robustness of a <b>tactical</b> <b>plan</b> and the flexibility level of an execution policy affects the performance of freight transportation systems in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Such analysis is conducted under two types of transportation systems, including a generalized distribution system and a military logistic system, that operate under demand uncertainty. Execution policies with different levels of flexibility - defined as the degree of freedom to which decisions can be adjusted at the executional level - are obtained by controlling the stickiness level of the different decisions as the decision maker transitions from the <b>tactical</b> <b>plan</b> to the executional plan. Robustness is used as a metric to measure the ability of a system to withstand random changes. <b>Tactical</b> <b>plans</b> with various degrees of robustness are obtained through the use of robust optimization. The performances of <b>tactical</b> <b>plans</b> with various degrees of robustness and execution policies with different levels of flexibility are evaluated through simulation. Results from the analysis on the distribution system show that the optimal level of robustness required from a <b>tactical</b> <b>plan</b> to achieve the lowest expected total cost decreases as the flexibility level of the system increases. Finally, the analysis on the military logistics system shows that the effect of increasing the flexibility level of the execution policy on the performance of the system depends on the uncertainty level of the demand. by Atikhun Unahalekhaka.

At midday, while Beauregard was still unclear about the direction his Union opponent was taking in the battle, Johnston decided that the critical point was {{to the north of}} his headquarters (the Lewis house, [...] "Portici"), at Henry House Hill. He abruptly announced [...] "The battle is there. I am going." [...] Beauregard and the staffs of both generals followed his lead and rode off. Johnston encountered a scattered unit, the 4th Alabama, all of whose field grade officers had been killed, and personally rallied the men to reinforce the Confederate line. He consoled the despairing Brig. Gen. Barnard Bee and urged him to lead his men back into the fight. (General Bee's exhortation to his men was the inspiration for Stonewall Jackson's nickname.) Beauregard then convinced Johnston that he would be more valuable organizing the arrival of reinforcements {{for the remainder of the}} battle than providing at-the-front tactical leadership. Although Beauregard managed to claim the majority of public credit, Johnston's behind-the-scenes role was a critical factor in the Southern victory.
