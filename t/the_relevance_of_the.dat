5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in energy {{efficiency}} and <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E
5|$|Immigration {{became an}} {{important}} issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish nationalism issue, immigrants {{were considered to be}} a threat to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 157 {{requires}} disclosures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fair value}} hierarchy (FVH) of assets and liabilities for financial reports issued after November 15, 2007. This dissertation examines <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FVH across a set <b>of</b> industry sectors. <b>The</b> {{results suggest that the}} FVH is value relevant for all industry sectors. However, although <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> value <b>relevance</b> varies across industry sectors, <b>the</b> relative amount <b>of</b> assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as a ratio to total assets and liabilities, does not influence <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FVH. This study also examines <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> several other characteristics <b>of</b> firms on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FVH across industry sectors. Its main findings suggest that book-to-market equity and a firm's status (as entering or incumbent) influence <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FVH. The dissertation also finds some evidence that a firm's size and firm's status are related and that the firm's size may also influence <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FVH. This dissertation is unable to find a clear pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> liquidity (as measured by both the quick ratio and cash flow from operations) on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Level 3 fair value of assets across industry sectors...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> a firm's debt financing decision on <b>the</b> informativeness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> income statement. This study specifically examines {{the association between}} a firm's bank dependence and <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> income statement by investigating <b>the</b> income-statement conservatism <b>of</b> firms with bank loans. Focusing on relatively small businesses, this study finds that income-statement conservatism, measured as timely loss recognition, is increasing in a firm's bank dependence. This study also finds that <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> income statement is increasing in a firm's bank dependence. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> this paper suggest that <b>the</b> usefulness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> income statement varies with a firm's bank dependence, indicating that <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> income statement {{is a function of}} a firm's debt financing decision. The findings further suggest that bank relationships affect <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> income statement through their influence on income-statement conservatism.

5|$|In {{a review}} of the book for the journal International Criminal Justice Review, Robert M. Worley of Penn State Altoona {{comments}} favorably on the comprehensive nature of Melzer's research and his descriptions of the differences of the practice of targeted killing in varying countries. Worley comments on <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book to scholars in various fields, including history, law, law enforcement, and terrorism analysis. Worley concludes his review by recommending the book for those with a fascination in researching criminal justice or the law. William Abresch comments favorably on Targeted Killing in International Law, in a review for the European Journal of International Law. He writes that the book is an important addition to the field of scholarship regarding how international law governs the practice of targeted killing. Abresch calls the author's writing style logical, and praises the book's organizational structure including its separate sections on use of targeted in war contrasted with use by police.|$|E
5|$|To {{convert the}} {{backlink}} data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into {{a measure of}} importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized {{that it could be}} used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network. After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 19 October 2011, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean explained <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ISA and {{its powers}} of preventive detention. He {{noted that in}} the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations. For the past two decades, though, preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism. Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat, {{as opposed to a}} criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge. Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive action to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm. In addition, the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence. Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court. What is more, disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering. However, if confidential information were withheld from the court, a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements, which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused. Finally, court proceedings may stall investigations {{as part of a broader}} network, and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved.|$|E
