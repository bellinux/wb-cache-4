5|$|With {{darkness}} falling, Sally and Franklin {{set out to}} {{find their}} friends. As they near the neighboring house and call out, Leatherface lunges from the darkness and kills Franklin with a chainsaw. Sally runs <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and finds the desiccated remains of an elderly couple upstairs. She escapes from Leatherface by jumping through a second-floor window and flees to the gas station. The proprietor calms her with offers of help but then ties her up, gags her and forces her into his truck. He drives to the house, arriving {{at the same time as}} the hitchhiker, now revealed as Leatherface's brother. The hitchhiker recognizes Sally and taunts her.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{learns that}} Derek and Sharon {{will be going}} away from town for a few days, with Sharon leaving one {{afternoon}} and Derek the next day. While Sharon is {{on her way to}} pick up Kyle, she realizes she forgot to set the alarm system and returns home. Meanwhile, Lisa breaks into Derek and Sharon's house again and decorates the master bed with rose petals. While setting the alarm, Sharon hears Lisa in the bedroom. She confronts Lisa, who tries to convince her that Derek was seeing Lisa. However, Sharon sees through her lie and attempts to call the police, but Lisa tackles her to the floor, and the two engage in a fistfight. Derek calls the home phone and Lisa answers; he calls Detective Reese and they both head <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Lisa runs to the attic and Sharon pursues her. Sharon leads her to a weak spot in the attic floor, where Lisa falls through. Seeing that Lisa is in mortal danger, Sharon reaches out in an attempt to grab Lisa and lift her up, but Lisa refuses and tries to pull Sharon down with her. Seeing that the floor is beginning to buckle, Sharon pries Lisa off of her arm. Lisa falls and smashes onto the glass table below. A chandelier falls from the ceiling onto Lisa, eventually killing her. Detective Reese arrives as Sharon comes out of the house. As soon as Detective Reese goes inside the house to investigate Lisa's actions, Derek soon arrives; he and Sharon then tearfully embrace one another.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} side of the house, Pam leads Vic into the garden toward a pond with a statue of Ellen in it. She {{suddenly}} disappears. When Vic looks down into the pond, he sees what he believes to be Pam's dead body. He attempts to pull her out of the water, but the body vanishes and he is left clutching only her nightgown. He panics and runs back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Looking back, he sees the statue come to life and has a heart attack. Vic tries to draw the attention of Emery (who is inside the house), but Emery again believes this to be an apparition and refuses to open the window. Nick arrives and tries to open the window, but it will not open and the glass cannot be broken. Vic collapses and dies in full view of Emery and Nick. Out in the woods, Mrs. Waterman is stopped and knocked unconscious by the ghost of Kevin Bollinger.|$|E
500|$|She went to {{the garage}} and saw Fischer's body lying face up on the driveway. She told her {{daughter}} Kathy to call 911, and her father, Buddy, who lived a few minutes away. Buddy dressed and headed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> He took a shortcut off Texas highways 77 and 83 to reach the house, and recalled going over [...] at some point, and brushing off a few cars along the way by gesturing with his left hand. Once he reached Rancho Viejo, he ignored the entrance and drove instead through a field of palm trees. As he drew closer to Fischer's house, he heard police sirens at a distance. When he arrived, he saw his son's body holding a garden hose. The running water had covered the entire roadway with Fischer's blood. Witnesses, including Eric, recall seeing a short-bearded Hispanic man in his mid-20s driving a white, four-door vehicle with Mexican license plates speeding away after the attack. Kathy then phoned one of Fischer's closest friends before school started {{and asked him if}} he knew if Fischer had any enemies. Fischer's friend could not think of anyone who disliked him, and only recalled that he and Fischer had been in an altercation with a group of boys at a football game.|$|E

2500|$|The capitaine {{maintains}} {{control over}} the Mardi Gras. [...] He issues instructions to the riders as they assemble {{early in the morning}} and then leads them on their run. [...] When they arrive at a farm house, he obtains permission to enter private property, after which the riders may charge <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> where they sing, dance, and beg until the owner offers them an ingredient for a gumbo. Often, the owner will throw a live chicken into the air that the maskers will chase, like football players trying to recover a fumble. By mid to late afternoon, the courir returns to town and parades down the main street on the way to the location where the evening gumbo will be prepared.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{encounter}} {{between the two}} sides was between the vanguard of the British force and a picket guard consisting of a sergeant and his squad. [...] The picket engaged the British, but was quickly overwhelmed by the horsemen and captured. [...] The British cavalry then rode on <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> where Captain Roberts and his company had already arrived and taken up a position on the house's right. [...] After exchange fire at long range, the cavalry halted to wait for the infantry, which arrived {{at about the same time}} as Captain-Lieutenant Farley's company; the companies of Stoddard and Cooper did not arrive in time to participate. [...] A hot fire then began between the three American companies and the British force which lasted about 15 minutes. [...] The numerically superior British flanked the Americans and successfully occupied the orchard that was behind the house. [...] Roberts was mortally wounded, and the American line broke, with some men fleeing into the house, while others tried to escape into the countryside. [...] The men in the house held out a little longer, but the British infantry forced their way in and captured the surviving occupants, while the cavalry chased down stragglers outside.|$|E
