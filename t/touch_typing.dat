25|$|<b>Touch</b> <b>typing</b> is typing on a {{keyboard}} without using {{the sense of}} sight to find the keys. Specifically, a touch typist will know their location on the keyboard through muscle memory. <b>Touch</b> <b>typing</b> typically involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along {{the middle of the}} keyboard (the home row) and having them reach for other keys. <b>Touch</b> <b>typing</b> was invented in 1888 by Frank Edward McGurrin, a court stenographer from Salt Lake City, Utah.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{games are}} games that are {{designed}} primarily to convey information or a learning experience to the player. Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game {{in the traditional sense}} of the term. Educational software does not typically fall under this category (e.g., <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> tutors, language learning programs, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear {{to be based on the}} title's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule. Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as exercise games, educational games, or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.|$|E

A former professor noted that she [...] "stood out from the empty-headed, overdressed little sorority girls of that era like a good piece of literature on a shelf of cheap paperbacks." [...] She held part-time jobs on campus, worked as a sales clerk in Bullock's-Wilshire department store, and taught <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> and shorthand at a high school. She also supplemented her income by working as an extra and bit player in the film industry, for which she took several screen tests. In this capacity she made brief appearances in the films Becky Sharp (1935), The Great Ziegfeld (1936), and Small Town Girl (1936). (People have spotted her in the 1936 Dancing Pirate as well.) In some cases she ended up on the cutting room floor, such as with her spoken lines in Becky Sharp. She told Hollywood columnist Erskine Johnson in 1959 that her time in films was [...] "too fleeting even for recollections embellished by the years" [...] and that [...] "my choice of a career was teaching school and the many jobs I pursued were merely to help with college expenses." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{what has}} been called [...] "a brief moment of {{remarkable}} creativity", in 2000, Sega restructured its arcade and console development teams into nine semi-autonomous studios headed by the company's top designers. Studios included United Game Artists (UGA) (headed by former Sega Rally Championship producer Tetsuya Mizuguchi), Hitmaker (headed by Crazy Taxi creator and future Sega president Hisao Oguchi), Smilebit (headed by Shun Arai and including many former Panzer Dragoon and future Yakuza developers from Team Andromeda), Overworks (headed by Noriyoshi Oba and composed of developers from Sega franchises including Sakura Wars, Shinobi and Streets of Rage), Sega AM2 (Sega's most famous arcade studio and the developer of Sega's Virtua Fighter fighting game series, headed by the company's top developer, Yu Suzuki), and Sonic Team (the developer of Sega's flagship series, Sonic the Hedgehog, headed by Yuji Naka). Sega's design houses were encouraged to experiment and benefited from a relatively lax approval process, resulting in titles such as Rez (an attempt to simulate synaesthesia {{in the form of a}} rail shooter), The Typing of the Dead (a version of The House of the Dead 2 remade into a <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> trainer), Seaman (a pet simulator in which players use a microphone to interact with a grotesque humanoid fish whose growth is narrated by Leonard Nimoy), and Segagaga (a Japan-exclusive role-playing-game employing commentary on the perceived over-abundance of sequels produced by the video game industry, in which players are tasked with preventing Sega from going out of business). Sega also revived franchises from the Genesis era, such as [...] Sega's internal studios were consolidated starting in 2003, with Mizuguchi leaving the company following the merger of UGA with Sonic Team.|$|E
50|$|<b>Touch</b> <b>typing</b> (also called touch type or touch keyboarding) is typing {{without using}} {{the sense of}} sight to find the keys. Specifically, a touch typist will know their {{location}} on the keyboard through muscle memory. <b>Touch</b> <b>typing</b> typically involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along {{the middle of the}} keyboard (the home row) and having them reach for other keys. Both two-handed <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> and one-handed <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> are possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{typing speed}} can be {{increased}} gradually and speeds of 60 WPM or higher can be achieved. The rate of speed increase varies between individuals. Many websites and software products are available to learn <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> {{and many of these}} are free. Learning <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> can be stressful both to the fingers as well as the mind in the beginning, but once it is learned to a decent level, it exerts minimal stress on the fingers. For individuals with past typing experience, learning to touch type is particularly difficult due to motivational reasons: the initial performance level in <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> is far lower than in visually guided typing; therefore it does not initially seem worthwhile to study <b>touch</b> <b>typing.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background 2 ̆ 6 Aims: Caregivers {{are more}} likely to touch their infants while {{speaking}} about an abstract topic than while speaking about a physically present object (Dueker, Portko 2 ̆ 6 Zelinsky, 2011). The current study will examine whether <b>touch</b> characteristics, utterance <b>type</b> or their interaction consistently predict the topic of infant-directed speech (IDS). Method: Adult-infant dyads were given objects and topic cards to use while interacting. Interactions were recorded and transcribed. Utterances were coded for topic, presence of <b>touch,</b> <b>type</b> and quality of <b>touch,</b> and utterance <b>type</b> (e. g. declarative, interrogative). Proposed Analyses: Data will be analyzed for patterns within aspects of <b>touch</b> and utterance <b>type</b> and interactions between aspects of <b>touch</b> and utterance <b>type.</b> Discussion: Results could reveal patterns of cues present during adult-infant interactions that predict the topic of IDS. Patterns may be used by the pre-verbal infant to disambiguate the referent of adult speech...|$|R

50|$|An audio typist {{is someone}} who specialises in typing text from an audio source which they listen to. The source, or {{original}} document is usually recorded onto microcassettes created by someone dictating into a Dictaphone.
