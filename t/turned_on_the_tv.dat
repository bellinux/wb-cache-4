50|$|Gina {{possesses}} several phobias, including wind chimes, shower curtains, sculptures depicting children, mountain lions, the wind, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and killer bees.

And she is a sterling example of pop survival. In a firmament that eats up artists like popcorn and where chart success is as fleeting as Jessica Simpson's attention span, Madonna remains an inspiring, intimidating beacon of permanence. Her longevity has thrived on her ability to continually reinvent herself by reading the winds of pop culture and taking her cue from there.|$|R

50|$|Several {{problems}} exist {{with regard}} to on-screen displays. One of them is diagnostics if a television's display system is damaged. Without any external screens, {{it is almost impossible}} (without opening <b>the</b> <b>TV)</b> to determine <b>the</b> source of <b>the</b> error. <b>TV</b> accessories that depend heavily on OSDs, such as VCRs or DVD players, are also difficult to configure without the use of a TV. On older VCRs, it was possible to program recording timers without <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TV; a modern VCR requires <b>the</b> user to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> to do so. Usability is generally also decreased with OSDs, as it is necessary to control a multitude of parameters with a few buttons, where earlier, real analog controls with mechanical feedback were available.|$|R

In addition, the volume buttons would be mapped to the sound system, the channel buttons would be mapped to the digital set to box, and other controls to the most appropriate system component for the activity.|$|R
50|$|Derrick {{falls into}} a slump until E.J. tells him to stop acting like him and start acting like himself. Derrick goes on to pass his Bar Exam, {{get a job and}} get a nice apartment. While {{unpacking}} he <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>T.V</b> and sees Jhnelle on screen at an award show. Inspired, he calls up E.J and they go posing as seat fillers. While she's performing, Derrick and the other seat fillers begin to stand up holding white carnations, inspired by a story Jhnelle once told him about her grandparents. He tries to walk up to her but is stopped by security. She tells them to wait and goes to him and the two embrace.|$|R
5000|$|Within days of release, {{controversy}} surrounded this album, revolving {{especially around}} anti-homosexual subject matter.

I address it hard as hell.” ...|$|R
