40|$|The {{continued}} {{presence of}} arm and wrist-oriented musculoskeletal disorder risk factors on <b>the</b> seat-sewing <b>line</b> at Company XYZ is placing the organization {{at risk of}} incurring continued employee illness and other productiOn/financial forms of loss. The past four years of OSHA recordable injuries, the results of the ergonomic-based risk factor assessment methods of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment(REBA), and an employee symptom survey were compared to recognition and remediation measures for musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) that have been identified in professional literature on the topic. The research results indicate that awkward postures, high repetition, and small-range motions are all present in <b>the</b> <b>top-stitch</b> sewing process. Upper extremity injuries relating to MSDs were the only causes of lost time away from work in <b>the</b> sewing <b>line</b> for <b>the</b> past four years. <b>The</b> seat-sewing <b>line</b> currently has several administrative and engineering controls in place to prevent the occurrence of cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs), but the system is new and has an absence of enforcement and education. The conclusions of this research are that a 3 selection of administrative and engineering controls that educate the workers and physically remove the risk factors from the seat-sewing process can be implemented to reduce the ergonomic-related risk factors that are present while workers perform <b>the</b> <b>top-stitch</b> activity. ...|$|R
