40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on banks performance in Nigeria using annual panel data set over 2001 to 2011 periods. The data was analysed using panel unit root, panel cointegration, Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) and Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) to reveals a positive impact of ICT on banks performance in the country. Therefore, the study concludes that cautious application of ICT apparatus will continue <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>commercial</b> banks <b>performance</b> in the country unless otherwise disrupted by externalities. The implication of this finding exposes the potentiality of cashless economy in Nigeria for strengthening the efficacy of financial system. Accordingly, the Central Bank of Nigeria’ cashless policy is an initiative at the right direction since it will help in minimising the cost of issuing currency in the fairly performing Nigerian economy. We recommend that there {{is the need for}} orienting the populace about the benefit of ICT product on banking operation in particular and the economy in general. In order to promote more patronage of ICT equipments {{on the one hand and}} enhance banking culture on the other hand, concerted efforts must be made to translate the ICT device language into the major local languages so that client can find it user-friendly at the midst of prevailing high rate of illiteracy in the country. ...|$|R
40|$|Orientation: The {{commercial}} {{growth of}} sport clubs {{is often a}} direct consequence of the level of engagement of its fans. However, limited research has been done to understand how the engagement experience of these fans could be enhanced. Research purpose: The objective of this research was to evaluate whether differences exist amongst groups of sport fans in terms of their levels of engagement. This is conducted on the basis of customer engagement – relationship marketing – and market segmentation theories,and in an effort to inform practical strategies {{that could be used to}} leverage engagement. By establishing that differences do exist between segments of sport fans, practical strategies could be developed based on such differences. Research approach, design and method: A cross-sectional, quantitative design was utilised in this study. A convenience sample of 430 adult fans of one of South Africa’s largest and best supported professional football clubs participated in the study. Two fan groupings were compared, namely fans who belonged to a formal supporters’ branch of the club versus fans who did not, and fans who frequented the social media platforms of such club versus fans who did not. Multi group confirmatory factor analysis and latent variable modelling were implemented to compare groups of fans in terms of sport fan engagement. Measurement invariance was reviewed to compare the equivalence of measurement between the groups. Main findings: Statistical analysis revealed greater levels of fan engagement amongst fans that form part of formal supporters’ branches as well as amongst fans who regularly visit the sport club’s social media platforms. Practical/managerial implications: By making use of supporters’ branches and social media,practical engagement strategies are available to professional sport clubs that seek <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> the engagement experience of their fans. These strategies could assist clubs in developing customised intervention programmes specifically for this purpose. Contribution/value-add: The study puts forward practical suggestions with regards to engagement strategies that professional sport clubs can consider in their efforts <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> the <b>commercial</b> <b>performance</b> of their teams through greater engagement. </p...|$|R
40|$|This report fully summarises {{a project}} {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>commercial</b> real estate <b>performance</b> within both operational and investment contexts {{through the development}} of a model aimed at supporting improved decision-making. The model is based on a risk adjusted discounted cash flow, providing a valuable toolkit for building managers, owners, and potential investors for evaluating individual building performance in terms of financial, social and environmental criteria over the complete life-cycle of the asset. The ‘triple bottom line’ approach to the evaluation of commercial property has much significance for the administrators of public property portfolios in particular. It also has applications more generally for the wider real estate industry given that the advent of ‘green’ construction requires new methods for evaluating both new and existing building stocks. The research is unique in that it focuses on the accuracy of the input variables required for the model. These key variables were largely determined by market-based research and an extensive literature review, and have been fine-tuned with extensive testing. In essence, the project has considered probability-based risk analysis techniques that required market-based assessment. The projections listed in the partner engineers’ building audit reports of the four case study buildings were fed into the property evaluation model developed by the research team. The results are strongly consistent with previously existing, less robust evaluation techniques. And importantly, this model pioneers an approach for taking full account of the triple bottom line, establishing a benchmark for related research to follow. The project’s industry partners expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the project outcomes at a recent demonstration seminar. The project in its existing form has not been geared towards commercial applications but it is anticipated that QDPW and other industry partners will benefit greatly by using this tool for the performance evaluation of property assets. The project met the objectives of the original proposal as well as all the specified milestones. The project has been completed within budget and on time. This research project has achieved the objective by establishing research foci on the model structure, the key input variable identification, the drivers of the relevant property markets, the determinants of the key variables (Research Engine no. 1), the examination of risk measurement, the incorporation of risk simulation exercises (Research Engine no. 2), the importance of both environmental and social factors and, finally the impact of the triple bottom line measures on the asset (Research Engine no. 3) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on commercial transformation of smallholders makes little distinction between market orientation (production {{decision based on}} market signals) and market participation (sale of output). However, policy implications <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>commercial</b> transformation of subsistence agriculture drawn from {{the analysis of the}} determinants of household market participation alone could be inadequate, if in fact, the determinants of market orientation and market participation are not the same or not consistent with each other. This paper analyzes the determinants of market orientation and market participation in Ethiopia separately and examines if market orientation translates into market participation. Empirical results show that the determinants of market orientation and market participation in crop output markets are not the same, but market orientation translates strongly into market participation.

40|$|Geographic data, {{stored and}} {{processed}} in a GIS, form a conceptual {{model of the}} real world. The abstraction {{of the real world}} to construct the conceptual model unavoidably results in differentiation between objects of the real world and their representation in GIS (i. e., computer). Since classical set theory is used in conventional GIS software systems to model uncertain real world, the natural variability in the environmental phenomena can not be modeled appropriately. Because, pervasive imprecision of the real world is unavoidably reduced to artificially precise spatial entities when the conventional crisp logic is used for modeling. In this study, a system <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>commercial</b> GIS software, namely ArcGIS r ○, with fuzzy set theory is designed and implemented. The proposed system allows users to (a) incorporate human knowledge and experience in the form of linguistically defined variables into GIS-based spatial analyses, (b) handle imprecision in the decision-making processes, and (c) approximate complex ill-defined problems in decision-making processes and classification. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{mechanistic}} model of microalgae {{is used to}} explore the implications of modifying microalgal chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency with an aim to optimizing commercial biomass production. The models show {{the potential for a}} ten-fold increase in microalgae productivity in genetically modified versus unmodified configurations, while also enabling the use of bioreactors of greater optical depth operating at lower dilution rates. Analysis suggests that natural selection of a trait benefiting the individual (high Chl:C; i. e. high antennae size) conflicts with artificial selection of a trait (low Chl:C) of most benefit to production at the population level. The implication is that GM strains rather than strains selected from nature will be most beneficial for commercial algal biofuels production. Further, escaped GM algae populations may, depending on the specific nature of the modification, be quickly out-competed by the natural forms because individually a high Chl:C is beneficial in low light environments. However, it remains possible that changes in biochemical composition associated with genetic modification of photosystem competence, or with other selection processes <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>commercial</b> gain, may adversely affect the value of such organisms as prey for zooplankton, leading to the unwanted generation of future harmful algae...|$|R

Several of the roadblocks and hurdles encountered and overcome in the development of BioPerl are examined through the telling of the history of the project. Along the way, key points of open-source law are explained, such as license choice and copyright.

Four distinct breeding lines of B. juncea obtained from an introduced accession of Indian origin were planted out in a randomized complete block design and characterized for plant height, number of seeds per pod, pod length, leaf length, leaf width, petiole length, 1000 -seed weight, and days to first flowering. Five qualitative traits including seed coat color, stem pigmentation, leaf shape, stem pubescence, and susceptibility to lodging were also observed. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences among the breeding lines for the morphological characters studied.
