5|$|A six-page writeup {{about the}} {{building}} appeared in Architect and Engineer in December 1937. The article listed {{the owners and}} the structural engineer, but did not name the architect. In the early 1980s, geologist and architectural historian Gray Brechin discovered that Irvin Goldstine had designed the building; Brechin subsequently interviewed Goldstine regarding his career. An article about the discovery was printed in Metro Magazine, a defunct San Francisco magazine. Until that time, the building was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> by the Mallochs.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{station was}} opened on 10 October 1934, when the municipally owned company Akersbanerne had {{completed}} the Sognsvann Line from Majorstuen to Sognsvann. Residential areas at Sogn, Tåsen and Berg were starting to grow, in pace with a larger suburban development plan. Akersbanerne bought new property along the line, upon which new houses were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> by the Norwegian architect Kristofer Lange (1886–1977).|$|E
5|$|Insect {{walking is}} of {{particular}} interest as an alternative form of locomotion in robots. The study of insects and bipeds has a significant impact on possible robotic methods of transport. This may allow new robots <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> that can traverse terrain that robots with wheels may be unable to handle.|$|E

5|$|It is {{reported}} that this {{problem with the}} CL contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed,</b> such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 is {{the first}} Aston Martin model <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> and {{developed}} on Ford's aluminium VH (vertical/horizontal) platform. The body structure is composed of aluminium and composites melded together by mechanically fixed self-piercing rivets and robotic assisted adhesive bonding techniques. The bonded aluminium structure is claimed to possess {{more than double the}} torsional rigidity of its predecessor's, despite being 25 percent lighter.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Board of Professional Engineers {{announced}} in 2000 that the Aggie Bonfire met the requirements {{to be considered}} a complex construction project that should be regulated by state engineering laws. If Bonfire is resumed by the university in its former state, it will have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> and overseen by a professional engineer.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{architectural}} planning authorities {{continue to}} take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems, recycling rainwater, green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving.|$|E
5|$|The {{fifth-generation}} LS {{also features}} 3D-surround Mark Levinson audio with in-ceiling array speakers. Its next-generation, remote touch infotainment interface called Lexus Enform, is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to mimic smartphone operation, with support for handwritten input. Alongside the 12.3inch navigation display, the fifth-generation LS {{can be specified}} with an optional 24inch, colour HUD for the driver’s view. The fifth-generation LS will be launched in Japan {{at the end of}} 2017 and globally in early 2018.|$|E
5|$|Union Station is in {{downtown}} Erie on West 14th Street between Peach and Sassafras Streets. Designed by architects Alfred T. Fellheimer and Steward Wagner, {{it was the}} first Art Deco railroad station <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> and built in the United States. Previously, Fellheimer had been influential in the design of Grand Central Terminal in New York City, and both architects collaborated on several railroad stations for the New York Central Railroad, including Buffalo Central Terminal in 1929 and Cincinnati Union Terminal in 1933.|$|E

5|$|After the Order emerged victorious {{from the}} siege, it {{received}} {{financial support from}} Europe, which was used to construct the new capital city on the Sciberras Peninsula. The Italian engineer Francesco Laparelli was sent by the Pope to design the city's fortifications, which were designed along the Italian bastioned system. Laparelli's original design consisted of a bastioned enceinte, with nine cavaliers and a ditch. The city was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> along a grid plan, and was to include a naval arsenal and a Manderaggio (a harbour for small ships).|$|E
5|$|Bull's station {{building}} {{burned down}} in 1914 {{and was replaced}} two year later by a new. By then {{it was decided that}} the line past Lysaker would be upgraded and Lysaker became the first of many stations on the line <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> as an elevated station. The tracks were thereby placed elevated with an island platform with the station on the side, as the first station in Norway designed for double-track operation. The new station was designed in Baroque Revival by Adalbert Kielland at NSB Arkitektkontor. One year later the wooden bridge over Lysakerelven was replaced by a stone bridge.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was {{originally}} intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> by Mark Cerny, who had designed all {{the games in}} the series thus far, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game under Cerny's direction {{was to be a}} free-roaming title with puzzle elements that would see Crash travelling between different planets. In early 2000, when Universal approached Traveller's Tales to be the development team behind the game, they produced a 3-D rendered demo of Crash running through a volcanic level. Development of the game's engine began in mid-2000.|$|E

5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. The aim {{was to create a}} more accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work was provided by the rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> with the console's hardware limitations in mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the Dammasch State Hospital mental {{hospital}} {{opened on the}} west side of the community. Gordon House, the only house in Oregon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, was built in 1963 near what became Charbonneau and moved to the Oregon Garden in 2001. Wilsonville was flooded in 1964 and the first fire station was built in 1966. Wilsonville was incorporated as a city in 1969 with a population of about 1,000. In 1971, the planned community of Charbonneau on the south side of the river was annexed into the city the year after development began.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century the romantic medieval gothic style {{appeared}} as a backlash to the symmetry of Palladianism which brought certain changes to the city's appearance. Many of the new churches, for example, {{were built in the}} gothic style as were a number of new villas. Most of the new civic and retail buildings however continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> in the classical mode but along much more ornamented and elborate lines than their 18th century predecessors. However virtually all the new buildings were constructed using the local bath stone so the city continued to have a cohesive look. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, construction was able to develop incorporating steel as a building component.|$|E
30|$|JOD was {{established}} as an open access journal by the Organizational Design Community (www.orgdesigncomm.com) in 2011 and published its first volume in 2012. The overall aim of JOD {{was inspired by}} Herbert Simon’s (1969) comments on design in his influential book, The Sciences of the Artificial: “The natural sciences are concerned with how things <b>are.</b> <b>Design,</b> on the other hand, is concerned with how things ought <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Design</b> <b>is</b> changing existing situations into preferred ones.” Accordingly, JOD seeks papers {{that focus on the}} future (how organizations ought <b>to</b> <b>be)</b> and pertain <b>to</b> practice (how organizations can be re-designed and changed).|$|R

I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E
5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E
5|$|One Foot used Bournemouth to film some {{exterior}} sequences {{because of}} its favourable climate, easy access to London, and economical benefits relative to filming in the capital. After the first series was filmed, the housenear Pokesdown, Bournemouthwhich had been used for the Meldrews' house in location sequences, changed hands and the new owners demanded nearly treble the usage fees that the previous owners had asked for. Rather than agree to this, the production team decided {{to find a new}} house, and the first episode of the second series was rewritten to have the Meldrews' house destroyed in a fire (Filmed on waste ground in Northcote Road, Springbourne). This also gave the opportunity for a new interior set <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed,</b> as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.|$|E
