40|$|This {{proposal}} is submitted {{in response to}} a programmatic need at LLL for a supplier of 50 -cm targets (<b>tritided)</b> for the new RTNS-II facility. Previous letters of inquiry to Mound also delineate a need for recovery of tritium from expended RTNS-II targets. As explained in this proposal, the <b>tritided</b> target manufacturing and tritium recovery can be accomplished in an efficient and timely manner at Mound Facility. Mound has been a major tritium handling facility for over 20 yr. Multigram quantities of tritium are routinely handled in various production, recovery, research, and development processes. Mound is widely recognized as a leader in the design, installation, and operation of high-purity glovebox atmosphere systems, and tritium containment, effluent control, and waste packaging systems. Demonstrated performance and experience in these strategic technology areas makes this facility ideally suited for meeting LLL`s <b>tritided</b> accelerator target needs. After consolidation and evaluation of various inputs of information, the authors feel confident that Mound can fabricate and recover RTNS-II targets to meet LLL requirements. This proposal, therefore, outlines their plan for performing this work and requests that Mound Facility be designated by LLL as the fabrication and recovery site for large-diameter fully <b>tritided</b> accelerator targets...|$|R

It is found that the rate of swelling increases with increasing helium to metal ratio consistent with experimental observations on the swelling of metal <b>tritides.</b> Finally, the detailed defect structure due to the bubble growth was investigated.

The way of reducing storage temperature from 300 to 225 K or increasing the helium atoms diffusion barrier from 0. 81 to 1. 1 eV can effectively restrain bubbles growth and prolong lifetime of titanium <b>tritide</b> more than 4 times, which provides a useful reference to relevant experiment exploration and applications.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the linking of helium bubbles growing in aging metal <b>tritides.</b> Stresses created by neighboring bubbles {{are found to}} produce bubble growth toward coalescence. This process is interrupted by the fracture of ligaments between bubble arrays. The condition for ligament fracture percolates through the material to reach external surfaces, leading to material micro-cracking {{and the release of}} helium within the linked-bubble cluster. A comparison of pure coalescence and pure fracture mechanisms shows the critical HeM concentration for bubble linkage is not strongly dependent on details of the linkage process. The combined stress-directed growth and fracture process produces predictions for the onset of rapid He release and the He emission rate. Transition to this rapid release state is determined from the physical size of the linked-bubble clusters, which is calculated from dimensional invariants in classical percolation theory. The result is a transition that depends on material dimensions. The onset of bubble linkage and rapid He release are found to be quite sensitive to the bubble spacing distribution, which is log-normal for bubbles nucleated by self-trapping...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results on}} tritium effusion, {{along with the}} tritium depth profiles, from {{hydrogenated}} amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si) tritiated in tritium (T 2) gas at various temperatures and pressures are presented. The results indicate that tritium incorporation {{is a function of}} the material microstructure of the as-grown films, rather than the tritium exposure condition. The highest tritium concentration obtained is for a-Si:H deposited at a substrate temperature of 200 °C. The tritium content is about 20 at. % on average with a penetration depth of about 50 nm. In contrast, tritium occluded in the c-Si is about 4 at. % with penetration depth of about 10 nm. The tritium concentration observed in a-Si:H and c-Si is much higher than the reported results for the post-hydrogenation process. β irradiation appears to catalyze the tritiation process and enhance tritium dissolution in the silicon matrix. The combination of tritium decay and β-induced ionizations results in formation of reactive species of tritium (tritium atoms, radicals, and ions) that readily adsorb on silicon. The electron bombardment of the silicon surface and subsurface renders it chemically active thereby promoting surface adsorption and subsurface diffusion of tritium, thus leading to tritium occlusion in the silicon matrix. Gaussian deconvolution of tritium effusion spectra yields two peaks for a-Si:H films tritiated at high temperature (250 °C), one low temperature (LT) peak which is attributed to tritiated clusters and higher order <b>tritides,</b> and another high temperature peak which is attributed to monotritides.

Although the methods are, on the whole, fairly simple and straightforward, there is still a need for improvement. The same applies as far as the analysis of the tritium distribution is concerned. High resolution 3 H NMR spectroscopy of solutions is now a well established technique. However many compounds exist as solids which are either insoluble or sparingly soluble in organic solvents, consequently {{there is a need to}} develop high resolution 3 H NMR spectroscopy of solids. The thesis therefore consists of four chapters. The first is a review dealing with the properties of tritium, the various labelling methods and tritium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the second chapter an account is given of the way in which complex metal <b>tritides</b> and tritiated methyl iodide, an important reagent which enables one to introduce three tritium atoms in a single step and therefore obtain products of very high specific activity, are prepared.

Evolution of tritium and helium in the titanium <b>tritide</b> films {{over a period}} of four years was investigated using a thermal desorption technique, together with X-ray diffraction analysis. Results showed that desorption profiles of the tritium varied significantly with the evolution of He contents. Apart from the primary peak from tritium desorption located at a temperature between 610 and 840 K, another higher temperature tritium desorption peak (at ∼ 950 K) was observed, attributed to damages in the lattice structures induced by generation of 3 He bubbles. Release of helium in the <b>tritide</b> film became significant after a long term aging process (i. e., after a few years). Depending on the amount of the 3 He bubbles generated due to the decay of tritium, spectra of the thermal helium desorption showed five peaks in the range from room temperature to ∼ 1750 K, corresponding to different states of helium evolution during aging of the titanium <b>tritide</b> films.

40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} of nucleation, growth and clustering of helium bubbles within metal <b>tritide</b> alloys is of high {{scientific and technological}} importance. Of interest {{is the ability to}} predict both the distribution of these bubbles {{and the manner in which}} these bubbles interact at a critical concentration of helium-to-metal atoms to produce an accelerated release of helium gas. One technique that has been used in the past to model these materials, and again revisited in this research, is percolation theory. Previous efforts have used classical percolation theory to qualitatively and quantitatively model the behavior of interstitial helium atoms in a metal <b>tritide</b> lattice; however, higher fidelity models are needed to predict the distribution of helium bubbles and include features that capture the underlying physical mechanisms present in these materials. In this work, we enhance classical percolation theory by developing the dynamic point-source percolation model. This model alters the traditionally binary character of site occupation probabilities by enabling them to vary depending on proximity to existing occupied sites, i. e. nucleated bubbles. This revised model produces characteristics for one and two dimensional systems that are extremely comparable with measurements from three dimensional physical samples.

40|$|Effects of tritium {{content on}} crystal lattice, 3 He {{retention}} and structure evolution during aging of Ti tritides were investigated using X-ray diffraction, together with analysis of 3 He release. Phase transformation and lattice {{parameters of the}} Ti tritides varied apparently depending on tritium stoichiometry.

Variation of crystal lattice structures of α + δ, δ and ε phases in the Ti tritides has been investigated, and evolution of 3 He during aging is mainly governed by the finite defects of self-interstitial atoms, dislocation loops, 3 He bubbles, and dislocations created by formation and growth of 3 He bubbles. In the α + δ two phase region, the phase boundaries played an important role to accumulate 3 He bubbles and cause inter-bubble fracture.

40|$|International audienceThe {{modeling}} of the He- 3 bubble nucleation phase that occurs during {{the aging of}} metal tritides such as palladium <b>tritide</b> is undertaken using a cellular automaton describing the material at the atomic scale. In that model, using simple rules of cell state change, the physical phenomena involved in the bubble nucleation, namely tritium diffusion, formation of He- 3 by radioactive tritium decay, He- 3 diffusion, He- 3 self-trapping, bubble growth, influence of pre-existing trapping sites such as vacancies, are taken into consideration. Calculations steps are related to physical time through the decay of tritium atoms into He- 3 atoms which {{is characterized by a}} half-life of 12. 32 years. That work has shown that the bubble density and distribution are almost stable within a few days of aging - typically 5 - 10 -, whatever the input parameters, the system making created bubbles to grow thereafter instead of creating new ones. The reached bubble density is very dependent on the He- 3 mobility - related to temperature for instance - during the first days of aging. The smaller it is, the higher the density.

For such application, it {{is of paramount importance}} that the equilibrium dissociation pressure (Peq) of metal <b>tritide</b> be very low at room temperature and the temperature reaching Peq of 1 atm, (T 1 atm), not be too high. Thus, the thermodynamical properties related to the heat of formation of Zr-Ni deuteride instead of <b>tritide</b> were studied so as to find the best material. The composition of the Zr-Ni alloy used in this study was Zr 9 Ni 11, which was characterized by X-ray diffractometry. The Zr 9 Ni 11, activated in advance, was exposed to a given amount of deuterium at room temperature, and then the deuteride was heated stepwise to 300 ℃. Each temperature was kept constant for adequate time till Peq become constant. The data for both Peq and temperature were arranged by the van’t Hoff equation: lnPeq=(ΔHﾟ/RT) -(ΔSﾟ/R). Values of -ΔHﾟ= 24 ～ 25 kcal/mol[D 2] and -ΔSﾟ= 33 ～ 34 kcal/mol[D 2]・deg were obtained when atomic composition of deuteride was in the range from Zr 9 Ni 11 D 1 to Zr 9 Ni 11 D 3.
