5|$|However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> {{significant}} difference in Napoleon himself, {{in the way he}} holds himself. David's Napoleon is flamboyant, confident in his leadership of the French army, and in his ability to cross the Alps and defeat the Austrians in Italy. Delaroche's Napoleon is instead downcast, gaunt and embittered by the harsh cold. His eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness, his tiredness a result of the long and unstable trek.|$|E

The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E

After the Gunmen capture her, she reveals that he had been experimenting with the immune system of sharks and had been {{grafting}} pieces of shark onto his body in order to become a living host to a biological weapon. His research had been funded by Yves's arms dealing father, who had commissioned Fletcher to find her and prevent her from stopping his biological terrorism plot.

5|$|Napaljarri (in Warlpiri) or Napaltjarri (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one {{of sixteen}} used to denote the {{subsections}} or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people.

She is sometimes referred to as Wintjia Napaltjarri No.1; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> artist from the same region, Wintjiya Morgan Napaljarri (also called Wintjiya Reid Napaltjarri), who is known as Wintjiya No.2.|$|E

Aij Tjeng calls for his father, to discover the secret, but finds that he too has died.|$|E
