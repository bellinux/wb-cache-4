According to The Wrap's Umberto Gonzalez, Fox wants to relaunch the film as what <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Planet of the Apes and {{the details of the}} film are that New York City won’t be a maximum security prison, Snake's real name and a new villain. In March 2017 it was announced that Robert Rodriguez will direct the remake with John Carpenter producing.|$|E

5|$|At the 2011 World Cup, Wales {{reached the}} tournament semi-finals {{for the first}} time since 1987 where they lost 9–8 to France after a red card for captain Sam Warburton. The two teams met again in March 2012, where Wales needed a win to claim their third Six Nations Grand Slam in eight years, which <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> a 16–9 victory. This was {{followed}} immediately by an eight-match losing streak, which was eventually broken during the 2013 Six Nations, where Wales retained the Championship {{for the first time}} since 1979 wins. Wales reached the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Cup at the expense of hosts England, then lost 23–19 to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In late December 2009, The Walt Disney Company {{purchased}} Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. In October 2010, Walt Disney Studios {{bought the}} distribution rights for The Avengers and Iron Man 3 from Paramount Pictures, with Paramount's logo {{remaining on the}} films, {{as well as for}} promotional material and merchandise, although Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures is the only studio credited at the end of these films. Disney has distributed all subsequent Marvel Studios films. In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger from Paramount. The Incredible Hulk {{was not part of the}} deal, due to an agreement between Marvel and Universal, where Marvel owns the film rights and Universal owns the distribution rights, for this film as well as the right of first refusal to distribute future Hulk films. According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not bought the film distribution rights to the Hulk as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Paramount for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Disney wants for its own theme parks.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} schemes Pitt had for colonial expeditions was in West Africa where France had several lucrative but strategically unimportant bases. He was fighting against {{a great deal of}} scepticism in the British government, which saw Europe as the main venue of warfare and all other theatres as costly distractions. As an initial test of his strategy Pitt gained support for a British expedition proposed by a New York merchant Thomas Cumming to take the French trading station at Fort Louis on the Senegal River which <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> relative ease, carrying back a large amount of plunder to Britain. Subsequent expeditions also took out French posts at Gorée and on the River Gambia.|$|E
25|$|Barbary corsairs led attacks upon American {{merchant}} shipping {{in an attempt}} to extort ransom for the lives of captured sailors, and ultimately tribute from the United States to avoid further attacks, as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the various European states. Before the Treaty of Paris, which formalized the United States' independence from Great Britain, U.S. shipping was protected by France during the revolutionary years under the Treaty of Alliance (1778–83). Although the treaty does not mention the Barbary States in name, it refers to common enemies between both the U.S. and France. As such, piracy against U.S. shipping only began to occur {{after the end of the}} American Revolution, when the U.S. government lost its protection under the Treaty of Alliance.|$|E
