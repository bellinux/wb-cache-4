40|$|We {{need to set}} {{priorities}} for conservation because we cannot do everything, everywhere, at the same time. We determined priority areas for investment in threat abatement actions, in both a cost-effective and spatially and temporally explicit way, for the threatened mammals of the world. Our analysis presents the first fine-resolution prioritization analysis for mammals at a global scale that accounts for the risk of habitat loss, <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> required to <b>abate</b> this risk, the costs of these <b>actions</b> and <b>the</b> likelihood of investment success. We evaluated the likelihood of success of investments using information on the past frequency and duration of legislative effectiveness at a country scale. The establishment of new protected areas was <b>the</b> <b>action</b> receiving <b>the</b> greatest investment, while restoration was never chosen. The resolution of the analysis and the incorporation of likelihood of success made little difference to this result, but affected the spatial location of these investments...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLocal anesthetics {{effectively}} suppress pain sensation, {{but most}} of these compounds act nonselectively, inhibiting activity of all neurons. Moreover, their <b>actions</b> <b>abate</b> slowly, preventing precise spatial and temporal control of nociception. We developed a photoisomerizable molecule, quaternary ammonium-azobenzene-quaternary ammonium (QAQ), that enables rapid and selective optical control of nociception. QAQ is membrane-impermeant and has no effect on most cells, but it infiltrates pain-sensing neurons through endogenous ion channels that are activated by noxious stimuli, primarily TRPV 1. After QAQ accumulates intracellularly, it blocks voltage-gated ion channels in the trans form but not the cis form. QAQ enables reversible optical silencing of mouse nociceptive neuron firing without exogenous gene expression and can serve as a light-sensitive analgesic in rats in vivo. Because intracellular QAQ accumulation is a consequence of nociceptive ion-channel activity, QAQ-mediated photosensitization is a platform for understanding signaling mechanisms in acute and chronic pain...|$|R
50|$|Bedding {{increases}} {{accuracy in}} part by relieving stress on <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> <b>The</b> rifle's <b>action</b> will rarely sit flush in the stock without bedding. This causes <b>the</b> <b>action</b> to flex when tightening the bolts holding <b>the</b> <b>action</b> to <b>the</b> stock. The flexing results {{in a loss of}} accuracy. Bedding will create a flush surface for <b>the</b> <b>action</b> and prevent flexing. Bedding also reduces movement of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> in <b>the</b> stock. Without bedding, <b>the</b> <b>action</b> {{may be more likely to}} shift after a shot. If <b>the</b> <b>action</b> shifts and does not return to same spot in the stock the rifle will lose the ability to maintain zero.|$|R

40|$|Decisions {{need to be}} {{made about}} which {{biodiversity}} management actions are undertaken to mitigate threats and about where these actions are implemented. However, management actions can interact; that is, the cost, benefit, and feasibility of one action can change when another action is undertaken. There is little guidance on how to explicitly and efficiently prioritize management for multiple threats, including deciding where to act. Integrated management could focus on one management <b>action</b> to <b>abate</b> a dominant threat or on a strategy comprising multiple <b>actions</b> to <b>abate</b> multiple threats. Furthermore management could be undertaken at sites that are in close proximity to reduce costs. We used cost-effectiveness analysis to prioritize investments in fire management, controlling invasive predators, and reducing grazing pressure in a bio-diverse region of southeastern Queensland, Australia. We compared outcomes of 5 management approaches based on different assumptions about interactions and quantified how investment needed, benefits expected, and the locations prioritized for implementation differed when interactions were taken into account. Managing for interactions altered decisions about where to invest and in which actions to invest and had the potential to deliver increased investment efficiency. Differences in high priority locations and actions were greatest between the approaches when we made different assumptions about how management actions deliver benefits through threat abatement: either all threats must be managed to conserve species or only one management action may be required. Threatened species management that does not consider interactions between actions may result in misplaced investments or misguided expectations of the effort required to mitigate threats to species...|$|R
