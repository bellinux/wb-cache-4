Actually, many aspects justify {{the evolution of}} social informatics Framework {{and the development of}} the corporate social responsibility (CSR) behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - Inside the international framework of the European Union (EC, 2001), this research analyzes the interrelationship between corporate social responsibility and social informatics, centring in those aspects that influence more the firm activity, for example the information and communication technology (lCT) costs. Specifically, the CSR stimulates the knowledge sharing in firms and improve the professional practices in accordance with of sustainable development and the effective execution of its social, environmental, ethical and corporate governance priorities that satisfy the needs of different category of ICT stakeholders.

40|$|Purpose. Profit and {{profitability}} of any, including transport enterprises {{are the main}} economic indicators of the enterprise effectiveness. These indicators reflect the results and successful performance of the enterprise. On the other hand the enterprise effectiveness in the long term, assurance of rapid development and competitiveness is largely determined by the level of investment activity {{and the range of}} investment activity. The {{purpose of this study is}} the feasibility of the method to determine optimal investments volume for improving these or others (selectable by the management) principal economic indicators of the enterprise effectiveness. Methodology. The basis of the proposed methodology for determining the optimal investments volume is the theory of optimal control, in particular, the procedure of dynamic programming since a managed development process of the enterprise is a multiple stage. This procedure, using a phased plan, allows not only simplifying the solution of optimization problems, but also solving those, which are impossible to apply the methods of mathematical analysis. Findings. The expediency of performing the calculations to determine the optimal investments volume to ensure high rates of enterprise development was proved, it is a key to the effectiveness of the enterprise in the long term and it improves its competitiveness. Originality. It is shown that using methods of the optimum control theory one can calculate the minimum volume of capital investments for the improvement of economic indicators, which determine the enterprise effectiveness. The proposed method of calculation does not depend on the specific content of economic indicators. The effectiveness of this calculation method is demonstrated on a model example. Practical value. The proposed method of calculating the minimum volume of capital investments to improve the economic effectiveness of enterprises is quite simple, but at the same time enables, on the one hand, to determine priority directions of investment activity of the enterprise. On the other hand it improves the manageability and <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> enterprises, increases the head's confidence in the correctness of decisions...|$|E

Thus, on the 1 st of May 2004, ten other States became members of the EU, eight of them being from the Central and Eastern Europe. At 1 January 2007, now we know certainly, the European gates will be wide-open for Bulgaria and Romania, the number of country members being 27. A huge economic and social potential is created, due to the increasing number of State members (counting from 15 to 27), and implicitly, to the extension of the European Union territory (a growth of 30 % is registered); due to the population growth rate of 30 %, reaching a total amount of 478 million inhabitants, the equivalent of the same number of consumers within the economic sphere; due to the increasing rate of GDP of about 4. 5 % etc. There are multiple advantages generated by the {{integration process}} for the autochthonous economic environment, the most visible ones being: the easy access on an extended market; a greater <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> activities; a high rate of direct foreign investments; a great stability at the macroeconomic level; long term development etc. Despite the numerous advantages that the integration process implies, the expansion process of the European Union may determine a growth of the total cost generated by the risks to which local corporations from the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are submitted. Abiding by new governmental decrees introduced to obtain the matching of the national legislation to the acquis communautaire, represents a difficult and expensive process, but the costs resulting from the non-compliance may be more important. Thus, if business corporations from CEE intend to secure against the risk of non-compliance to the European legislation and to reduce the impact resulting from previous legislative changes, it is essential to understand and to consider certain risk areas made evident and carefully exploited by insurance companies; the present paper aims to point out this idea. ...|$|E

Corporate Social Responsibility and Disclosure practices in most developing countries remain fairly rudimentary and relatively few studies have focused on the corporate social responsibility disclosure practices in such countries.

In particular, it seeks to map current corporate social disclosure in annual reports and to understand various parties’ views of that practice and its possible future development. To achieve the aim and particular objectives of the study it was necessary to utilise more than one research method. Firstly, a descriptive method is used to provide an overview of accounting and its environment in a developing country, and the economic, social and political environment in Libya. Secondly, empirical evidence covering a five year period across a sample of private and public companies in Libyan environment is presented using content analysis to analyse the companies’ annual reports. Finally, an empirical survey by personally delivered and collected questionnaire of 303 participants in four groups of research participants (academic accountants, financial managers, government officials and investors) was performed to explore the views and perceptions regarding corporate social reporting in Libya. The content analysis showed that Libyan companies generally disclose some information related to social responsibility. However, the amount of information is low compared with counterparts in developed countries. Employee and community involvement are the themes that the companies disclose most information about. The findings from the questionnaire survey indicate that participants preferred social information to be disclosed in the annual report, ideally placed in a separate section.

A literature review provides the underpinning theory for {{sustainable development}} and corporate sustainability. The Capital Values Sustainability Framework is proposed as a conceptual model for use by individual firms engaged with sustainability initiatives. Focusing on the cruise industry, this thesis provides an assessment of sustainability reporting of 22 firms. In order to test the application of the proposed framework, a qualitative analysis of Carnival Corporation & PLC’s sustainability efforts is provided.

This framework provides a model for assessment and may prove valuable for firms developing sustainability initiatives that achieve both the business goals for corporate sustainability and the long-term intergenerational equity goals of sustainable development...|$|R
