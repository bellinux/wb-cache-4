5|$|Reserved and efficient, Ianto {{was often}} used by writers to add humorous asides to the episodes' scripts. The {{character}} becomes the main romantic interest of Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), {{who is the}} lead male of the series. Established to have had heterosexual relationships prior to the series, Ianto's story forms {{a part of the}} show's ongoing exploration of human sexuality. Expanded Universe material develops on Ianto's sexual orientation and <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> with Jack, describing Ianto as bisexual and his feelings for Jack as genuine love. Additionally, writers have used these other media to explore Ianto's characterisation; for example, some stories elaborate on Ianto's backstory, or provide insight into his feelings.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} defeats the Elite Four {{and enters the}} Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has {{defeated}} Alder and become the newest Pokémon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pokémon League, challenging the player to find him {{to take part in}} one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pokémon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pokémon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pokémon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake about <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between people and their Pokémon before leaving the castle on his captured Pokémon to a far-off land.|$|E
5|$|Amulets and idols {{fashioned}} from assorted natural materials have occupied an important place among many ethnic groups of Madagascar for centuries. Ody, personal amulets believed to protect or allocate powers to the wearer, were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. The name sampy {{was given to}} those amulets that, while physically indistinguishable from ody, were distinct in that their powers extended over an entire community. The sampy were often personifiedcomplete with a distinct personalityand offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo amassed twelve of the most reputed and powerful sampy from neighboring communities. He furthermore transformed <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools {{at the disposal of}} community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the leader's sovereignty and the integrity of the state which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampytwelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmologyand transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.|$|E

As stated by him, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist should promote the harmony between those natures according to certain standards. If <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material prevails over the others, the result is rude. If <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist is predominating, then <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> art becomes mannered. The style is <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> ideals.

40|$|Mediation is a {{peaceful}} method of third-party intervention in resolving {{regional and international}} crises without resorting to seemingly inevitable war. The literature on international mediation generally draws four contextual and process variables affecting the mediation outcomes. The three contextual variables are (a) <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dispute; (b) <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disputed parties; and (c) <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mediator. The process variable is the mediator strategies. Unlike international relations theorists focusing on explaining <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> war between states, most conflicts since 1945 have arisen within, rather than between, states, especially in Third World countries {{such as those in}} the African region. With this problem in mind, <b>the</b> research focus <b>of</b> this paper is to investigate the role played by third-party interveners in contemporary African civil conflicts within the same nation state by specifically assessing South Africa's mediating role (especially <b>the</b> facilitating role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former South African President Nelson Mandela) in resolving the Burundi civil conflict based on the above four variables suggested by mediation literature. <b>The</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dispute; <b>The</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Disputed Parties; <b>The</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediator; the Mediator Strategies; South Africa's Mediating Role in the Burundi Civil Conflict...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{economists are}} leaving the reservation. They are {{recruiting}} subjects in the field {{rather than in the}} classroom, using field goods rather than induced valuations, and using field context rather than abstract terminology in instructions. We argue that there is something methodologically fundamental behind this trend. Field experiments differ from laboratory experiments in many ways. Although it is tempting to view field experiments as simply less controlled variants of laboratory experiments, we argue {{that this would be a}} serious mis-characterization. What passes for “control ” in laboratory experiments might in fact be precisely the opposite if it is artificial to the subject or context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task.

Relations degraded rapidly, however, upon departure of officers for World War I in Europe; this changed <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between the races the most. The Haitian elite found the American junior and non-commissioned officers to be ignorant and uneducated.

25|$|As Clara Kaiser (1958) has {{indicated}} {{there have been}} numerous philosophical and theoretical influences on the development of social group work.

Early theoretical, research and practice efforts of Grace Coyle (1930, 1935, 1937, 1947, 1948), Wilber Newstetter (1935), and Neva Boyd (1935) {{paved the way for the}} advancement and development of social group work.|$|E

500|$|In English football, the {{relocation}} of teams away from their traditional districts is unusual because of <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between clubs and their fans: the local football club is regarded by most English football supporters {{as part of the}} local identity and social fabric rather than as a business that can be transplanted by its owners at will. As a result, any relocation plan would be strongly opposed by fans in the club's original area, and unlikely to succeed in most new locations due to the existence of established teams in most towns and cities that would already have secured the loyalty of local football fans.
