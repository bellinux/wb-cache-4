5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover from <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean {{than the rest}} of the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pacific.</b> This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{variability of}} mixed-layer salinity (MLS) is {{examined in the}} Pacific Ocean between 20 ° S and 60 ° N {{using a variety of}} data sources. Significant seasonal cycles were found in 5 regions: 1) <b>the</b> western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> 2) <b>the</b> northeastern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> and Alaska gyre, 3) the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) 4) an area of <b>the</b> central <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>north</b> of <b>the</b> Hawaiian Islands, 5) the central south Pacific along 10 – 20 ° S. The phase and amplitude of the seasonal cycle were determined. Amplitudes range from 0. 1 to > 0. 5. The largest amplitudes are in the tropical band and <b>the</b> western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific.</b> Maximum salinity is obtained in late (northern) winter in <b>the</b> western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> late winter and early spring in <b>the</b> northeastern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> early summer in the ITCZ area, late summer and early fall in <b>the</b> central <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> area and (northern) summer in the central South Pacific. Large areas of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> and Tropical <b>Pacific</b> have no significant seasonal variation in MLS. Seasonal variability of evaporation rate, precipitation rate and the difference between them (E-P) were calculated from the OAFlux and Global Precipitation Climatology Project datasets. Typical amplitudes of E-P are 0. 1 – 1 &times; 10 &minus; 4 kg m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 . The seasonal variability of E-P is largely dominated by variability in evaporation in <b>the</b> western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> and precipitation elsewhere. The largest amplitudes are in areas along the edge of <b>the</b> western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> and in <b>the</b> far eastern tropical Pacific around 10 ° N. Phases in these areas indicate maximum E-P in mid- to late winter in these areas of large amplitude. The closest correspondence between E-P and MLS is in the ITCZ. Some terms of the MLS balance were calculated, and found to have similar magnitudes, but very different distributions. Averaged over large areas in <b>the</b> western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> ITCZ, South <b>Pacific</b> and northern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> <b>the</b> seasonal cycle is a balance between changes in MLS, E-P, and entrainment, with advection playing a relatively minor role.
