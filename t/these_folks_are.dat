2500|$|With {{reference}} to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: [...] "he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> interrelated…. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all." [...] This quote clarifies {{the fact that the}} documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the [...] "Jesus son of Joseph" [...] and the [...] "Mariamne" [...] in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. {{that they did not have}} the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Peñalver {{said that}} [...] "A {{straight}} line {{runs from the}} 1930s sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, to the 1960 lunch-counter sit-ins to the occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists in 1969 to Occupy Wall Street. Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness {{to break the law}} and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences." [...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who says he has no idea what <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture".|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{nothing much}} to be done here in the meantime. <b>These</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> wasting labor and money plowing their little fields, but I reckon they're slow and stubborn. It wouldn't pay to hustle them yet." ...|$|E
50|$|According to the 1931 census in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the town's {{population}} included 1157 Danube Swabian Germans (the majority). <b>These</b> <b>folk</b> <b>were</b> {{almost all}} expelled by the Communist regime of Josip Broz Tito after 1945.|$|R
50|$|The Nittaewo are a lost race of dwarfish {{men said}} to {{have lived in the}} Mahalenama region now within the Yala East Intermediate Zone and the Tamankaduva area. <b>These</b> <b>folk</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to have been exterminated by the Veddas about 250 years ago.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing {{doing at}} the casino and the place was very hot," [...] he said. [...] "Besides, I don't quite trust {{the man who runs}} the bank. Taking them all round, <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> clever crooks." ...|$|E
6000|$|Actually a Scottish {{voice was}} in his ears, as {{he looked up and}} saw the turbaned head of Yusuf the {{merchant}} bending over him, and saying--'Wake up, my bonny laddie; we can hae our crack in peace while <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> taking their noonday sleep. Awed, and where are ye frae, and how do you ca' yersel'?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect they are, to some extent," [...] Bethune {{carelessly}} agreed. [...] "That kind {{of thing}} is hard to stop anywhere, and <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> very smart at petty pilfering. Anyway, you might get yourself into trouble by interfering and any small theft you stopped probably wouldn't pay for the time you'd have to spend on the job. Leave it alone, and take matters as you find them, is my advice." ...|$|E
5000|$|Josephus {{describes}} {{these men}} {{as a new}} kind of brigand. [...] "Rebellion against Rome took many forms. There were certain people that were known as bandits or robbers. These were not ordinary thieves. They were insurrectionists who robbed from the wealthy who supported Rome. <b>These</b> <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> often Robin Hood type figures who gained popularity with the people.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is the way}} we do it here. No time fooled away; nobody straggling {{in after}} the curtain's up. Wishing is quicker work than travelling. A quarter of a second ago <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> {{millions}} of miles from here. When they heard the last signal, {{all they had to do}} was to wish, and here they are." ...|$|R
60|$|The Loons--for so <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> called--had {{been doing}} many things, some playing together, some working at tasks and some {{gathered}} in groups to talk; {{but at the}} sound of strange voices, which echoed rather loudly through the clearing, all turned {{in the direction of the}} intruders. Then, in a body, they all rushed forward, running and bounding with tremendous speed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] snorted Miss Ella Stowbody, [...] "they've been fooling you, Mrs. Kennicott. There isn't {{any real}} poverty here. Take that Mrs. Steinhof you speak of: I send her our washing {{whenever}} there's {{too much for}} our hired girl--I must have sent her ten dollars' worth the past year alone! I'm sure Papa would never approve of a city home-building fund. Papa says <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> fakers. Especially all these tenant farmers that pretend they have so much trouble getting seed and machinery. Papa says they simply won't pay their debts. He says he's sure he hates to foreclose mortgages, but it's {{the only way to}} make them respect the law." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So Mr. Snake {{found that}} lying {{helped him to}} cheat and steal, {{and all the time}} he kept {{thinking}} how smart he was. But even Mr. Snake {{had a little bit of}} conscience, and once in a while it would trouble him. So what do you think he did? Why, cheating had become such a habit with him that he actually tried to cheat himself--to cheat his conscience! When he was telling a lie, he would wink one eye. 'That,' said he to himself, 'means that it isn't true, and if <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> not smart enough to see me wink and know what it means, it is their own fault if they believe what I am telling them.' But always he took care to wink the eye that was turned away from the one he was talking to.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{several of}} Pynchon's earlier works, Against the Day {{includes}} both mathematicians and drug users. [...] "As {{an era of}} certainty comes crashing down around their ears and unpredictable future commences, <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> mostly just trying to pursue their lives. Sometimes they manage to catch up; sometimes it's their lives that pursue them." ...|$|E
60|$|What seemed {{particularly}} odd to Rip <b>was,</b> {{that though}} <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> evidently amusing themselves, yet they maintained the gravest faces, the most mysterious silence, and were, withal, the most melancholy party of pleasure {{he had ever}} witnessed. Nothing interrupted {{the stillness of the}} scene but the noise of the balls, which, whenever they were rolled, echoed along the mountains like rumbling peals of thunder.|$|R

5|$|Felipe, {{being an}} exile himself, {{received}} any Filipino {{who came into}} their house. Thereafter, the place became a sanctuary for other Filipino revolutionary exiles. They initiated meetings in the Agoncillos' residence, especially during the critical months of March and April 1898. Among <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> Gen. Antonio Luna and Gen. Aguinaldo. Also, Josephine Bracken, Jose Rizal's fiancée, sought refuge in their house when the Spanish authorities threatened to torture her.|$|R
5000|$|Bush {{has often}} been invited to speak to audiences overseas. Bush says he has {{courtesy}} visits with world leaders but {{has no plans to}} wade into foreign policy. [...] "Oftentimes because of my father's goodwill, and because of the president being who he is, people might extend an invitation, and it's enjoyable for me," [...] Bush said. [...] "Some of <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> family friends." ...|$|E
5000|$|While the network's Web site or Facebook page doesn't {{specifically}} say conservatives, it's clearly {{designed for}} folks who might be upset with today's government. One of the RightNetwork shows was called [...] "Running," [...] which Grammer described as a reality show following six political rookies running for the first time. The theme through the promotional clip is that <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> running against [...] "polished politicians." ...|$|E
5000|$|Breen was {{notoriously}} anti-Semitic. In {{a letter}} to the Jesuit priest and then-editor of America, Rev. Wilfrid Parsons, Breen wrote that Hollywood consisted of [...] "a rotten bunch of vile people with no respect for anything beyond the making of money. Here we have Paganism rampant and in its most virulent form. Drunkenness and debauchery are commonplace. Sexual perversion is rampant...any number of our directors and stars are perverts. Ninety-five percent of <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> Jews of an Eastern European lineage. They are, probably, the scum of the earth." [...] His anti-Semitism had major effects on the way he conducted his role as chief censor of the American film industry.|$|E
6000|$|... "With a sorry hack {{one uses}} whip and spur, sire," [...] said Chandos; [...] "but with a horse {{of blood and}} spirit a good {{cavalier}} is gentle and soothing, coaxing rather than forcing. <b>These</b> <b>folk</b> <b>are</b> strange people, and you must hold their love, even as you have it now, for you will get from their kindness what all the pennons in your army could not wring from them." ...|$|R
6000|$|McNutt wiggled {{the toes}} of his good foot and {{regarded}} them reflectively. <b>These</b> city <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> surely the [...] "easiest marks" [...] he had ever come across.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{ought to}} have {{convinced}} them of her honesty," [...] remarked Fowler, with a note of amusement in his voice, [...] "but it didn't; <b>these</b> scientific <b>folk</b> <b>are</b> so difficult." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ben Brantley, in {{his review}} in The New York Times, called the play [...] "charming", writing [...] " [...] It is also smart, sad and so impossibly well-spoken you may feel like giving up on conversation.... is an elegy to a breed of woman, a style of living and a genre of theater of which only vestiges remain in frantic, self-promoting New York." [...] The USA Today {{reviewer}} called the play [...] "endearing", writing [...] "By the time Act Two unfolds -- 20 years later, in the same apartment -- {{we have learned that}} <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> all vulnerable to bad choices, the whims of fortune and the simple passing of time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Aziz's fictional {{experiences}} {{show how}} often individuals {{go to war}} {{for reasons other than}} fighting for a national cause. For Aziz and other Afghan characters in Green on Blue, fighting in the Special Lashkar is a source of much-needed income. For others, fighting becomes a way to fulfill their own desire for revenge on an enemy. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Ackerman notes that [...] "the reasons they were fighting were not particularly ideological...the reason why <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> fighting is they're caught up in cycles of violence, and cycles of need." [...] Green on Blue highlights the complicated and diverse motives surrounding why people go to war and the often self-serving reasons why war continues.|$|E
5000|$|Connor {{claimed that}} he posted no {{officers}} at the bus depot because of the holiday; however, it was later discovered that the FBI knew of the planned attack and that the city police stayed away on purpose. Patterson offered no apologies, explaining, [...] "When you go somewhere looking for trouble, you usually find it [...] [...] [...] [...] You just can't guarantee {{the safety of a}} fool and that's what <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are,</b> just fools." [...] When asked about Connor, Mann said [...] "He was in charge, Bull Connor {{was in charge of the}} police department in Birmingham at that point in time. He was police commissioner." [...] "his comment was that it was just absolutely ridiculous for those people to be in Alabama doing what they were doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jefferson smiled. [...] "We {{have had}} disputes. I reckon you know Austin and I send the Cayman across now and then. Sometimes she brings back sheep and barley and {{sometimes}} other goods. The trouble is the Spanish crew are not keen about anchoring on the Sahara coast; {{they know the}} Moros. But the fellows are not Moors, but Berbers of a sort. The true Berber is rather short and light; <b>these</b> <b>folk</b> <b>are</b> big and dark." ...|$|R

5000|$|David Nusair from Reel Film Reviews gave Trapped {{only one}} star out of five, he stated: [...] "Trapped doesn't really work, {{especially}} since we {{know exactly how}} <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> {{going to get out}} of the burning building (c'mon, would it even be possible not to realize that Meat Loaf's ride is going to work its way back into the plot?) and the characters are straight out of a how-to-create-a-disaster-movie handbook. And for a flick with this many characters, remarkably few of them wind up charred corpses." [...] Jules Faber from DVD.net gave the film 7 out of 10 stars, concluding: [...] "Trapped is perhaps one of this new breed of film with some decent performances and clever, well-executed special effects. While a far cry from Oscar-winning portrayals, this is nonetheless a surprisingly good production, regardless of the rather tacked on ‘arsonist’ subplot." ...|$|E
5000|$|One {{focus of}} inquiry is when Snyder {{became aware of}} the issue, and how much he knew about it. In a July 2015 email, Dennis Muchmore (then Snyder's chief of staff) wrote to a Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) official, [...] "I'm {{frustrated}} by the water issue in Flint. I really don't think people are getting the benefit of the doubt. <b>These</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> scared and worried about the health impacts and they are basically getting blown off by us (as a state we're just not sympathizing with their plight)." [...] In a separate email sent on July 22, 2015, MDHHS local health services director Mark Miller wrote to colleagues that it [...] "Sounds like the issue is old lead service lines." [...] These emails were obtained under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act by Virginia Tech researchers studying the crisis, and were released to the public {{in the first week of}} January 2016.|$|E
5000|$|President Barack Obama visited ARC Energy on February 2, 2010. He touted ARC Energy in {{his speech}} at Nashua North High School later that same day, [...] "That is why jobs will be our number one focus in 2010. And we’re going to start where most new jobs do - with small businesses. These are the {{companies}} that begin in basements and garages when an entrepreneur takes a chance on his dream, or a worker decides it’s time she became her own boss. They’re companies like ARC Energy, which I visited earlier today. <b>These</b> <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> {{hard at work on}} a new manufacturing process for ultra-efficient LED lights that will make them affordable for ordinary people. The technology they’ve created is the only {{of its kind in the}} world. They’re this little business in a condo out on Amherst Street, and they have the potential to revolutionize an industry. Right here in Nashua." ...|$|E
25|$|In 1939, local {{residents}} were made {{privy to the}} events of World War II. Conscripted residents were required to report for duty at a drill hall on Canterbury Road, Belmore. Camps were set up in and around Canterbury Racecourse and local parks in the district. Residents with foreign names were sent to internment camps as there was growing suspicion about residents with foreign names.
