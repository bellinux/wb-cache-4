5|$|For {{their efforts}} <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> given a week's leave: the {{airfield}} {{where they are}} based comes under enemy artillery bombardment; Bell receives a letter from his wife informing him that she has {{fallen in love with}} someone else and wishes to divorce; Captain Staros is relieved of his command by Lieutenant Colonel Tall, who deems him too soft for the pressures of combat and suggests that he apply for reassignment and become a lawyer in the JAG in Washington. He offers to arrange a Purple Heart for Staros, to avoid the unit's name being stained by having an officer removed from command. Witt comes across the locals and notices that they have grown distant and distrustful of him and quarrel regularly with one another.|$|E
5|$|Sudarto {{orders the}} chief executed, a deed which {{ultimately}} {{falls on the}} man's son. Afterwards the division continues west. One night, Sudarto's second-in-command Adam tells him that <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> restless over his relationship with Widya. They argue, and Widya– who has overheard everything– says that she will go. The following morning Dutch soldiers launch an ambush in which many are killed, including Widya and Adam. The division in dire straits, Sudarto offers to go to nearby Bandung on his own for the much-needed supplies, leaving his fellow officer Leo in charge. After meeting with resistance fighters who offer supplies, Sudarto goes to visit Connie and is captured by Dutch forces.|$|E

50|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 21 September 1995, five local <b>men</b> <b>were</b> arrested on {{suspicion}} of murder in co-ordinated early morning raids. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> taken to Nuneaton police station for questioning.

Olivia can only ask [...] "who are you?" ...|$|R
5|$|The {{makeshift}} raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, while <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds {{the corpse of}} his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.|$|E

Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends {{the next few days}} spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.|$|E
5|$|The boys of South Park Elementary School are anxiously {{awaiting}} the night's episode of Terrance and Phillip, {{which ended in}} a cliffhanger last season, while the girls at the school express disgust over the show and the boys' obsession with fart jokes. Cartman retaliates by farting in a little girl's face, which causes all the boys to laugh. After school, the boys gather in Cartman's house to watch the episode. To their horror, it is then revealed that, as an April Fools Day joke, the channel is airing a new show called the Queef Sisters, about Canadian sisters Katherine (voiced by Trey Parker) and Katie Queef (voiced by Matt Stone). They {{are very similar to}} Terrance and Phillip, but instead of fart jokes, they make queef jokes. The show starts a queefing movement across the country, and men everywhere get upset and disgusted by the queefs, although the women do not understand what the problem is. Though the women of South Park argue that there is no difference between queefing and farting, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> revolted by queefs, while still finding their own fart jokes amusing.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{taken for}} a stroll in the cloister of the hospital, and crossed Giulia Canella's path without showing any emotion or sign he {{recognized}} her. Canella stated that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> her husband beyond doubt. On a second attempt the day later, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> told his psychiatrists that he vaguely recognized the woman, and that some recollections were resurfacing in his mind. In the third meeting, the woman broke into tears, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> hugged her, apparently recognizing his wife. On the same afternoon, a fourth encounter convinced the doctors that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> indeed Canella, who told them about some vague recollections about his children. More encounters were scheduled to aid in memory recovery, but <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> now considered identified.|$|R
50|$|Three {{tests were}} {{conducted}} using penile plethysmography. While {{there was no difference}} in response when <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> exposed to heterosexual and lesbian pornography, there was a major difference in response when <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> exposed to male homosexual pornography.|$|R
60|$|Obviously <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> a hobo. <b>The</b> coffee boiling in a {{discarded}} tin can {{would have}} been proof positive of this without other evidence; but there seemed plenty more. Yes, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> a hobo. Billy continued to stand listening.|$|R

Infantry training <b>was</b> poor, since <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> considered to be purely artillerists.|$|R

60|$|A {{moment later}} the captain came on deck {{followed}} by Lowell. They gazed sharply about, and I was sure they were counting {{to see if any}} of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> missing, for presently the boatswain entered the forecastle to see if one of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>was</b> not there.|$|R
5000|$|Happy <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> an American {{progressive}} {{rock band}} formed in 1973.

60|$|Matt was now growing alarmed. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> just {{intoxicated}} {{enough to}} be thoroughly ugly, and might try to do him harm should he refuse the request which had been made.

25|$|Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly {{is unusual}} in that it not only depicts {{homosexual}} sex acts, but that it does so {{very early in the}} history of pornographic film. However, like most of the films which came after it, Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly only shows male-male sex acts as deviant, firmly establishes the heterosexuality of the characters, and often depicts the sex acts as essentially bisexual (e.g., male-male sexual contact occurs while <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> also having heterosexual intercourse).|$|E
