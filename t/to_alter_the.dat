40|$|In this study, two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the specificity of adaptation to real-time formant shifting. During the experiments, talkers were adapted <b>to</b> <b>altered</b> auditory feedback for one vowel (trained vowel) and received unaltered feedback for a different vowel (untrained vowel). In the first experiment, production of the untrained vowel was measured while the talker {{was in the process}} of adapting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> feedback for <b>the</b> trained vowel. In the second experiment, production of the untrained vowel was measured after talkers had adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> feedback for <b>the</b> trained vowel. In both experiments, talkers spontaneously modified production of the trained vowel in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> auditory feedback. In the first experiment, talkers slightly <b>altered</b> production of <b>the</b> untrained vowel while the trained vowel was adapting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> feedback. In <b>the</b> second experiment, production of the untrained vowel was not altered after talkers had completely adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> feedback of <b>the</b> trained vowel. These results suggest that the degree of generalization depends on the conditions of adaptation and on the information available about the acoustic environment. 1...|$|R

It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided <b>to</b> <b>alter</b> <b>the</b> course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be assured.
