5|$|Sarolt {{gave birth}} to {{at least three of}} Géza's children; Stephen, who succeeded his father on the throne, and two unnamed daughters. Sarolt survived Géza, which {{suggests}} that she was also the mother of Géza's daughters. Based on the Polish-Hungarian Chronicle, Szabolcs de Vajay wrote that the daughters' mother was Géza's alleged second wife Adelaide (Adleta) of Poland, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> widely accepted. The following family tree presents Géza's ancestry and his offspring.|$|E

5|$|Since devolution, {{in which}} other {{countries}} of the United Kingdom—Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England. Originally it was planned that various regions of England would be devolved, but following the proposal's rejection by the North East in a referendum, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> carried out.|$|E
5|$|Some {{claim that}} {{swooping}} {{can be prevented}} by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{association}} between the blood levels of homocysteine and thrombosis, although <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> reported consistently in all studies. Homocysteine levels are determined by mutations in the MTHFR and CBS genes, but also by levels of folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, which depend on diet.|$|E

5|$|This {{thumb is}} {{typically}} {{interpreted as a}} close-quarter stiletto-like weapon against predators, although it could also {{have been used to}} break into seeds and fruits, or against other Iguanodon. One author has suggested that the spike was attached to a venom gland, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> accepted, as the spike was not hollow, nor were there any grooves on the spike for conducting venom.|$|E
5|$|Two temples {{dating to}} Late Chikanel times had masonry-walled {{superstructures}} {{that may have}} been corbel-vaulted, although <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> proven. One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a scrollwork background, painted in yellow, black, pink and red.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried {{a higher rate of}} side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> confirmed. In absolute terms, {{only a very small}} proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females have short, {{straight}} fur that is relatively dense and without spots or patterns. Both sexes are generally a reddish-brown dorsally and colored a dirty cream ventrally. When in rut, they may have an orange coloration to their abdomen from a reddish substance secreted by a chest gland secretions, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> consistently observed by all researchers. The tail tends to be lighter in coloration than the sides. Juveniles are either gray or nearly white.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, {{although it is not}} clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E

5|$|Constantine's {{death in}} 952 is {{recorded}} by the Irish annals, who enter it among ecclesiastics. His son Indulf would become king on Malcolm's death. The last of Constantine's certain descendants to be king in Alba was a great-grandson, ConstantineIII (Constantín mac Cuiléin). Another son had died at Brunanburh, and, according to John of Worcester, Amlaíb mac Gofraid {{was married to a}} daughter of Constantine. It is possible that Constantine had other children, but like the name of his wife, or wives, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> recorded.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex, or even a direct ancestor through anagenesis. Gregory Paul reassigned D. torosus to the genus Tyrannosaurus, creating the new combination Tyrannosaurus torosus, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> generally accepted. Many researchers believe Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa or even {{to be the same}} genus, with Daspletosaurus a more basal relative. On the other hand, Phil Currie and colleagues find Daspletosaurus to be more closely related to Tarbosaurus and other Asian tyrannosaurids like Alioramus than to the North American Tyrannosaurus. The systematics (evolutionary relationships) of Daspletosaurus may become clearer once all the species have been described.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of bacteria that exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing {{of a large number}} of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E

5|$|Fluorine is not {{essential}} for humans or other mammals; small amounts may be beneficial for bone strength, but <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> definitively established. As there are many environmental sources of trace fluorine, {{the possibility of a}} fluorine deficiency could apply only to artificial diets. Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is fluoroacetate, which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon – adenosyl-fluoride synthase – was discovered in bacteria in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are found}} in the west, north, and east of Madagascar, but their {{distribution}} is discontinuous. Their habitat ranges from dry deciduous forests on the western coast of the island to rainforest in the east. They are also commonly found in secondary forest, but not in areas lacking continuous forest cover. They are most common in the west of the island. Fork-marked lemurs are not found in the southern spiny forests in the dry southern part of the island, and only recently have been reported from the southeastern rainforest at Andohahela National Park, though <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> confirmed. A team led by E.E.Louis Jr. has suggested that undescribed varieties may also exist elsewhere on the island.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{confluence}} of the Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers may have been a zone of hybridization between these two species, although no conclusive results have indicated current interbreeding. In general, the Antainambalana River appears to isolate the red ruffed lemurs from the neighboring subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, V. v. subcincta. The subspecies V. v. variegata can be found further south, and V. v. editorum is the southernmost subspecies. The ranges of these two southern subspecies overlap and intermediate forms are reported to exist, although <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> confirmed.|$|E
