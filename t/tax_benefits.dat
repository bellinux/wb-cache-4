5|$|Until 1976, {{federal tax}} {{incentives}} were virtually non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal <b>tax</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} FiFoSiM, {{the integrated}} <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> microsimulation and {{computable general equilibrium}} (CGE) model of the Center of Public Economics at the University of Cologne. FiFoSiM consists of three main parts. The first part is a static <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> microsimulation module. The second part adds a behavioural component to the model: an econometrically estimated labour supply model. The third module is a CGE model which allows the user of FiFoSiM to assess the global economic effects of policy measures. Two specific features distinguish FiFoSiM from other <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> models: First, the simultaneous use of two databases for the <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> module and second, the linkage of the <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> model to a CGE model...|$|R

50|$|Council <b>Tax</b> <b>Benefit</b> was a means-tested rebate that {{potentially}} rebated 100% of a claimant's council tax bill. The rebate {{would be reduced}} by a fifth of any qualifying income above a certain level; benefits did not qualify for this calculation, but most other income did. In effect, Council <b>Tax</b> <b>Benefit</b> was a rebate for people with low incomes.|$|R
5|$|In 1038, Kraków {{became the}} seat of the Polish government. By the end of the 10th century, the city was a leading centre of trade. Brick {{buildings}} were constructed, including the Royal Wawel Castle with St. Felix and Adaukt Rotunda, Romanesque churches such as St. Adalbert's, a cathedral, and a basilica. The city was almost entirely destroyed during the Mongol invasion of 1241. It was rebuilt practically identical, based on new location act and incorporated in 1257 by the high duke Bolesław V the Chaste who following the example of Wrocław, introduced city rights modelled on the Magdeburg law allowing for <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> and new trade privileges for the citizens. In 1259, the city was again ravaged by the Mongols. A third attack in 1287 was repelled {{thanks in part to the}} new built fortifications. In 1335, King Casimir III of Poland (Kazimierz in Polish) declared the two western suburbs to be a new city named after him, Kazimierz (Casimiria in Latin). The defensive walls were erected around the central section of Kazimierz in 1362, and a plot was set aside for the Augustinian order next to Skałka.|$|E

50|$|Part IVA {{is a set}} {{of general}} anti-avoidance {{measures}} addressing schemes with a dominant purpose of creating a <b>tax</b> <b>benefit.</b> Section 177E specifically covers dividend stripping.

Dividend stripping will generally result in money to owners being taxed as dividends, irrespective of interposed steps.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how {{parametric}} {{reform in}} a pay-as-you-go pension {{system with a}} <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> link affects retirement and work incentives of prime-age workers. We find that postponed retirement tends to harm incentives of prime-age workers {{in the presence of}} a <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> link, thereby creating a policy trade-off in stimulating aggregate labor supply. We show how several popular reform scenarios are geared either towards young or old workers, or, indeed, both groups under appropriate conditions. We also provide a sharp characterization of the excess burden of pension insurance and show how it depends on the behavioral supply elasticities of the extensive and intensive margins and the effective tax rates implicit in contribution rates. pension reform, retirement, hours worked, <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> link, actuarial adjustment, excess burden...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the glues being brought to the forefront, the wood resources themselves are becoming the focus of manufacturers, {{due in part to}} energy conservation, as well as concern for natural resources. There are several certifications available to manufacturers who participate in these programs. Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), and Greenguard are all certification programs that ensure that production and construction practices are sustainable. Many of these programs offer <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> to both the manufacturer and the end user.|$|E

30|$|The B-T line {{indicates}} the overall net {{gain from the}} <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> system. This indicator is negative for households in the top quintile of the income distribution in every country indicating that richer households contribute more than they take out from {{the part of the}} system that we examine. Yet, the size of their contribution is country specific. Generally, countries where the <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> system strongly advantages the bottom quintile are also countries where the top loses relatively more. Examples include Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, and Belgium. The reverse is however not true. Countries where the bottom gains relatively less from the <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> system are not necessarily imposing a lower burden on the top. For example, in Latvia the difference between <b>benefits</b> and <b>taxes</b> is 17 % of disposable income in the bottom quintile but reaches - 55 % at the top. Large reductions in income from the <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> system at the top are mainly due to direct income taxation suggesting that if richer households are to be made to contribute more to the system this will mostly be done via higher taxation.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the effect of}} {{investor}} level taxes, firm-specific ownership structure and firm-specific payout policy on firms' capital structure choice. Our analysis is based on data for 10, 983 firms from 13 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries over the time period 2002 - 2012. Our results show a significant impact of the net <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> of debt on the debt ratio of firms. Ignoring firm heterogeneity, {{an increase in the}} net <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> of debt by 10 percentage points leads to an increase in the debt ratio of 2. 49 percentage points. Taking into account investor-level taxation and firm heterogenity, an increase in the net <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> of debt of 10 percentage points leads to an increase in the debt ratio of only 1. 27 percentage points, if the firm's largest individual domestic owner has more than 50 % of the shares. If all individual domestic owners together have more than 50 % of the shares, an increase in the net <b>tax</b> <b>benefit</b> of debt of 10 percentage points leads to a negligible increase in the debt ratio of 0. 05 percentage points...|$|R
