5|$|Muchelney Abbey is an English Heritage {{property}} {{in the village of}} Muchelney in the Somerset Levels, England. The site consists of ruined walls showing the layout of the abbey buildings constructed from the 7th to 16th and the remaining intact Abbott's House. It is next to the parish church in which some of <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abbey has been reused.|$|E

5|$|As of 2005, the {{building}} still retained {{a number of}} original features, including its gold brocade seats, wall friezes, cornices, and ceiling roses. However, <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building remained in a poor state of repair, and in January 2008 it was announced once again that {{the building}} was to be demolished, and scaffolding was erected at the front in preparation. The building, once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester, was not regarded as architecturally interesting, and was demolished {{in the spring of}} 2008. The pair of stone piers in the forecourt of the building, which were Grade II listed in 1998, remain.|$|E
5|$|Bellew's Gartership also {{witnessed}} {{changes to}} <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> College of Arms. Although it {{had survived the}} Blitz, structural problems with the roof and brickwork forced the heralds to decide between leaving the College's buildings on Queen Victoria Street or attempting expensive repairs. In 1954, they approached the Ministry of Works to ask for financial assistance in the building work; the Ministry agreed to cover half the cost. A successful public appeal for the remaining funds followed and the restoration work carried out. The College of Arms Trust was established in 1956 to oversee funds for the building's maintenance.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War {{the temple}} {{was used as}} a post for Air Raid Precautions wardens. It was given Grade I listed status in September 1952 and became part of a {{conservation}} area in the 1960s, when it was used for poetry readings. However, it had become neglected and vandalised by the 1970s. It suffered from wet and dry rot, vibrations from traffic on the busy nearby road had damaged <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building and thieves had stolen the lead off the roof. Donald Insall Associates, a specialist conservation architectural firm, was commissioned by Richmond upon Thames Council to restore the building at a cost of £37,000. The work was carried out by the building firm Gostling and the architect James Lindus Forge. Patrick Baty advised on the paint colours.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|Local {{architect}} Thomas Bower performed some alterations to {{the house}} for Robert Crewe-Milnes in 1896, including extending the service wing. Few changes to the hall itself occurred during Calmic's tenancy. The company installed central heating in around 1948, and later constructed an office extension {{on the north side}} of the house, which was demolished a few years after the building's conversion into an hotel. Calmic had undertaken only cosmetic maintenance work, and by the 1970s <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building was in poor repair. A major stonework fall from the north gable during high winds in 1974 led Wellcome to carry out an extensive restoration programme to both the interior and the exterior, which was completed in 1979 at a cost of £500,000 (£ today).|$|E

5|$|The Princess of Wales Bedroom {{is named}} after {{the wife of the}} future King Edward VII, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, who stayed at Althorp in 1863 on a visit to see the Red Earl. Although <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four-poster bed was {{designed}} in 1911, the room is largely Georgian, with deep red walls and furnishings, and contains a notable portrait of a young princess by the Spanish court painter, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. The Queen Mary Bedroom {{is named after}} Mary, the wife of King George V, who visited Althorp in 1913. It contains a bed with an extremely tall structure, dated to the 18th century, draped in pea green taffet. Of particular note in the Queen Mary Bedroom are two chairs covered with needlework created by Albert, who was once the chairman of the Royal School of Needlework.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{traces of}} <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} clas church. Most {{buildings in the}} sixth century were of wood, wattle and daub. Even churches were wooden. Although the use of stone was not unknown elsewhere in Britain at this time, it was not used in Wales (it was rare anywhere in Britain until the eleventh century). Churches were also distinguished by their comparatively small size and simplicity. They tended to be under 40 feet long, with a single tall, aisleless nave, and with a small square chancel attached. They were often oratories, rather than full churches.|$|E
5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E

5|$|When Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk was {{executed}} for treason in 1554 his property {{was taken over}} by the monarch. In 1671 Thomas Preston, 3rd Baronet Preston bought Aldingham manor which included Gleaston Castle. The property descended through the Prestons to the Cavendish family. The castle is now part of an active farm which dates from the 19th century. The farm buildings incorporate some of <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle. The Prestons owned the castle until 1922 when it was sold to the current family of owners. According to a 1905 document from the Cumbria Archive Centre up to four human skeletons were discovered at the castle in the 19th century when the farm buildings were built.|$|E
5|$|During the Queen's tenure {{much has}} been done, not only to restore and {{maintain}} <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, but also to transform it into a major British tourist attraction, containing {{a significant portion of}} the Royal Collection of art, which is managed from Windsor. Archaeological work has continued at the castle, following on from limited investigations in the 1970s, the work on the Round Tower from 1988–92 and the investigations following the 1992 fire. During 2007, 993,000 tourists visited the castle. This has had to be achieved in co-ordination with security issues and the castle's role as a working royal palace. In late 2011 two large water turbines were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide hydroelectric power to the castle and the surrounding estate. In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a £27m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors, as well as a new cafe that will be housed in the 14th Century undercroft. The project will be completed at the end of 2018, and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the closure}} of the chapel in the 1980s, the size of the {{congregation}} had declined and <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building was deteriorating. In 1978 the decorative plaster ceiling was replaced with a suspended ceiling of acoustic tiles, with further repairs carried out under the Manpower Services Commission. During the course of these repairs, discussions took place {{about the future of the}} building and its dwindling congregation. None of the ideas for developing the building came to fruition, and worship in the chapel ended in December 1985. Permission to demolish the building was refused because of its listed status. It was bought by a private individual in 1987, but the plan to convert it into a nightclub was declined. The building was acquired by the Bethesda Heritage Trust in 2000. After the Bethesda Heritage Trust failed to raise sufficient finance to continue worship, in 2002 it passed into the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, an organisation which aims to find community uses for the buildings in its care.|$|E

5|$|The manor of St Catherine {{belonged to}} Prior Cantlow of Bath Abbey in medieval times. It takes {{its name from}} the Church of St Catherine beside the manor house. When the house was not {{occupied}} by the monks it was leased. In 1536 the lease was to Thomas Llewellyn who remained as the tenant after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry VIII granted the manor to his tailor, John Malte, in 1546. Part of the condition of the gift was that he adopt the kings illegitimate daughter Ethelreda Malte. Ethelreda inherited the house and married John Harington. After Ethelreda's death in 1551 Harrington married again. His son from this marriage was another John Harington who grew up and became a courtier of Elizabeth I and invented the first flush toilet. He {{spent most of his time}} at his principle seat at nearby Kelston and, in 1591, sold St Catherine's Court to John Blanchard. His son William Blanchard, remodelled the house. His initials appear in the plasterwork frieze of a bedroom. The Blanchard family lived at the court for several generations. In 1610 the porch was added and a terraced garden laid out. The house passed by marriage to the Parry family but was not maintained and <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building was declining by the 18th century, when half of the building was used by a tenant farmer.|$|E
5|$|The {{site of the}} Abbey was {{effectively}} {{an island in the}} marshy and frequently flooded Somerset Levels. There {{is believed to have been}} a religious building erected on the site as early as 693, with a charter being granted by Cynewulf in 762, although the Benedictine monks were not established there until the 10th century. Viking raids in the area damaged some of <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abbey and necessitated rebuilding. The refounders of the Abbey are not completely clear; however in a document of 1535 (drawn up following the Valor Ecclesiasticus), Centwine, Ine, Æthelstan and Æthelred are claimed as founders. Tradition suggests that Æthelstan's contribution was penance for the murder of Atheling Edwin in 933 or following victory at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937. The charter of King Ine is known to be a forgery, however it may have some basis in fact. The charters were placed in the Museum of Somerset in 1946 on permanent loan from Lady Ailesbury.|$|E
5|$|With {{the energy}} and impetuosity noted by Lang, Henson worked {{continually}} {{over the next seven}} years to improve the parish, restoring <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, opening clubs for his parishioners, and holding popular open-air services in the vicarage grounds. At Barking his high-church leanings were welcomed, and he was invited to preach from time to time at St Alban's Holborn, a central London bastion of Anglo-Catholicism. He was never physically strong, and his relentless work at Barking put a strain on his physique. In 1895 he accepted an offer from Lord Salisbury of a less arduous post, the chaplaincy of St Mary's Hospital, Ilford, which he held until 1900. In 1895 and 1896, Henson was select preacher at Oxford, and from 1897 he served as chaplain to John Festing, Bishop of St Albans. He had time for writing; between 1897 and 1900 he published four books, ranging from purely theological studies to analyses of Church politics. His beliefs had changed from his early high-churchmanship to a broad-church latitudinarianism; his 1899 Cui bono? set out his concerns about the strict ritualists in the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church.|$|E
