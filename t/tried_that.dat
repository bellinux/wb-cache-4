Wolfe and Archie Goodwin are sufficiently distracted by enquiries about Peter Hays being the man named in the advertisement (and that he is by implication innocent of the murder for which Hays is currently being <b>tried)</b> <b>that</b> Wolfe dispatches Archie to visit the court room to hear the verdict against Hays. By comparing the man he sees in court to photos supplied by the father, Archie tentatively identifies the two names as referring to the same man.|$|E

500|$|White {{was unable}} to {{completely}} halt the slide in circulation, though it rose a little in 1977. [...] That year Cohen lost $15,000 dollars on the magazines, and decided to sell. [...] He spent some time {{looking for a new}} publisher—editor Roy Torgeson was one of those interested—but on September 15, 1978, he sold his half of the business to Arthur Bernhard, his partner. [...] White renewed his suggestions for improving the format of the magazine: he wanted to make Fantastic the same size as Time, and believed he could avoid the mistakes that had been made by other sf magazines that had <b>tried</b> <b>that</b> approach. [...] White also proposed an increase in the budget and asked for a raise. [...] Bernhard not only turned down White's ideas, but also stopped paying him: White responded by resigning. [...] His last official day as editor was November 9; the last issue of Fantastic under his control was the January 1979 issue. [...] He returned all submissions to their authors, saying that he had been told to do so by Bernhard; Bernhard denied this.|$|E
5000|$|Gould {{currently}} {{works as}} an expert for Channel 9 and Triple M radio during rugby league telecasts, including NRL, State of Origin and International football contests. He also writes for the Sydney Morning Herald. He is considered controversial within rugby league fan circles for his blunt opinions about the playing and administration of the game. Many of his repetitious commentary catchphrases are used to criticise refereeing decisions: they include [...] "dear oh dear oh dear", [...] "no no no no no", [...] "that's ridiculous, that is ridiculous" [...] and [...] "modern day gladiators".Phil is renowned for repeating his point {{over and over again}} e.g. [...] "that's a <b>try,</b> <b>that's</b> a <b>try,</b> <b>that's</b> a <b>try,</b> <b>that's</b> a <b>try,</b> <b>that's</b> a try." ...|$|R

500|$|A {{reviewer}} by the moniker KJB {{watched the}} episode for IGN, giving it {{one out of}} five stars. He said it was [...] "like watching a television episode made up of all the things from the 'Stuff We've <b>Tried</b> <b>That</b> Doesn't Work on Star Trek list." [...] Criticism was directed at the introduction of the MACOs, which were described as Starship Troopers clones, and at the modification to the theme tune. The Xindi themselves were described as [...] "bad Farscape knock offs", and the reviewer said that they set a poor tone {{for the rest of the}} season. Michelle Erica Green said she was in a [...] "double mind" [...] about [...] "The Xindi" [...] in her review at TrekNation as there were both good and bad elements. She praised the action sequences, the make-up and McHattie as the alien foreman. Green enjoyed the twist at the end with the Xindi homeworld being already destroyed, and felt that the Xindi races would be interesting. On the other hand, she thought that the MACO scenes were too dark and that the T'Pol nude scenes were unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I <b>tried</b> <b>that,</b> and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story is}} set in post-World War II London in the 1940’s. Twice the narrator, Maurice Bendrix, visits an A.B.C. The first time he confers with a detective, Mr. Parkis, “who had met me by {{appointment}} in an A.B.C—it was his own suggestion as he had the boy with him and couldn’t take him into a bar” (Book Two, Chapter 6). The second time occurs as Bendrix searches for his former lover, Sarah Miles: “There was an A.B.C in the High Street and I <b>tried</b> <b>that.</b> She wasn’t there” (Book Four, Chapter 1). [...] Greene's The Human Factor (1978), Part One Chapter 1, refers to the A.B.C. in the Strand as having Maltesers available.|$|E

2500|$|Moule's cricket {{career was}} short, {{and though he}} played a few times for Victoria, most of his {{first-class}} appearances were on the 1880 tour of England with the Australian team under Billy Murdoch. He played in the one Test match of the tour, a hastily arranged match at The Oval {{which was the first}} Test in England, mainly because Fred Spofforth was injured; he batted at No 11 and was the sixth bowler <b>tried.</b> <b>That</b> seems to have done little justice to his abilities, for with three wickets for 23 runs he was the most successful bowler in England's first innings and his 34 in Australia's second innings helped in a last-wicket partnership of 88 with his captain that avoided an innings defeat.|$|E
2500|$|The track [...] "Where Are You" [...] {{went through}} many changes and {{arrangements}} after being written including {{an entirely different}} chorus. The song was known as [...] "The Best Day of Your Life" [...] and [...] "Where Are You (Best Day)" [...] on advance copies of Healthy. [...] "Apology" [...] also morphed throughout recording. [...] "The song 'Apology' for example was from the first demo sessions. We <b>tried</b> <b>that</b> song a year later completely differently ... way more up-tempo and it just didn't feel right. It didn't serve the song and what Raine was saying {{and how he was}} singing dictated how we were playing. I love all the songs on the record, but that was a very magical, musical moment because it was so organic the way that happened." ...|$|E

I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I <b>tried</b> <b>that</b> with our band and we got into doing it. It worked. Instead of just strolling in at any hour, it made it more like we were saying, [...] "Let’s do it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On 15 April, the {{government}} army celebrated Cumberland's twenty-fifth birthday by issuing two gallons of brandy to each regiment. At Murray's suggestion, the Jacobites <b>tried</b> <b>that</b> evening {{to repeat the}} success of Prestonpans by carrying out a night attack on {{the government}} encampment. Murray proposed that they set off at dusk and march to Nairn. Murray planned {{to have the right}} wing of the first line attack Cumberland's rear, while Perth with the left wing would attack the government's front. In support of Perth, Charles Edward Stuart would bring up the second line. The Jacobite force however started out well after dark at about 20:00. Murray led the force cross country with the intention of avoiding government outposts. This however led to very slow going in the dark. Murray's one time aide-de-camp, James Chevalier de Johnstone later wrote, [...] "this march across country in a dark night which did not allow us to follow any track, and accompanied with confusion and disorder". By the time the leading troop had reached Culraick, still [...] from where Murray's wing was to cross the River Nairn and encircle the town, there was only one hour left before dawn. After a heated council with other officers, Murray concluded that there was not enough time to mount a surprise attack and that the offensive should be aborted. O'Sullivan went to inform Charles Edward Stuart of the change of plan, but missed him in the dark. Meanwhile, instead of retracing his path back, Murray led his men left, down the Inverness road. In the darkness, while Murray led one-third of the Jacobite forces back to camp, the other two-thirds continued towards their original objective, unaware of the change in plan. One account of that night even records that Perth and Drummond made contact with government troops before realising the rest of the Jacobite force had turned home. Not long after the exhausted Jacobite forces had made it back to Culloden, reports came of the advancing government troops. By then, many Jacobite soldiers had dispersed in search of food, while others were asleep in ditches and outbuildings.|$|E
