25|$|Adding to the interracial {{animosity}} was {{the sense}} of many whites that their former slaves had betrayed them. Before the war, slaveholders had convinced <b>themselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were treating their slaves well and had earned their slaves' loyalty. When the Union Army rolled in and slaves deserted by the thousands, slaveholders were stunned. The black population scrambled to preserve its new rights while the white population attempted to claw its way back up the social ladder by denying blacks those same rights and reviving white supremacy.|$|E

It was {{met with}} high acclaim from IGN's Colin Moriarty, who felt [...] "extremely satisfied," [...] saying [...] "safely and confidently" [...] that it [...] "might be my personal favorite album of the year," [...] giving it a score of 9.3 out of 10. Conversely, Exclaim! writer Amber Authier felt that, [...] "On first listen its simply generic sound did nothing for me," [...] though later admitted, [...] "I listened to Breaking Benjamin several times over a week and several elements of the disc started to grow on me, even appeal to me." [...] The writer concluded, [...] "Breaking Benjamin created a standard of quality for <b>themselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> simply couldn't meet on the entire disc." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{influenced}} by the changing mediums people listen to music in the 2000s and 2010s: how people used their cellphones or YouTube to discover new music. Yamaguchi wanted to create songs that were difficult to evaluate by listening to just a sample of the song. The seven minute long [...] "Me ga Aku Aiiro" [...] in particular was written with such music consumers in mind. The band also felt influenced by the city of Tokyo, after living in the city {{for a year and a}} half and deciding to call it their permanent home. Retrospectively, Yamaguchi saw Shin-shiro as depicting the band as they had arrived in Tokyo, while Kikuuiki showed the versions of <b>themselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had discovered by living in Tokyo.|$|E
500|$|The novel's {{title is}} taken from the popular Dominican merengue Mataron al chivo ("They Killed the Goat"), which refers to Trujillo's {{assassination}} on May 30, 1961. Merengue is a style of music created by Ã‘ico Lora in the 1920s and actively promoted by Trujillo himself. It's now considered the country's national music. Cultural critics Julie Sellers and Stephen Ropp comment about this particular merengue that, by envisaging the dictator as an animal who could {{be turned into a}} stew (as frequently happened with goats struck down on the Dominican Republic's highways), the song [...] "gave those performing, listening to, and dancing to this merengue a sense of control over him and over <b>themselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not experienced for over three decades." [...] Vargas Llosa quotes the lyrics to Mataron al chivo {{at the beginning of the}} novel.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, in {{the wider}} context of the Greco-Persian wars, {{it was a very}} {{significant}} battle for the Allies. The Allies had demonstrated to <b>themselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could stand up to the Persian navy, even having the better of some encounters. For many of the Allied crews, it was their first taste of battle, and the experience gained was invaluable at the forthcoming Battle of Salamis. Moreover, fighting the Persians at Artemisium allowed the Greek admirals to see how the Persian fleet performed, and gave them insights into how it might be beaten. In addition, the events before and during Artemisium were crucial in cutting down the size of the Persian fleet (even if this was not all due to military action), meaning that the odds faced by the Allies at the Battle of Salamis were not overwhelming. As the poet Pindar put it, Artemisium was [...] "where the sons of the Athenians laid the shining foundation-stone of freedom".|$|E
500|$|Sarah Whitney, in Investigating Veronica Mars: Essays on the Teen Detective Series, {{found the}} episode's {{portrayal}} of rape [...] "troubling". She wrote, [...] "On {{of the reasons}} this ending has always been problematic {{for me as a}} viewer {{is that it is a}} too-familiar script. Women are frequently told (or tell <b>themselves)</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have [...] "misinterpreted" [...] sexual situations by missing cues ("leading men on") or by being [...] "unclear" [...] about their lack of consent. Furthermore, the episode leaves us bereft of a villain that can be nailed to the wall for forcible rape." [...] The writer went on to state that instead of placing the blame on a single person, [...] "A Trip to the Dentist" [...] blamed several people for Veronica's rape. Whitney also wrote that despite that the [...] "official resolution of the rape narrative denies a traditional 'whodunit' ending," [...] it makes a statement that she was raped by an [...] "unfeeling class of people." ...|$|E
500|$|Markus and McFeely {{wanted to}} adapt Ed Brubaker's Winter Soldier storyline from the comics, which they {{described}} as [...] "the tone of Capâ€™s modern franchise", {{but it took}} the duo six months to convince <b>themselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could do it. In the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of The First Avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values {{in the new world}} he was living in, with Markus saying, [...] "If you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics everything is going to seem like a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth." [...] Three Days of the Condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.|$|E

500|$|The healing {{elements}} of the movement are difficult to classify given {{that a variety of}} terms are used, with some New Age authors using different terms to refer to the same trends, while others use the same term to refer to different things. However, Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised. The first of these was the Human Potential Movement, which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential, and which accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of <b>themselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have alienated and suppressed, thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life. Hanegraaff described transpersonal psychology as the [...] "theoretical wing" [...] of this Human Potential Movement; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought, transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of altered states of consciousness. Closely connected to this is the shamanic consciousness current, which argues that the shaman was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and which seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from January 7, 1911. It states, [...] "Miss Street's Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils. The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with <b>themselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to something. When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, {{to have fun with}} the girls. The young women, after some practice, realize that their team, while it may be pretty to look at, is of little real use on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly offer to help them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to do except look pretty. When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players." ...|$|E
500|$|In the East, the {{persecution}} was officially discontinued on April 30, 311, although martyrdoms in Gaza continued until May 4. Galerius, now on his deathbed, issued a proclamation to end hostilities, and give Christians {{the rights to}} exist freely under the law, and to peaceable assembly. Persecution was everywhere at an end. Lactantius preserves the Latin text of this pronouncement, describing it as an edict. Eusebius provides a Greek translation of the pronouncement. His version includes imperial titles and an address to provincials, suggesting that the proclamation is, in fact, an imperial letter. The document seems only to have been promulgated in Galerius's provinces.Among all the other arrangements that we are always making for the benefit and utility of the state, we have heretofore wished to repair all things {{in accordance with the}} laws and public discipline of the Romans, and to ensure that even the Christians, who abandoned the practice of their ancestors, should return to good sense. Indeed, for some reason or other, such self-indulgence assailed and idiocy possessed those Christians, that they did not follow the practices of the ancients, which their own ancestors had, perhaps, instituted, but according to their own will and as it pleased them, they made laws for <b>themselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> observed, and gathered various peoples in diverse areas. Then when our order was issued stating that they should return themselves to the practices of the ancients, many were subjected to peril, and many were even killed. Many more persevered in their way of life, and we saw that they neither offered proper worship and cult to the gods, or to the god of the Christians. Considering the observation of our own mild clemency and eternal custom, by which we are accustomed to grant clemency to all people, we have decided to extend our most speedy indulgence to these people as well, so that Christians may once more establish their own meeting places, so long as they do not act in a disorderly way. We are about to send another letter to our officials detailing the conditions they ought to observe. Consequently, in accord with our indulgence, they ought to pray to their god for our health and the safety of the state, so that the state may be kept safe on all sides, and {{they may be able to}} live safely and securely in their own homes. Galerius's words reinforce the Tetrarchy's theological basis for {{the persecution}}; the acts did nothing more than attempt to enforce traditional civic and religious practices, even if the edicts themselves were thoroughly nontraditional. Galerius does nothing to violate the spirit of the persecutionChristians are still admonished for their nonconformity and foolish practicesGalerius never admits that he did anything wrong. The admission that the Christians' god might exist is made only grudgingly. Certain early 20th-century historians have declared that Galerius's edict definitively nullified the old [...] "legal formula" [...] non licet esse Christianos, made Christianity a religio licita, [...] "on a par with Judaism", and secured Christians' property, among other things.|$|E
