5|$|Vampire bats use {{infrared}} radiation to locate blood hotspots on their prey. A recent study {{has shown that}} common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its <b>thermal</b> <b>activation</b> threshold to about 30°C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. The only other vertebrates capable of detecting {{infrared radiation}} are boas, pythons and pit vipers, {{all of which have}} pit organs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no <b>thermal</b> <b>activation</b> energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E
25|$|The trimerization {{of a part}} of a nitrile {{molecule}} and {{two parts}} of acetylene into pyridine is called Bönnemann cyclization. This modification of the Reppe synthesis can be activated either by heat or by light. While the <b>thermal</b> <b>activation</b> requires high pressures and temperatures, the photoinduced cycloaddition proceeds at ambient conditions with CoCp2(cod) (Cp = cyclopentadienyl, cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) as a catalyst, and can be performed even in water. A series of pyridine derivatives can be produced in this way. When using acetonitrile as the nitrile, 2-methylpyridine is obtained, which can be dealkylated to pyridine.|$|E

Although this is a valid approach for designing systems, the probabilistic nature of these boundary conditions influences the energy demand and achieved thermal comfort of real systems [1]. This paper analyzes the influence of occupant behavior on the energy performance and thermal comfort of three model rooms equipped with <b>thermal</b> mass <b>activation.</b> Three TRNSYS models with weather data form Trondheim were set up. First, the energy performance and thermal comfort of thermally activated building elements are compared {{with the performance of}} idealized cooling with standardized user behavior. <b>Thermal</b> mass <b>activation</b> is able to deliver a better thermal comfort than ventilation heat but results in the parametric studies shows to have a higher energy demand. The influence of the cooling load was investigated by ASHRAE [...] ‐guidelines. It is shown that the ceiling is the best location for tackling the cooling load in an indoor space. It is also proven that integrating <b>thermal</b> mass <b>activation</b> is a valuable component for improving the thermal comfort of an indoor space. While its performance is better than that of ventilation, there is not thus far a clear answer as to whether TMA is more energy efficient than activating this same thermal mass by ventilation heat.

40|$|We {{investigate}} numerically {{the relaxation}} dynamics of an elastic string in two-dimensional random media by thermal fluctuations starting from a flat configuration. Measuring spatial fluctuations of its mean position, {{we find that}} the correlation length grows in time asymptotically as ξ∼ (t) ^ 1 /χ̃. This implies that the relaxation dynamics is driven by <b>thermal</b> <b>activations</b> over random energy barriers which scale as E_B(ℓ) ∼ℓ^χ̃ with a length scale ℓ. Numerical data strongly suggest that the energy barrier exponent χ̃ is identical to the energy fluctuation exponent χ= 1 / 3. We also find that there exists a long transient regime, where the correlation length follows a power-law dynamics as ξ∼ t^ 1 /z with a nonuniversal dynamic exponent z.

Our total energy calculations support the proposed experimental process, as it indicates that the chemisorption of the molecule is as follows: The gas phase VAA (AAc) adsorbs molecularly to the electrophilic surface Si atom and then dissociates into H(2) C = CH - COO and H, bonded to the electrophilic and nucleophilic surface silicon dimer atoms, respectively.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of realising adaptive structures {{is of great}} interest in the control/automation fields, owing to the benefits related to enhanced performance. To accomplish this, a challenging approach is the employment of Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) as active elements, which can recover seemingly permanent strains by temperature-induced phase transformations whereby the so-called Shape Memory Effect (SME) takes place. This paper deals with an experimental investigation of the bending recovery performance of a functional structure. The active material was a near-equiatomic NiTi alloy {{in the form of}} strips, which were embedded into a custom-made polymeric matrix. To study the influence of heating/cooling rates on the characteristic transformation temperatures of the NiTi material, several analyses were carried out by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Prior to the insertion, the strips were thermo-mechanically treated to memorise a bent shape through experimentally evaluated shape setting parameters. The martensitic and reverse martensitic transformations were thermally activated by means of a hot/cold air stream flow. Experimental tests enabled the characterisation of the SME recovery behaviour evolution as well as the shape changes of the structure. Subsequently <b>thermal</b> <b>activations</b> were considered to assess the stability of the functional structure deformations (polymeric matrix with SMA strips) whose actual deflections were evaluated by means of digital image analysis...|$|R
50|$|There are {{deviations}} from the Arrhenius law during the glass transition in all classes of glass-forming matter. The Arrhenius law predicts that {{the motion of the}} structural units (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) should slow down at a slower rate through the glass transition than is experimentally observed. In other words, the structural units slow down at a faster rate than is predicted by the Arrhenius law. This observation is made reasonable assuming that the units must overcome an energy barrier by means of a <b>thermal</b> <b>activation</b> energy. The thermal energy must be high enough to allow for translational motion of the units which leads to viscous flow of the material.|$|E
50|$|In some materials, the {{transition}} is sharper than others and typically requires a temperature-sensitive deformation mechanism. For example, in materials with a body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice the DBTT is readily apparent, as the motion of screw dislocations is very temperature sensitive because the rearrangement of the dislocation core prior to slip requires <b>thermal</b> <b>activation.</b> This can be problematic for steels with a high ferrite content. This famously resulted in serious hull cracking in Liberty ships in colder waters during World War II, causing many sinkings.
