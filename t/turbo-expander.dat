40|$|This Master {{thesis is}} a {{continuation}} of a project thesis written fall 2012 ?Evaluation of Liquefaction systems for Floating LNG?. Two processes for liquefaction of natural gas for a floating unit was compared and evaluated. The main basis for comparison came from simulations conducted in the simulation program Aspen HYSYS. These two processes were a dual mixed refrigerant process, DMR, from Air Products and Chemicals and a <b>turbo-expander</b> process from TOTAL. (Ref) The specific power consumptions for the processes were 284 kWh/ton LNG for the DMR process and 395. 8 kWh/ton LNG for TOTALs <b>turbo-expander</b> process. Two additional liquefaction processes were simulated and studied in this Master thesis; a <b>turbo-expander</b> process from APCI and a <b>turbo-expander</b> from US patent 5, 768, 912. (Ref) The simulations gave a specific power consumption of 405. 7 kWh/ton LNG for APCIs <b>turbo-expander</b> process and 422. 5 kWh/ton LNG for the US patent model. These models were compared with the mixed refrigerant process from APCI and TOTALs <b>turbo-expander</b> process in terms of power consumption, volume flow rates of refrigerant and heat exchanger properties. The expander processes from TOTAL and APCI were dual expanders while the process from US patent 5, 768, 912 had three turbo-expanders. All expander processes were simulated with a CO 2 precooling system. The liquefaction units had a production capacity of 3. 5 Mtpa of LNG. The equipment in the DMR process was assumed large enough to handle the production capacity while the <b>turbo-expander</b> processes had to be divided in several production trains. The limitations for the expander process were a maximum compander capacity of 15 MW. TOTALs and APCIs <b>turbo-expander</b> had expander powers of respectively 49 and 55 MW for the largest expander in the processes and were divided into four trains. The <b>turbo-expander</b> from US patent was suggested with two production trains with a released power of 29 MW for the largest expander. A common CO 2 system served the parallel trains for the <b>turbo-expander</b> processes. Process parameters of feed gas composition and pressure, water cooling temperature and split temperatures in the processes were some of the parameters included in a sensitivity analysis of the processes. A richer feed composition and a higher feed gas pressure gave reductions in power consumptions due to higher condensing temperature of the natural gas. Alternative systems for the precooling units with several evaporation stages of the CO 2 were also studied and compared with the initial precooling system of one evaporation stage. A CO 2 system with three evaporation stages gave reductions in specific power consumption of 0. 6 %, 2. 1 % and 4. 7 % for the expander processes from TOTAL, APCI and US patent respectively.

Charge air temperature directly and indirectly influences engine performance, fuel economy & emissions. To date charge air temperature control has, in the main, been passive; aiming only to reduce temperatures towards, but still above, ambient temperature. Driven by increasing specific output, the opportunities for sub-ambient charge cooling need to be investigated. For some real world driving conditions it is also desirable to raise the charge temperature. Air Cycle Technology ltd (ACT), working with the University of Huddersfield (UoH) are developing a controllable charge air cooling system, which will deliver charge air at sub-ambient temperature over a wide engine operating range.

At this high speeds, normal {{bearings}} cannot be used as it results in high friction and wear of the bearings. That is the reason; we are going to use gas foil bearings as a recent and advanced alternative. Here, in this project we are going to design bearings required to support the shaft which runs {{at a very high}} speed. Current project concentrate to analyse the load bearing capacity of the thrust bearings. In the analysis Reynoldsâ Equation is used to know the pressure distribution of these bearings. The Reynoldsâ Equation is solved by using FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD and using many assumptions to know the pressure distribution of the thrust bearings.

40|$|Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) {{power systems}} are a {{well-established}} {{technology for the}} conversion of thermal energy sources in the small-to-medium power range. In the last few years, efforts have been devoted {{to the development of}} mini ORC (mORC) power systems (5 - 30 kWe) for waste heat recovery from truck engines, or distributed conversion of concentrated solar radiation. In these high-temperature applications the expander is arguably the most critical component. Due to the high expansion ratio, <b>turbo-expanders</b> are typically preferred. Recently, a multi-stage radial-outflow turbine (ROT) configuration for ORC power systems has been studied. However, even if the authors preliminarily demonstrated that ROT may allow for compact and efficient expanders [1], some research questions are still open. Notably, the key point is the fluid dynamic design of the first stages, which are subject to severe flow conditions (very high flow deflection, low aspect ratio of the blades and with high tip clearance losses). This work thus proposes a novel design methodology for centrifugal cascades, specifically targeted to the first rotor of the mORC centrifugal turbine described in Ref. [1]. Blades are initially designed using a novel in-house Turbomachinery Blade Modeler (BM), then performance is verified by means of 3 D CFD simulation on unstructured grids using the solver SU 2, recently extended also in-house to treat non ideal compressible fluid flows [2]. Results show that traditional blade design rules for axial cascades are not directly extendable to centrifugal profiles and new design guidelines are needed. Moreover, the 3 D performance of the cascade has also been investigated by taking into account tip clearance and secondary loss mechanisms. Finally, an accurate comparison with the mean-line code predictions is provided. As expected, the outcome of the study reveals moderate discrepancy between the CFD results and the mean-line code. This suggests that in case of non-conventional machines a more tight integration of design tools of increasing fidelity may be convenient.

40|$|Cryostar {{has been}} a world leader in radial inflow turbine {{technology}} for more than 30 years but is a relative newcomer in the geothermal business. Experience gained during the design and production of two <b>turbo-expanders</b> coupled to a generator for binary cycles has shown that standard expanders can easily be used for geothermal or heat recovery applications. The Main concern of the corrosion resistance of turbine elements against a corrosive working fluid like ammonia-water mixture can be solved with a rigorous selection of materials. The other concern is about sealing gas management in a close cycle loop. The Dry Gas Seal solution allows the seal gas flow to be decreased to very low values. The recompression of the leaking gas back into the cycle offers a zero leakage system. Process data for binary cycles are ideal for radial inflow turbines: pressure ratios, flows and temperatures ensure an operation {{very close to the}} maximum achievable isentropic efficiency. Other losses in gear boxes, generator and bearings typically do not exceed in total 10 % of the total isentropic enthalpy drop. For this reason the larger units can recover almost 85 % electricity compared to the total isentropic enthalpy drop. Another benefit in using radial inflow turbine in standard execution with variable inlet nozzles is the ability to smooth seasonal variations inherent to geothermal process. In fact, this device can be used to control the flow widely through the expander without wasteful throttling. All the expansion energy in the nozzles and wheel is recovered almost at constant isentropic efficiency throughout the year. The advantages of operating at higher pressure levels and with lighter organic fluid than usual are explained. It increases the recovered electrical power, whilst decreasing the expander frame size and its price. In most of the cases there is a large benefit to optimise the binary cycle process data together with the turbine design to offer the best net cycle efficiency...|$|R

The history of {{the case of a}} <b>turbo-expander</b> for the cryogenic industry is described. The investigated machine has a single relatively stiff rotor with two overhung impellers. The rotor is supported on two tilting pad bearings, as they are commonly used for these applications. It was designed in line with API 617 7 th edition [11]. During internal factory testing excessive vibration at high speed suddenly developed, in spite of very high damping and comfortable separation margins of the relevant rotor vibration modes. The vibrations evolution in a polar plot had the appearance of a spiral, as they are typically observed in case of vibration induced hot spots. The tilting pad bearings were suspected as the most likely cause for the hot spots. In parallel to the tests, hot spot stability analyses with a rotor dynamic model of the <b>turbo-expander</b> were carried out. The applied method, introduced by Schmied [5] allows the handling of general rotor systems. The hot spot model is based on the theory of Kellenberger [3] using a thermal equation between the shaftâs thermal deflection and the shaft displacement at the hot spot location. The analytical results gave evidence of the instabilities and confirmed the fluid-film bearings as the source of the hot spot. The model was used to assess changes for the solution of the problem. The following measures were studied: Reduction of the oil viscosity, stiffening of the rotor and reduction of the bearing width. The final successfully implemented solution was a combination of lower bearing width and reduced viscosity.

40|$|This {{contribution}} aims {{to analyze}} micro-CHP units based on Rankine cycles. Two types of expander are considered: {{a small scale}} inward flow radial turbine and a volumetric scroll type expander. This latter, should allow to overcome the limitation imposed by a standard steam-turbine that arise when the required shaft-power is very low. Moreover, the scroll expander will also allow to easily treat wet steams, which must be avoided when considering a <b>turbo-expander.</b> The final aim is to deduce {{which one of the}} two types of expander is more suitable, with a specified target performance and the availability of a certain hot source. In order to define the thermodynamic expansion process, the analysis uses a onedimensional model of the radial turbine, previously developed by the authors, and of an estimation of the scroll expander efficiency. Also, the analysis is carried out for different working fluids, such as water, and two organic fluids, cyclohexane and toluene. Through the discussion of the results, for a specified set of constraints (e. g. expander inlet temperature, temperature of condensation, expander geometrical parameters) it is possible to deduce important indications on the most suitable expander for a given cycle layout...|$|E
40|$|Solid Oxide Fuel Cells {{hold the}} {{greatest}} potential of any other fuel cell technology. Using low cost ceramic materials, they can achieve high electrical efficiencies without relying on CHP. Moreover, SOFCs operate at high temperature (typically above 800 Â°C), which allows fuel flexibility. However, there are still significant technical challenges inhibiting {{the use of this}} promising new technology. This paper examines the development of enabling technologies of SOFC/Î¼GT Hybrid Systems for power generation. The positive characteristics and the drawbacks of solid oxide fuel cells are being introduced. Such an application includes a series of specifications and restrictions. The requirement of maintaining a 7 bar static pressure at the fuel cell inlet leads to the addition of a centrifugal compressor. This additional device is used as a booster with a desired pressure ratio of 1. 5. The investigation of two alternative technical approaches for the driving of the booster is presented: an electrically driven compressor and a booster driven by a <b>turbo-expander.</b> The integration procedure carries on with the design of the cycle and its components. The present work is being concluded after the preliminary design of both the compressor and the expander. Results show a 5. 79...|$|E

40|$|Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} technology for small electric power generations. The geometry analysis and the effect of turbulence model on the radial turbo-expanders design for small ORC power generation systems were discussed in this paper. The rotor blades and performance were calculated using several working fluids such as R 134 a, R 143 a, R 245 fa, n-Pentane, and R 123. Subsequently, a numerical study was carried out in the fluid flow area with R 134 a and R 123 as the working fluids. Analyses were performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) ANSYS Multiphysics on two real gas models, with the k-epsilon and SST (shear stress transport) turbulence models. The result shows the distribution of Mach number, pressure, velocity and temperature along the rotor blade of the radial turbo-expanders and estimation of performance at various operating conditions. The operating conditions are as follow: 250, 000 grid mesh flow area, real gas model SST at steady state condition, 0. 4 kg/s of mass flow rate, 15, 000 rpm rotor speed, 5 bar inlet pressure, and 373 K inlet temperature. By using those conditions, CFD analysis shows that the <b>turbo-expander</b> able to produce 6. 7 kW and 5. 5 kW of power when using R 134 a and R 123, respectively. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{results of}} the {{designed}} radial inflow <b>turbo-expander</b> with back swept curve blade rotor have been presented. The spiral casing is designed considering constant mean flow velocity and the areas of crosssections of the spiral casing are decreased gradually by reducing {{the width of the}} flow areas from inlet to end. The rotor is shrouded to cope up with centrifugal as well as bending load on the vanes of the rotor and avoid energy losses due to the tip clearance. The degree of reaction is selected as 0. 25 in contrast to usual value of 0. 5 at design point on the consideration of absolute velocity of air at nozzle exit needs to be higher than the rotor tip speed. The rotor shaft assembly is supported by externally pressured air bearing. The turbine with coupled brake centrifugal compressor, aerostatic radial and thrust bearing and test rig are developed for conducting experiments. The experiments are conducted with compressed cold air by varying mass flow rates and pressure ratios. At the pressure ratio of 1. 6 the temperature drop of 12. 5 o C of flowing air across turbo expander is achieved and 41 % total to static efficiency is obtained. The findings of exhaustive experimentation with the developed turbo expander are illustrated in details in this paper...|$|E
