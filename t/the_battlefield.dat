5|$|With nightfall, the ceasefire {{imposed by}} United Nations Security Council Resolution 338 came into effect at 6:52pm, ending the battle. A {{large number of}} Israeli wounded were still on <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b> Sharon {{requested}} helicopters to evacuate the wounded, but Bar-Lev replied in the negative, as {{it was dark and}} too risky to land helicopters near <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b> The Israelis worked to extract the wounded from <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> anyway, and the rescue operations took some four hours before most of the wounded were finally evacuated. When sunrise arrived, Israeli paratroopers and Egyptian Sa'iqa sometimes found that there were no more than 20 meters separating their positions, but the ceasefire held.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 2014, 3,100 American {{ground troops}} were {{committed}} to the conflict and 16,000 sorties were flown over <b>the</b> <b>battlefield,</b> primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.|$|E

5|$|He {{planned to}} engage his two central armies with the Muslim centre {{in an effort}} to stall them while the main thrusts would be against the wings of the Muslim army, which would then either be driven away from <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> or pushed towards the centre.

5|$|On the {{northern}} end of <b>the</b> <b>battlefield,</b> events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, {{out of sight of the}} rest of <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sunrise was at 6:48am that morning, {{and reports}} of the day record that it was unusually bright. The weather {{conditions}} are not recorded. The route that the English army took to <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> is not known precisely. Several roads are possible: one, an old Roman road that ran from Rochester to Hastings has long been favoured because of a large coin hoard found nearby in 1876. Another possibility is a Roman road between London and Lewes and then over local tracks to <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b> Some accounts of the battle indicate that the Normans advanced from Hastings to <b>the</b> <b>battlefield,</b> but the contemporary account of William of Jumièges places the Normans {{at the site of}} the battle the night before. Most historians incline towards the former view, but M. K. Lawson argues that William of Jumièges's account is correct.|$|E

The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E

Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve a portion of <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete.
