5|$|Apart from Goloka and Patala, Kamadhenu is also {{described}} as {{residing in the}} hermitages of the sages Jamadagni and Vashista. Scholar Mani explains the contradicting stories of Kamadhenu's birth and presence in the processions of many gods and sages by stating that while <b>there</b> <b>could</b> {{be more than one}} Kamadhenu, all of them are incarnations of the original Kamadhenu, the mother of cows.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} of the Treaty of Versailles, hyperinflation spread across Germany and many lost their life savings. Halle was not spared. By 1921, few townspeople <b>there</b> <b>could</b> afford a musical education at Bruno Heydrich's conservatory. This led to a financial crisis for the Heydrich family.|$|E

5|$|Ideasthesia {{theory of}} art {{may be used}} for {{psychological}} studies of aesthetics. It may also help explain classificatory disputes about art as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history. <b>There</b> <b>could</b> exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.|$|E

5|$|The base's Education Center also {{provided}} testing service {{for those interested}} in taking exams. It provided the CLEP, DANTES Exams, SAT, ACT, the LSAT and GRE exams.

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>could</b> conceivably {{be other}} planets {{in the system}} that do not transit the star, but they would only be {{detectable}} by the effects of their gravity on {{the motion of the}} visible planets (much as how Neptune was discovered).|$|E
5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus <b>there</b> <b>could</b> be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E

He hoped to also win gold in the 50-metre and 100-metre freestyle, but settled for silver in the 50-metre freestyle, and bronze in the 100-metre freestyle. When interviewed after the contest, Cielo said <b>there</b> <b>could</b> have been some flaw in his training program, resulting in a lack of stamina.|$|E
5|$|At the Greene farm, Hershel {{reveals that}} Carl needs major surgery to live, {{and that he}} will need a respirator. Otis {{suggests}} that they might find supplies at a nearby high school—where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a trailer—although the place is likely overrun with walkers. Otis and Shane decide to get the supplies, while Maggie retrieves Lori from the group and brings her to the Greene home. Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic; Rick believes there is no cure, while Hershel has faith that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> be one.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro is a {{widespread}} hilly geological area covering large portions of the lunar surface around Mare Imbrium, and {{is thought to be}} composed of ejecta from the impact which formed Imbrium. The area is primarily composed of relatively low ridges and hills, between which exist undulating valleys. Much of the ejecta blanket from the Imbrium impact is covered with debris from younger impacts and material churned up by possible moonquakes. Debris found in the formation may have originated from deep beneath the original crust, and samples collected <b>there</b> <b>could</b> give insight into the geologic history of the Moon. The petrology of the formation, based on data obtained on Apollo 14, indicates a history of impact and ejection possibly spanning over approximately 500 million years.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{a number}} of {{activities}} were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as {{a slap in the}} face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|E
5|$|In early summer, Maslama {{ordered his}} fleet {{to join him}} and with his army crossed the Hellespont (Dardanelles) at Abydos into Thrace. The Arabs began their march on Cοnstantinople, {{thoroughly}} devastating the countryside, gathering supplies, and sacking the towns they encountered. In mid-July or mid-August, the Arab army reached Constantinople and isolated it completely on land by building a double siege wall of stone, one facing the city and one facing the Thracian countryside, with their camp positioned between them. According to Arab sources, at this point Leo offered to ransom the city by paying a gold coin for every inhabitant, but Maslama replied that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> not be peace with the vanquished, and that the Arab garrison of Constantinople had already been selected.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which <b>there</b> <b>could</b> actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax is implemented, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> {{be a strong}} {{incentive}} for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794 {{the army of the}} French Republic overran the Dutch Republic. The French National Convention {{reformed}} the Dutch Republic into a revolutionary client state named the Batavian Republic. This event alarmed the government of Great Britain, erstwhile allies of the Dutch, as the Dutch Empire controlled a number of strategically important colonies in the East Indies. The key to controlling European access to the region was the Dutch Cape Colony on the tip of Southern Africa; a naval force based <b>there</b> <b>could</b> dominate the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies, in particular the economically vital links between Britain and British India.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 2011, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests {{said that}} the {{proposal}} for according tiger reserve status for the Sathyamangalam Reserve Forests is under consideration. He said that studies using camera traps indicated <b>there</b> <b>could</b> be 19 to 25 tigers in Sathyamangalam forests. A 2011 camera trap tiger density study conducted by World Wildlife Fund indicated that the sanctuary is home to at least 25 tigers. In the same year, a DNA based project initiated by the state forest department collected 150 samples of pugmarks from Sathyamangalam forests and 69 of them were found positive for tigers by tests conducted at the Center for Molecular Biology in Hyderabad. The findings also indicated that the region is home {{to as many as}} 30 tigers.|$|E
