5|$|In July 1869 Van Gogh's uncle Cent {{obtained}} a position {{for him at}} the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>year</b> of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as {{the degree to which the}} firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.|$|E

25|$|In fact, the 1951 season set {{the pattern}} for the next eight seasons of Parkhouse's career. In each season from 1951 to 1958, he made his 1000 runs for the year, but he never made {{more than two centuries}} in a season, and in 1952 and 1958 he made none at all. His batting average in most of these seasons was around 30, with 1642 runs at 35.69 in 1957 <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>year,</b> and 1126 at 24.47 in 1958 the worst. From 1953 he went back to opening the innings, initially, with Emrys Davies, then with Clift or captain Wilf Wooller, finally forming a regular {{partnership}} with Bernard Hedges. In 1954, he raised his own highest score with an innings of 182 against Middlesex at Lord's. And two years later, in 1956, he raised it again, to 201, in the match against Kent at Swansea.|$|E
25|$|Baltimore's {{quest for}} a {{championship}} seemed doomed from the start when long-time starting quarterback Johnny Unitas suffered a pre-season injury to his throwing arm {{and was replaced by}} Earl Morrall, a veteran who had started inconsistently {{over the course of his}} 12 seasons with four different teams. But Morrall would go on to have <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>year</b> of his career, leading the league in passer rating (93.2) during the regular season. His performance was so impressive that Colts coach Don Shula decided to keep Morrall in the starting lineup after Unitas was healthy enough to play. The Colts had won ten games in a row, including four shutouts, and finished the season with an NFL-best 13–1 record. In those ten games, they had allowed only seven touchdowns. Then, the Colts avenged their sole regular-season loss against the Cleveland Browns by crushing them, 34–0, in the NFL Championship Game.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Muster enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>year</b> of {{his career}} winning 12 tournaments, with 11 of those tournaments won on clay-courts. Between February and June 1995, Muster won 40 {{consecutive}} matches on clay (the longest winning streak on the surface since Björn Borg had won 46 matches between 1977–79). At the 1995 Monte Carlo Masters, he defeated Andrea Gaudenzi in the semifinals, despite struggling heavily in the latter stages of the match due to having a shortage of glucose in his blood and suffering a 40° fever, which required a brief spell in hospital after the match. The next day, he won the final against Boris Becker, after a tough match, by 4–6, 5–7, 6–1, 7–6, 6–0, with Muster surviving two championship points in the fourth set tiebreak, {{the first of which}} saw Becker double-faulting after going for a big second serve. He went on to win his second Italian Open title, defeating Sergi Bruguera in the final. At the 1995 French Open, Muster won his first and only Grand Slam singles title, defeating Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the semifinals and comfortably beating 1989 champion Michael Chang in the final. Muster is the only Austrian to win a Grand Slam singles title. His win-loss record on clay in 1995 was a remarkable 65–2. Although his record on other surfaces was less impressive, a late season victory over Pete Sampras on fast indoor carpet, during his run to the title of the Masters event in Germany, gave Muster an outside chance at finishing the year no. 1; however, Sampras finished the year at no. 1. Of the 12 tournaments that Muster won in 1995, Muster saved at least one match point held against him during six of them, with those six tournaments being held in Estoril, Barcelona, Monte Carlo, St. Pölten, Stuttgart Outdoor and Umag.|$|E

500|$|During {{the time}} the canal was {{administered}} by the Bridgewater Trustees, it made a profit every year. [...] Until his retirement in 1834, the administration was carried out entirely by Bradshaw. It has been calculated that the average annual profit between 1806 and 1826 was {{of the order of}} 13 per cent, and in 1824, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>year,</b> it was 23 per cent. [...] Bradshaw found it difficult to delegate, and complained of being over-worked, but he was also regarded as being a [...] "formidable bargainer". In 1805 he was approached by the proprietors of the nearby Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal to resolve a dispute with a Salford landowner, but his response was delayed. In 1810 there was a general agreement with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company (M) to simultaneously raise freight charges. However any cooperation between the two companies was short-lived and by 1812 the Mersey and Irwell had reduced their charges. Further competition was to come from other carriers who used the canal; in 1824 the traffic carried by private companies exceeded that carried by the Trustees for the first time. However, in time more profit came from [...] "tonnage traffic" [...] (that carried by private companies) than from the Bridgewater's own carriage of freight. Bradshaw's administration saw increased deterioration of the fabric of the canal, the locks, docks and warehouses. The undertakings were starved of capital largely owing to inadequate provision for it in the duke's will. There were also problems caused by silting around the entrance to the Mersey and by the changing channels of the river itself.|$|E

[...] As a pitcher, he started 40 games (34 of them complete games) and compiled a 23–15 win-loss record and a 2.46 ERA in 329-2/3 innings. [...] He also pitched a no-hitter on August 26, 1884, against the Kansas City Cowboys, the first of only two no-hitters pitched in the UA.

On August 20, 1909, the Tigers traded him to the St. Louis Browns for Tom Jones. Rossman had a {{peculiar}} emotional quirk where he sometimes froze and could not throw the ball when he became excited. Runners would lead off first to draw a throw from the pitcher, then run to second when Rossman froze. He was 28 when he played his last major league game and died at age 46 in a New York hospital for the insane {{where he had been}} a patient for several years.|$|E

From two games to three advantage Goolagong in the first set, Evert took the next ten games off her opponent and took the title and championship. Goolagong could not give any competition to Evert in the final, which she lost {{for the second year in}} a row to Evert, which made Evert's record against her 18 to 11. She would lose only 12 games at this US Open on her way to the title. It is the least amount of games lost by a Grand Slam Champion.

60|$|In {{the last}} three years the whole of our exports was between 44 and 45 millions. In the three years {{preceding}} the war, it was no more than from 35 to 36 millions. The average balance of the former period was 3,706,000l.; of the latter, something above four millions. It is true, that whilst the impressions of the author's destructive war continued, our trade was greater than it is at present. One of the necessary consequences of the peace was, that France must gradually recover a part of those markets of which she had been originally in possession. However, after all these deductions, still the gross trade in the worst year of the present is better than in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>year</b> of any former period of peace. A very great part of our taxes, if not the greatest, has been imposed {{since the beginning of the}} century. On the author's principles, this continual increase of taxes must have ruined our trade, or at least entirely checked its growth. But I have a manuscript of Davenant, which contains an abstract of our trade for the years 1703 and 1704; by which it appears that the whole export from England did not then exceed 6,552,019l. It is now considerably more than double that amount. Yet England was then a rich and flourishing nation.|$|E
