This day, Sedantag in German (French journée de Sedan), became a holiday in the German Empire. The first, brief attempt to avoid disaster through an armistice had failed and the emperor had become a prisoner of war.|$|E

500|$|Play.d {{magazine}} credited Smith with inspiring gamers {{to learn}} more about the game industry and not accept company promotion, as well as turning 1UP from [...] "the bastard child of EGM" [...] to an important part of the Ziff Davis Internet company's gaming network. His style has been described as a [...] "robust, direct approach" [...] to journalism and is known for his scathing attacks on the industry. Smith, however, felt disheartened by the state of game journalism. [...] "Video game journalism is just weird. You have guys married to women in marketing for the games they cover. Video game journalism is still very young, very early, still trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is," [...] he said. In an interview with Michael Zenke of The Escapist, Smith said he felt game journalists were treated by developers as another part of the PR plan, with developers sending out information and the journalists [...] "regurgitating" [...] it. Worse, Smith felt that gamers had become used to this sort of information; [...] "We have to be responsible for our actions and held accountable when we manipulate the expectations of gamers," [...] he told Zenke.|$|E

Gough sent interpreter Peter Perring Thoms, on secondment from British Plenipotentiary and Superintendent of Trade Charles Elliot, <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant. When a Mandarin explained that the Chinese wanted peace, Gough notes in his official report: [...] "I had it explained that, as General commanding the British, I would treat with none but the General commanding the Chinese troops, that we came before Canton much against the wishes of the British nation, but that repeated insults and breaches of faith had compelled us to make the present movement, and that I would cease from hostilities for two hours to enable their General to meet me and Sir Le Fleming Senhouse." [...] When no general appeared, the next day British forces prepared once more for the attack on Canton. This time, a message arrived from Charles Elliot announcing that he had come to an agreement with the Governor-general of Canton, Yu Baochen (余葆纯) according to the following key points: ...|$|E

2500|$|Yorke {{released}} his debut solo album The Eraser in 2006 on the independent label XL Recordings. Composed of mainly electronic music recorded during Radiohead's 2004 hiatus, {{the album was}} produced by Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich and features artwork by Donwood. Yorke said: [...] "I've been in the band since we left school and never dared do anything on my own... It was like, 'Man, I've got <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> feels like,' you know?" [...] He stressed that Radiohead were not splitting up and that the album was made [...] "with their blessing". The Eraser reached number three in the UK in its first week, number two in the United States, Canada and Australia, and number nine in Ireland. It was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize and the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. An album of remixes by various artists, The Eraser Rmxs, was released in 2009. In July 2009, Yorke performed solo at the Latitude Festival in England. On 21 September 2009, he released a double-A-side single, [...] "Feeling Pulled Apart by Horses" [...] / [...] "The Hollow Earth". In the same year, Yorke formed a new band, Atoms for Peace, to perform songs from The Eraser. Alongside Yorke on vocals, guitar and keyboards, the band comprises bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, drummer Joey Waronker of Beck and R.E.M., percussionist Mauro Refosco of Forro in the Dark, and Godrich on keyboards and guitar. Yorke said: [...] "God love 'em but I've been playing with the same band since I was 16, and to do this was quite a trip... It felt like we'd knocked a hole in a wall, and we should just fucking go through it." [...] The band played eight North American shows in 2010.|$|E
