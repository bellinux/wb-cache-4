25|$|Like in the Netherlands, Belgium and France have a {{road sign}} that allows cyclists to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> a red light. The French and Belgian signs {{consist of a}} yield sign with a yellow bike and arrow inside. Such signs are placed under traffic lights.|$|E
25|$|Most of Jackson's {{men were}} unaware of the small action {{at the rear of}} their column. As they marched north on Brock Road, Jackson was {{prepared}} to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> the Orange Plank Road, from which his men would attack the Union lines at around Wilderness Church. However, it became apparent that this direction would lead to essentially a frontal assault against Howard's line. Fitzhugh Lee met Jackson and they ascended a hill with a sweeping view of the Union position and Jackson was delighted to see that Howard's men were resting, unaware of the impending Confederate threat. Although by now it was 3 p.m., Jackson decided to march his men two miles farther and <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> the Turnpike instead, allowing him to strike the unprotected flank directly. The attack formation consisted of two lines—the divisions of Brig. Gens. Robert E. Rodes and Raleigh E. Colston—stretching almost a mile {{on either side of the}} turnpike, separated by 200 yards, followed by a partial line with the arriving division of A.P. Hill.|$|E
50|$|In some countries, {{red lights}} {{can be avoided}} by <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> red (or left in drive-on-the-left countries), making a U-turn, and then <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> (or left) again back on to the street on which the {{motorist}} was traveling. This may require less time than waiting for the light to turn green.|$|R

25|$|In Lithuania, {{drivers are}} allowed to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> red when a {{particular}} sign with a green arrow on a white background is mounted beside the red light of the traffic signal. However, on 10 November 2014, national traffic rules were altered meaning that this sign will be valid only until 31 December 2019 at the latest, by which time all such signs will have been eliminated. These changes for reasons of road safety.|$|E
25|$|Through most of Canada, {{a driver}} may turn right {{at a red}} light after coming to a {{complete}} stop unless a sign indicates otherwise. In the province of Quebec, turning right on a red was illegal until a pilot study carried out in 2003 showed that the right turn on red manoeuvre did not result in significantly more accidents. Subsequent to the study, the Province of Quebec now allows right turns on red except where prohibited by a sign. However, like in New York City, it remains illegal to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> a red anywhere on the Island of Montreal. Motorists are reminded of this by large signs posted at the entrance to all bridges.|$|E
2500|$|In France a {{right turn}} on red without {{stopping}} is allowed when a separate arrow-shaped amber light flashes, but drivers {{do not have}} priority. [...] They must check if any pedestrians are crossing before turning and must give way to vehicles coming from other directions.. In France it is allowed to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> red for cyclists if a sign tell so.|$|E

2500|$|In the Netherlands, {{bicycles}} are occasionally {{allowed to}} <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> {{a red light}} (assuming that {{the design of the}} junction is such that the light is even applicable to right turning cyclists, which it often is not in the Netherlands). Wherever this is the case, a sign [...] "rechtsaf voor fietsers vrij" [...] (right turn free for cyclists) or [...] "rechtsaf voor (brom)fietsers vrij" [...] (right turn free for cyclists and mopeds) is present.|$|E

50|$|The Q59's western {{terminus}} {{is at the}} Williamsburg Bridge Plaza Bus Terminal in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. From there, it goes west <b>on</b> Broadway, <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> Kent Avenue {{to travel}} north to Grand Street. However, since Grand Street is not continuous across the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE), the eastbound Q59 uses Roebling Street, Metropolitan Avenue, and Union Avenue to travel around the BQE. At Grand Street, the Q59 turns left, continuing until Gardner Avenue and Metropolitan Avenue (since eastbound Grand Street curves onto Metropolitan Avenue after crossing the Newtown Creek). The eastbound Q59 <b>turns</b> <b>right</b> onto Grand Street after a short distance, continuing across the Grand Street Bridge and into Maspeth until another discontinuity forces the Q59 to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> and then left at Flushing Avenue. It remains on Grand Avenue until Queens Boulevard, when it <b>turns</b> <b>right.</b> At Queens Boulevard, the Q59 <b>turns</b> <b>right</b> onto the eastbound service road. It continues along Queens Boulevard until Eliot Avenue, where it turns left along the Long Island Expressway. The Q59 <b>turns</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> Junction Boulevard and terminates at 62nd Road, near Rego Center and the 63rd Drive-Rego Park subway station in Rego Park.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1989, PA 307 {{followed}} an older alignment bypassing Downtown Scranton. On Moosic Street, {{just north of}} I-81, PA 307 <b>turned</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> Harrison Avenue, starting a concurrency with US 11. Together they crossed the Harrison Avenue bridge and continued about a mile to Myrtle Street. PA 307 and US 11 <b>turned</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> Myrtle for one block then left on Wheeler Avenue. After entering the Borough of Dunmore and crossing the old Erie Railroad tracks, the pair turned left on Cherry Street then bore right onto South Blakely Street, entering Downtown Dunmore. They turned left onto Green Ridge Street, re-entering Scranton in the Green Ridge section of the city. At the end of Green Ridge Street at North Scranton Junior High School, they <b>turned</b> <b>right</b> onto Main Avenue entering the Providence section of the city.

5000|$|<b>Right</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> red are {{permitted}} {{in many regions}} of North America.

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 required in §362(c)(5) that in order for a state to receive federal assistance in developing mandated conservation programs, they must permit <b>right</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> red lights. [...] All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have allowed <b>right</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> red since 1980, except where prohibited by a sign or where <b>right</b> <b>turns</b> are controlled by dedicated traffic lights.

50|$|The course {{began on}} Almaden Boulevard running northerly along the {{southbound}} lanes {{of the road}} crossing VTA light rail tracks at San Carlos St. Just before reaching Santa Clara Street the course reached turn one, an abrupt hairpin that caused the drivers to double back in the southbound direction along Almaden Blvd again {{in the opposite direction}} of normal traffic.

2500|$|At intersections where U-turns are {{permitted}} {{and controlled by}} a U-turn arrow from the left-most lane, motorists <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> red onto the same road must yield to those making U-turns before turning, as the motorists making U-turns have {{the right of way}} and a collision could easily occur. At intersections where U-turns are prohibited in the same fashion, a green <b>right</b> <b>turn</b> arrow will sometimes appear with the red light for those <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> onto the road, allowing only traffic <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> to proceed without having to stop or yield to other vehicles or pedestrians. Some states such as California have [...] "No U-Turn" [...] signs posted at these intersections because of the green <b>right</b> <b>turn</b> arrow.|$|R
