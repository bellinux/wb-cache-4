40|$|RONO: 2490 5234 RONO: 2490 4066 Ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} {{following the}} application of livestock slurry to agricultural land is {{a significant source of}} atmospheric NH 3, and not only poses a risk to the environment through eutrophication and acidification of sensitive ecosystems, but may also result in a loss of plant-available nitrogen (N). The band-spread slurry application technologies of <b>trailing</b> <b>hose</b> and trailing shoe have been shown to reduce NH 3 emissions and consequently to increase plant uptake of slurry-applied N. There is a need to improve the precision in calculating the reduction in NH 3 emission nationally and at farm level, and this may be achieved through the development of algorithms that more accurately estimate NH 3 emission and also support the assessment of fertilizer efficiency of slurry that is band-applied to crops. Therefore, this study reviewed studies of NH 3 emission from slurry band applied with a <b>trailing</b> <b>hose</b> or shoe with the objective of developing an algorithm for calculating the reduction efficiency of the band application technique in relation to crop height. The developed algorithm predicted that for slurry applications to cereal crops, the reduction efficiency would increase by slightly less than 1 % for every 1 cm increase in crop height. For slurry application to grassland, the reduction efficiency was predicted to increase by approximately 5 % for every 1 cm increase in sward height. The developed algorithm was used in combination with the ALFAM model, which predicts NH 3 emission from slurry applications to bare soil, to provide monthly coefficients for estimating NH 3 emission from slurry applied to bare soil, cereal crops and grassland for Denmark and Southern England. Inclusion of the crop height algorithm in the emission factor derivation predicted, for example, a decrease in the emission factor for cattle slurry application by <b>trailing</b> <b>hose</b> to winter wheat from c. 25 % to c. 15 % of applied ammoniacal N for applications in January and May, respectively. While the algorithm developed in this study would benefit from wider validation, should more published data become available, the present paper demonstrates its potential value as an educational tool for farmers and advisers in developing more sustainable manure management strategies and for inclusion in emission factor calculations for national inventories to both improve the temporal distribution of emissions from slurry application and to better reflect improved management practices of farmers.

40|$|Objective: Nitrogen {{losses from}} manure, {{especially}} from cattle slurry, significantly {{contribute to the}} eutrophication problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to minimize the nitrogen losses from cattle slurry used as a fertilizer of winter wheat. Investigation programme: In multi-factorial field experiments and accompanying laboratory studies techniques for the careful incorporation of slurry were tested together with slurry separation and slurry additives. Results, possible applications: A rapid pH increase due to CO_ 2 volatilization following slurry application is the cause of the high initial NH_ 3 emission rates. To conserve slurry nitrogen, the slurry-borne bases have to be buffered by the acid content of the soil. Only the combination of slurry separation and incorporation (flexible harrow, injector) provides sufficient contact between slurry and soil to reduce NH_ 3 losses to less than 30 % of the ammoniacal slurry nitrogen in all the weather and soil conditions investigated. Banded application of slurry to growing crops (winter wheat) by <b>trail</b> <b>hoses</b> with subsequent careful incorporation by a flexible harrow seems to be the best way to use the slurry as a fertilizer in cereal production. The use of <b>trail</b> <b>hoses</b> allone is not sufficient. Viscous slurry with a high dry matter content may only be used in a N-conserving manner after it has been dry matter-reduced by separation. Possibly the addition of ground gypsum to slurry previous to the application can further reduce the NH_ 3 losses. (orig.)

40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} {{from animal}} manure contributes to {{air pollution and}} ecosystem degradation, {{and the loss of}} reactive nitrogen (N) from agricultural systems. Estimates of NH 3 emission are necessary for national inventories and nutrient management, and NH 3 emission from field-applied manure has been measured in many studies over the past few decades. In this work, we facilitate the use of these data by collecting and organizing them in the ALFAM 2 database. In this paper we describe the development of the database and summarise its contents, quantify effects of application methods and other variables on emission using a data subset, and discuss challenges for data analysis and model development. The database contains measurements of emission, manure and soil properties, weather, application technique, and other variables for 1895 plots from 22 research institutes in 12 countries. Data on five manure types (cattle, pig, mink, poultry, mixed, as well as sludge and "other") applied to three types of crops (grass, small grains, maize, as well as stubble and bare soil) are included. Application methods represented in the database include broadcast, <b>trailing</b> <b>hose,</b> trailing shoe (narrow band application), and open slot injection. Cattle manure application to grassland was the most common combination, and analysis of this subset (with dry matter (DM) limited to < 15 %) was carried out using mixed- and fixed-effects models in order to quantify effects of management and environment on ammonia emission, and to highlight challenges for use of the database. Measured emission in this subset ranged from < 1 % to 130 % of applied ammonia after 48 h. Results showed clear, albeit variable, reductions in NH 3 emission due to <b>trailing</b> <b>hose,</b> trailing shoe, and open slot injection of slurry compared to broadcast application. There was evidence of positive effects of air temperature and wind speed on NH 3 emission, and limited evidence of effects of slurry DM. However, random-effects coefficients for differences among research institutes were among the largest model coefficients, and showed a deviation from the mean response by more than 100 % in some cases. The source of these institute differences could not be determined with certainty, but {{there is some evidence that}} they are related to differences in soils, or differences in application or measurement methods. The ALFAM 2 database should be useful for development and evaluation of both emission factors and emission models, but users need to recognize the limitations caused by confounding variables, imbalance in the dataset, and dependence among observations from the same institute. Variation among measurements and in reported variables highlights the importance of international agreement on how NH 3 emission should be measured, along with necessary types of supporting data and standard protocols for their measurement. Both are needed in order to produce more accurate and useful ammonia emission measurements.

40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} from {{livestock production}} causes undesirable environmental effects {{and a loss}} of plant available nitrogen. Much atmospheric NH 3 is lost from livestock manure applied in the field. The NH 3 emission may be reduced by slurry injection, but slurry injection in general, and especially on grassland, increases the energy demand and places heavy demands on the slurry injection techniques used. The reduction in NH 3 emission, injection efficiency and energy demand of six different shallow slurry-injection techniques was examined. The NH 3 emission from cattle slurry applied to grassland was reduced by all the injectors tested in the study, but there were major differences in the NH 3 reduction potential of the different types of injectors. Compared with the <b>trailing</b> <b>hose</b> spreading technique, the NH 3 loss was reduced by 75 % when cattle slurry was injected using the most efficient slurry injection technique, and by 20 % when incorporated by the least efficient injection technique. The reduction in NH 3 emission was correlated with injection depth and the volume of the slot created. The additional energy demand for reducing ammonia emissions by slurry injection was approximately 13 000 kJ ha- 1 for a 20 % reduction and 34 000 kJ ha- 1 for a 75 % reduction. The additional energy demand corresponds to additional emissions of, respectively, 5. 6 and 14. 5 kg CO 2 per ha injected...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{economic}} analysis {{of different ways}} to cover the slurry tank and apply the slurry to the field has been carried out. It is found that covering slurry tanks with either straw or a floating lid is profitable. New field application techniques have become more profitable since an N-norm of 10 % under the economic optimum was adopted in Denmark. This has increased the shadow price of nitrogen. When applying animal manure, injection is a profitable alternative to <b>trailing</b> <b>hoses</b> in spring crops before sowing and in many forage crops, as it gives higher yields and sometimes also higher protein content. Injection of animal manure can in some cases eliminate the negative economic effect of a nitrogen norm.

40|$|Favourable {{economics}} of handling {{and application of}} manure are of fundamental importance to encourage the implementation of emission-reducing application techniques. The {{economics of}} manure application depend on {{the costs of the}} equipment and the time to carry out the field operation. In this study the costs of application techniques designed to reduce ammonia losses were assessed and compared with the costs of conventional broadcast spreading across a range of farm characteristics. A model was developed to calculate the costs and time requirements of manure application. Data on factors affecting the costs were used from different countries in Europe. The calculations showed that for a range of farm characteristics with a manure production of 1000 - 3000 m(3) y(- 1), the costs of manure application by <b>trailing</b> <b>hose,</b> trailing foot, shallow injector and arable land injector were approximate to 2 Euro m(- 3) higher than for broadcast spreading. The cost difference between broadcast spreading and the other application techniques decreased with farm size. The average additional costs of manure application by a trailing foot or a shallow injector decreased by 15 % on small extensive farms to more than 50 % on intensive farms, when the fertiliser value of the nitrogen was taken into account. The field application itself took less than 50 % of the operating time in the process of the manure handling and application. With an increasing application rate, the relative contribution of the time for field application decreased. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAmmonia {{exchanges between}} the {{atmosphere}} and terrestrial ecosystems are composed of several pathways including exchange with the soil, the litter, the plant surfaces (cuticle) and through the stomata. In this study, the fate of nitrogen in the different pools (soil and plant) was analyzed {{with the aim of}} determining the sources and sink of atmospheric ammonia after slurry application on a wheat canopy. To do this, we measured ammonia exchanges between a winter wheat canopy and the atmosphere following cattle slurry application with a <b>trailing</b> <b>hose.</b> From 12 March to 8 April in Grignon near Paris, France, the ammonia fluxes ranged from an emission peak of 54, 300 NH 3 ngm− 2 s− 1 on the day of slurry application (with a median during the first 24 h of 5990 NH 3 ngm− 2 s− 1) to a deposition flux of − 600 NH 3 ngm− 2 s− 1 (with a median during the last period of − 16 NH 3 ngm− 2 s− 1). The ammonia compensation points were evaluated for apoplasm, foliar bulk, root bulk and litter bulk tissue, as well as for soil surface. Ammonia emission potentials defined by the ratios between the concentration in [NH 4 +] and [H+] for each N ecosystem pool were in the same order of magnitude for the plant decomposed in apoplastic liquid, green leaf bulk tissue and cuticle, respectively, averaging at 73, 160 and 120; in green leaf bulk tissues, the emission potential decreased gradually from 230 to 78 during the period after slurry application, while in the dead leaf bulk tissues considered as litter, the emission potential reached a maximum of 50, 200 after application stabilized at around 20000. The dynamic of the emission potential for roots was similar to the ammonium concentration in the first two centimeters of the soil, with a maximum of 820 reached two days after application and a minimum of 44 reached three weeks later. The surfatm-NH 3 model interpreted the emission and deposition fluxes by testing soil surface resistance. We conclude that emission of the first day application was driven by climatic conditions and ammonia concentration at the soil surface, with no surface resistance and with only soil surface emission potential. On the next three days, the ammonia emission originated from the soil surface with the growth of a dry surface layer inducing surface resistance and regulated by slurry infiltration. The following days need a more detailed description of soil surface processes and the integration of vegetation exchanges (stomatal and cuticle pathways), particularly in the last period, in order to explain the ammonia deposition...|$|E

40|$|Emissions {{of ammonia}} to the {{atmosphere}} are considered {{a threat to the}} environment and both United Nation treaty and European Union legislation increasingly limit emissions. Livestock farming is the major source of atmospheric NH 3 in Europe and field applied manure contributes significantly to the emission of NH 3 from agriculture. This paper presents a review of studies of NH 3 emission from field-applied animal manure and of the methods available for its reduction. It is shown that there is a complex relationship between the NH 3 emission rate from slurry and the slurry composition, soil conditions and climate. It is concluded that simple empirical models cannot be used to predict ammonia emission from the wide range of circumstances found in European agriculture and that a more mechanistic approach is required. NH 3 emission from applied solid manure and poultry manure has been studied less intensively than slurry but appear to be controlled by similar mechanisms. The use of <b>trail</b> <b>hoses,</b> pre- or post-application cultivation, reduction in slurry viscosity, choice of application rate and timing and slurry injection were considered as reduction techniques. The most effective methods of reducing ammonia emissions were concluded to be incorporation of the animal slurry and farmyard manure or slurry injection. Incorporation should be as close to the application as possible, especially after slurry application, as loss rates are high in the 1 st hours after application. Injection is a very efficient reduction technique, provided the slurry is applied at rates that can be contained in the furrows made by the injector tine. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.
