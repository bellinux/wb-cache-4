5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, mooted the idea of a Federation of Malaysia, comprising existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei and the British Borneo territories of North Borneo and Sarawak. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge {{as the leader of the}} survivors. Kate's {{original}} backstory was that her husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive. However the Lost producers changed <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> Jack's death; they decided he would become the leader and created a new backstory for Kate. They still liked Kate's original backstory, so they used it for Rose. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and decided to make Bernard a white character to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked. Sam Anderson was unaware of which character he would be playing when he was cast in Lost. During his audition he performed a scene where a man from the plane crash was informed his daughter was still alive, which he noted covered a similar emotion to the scene in which Bernard is told Rose is still alive. Anderson and Caldwell were given a rough idea of how much they would appear at the start of the seasons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She {{was not going to be}} a fugitive, instead her husband was going to go to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.|$|E

5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E
25|$|Structuration is {{very useful}} in synthesising micro and macro issues. On a micro scale, one of individuals' {{internal}} {{sense of self}} and identity, consider the example of a family: we are increasingly free to choose our own mates and how to relate with them, which creates new opportunities but also more work, as the relationship becomes a reflexive project that has to be interpreted and maintained. Yet this micro-level change cannot be explained only by looking at the individual level as people did not spontaneously change <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> how to live; neither can we assume they were directed to do so by social institutions and the state.|$|E

When she finally found a house, the neighbors were not happy. Shots were fired at her windows and she had to contact the police for protection.

25|$|In the 5th century, Saint Augustine wrote The Literal Meaning of Genesis {{in which}} he argued that Genesis should be {{interpreted}} as God forming the Earth and life from pre-existing matter and allowed for an allegorical interpretation of {{the first chapter of}} Genesis. For example: he argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. On the other hand, Augustine called for a historical view of the remainder of the history recorded in Genesis, including the creation of Adam and Eve, and the Flood. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that Christians should be willing to change <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> it as new information comes up. He also warned believers not to rashly interpret things literally that might be allegorical, as it would discredit the faith.|$|E

When the character returns in the fourth season, she is much different than her third season counterpart. Cortese felt that while the drastic change made fans angry, the flashbacks provided in [...] "I Know What You Did Last Summer" [...] shed some light on Ruby's new mindset and made fans more accepting of the character. However, the overall criticisms towards Cortese's performance made her reluctant to return for an episode in the sixth season, although she eventually accepted when she learned she would be portraying herself.|$|E

While Kara seeks to make amends with Frieda, Finn and Jake discover that the island is full of Minerva look-alike robots called [...] "helpers". They are brought to the real Minervaa digitized consciousnesswhen Finn is identified as her son. Minerva reveals that she had Dr. Gross send Kara to retrieve Finn, but years had passed and Dr. Gross had accidentally released a deadly virus that was killing humans. Minerva had her essence uploaded into a computer, and then created the helpers to assist the human race. Now that she is with Finn, she expresses her desire that he stay permanently. Finn tries to convince Minerva that life off the island is not all bad, but Minerva thinks off-island life is dangerous. Finn then tries to convince the humans to leave, and they all rally alongside him. This causes Minerva to attempt to upload the consciousnesses of all the islands' inhabitants. To prevent this, Finn shares with her his memories of helping people, causing her to back down; she realizes that Ooo is not nearly a threat as she before believed. The humans all change <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> leaving, except for Frieda. With Minerva's help, they defeat the colossus. Later, Kara and Frieda announce to Finn, Jake, and BMO that they have made amends and are leaving to have their own adventures. Finn has one final talk with Minerva through the VR headset, where the two embrace in the digital realm. Finn then returns to Ooo with Jake and BMO.|$|E

During the credits, it reveals Isabella obtained the tool and gave it to the boys before they even time traveled in the first place. This causes them to change <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>about</b> going into the future, thus, canceling out all the events that happened earlier in the episode and also causing all the characters involved in the future to cease existence (also erasing the [...] "busting" [...] present Candace caused, thus possibly causing a time loop).
