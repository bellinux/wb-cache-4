40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} {{screening}} or nonlinear pricing for discrete consumer types when the single-crossing condition need not hold. A method is developed to reveal social efficiency or distortion of equilibria from market observations. The two known indicators of efficiency, namely absence of almost-envy by a consumer for other consumer’s package; or per-package profit similarity, are extended. The third, empirically more useful, new crite-rion {{is based on}} demand parametrization, observed <b>tariffs,</b> <b>package</b> sizes, and some approx-imate estimate of marginal cost. Application of this criterion to several consumer goods shows existence of overall efficiency or oversized packages in reality, both contradicting Spence-Mirrlees condition. The methodological contribution is elaborating “envy-graph” notions to desribe solution structures. Key words: second-degree price discrimination, self-selection, multidimensional screen-ing, no single-crossing, socially efficient price discrimination...|$|R

If the electorate liked food duties, {{they would vote for}} the entire package; if not, they did not have to. Law replied arguing that {{it would be impossible to}} do so effectively, and that with the increasing costs of defence and social programmes it would be impossible to raise the necessary capital except by comprehensive tariff reform. He argued that a failure to offer the entire <b>tariff</b> reform <b>package</b> would split the Conservative Party down the middle, offending the tariff reform faction, and that if such a split took place [...] "I could not possibly continue as leader".|$|R
40|$|Federal {{military}} installations often receive electric utility service under ``special`` rate schedules designed for large government and institutional facilities. These schedules {{are intended to}} be financially beneficial to the government when compared with rates offered to large non-federal customers. Past experience, however, indicates that this {{may not always be}} the case. Determining the applicability and cost-effectiveness of alternative rate schedules is a complicated process requiring the analysis of utility bills and computer simulation of diurnal load data and utility rate structures. A layer of complexity is added if the federal installation receives service from more than one electric utility and is considering consolidated billing. In 1993, under a project with the Air Force, Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) examined the possibility of developing a methodology to facilitate the evaluation of alternative rate schedules. To meet the objectives of this project, PNL performed two tasks as follows: Task 1, PNL developed a proof-of-concept prototype computer program (RateSET) that compares the costs under a government rate schedule to those back-calculated under an alternative rate schedule. The program was used to recreate the structure of both rate schedules and then to process 24 monthly billing statements and the associated 30 -minute demand data for the two year period. For the initial test case, actual data were used from a large US Army Forces Command installation located in Georgia. Task 2, PNL then reviewed the <b>tariff</b> <b>packages</b> for each of the major electric utilities providing service to Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, South Carolina. The primary objective of this alternative rate schedule screening and evaluation process was to characterize the process itself, identify problem areas, and develop a workable approach to use in future similar evaluations...|$|R

As a complementary to fixed-line broadband access, WiFi networks are undoubtedly taking off in many American households. Due to {{the combination of}} wireless technol-ogy and fixed-line broadband access, prior available bandwidth measurement tools {{may not be an}} appropriate solution for a common broadband subscriber. In this paper, we utilize abget in combination with Multi-Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) to target the tight link of the Internet. Based on the observation that the tight link of the Internet {{in the context of an}} in-home wireless broadband access is usually on the edge of the Internet, we then introduce ABODE, a single-end, light-weight tool for estimating available bandwidth in the context of an in-home wireless bandwidth environment. ABODE harnesses ICMP echo request messages to generate stable, rate-controlled traffic flows. Based on the timestamp of ICMP echo reply messages, ABODE performs available bandwidth estimation by calculating the drift of the time centroid over a traffic flow. To verify the accuracy of ABODE, we use MRTG data to compare with the estimation results of ABODE. The measurement shows that ABODE is capable of efficiently estimating available bandwidth in the context of an in-home wireless broadband environment. I...|$|R
40|$|Utility meters {{are being}} {{transformed}} from simple measurement devices to complex socio-technical systems, {{enhanced by the}} addition of new informational and communication capacities. In this paper, we examine how there are multiple opportunities for the development of environmental applications within smarter metering systems. These include improving the efficiency of generation and distribution networks by more imaginative and customer-specific load and <b>tariff</b> control <b>packages</b> or providing customers with cost and environmental messages through user displays. The take-up of these potentials is strongly framed by the competing commercial priorities established by privatisation and liberalisation. Identifying four distinct metering technical development pathways (TDPs), the paper shows how the insertion of environmental functionalities into different smart meters is only partly a technological issue. Each TDP is designed to structure relations between users and the utilities. Different types of environmental opportunities exist within each TDP, but these potentials are often squeezed out by competing priorities. Implementing these environmental applications would require a powerful shift in regulatory and institutional frameworks within which utilities and manufacturers configure the functionalities of smart meters. It is only in this way that the flexible approach needed to recognise and reinstate environmental objectives into the development of smart meters could be realised and maintained...|$|R

40|$|This article {{identifies}} {{a number}} of examples of apparent lack of coherence in United States and European Union trade policies. They include the effect of preferential policies that lock in trade shares and inhibit growth promoting structural adjustment, biases in tariff structures, policies that affect incentives of developing countries to make commitments in the World Trade Organisation, the use of anti-dumping actions {{and the nature of}} tariff peaks and escalation. The origins of the lack of policy coherence lie within the domestic policy-making processes of the developed economies. An important question, then, is whether opportunity exists for East Asian economies to mobilise to induce an external shock sufficient to shift policy consensus in the United States and the European Union – The key elements of such a grand bargain on trade in manufactured goods would include an explicit East Asian commitment to bind more tariff lines, initiatives to resolve the problem of accelerating anti-dumping actions and a replacement for the program of <b>tariff</b> preferences. A <b>package</b> of trade policy reforms of this type in East Asia would constitute a substantial offer and benefit to the United States and the European Union. It has the potential to trigger a response of equal benefit to East Asian economies. ...|$|R
