However, the Peyote ingredient makes anyone who drinks the juice hallucinate. Chief Wiggum catches on and soon the police surround the farm. Homer defends Seth, Munchie and the hippie honor by reminding the police of the morals taught by the 1960s, planting a flower in each of the officer's guns. However, Wiggum discharges his, lodging its flower in Homer's forehead and leaving him hospitalized.|$|E

5|$|In October 2013, {{cast member}} Colette Mann, who plays Sheila Canning, {{revealed}} that her character's daughter {{was going to}} be introduced. Producers decided to bring in another member of Sheila's family as they wanted to explore her background further. The producers were also keen to introduce a character similar to Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte), who would provoke strong reactions among the characters and viewers. Mann added that the role {{was in the process of}} being cast and the character would arrive the following year. On 30 December 2013, it was announced that New Zealand actress Morgana O'Reilly had been cast as Naomi. O'Reilly attended two rounds of auditions before being cast.

Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led his wife to complain that Smith was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money.

25|$|Alexander was {{a lifelong}} {{dedicated}} and gifted birdwatcher, keenly {{involved in the}} twentieth century movements for the protection and observation of birds. Along with two of his older brothers, Wilfred and Christopher, he took a keen interest in nature. Growing up in a Quaker home devoid of any other forms of entertainment, he found an interest in birds from the age of eight, when his older brother Gilbert gave him a book on natural history. In his autobiography he traced the precise origin of his interest in birds to 8.45 am on 25 March 1897, when an uncle pointed out a singing chiffchaff in <b>their</b> <b>garden.</b> It was not until he was 20 that he obtained his first pair of binoculars. He was one {{of a small group of}} amateur birdwatchers who developed the skills and set new standards for combining the pleasures of birdwatching with the satisfaction of contributing to ornithological science. He made many significant observations, mainly in Britain but also in India and the United States.|$|E
500|$|Derek and Mavis {{have been}} {{described}} by What's on TV as [...] "an old-fashioned pair who were made for each other", and were typically featured in comic storylines, such as one in 1995 that saw <b>their</b> <b>garden</b> gnome kidnapped and transported around the world; Derek and Mavis received pictures of the gnome in various exotic locations, sent to them with ransom notes. It transpired that the kidnapper was Derek's friend Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden). The Daily Record labelled this storyline one of [...] "Coronation Street's Classic Comic Moments" [...] in 2008.|$|E
500|$|... "The Frying Game" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Michael Polcino. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May19,2002. The screamapillar, the larva that the Simpsons find in <b>their</b> <b>garden,</b> was, according to current showrunner Al Jean, Swartzwelder's [...] "total conception." [...] He pitched the idea to the Simpsons writing staff, and because they found it [...] "hilarious," [...] they decided to include it in the episode. Jean said that when people ask what sense of humor Swartzwelder has, the screamapillar is [...] "one of the best examples." [...] It was voiced by main cast member Dan Castellaneta, who portrays Homer among other characters in the series. Because the screamapillar only communicates by screaming, its lines were recorded last during recording sessions, as the screaming would [...] "burn out" [...] Castellaneta's voice.|$|E

500|$|... "Little Girl in the Big Ten" [...] {{was written}} by {{producer}} Jon Vitti and directed by Lauren MacMullan. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who {{thought she was a}} college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was [...] "brilliant", and the subplot involving Bart in a [...] "germ-free" [...] plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make [...] "the most different subplot from an intellectual college plot" [...] they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in <b>their</b> <b>garden.</b> Bart says the line [...] "You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me", to which Lisa replies [...] "That's not a sunset, that's a bird on fire." [...] Originally, Lisa's line read [...] " [...] that's a plane on fire," [...] however, after the September 11 attacks, the line was considered offensive and was changed. [...] " [...] since we work so far ahead we usually do these things that are sort of timeless stories," [...] Jean said, [...] "but {{every once in a while}} there's something that turns out to be ironic in a bad way, then we have to change it." ...|$|E
500|$|Jean has himself {{admitted}} {{in an interview}} that The Simpsons is of [...] "liberal bent". In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (the writer of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), are conservative. In his book The Really Inconvenient Truths: Seven Environmental Catastrophes Liberals Don't Want You to Know About- Because They Helped Cause Them, Iain Murray described [...] "The Frying Game" [...] as [...] "subversively conservative", and wrote that it shows [...] "The best popular explanation of the liberal environmentalist model for endangered species." [...] In the episode, Homer buys a koi pond for Marge, only to find a screamapillar has taken residence in <b>their</b> <b>garden.</b> When Homer tries to squash it, an EPA official tells him that allowing an endangered species to die is a federal offense, under the [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act of 1994." [...] Homer is forced to coddle the screamapillar, and when he accidentally squashes it, Homer is found guilty of [...] "attempted insecticide and aggravated buggery." [...] The [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act" [...] is a reference to the Endangered Species Act, an environmental law that Murray opined had [...] "indeed become the Reversal of Freedoms Act." [...] He continued, [...] "Landowners who happened to have threatened or endangered species on their lands or who simply have habitat that might be used by endangered species are routinely prevented from using their lands or property. They are stopped from undertaking such activities as harvesting their trees, grazing their cattle, irrigating their fields, clearing brush along fence lines, disking firebreaks around their homes and barns, or building new homes.|$|E
