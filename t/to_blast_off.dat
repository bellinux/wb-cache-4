25|$|Banks demanded more {{protection}} and safe makers responded by designing larger, heavier safes. Safes {{with a key}} lock were still vulnerable through the key hole, and bank robbers soon learned <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> <b>off</b> the door by pouring explosives in this opening. In 1861, inventor Linus Yale Jr. introduced the modern combination lock. Bankers quickly adopted Yale's lock for their safes, but bank robbers came up with several ways {{to get past the}} new invention. It was possible to use force to punch the combination lock through the door. Other experienced burglars learned to drill holes into the lock case and use mirrors to view the slots in the combination wheels inside the mechanism. A more direct approach was to simply kidnap the bank manager and force him to reveal the combination.|$|E
25|$|Ralph Cornish is {{determined}} to launch another spacecraft to retrieve his astronauts, who the Doctor believes {{are still in the}} Mars Probe capsule in Earth orbit. The Doctor volunteers to pilot the rocket himself. As he prepares <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> <b>off,</b> Reegan tries to sabotage the mission by tampering with the fuel, but the Doctor survives and succeeds in piloting the craft to its scheduled rendezvous in Earth orbit, but at the last moment an enormous spacecraft bears down on the two linked capsules and engulfs them. Aboard the alien spaceship, the Doctor discovers the three human astronauts, unharmed, but they have been mentally conditioned to believe they are in extended quarantine at Space Control on Earth. An alien being reveals itself and explains the humans are being held pending the safe return of the alien ambassadors, who have been sent to Earth to make peaceful contact with mankind. The Doctor assures the alien commander that the authorities on Earth knew nothing of this, and gives his personal guarantee to return the ambassadors safely. The alien commander threatens to destroy the world if the ambassadors are harmed.|$|E

500|$|After {{numerous}} confrontations {{and challenges}} with many ghosts, portrait ghosts, boss ghosts, Boos, puzzles, and locked doors, Luigi confronts King Boo, who has trapped Mario inside a painting like the portrait ghosts and hung {{him in a}} secret altar in the basement. King Boo pulls Luigi into a painting for their final battle in an arena that resembles the mansion's roof within a fiery background, puppeteering a lifelike Bowser suit from the inside. Using spiked, explosive metal balls thrown by [...] "Bowser", Luigi finds a way <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> <b>off</b> the suit's head and eventually vacuum and defeat King Boo, causing [...] "Bowser" [...] to collapse. Luigi returns to E. Gadd with Mario's painting and successfully extracts him from within it using the Ghost Portrificationizer in reverse. King Boo is turned into a painting {{along with the other}} portrait ghosts. The ending also sees the haunted mansion disappear, after which Professor E. Gadd uses the treasure Luigi collected on his adventure to build a new, non-haunted mansion {{on the site of the}} original mansion. The size of the house depends on how much treasure the player gathered before the end of the game.|$|E

5000|$|What if NASA {{could land}} astronauts on Mars in a decade, for not ridiculously {{more money than}} the $10 billion the agency spends {{annually}} on human spaceflight? It's possible ... relieving NASA of the need to send fuel and rocketry <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> humans <b>off</b> the Martian surface, which has slightly more than twice the gravity of the moon, would actually reduce costs by about a factor of 10, by some estimates.|$|R
50|$|One of NuSTAR's main {{goals is}} to {{characterize}} stars' explosions by mapping the radioactive material in a supernova remnant. The NuSTAR map of Cassiopeia A shows the titanium-44 isotope concentrated in clumps at the remnant's center and points to a possible solution {{to the mystery of}} how the star exploded. When researchers simulate supernova blasts with computers, as a massive star dies and collapses, the main shock wave often stalls and the star fails to shatter. The latest findings strongly suggest the exploding star literally sloshed around, re-energizing the stalled shock wave and allowing the star <b>to</b> finally <b>blast</b> <b>off</b> its outer layers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>Off</b> {{was later}} {{involved}} in a Decepticon plot to capture the Middle East oil fields. Early in the episode, Blast Offshoots down Slingshot forcing the Autobots to retreat. In order {{to prove that the}} Decepticons were stealing planes for their operation, Slingshot and Skydive remain in a hangar in their jet modes. The Arabian planenappers disassemble the two Aerialbots and store their parts in laundry trucks. <b>Blast</b> <b>Off</b> opens the truck to inspect the parts, but orders them scrapped when Slingshot fakes a short circuit. Later on, the Aerialbots arrive on the scene and the Decepticons use their new jet drones <b>to</b> attack them. <b>Blast</b> <b>Off</b> is assigned three of these jets. However, these drones proved to be no match for the Aerialbots and are destroyed.|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, in the rocket's control room, {{the colonel}} {{in charge of}} the launch discovers Woody in the rocket and heads up to the top to try to eject him. Mistaking him for the {{landlord}} Woody offers him some ice water, but the colonel orders him to leave. Woody does, but not before hitting the colonel in the face with a pie and being forcefully thrown out of the rocket. The colonel then heads back into the control room <b>to</b> prepare for <b>blast</b> <b>off,</b> while Woody immediately sneaks back into the rocket. Suddenly realizing where he is once the colonel starts counting down, Woody tears apart some of the rocket's electronics <b>to</b> stop the <b>blast</b> <b>off,</b> once again bringing the colonel outside to try and stop him. Woody first throws a motor at the colonel, then cuts the elevator so it drops on him. As the colonel climbs {{up to the top of}} the rocket (his only means of getting up there now), Woody climbs down, then goes into the control room and launches the rocket. Only the top of the rocket, where Woody had been making home, <b>blasts</b> <b>off</b> and crashes down to the ground with the colonel in it. Looking at the wreck, the colonel shrugs and says [...] "well, back to the drawing board".|$|R

On November 12, 1970, the department gained notoriety after they attempted to dispose of a rotting beached sperm whale by using half a ton of dynamite <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> it <b>off</b> the beach, as one might remove a boulder. They were given responsibility for this task because Oregon beaches were designated as highways when the division was initially formed. This became known as the [...] "exploding whale incident".|$|R

40|$|Mercury's {{unusually high}} mean density {{has always been}} {{attributed}} to special circumstances {{that occurred during the}} formation of the planet or shortly thereafter, and due to the planet's close proximity to the Sun. The nature of these special circumstances is still being debated and several scenarios, all proposed more than 20 years ago, have been suggested. In all scenarios, the high mean density is the result of severe fractionation occurring between silicates and iron. It is the origin of this fractionation that is at the centre of the debate: is it due to differences in condensation temperature and/or in material characteristics (e. g. density, strength) ? Is it because of mantle evaporation due to the close proximity to the Sun? Or is it due <b>to</b> the <b>blasting</b> <b>off</b> of the mantle during a giant impact?...|$|R

5|$|In her legend, Haumea's many {{children}} came from {{different parts of}} her body. The dwarf planet Haumea appears to be almost entirely made of rock, with only a superficial layer of ice; most of the original icy mantle is thought <b>to</b> have been <b>blasted</b> <b>off</b> by the impact that spun Haumea into its current high speed of rotation, where the material formed into the small Kuiper belt objects in Haumea's collisional family. There could therefore be additional outer moons, smaller than Namaka, that have not yet been detected. However, HST observations have confirmed that no other moons brighter than 0.25% of the brightness of Haumea exist within the closest tenth of the distance (0.1% of the volume) where they could be held by Haumea's gravitational influence (its Hill sphere). This makes it unlikely that any more exist.|$|R

50|$|Though the {{accuracy}} {{as regards the}} French ensign and Loutherbourgs detailed preparatory sketches show the artists great care over the detail, {{the matter of the}} central duel and its departure from literal historical truth shows how the painting is more a Romantic treatment of the battle than a literally documentary one, though such departures did not attract such widespread criticism as Turners did in Trafalgar. Attempts are being made by four English boats to rescue the Vengeurs crew, who are shown clinging to their ships spars and <b>to</b> other wreckage <b>blasted</b> <b>off</b> other ships right across the foreground. Both sides are shown heroically fighting the sea itself as well as each other, intensifying both and giving the event drama as well as human scale, as well as showing the British sailor as compassionate to his defeated enemy. Compared to Turners later pendant, the painting is an unequivocally heroic image and its overall style is conventionally patriotic.|$|R
