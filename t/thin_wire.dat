25|$|The {{second major}} design of fibulae has a high, rounded arch (bogen in German) {{instead of the}} low flat arch of the violin bow fibula. At first, the bow was thin. In later {{variants}} the bow was made of thicker metal or of two pieces of <b>thin</b> <b>wire</b> twisted together. These rounded bow fibulae were first found in the 12th century BC, but lasted in use in some places {{for more than five}} centuries.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{different}} types of fish hooks. At the macro level, there are bait hooks, fly hooks and lure hooks. Within these broad categories there are wide varieties of hook types designed for different applications. Hook types differ in shape, materials, points and barbs, and eye type and ultimately in their intended application. When individual hook types are designed the specific characteristics of each of these hook components are optimized relative to the hook's intended purpose. For example, a delicate dry fly hook is made of <b>thin</b> <b>wire</b> with a tapered eye because weight is the overriding factor. Whereas Carlisle or Aberdeen light wire bait hooks make use of <b>thin</b> <b>wire</b> to reduce injury to live bait but the eyes are not tapered because weight is not an issue. Many factors contribute to hook design, including corrosion resistance, weight, strength, hooking efficiency, and whether the hook is being used for specific types of bait, on different types of lures or for different styles of flies. For each hook type, there are ranges of acceptable sizes. For all types of hooks, sizes range from 32 (the smallest) to 20/0 (the largest).|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Faraday's law {{strictly}} holds {{only when the}} closed circuit is a loop of infinitely <b>thin</b> <b>wire,</b> and is invalid in other circumstances. It {{ignores the fact that}} Faraday's law is defined by the total, not partial, derivative of magnetic flux and also the fact that EMF is not necessarily confined to a closed path but may also have radial components as discussed below. A different version, the Maxwell–Faraday equation (discussed below), is valid in all circumstances, and when used in conjunction with the Lorentz force law it is consistent with correct application of Faraday's law.|$|E

25|$|A crystal {{detector}} includes a crystal, a special <b>thin</b> <b>wire</b> that contacts the crystal, and the stand that holds those components in place. The most common crystal used {{is a small}} piece of galena; pyrite was also often used, as it was a more easily adjusted and stable mineral, and quite sufficient for urban signal strengths. Several other minerals also performed well as detectors. Another benefit of crystals was that they could demodulate amplitude modulated signals. This device brought radiotelephones and voice broadcast to a public audience. Crystal sets represented an inexpensive and technologically simple method of receiving these signals {{at a time when the}} embryonic radio broadcasting industry was beginning to grow.|$|E
2500|$|The Hertzian dipole or Elementary doublet {{refers to}} a {{theoretical}} construction, rather than a physical antenna design. It may {{be defined as a}} finite oscillating current (in a specified direction) of [...] over a tiny or infinitesimal length δℓ at a specified position. The solution of the fields from a Hertzian dipole can be used as the basis for analytical or numerical calculation of the radiation from more complex antenna geometries (such as practical dipoles) by forming the superposition of fields from a large number of Hertzian dipoles comprising the current pattern of the actual antenna. As a function of position, taking the elementary current elements multiplied by infinitesimal lengths [...] I(r)dℓ, the resulting field pattern then reduces to an integral over the path of an antenna conductor (modelled as a <b>thin</b> <b>wire).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hoop {{earrings}} are circular or semi-circular in design, {{and look}} {{very similar to}} a ring. Hoop earrings generally {{come in the form}} of a hoop of metal that can be opened to pass through the ear piercing. They are often constructed of metal tubing, with a <b>thin</b> <b>wire</b> attachment penetrating the ear. [...] The hollow tubing is permanently attached to the wire at the front of the ear, and slips into the tube at the back. [...] The entire device is held together by tension between the wire and the tube. [...] Other hoop designs do not complete the circle, but penetrate through the ear in a post, using the same attachment techniques that apply to stud earrings. [...] A variation is the continuous hoop earring. [...] In this design, the earring is constructed of a continuous piece of solid metal, which penetrates through the ear and can be rotated almost 360°. [...] One of the ends is permanently attached to a small piece of metallic tubing or a hollow metallic bead. [...] The other end is inserted into the tubing or bead, and is held in place by tension. [...] One special type of hoop earring is the sleeper earring, a circular wire normally made of gold, with a diameter of approximately one centimeter. Hinged sleepers, which were common in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, comprise two semi-circular gold wires connected via a tiny hinge at one end, and fastened via a small clasp at the other, to form a continuous hoop whose fastening mechanism is effectively invisible to the naked eye. Because their small size makes them unobtrusive and comfortable, and because they are normally otherwise unadorned, sleepers are so-called because they were intended to be worn at night to keep a pierced ear from closing, and were often the choice for the first set of earrings immediately following the ear piercing in the decades before ear-piercing guns using studs became commonplace, but are often a fashion choice in themselves because of their attractive simplicity and because they subtly call attention to the fact that the ear is pierced.|$|E

40|$|Use of the {{discontinuous}} Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) {{method for}} analyzing electromagnetic field interactions on microwave structures loaded with <b>thin</b> <b>wires</b> {{has been very}} limited despite its well-known advantages. Direct application of the three dimensional (3 D) DGTD method to such structures calls for very fine volumetric discretizations in {{the proximity of the}} <b>thin</b> <b>wires.</b> In this work, to avoid this possible source of computational inefficiency, electromagnetic field interactions on <b>thin</b> <b>wires</b> {{and the rest of the}} structures are modeled separately using the modified telegrapher and Maxwell equations, respectively. Then, 1 D and 3 D DGTD methods are used to discretize them. The coupling between the two resulting matrix systems is realized by introducing equivalent source terms in each equation set. A weighted electric field obtained from the 3 D discretization around the wire is introduced as a voltage source in the telegrapher equations. A volume current density obtained from the 1 D discretization on the wire is introduced as a current source in the Ampere law equation. © 2015 IEEE...|$|R

60|$|The notable {{parts of}} the suite were the swordbearers and the band. The former carried five afõa, {{peculiar}} weapons, emblems of royalty. The blades are licked when swearing; they are despatched with messengers as a hint to enforce obedience; and they are held, after a fashion, to be holy. I have never seen more conventional, distorted, and useless weapons. Three blades showed the usual chopping-bill shape, pierced, like fish-slicers, with round, semicircular, and angular holes. One, measuring twenty-three inches and three-quarters, was leaf-formed, dotted with a lozenge-pattern and set with copper studs. Another was partially saw-toothed. All were of iron, rusty with the rust of years and hardly sharp enough to cut a pat of butter. The impossible handles were worthy of the blades, bulging grips between two huge balls utterly unfitted for handling; four were covered with thin gold-plate in repoussé work, and one with silver. The metal was sewn together with <b>thin</b> <b>wire,</b> and the joints had been hammered to hide them. Cameron sketched them for my coming 'Book of the Sword;' and Ahin Blay kept his promise by sending me a specimen of the weapon with two divergent blades used to cut off noses and ears.
