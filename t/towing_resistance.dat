40|$|Long {{distance}} ocean towing is {{a commonly}} used transportation method {{in the oil}} & gas and renewable energy industries. Barges with cargo, vessels and various offshore structures are towed from and to location. Boskalis participates in this industry through its subsidiaries Smit and Fairmount Marine. From experience with these transports, {{it was found that}} the preliminary calculations do not match with the experiences offshore and that the impact of wave drift on these calculations is most promising for further research. To investigate this impact, the problem is split into three parts: wave drift estimation for a stationary vessel, wave drift estimation for a sailing vessel and the analysis of the towing stability. From the literature, eleven methods are identified for the wave drift estimation of a stationary vessel. These are compared for the surge, sway and yaw force components. The different methods are computed using the diffraction program Delfrac, the strip theory solver ShipMo and own implementations in Matlab. With vessel velocities included, ten wave drift estimation methods for the sailing vessel are compared. Specific attention is paid to the wave drift damping, which relates the stationary wave drift to vessel velocities. It is implemented using Aranha's formulations and the panel pressure output of Delfrac. The most applicable methods with respect to the sailing <b>tow</b> <b>resistance</b> are the far field and near field methods in combination with the wave drift damping. With respect to the total <b>tow</b> <b>resistance,</b> the wave drift contribution is found to make up roughly 25 % of the total resistance, irrespective of forward velocity. The dynamic behaviour of the tow operation is examined for two barges: one course stable and one course unstable barge. Their towing stability properties are assessed without waves present and for head waves conditions. It is found that the head waves do not affect the stability of the course stable barge assuming the towing tug has sufficient available towing force. For the course unstable barge, the main stabilising effect is identified as the extra resistance due to the head waves and not the direct wave drift moment. The relative contribution of the waves with respect to the wind and current shows that the head waves have a significant stabilising contribution to the towing stability although the specific relative contributions are highly dependent on the environmental conditions. Head waves either reduce the path width of the fishtailing motion or dampen these oscillations into a stable towing position. This was verified by simulations in the time domain. Irregular waves also promote the stability: they stabilise the unstable barge in the entire range of physically relevant wave periods, irrespective of towline length. Overall, the contribution of the wave drift to the <b>tow</b> <b>resistance</b> is significant, especially while sailing. Head waves are beneficial for the towing stability of a course unstable barge, both in regular and irregular sea states. This increased insight reduces the uncertainty in the <b>tow</b> <b>resistance</b> prediction and contributes to the understanding of the towing stability properties of unstable barges...|$|R

Increases in computational power available to designers, in addition to more efficient codes, have made CFD a valuable tool for early stage ship design and trade studies. In this work an existing physical model (DTMB # 5415, similar to the US Navy DDG- 51 combatant) was replicated in STAR-CCM+, initially without appendages, then {{with the addition of}} the appendages. <b>Towed</b> <b>resistance</b> was calculated at various speeds. The bare hull model was unconstrained in heave and pitch, thus allowing the simulation to achieve steady dynamic attitude for each speed run. The effect of dynamic attitude on the resistance is considered to be significant and requires accurate prediction. The results were validated by comparison to available data from tow tank tests of the physical model. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the CFD package and the potential for increasing the use of CFD as an effective tool in design space exploration. This will significantly reduce the time and cost of studies that previously depended solely on physical model testing during preliminary ship design efforts. by Petros Voxakis. Thesis (Nav. E. and S.

40|$|A 16 -person {{full-scale}} {{life raft}} was towed in a tow tank in calm water, regular and irregular waves. The objectives were {{to assess the}} raft motion response, occupant motion, tow force, effect of tow speed, effects of different test variables (drogue deployment, floor inflation, weight distribution and ballast), {{and the likelihood of}} occupant motion sickness. Comparisons of RAOs obtained in regular and irregular waves demonstrated that irregular waves {{could be used as a}} cost effective means to determine raft response with a high degree of confidence. They also show that the life raft tow performance is different in waves than in calm water. For example, mean tow force is 20 % higher in the sea state tested than in calm water. Floor inflation, drogue deployment, even weight distribution and tow speed increase mean tow force and tow force variation about its mean. The data also show that the same ballast types should be used to access the effects of different variables because manikin and water bag ballast produce different results. Measured occupant heave acceleration was about the same as the raft heave acceleration. From occupant heave acceleration, it was estimated that after 20 hours in the raft, 20 % of occupants would vomit. Formulae were proposed to predict tow force in different sea states.

In this work, the effect of two different wing forms, rectangular and tapered, on the hydrodynamic characteristics and dynamic stability of the glider were investigated, to determine the optimal wing form. To determine the hydrodynamic characteristics, <b>tow</b> tank <b>resistance</b> tests were carried out using a model fitted alternately with a rectangular wing and tapered wing.

40|$|Current IMO {{regulations}} require {{life rafts}} to be tow tested only in calm water. In real evacuation situations, life rafts are {{deployed in the}} prevailing environmental conditions, with wind and waves. Added wave resistance is small at low wave heights but increases nonlinearly with increased wave height. If life rafts are to be towed in moderate seas (up to 4 m significant wave height), tow force estimates based only on calm water <b>tow</b> <b>resistance</b> become less reliable. Tow patches, towline, towing craft etc. {{also need to be}} designed to withstand dynamic wave loading in addition to mean load. Therefore, mean tow force, tow force variation and maximum tow force are important. A full-scale 16 -person, commercially available, SOLAS approved life raft was towed in the tank, in upwind, head seas with significant wave height of 0. 5 m. The measured tow force showed that it could be treated as a linear system with wave amplitude, by demonstrating that tow force is mainly inertial and follows a Rayleigh distribution. Therefore, extreme-value statistics used for waves can be applied to developing equations for predicting tow force. A method is proposed to predict life raft tow force at different tow speeds and in various sea states, with waves and wind. The method involved using tank experiments to obtain tow force response for one sea state. The information can then be used to predict life raft tow force in wind and waves for different sea states. Three equations are proposed to demonstrate that a simple tank experiment could provide valuable information necessary to empirically estimate the mean tow force, tow force variation and maximum tow force for a specific life raft in different sea states. The equations are developed for upwind, head seas. These equations were extensively validated using tow force measured in the tank. They were partially validated with limited sea trial data, by towing the same 16 -person life raft and a 42 -person life raft in upwind, head seas with significant wave height of 1. 3 m. The equations were able to predict maximum tow forces to within 15 % of the measured. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|The {{deformation}} resistance and mechanisms of biaxial and triaxial non-crimp fabrics under bias extension loading is experimentally investigated. The bias {{deformation resistance}} of multiaxial non-crimp fabrics {{is found to}} be substantially lower than conventional single layer woven fabric due to the unique deformation mechanisms of rotation, sliding and compaction of the fibre tows. It is shown that the amount, line-tension and location of the warp-knitted stitches used to bind non-crimp fabrics have a major influence on the bias deformation resistance. It is found that lowering the amount and line-tension of the stitches facilities the tow sliding mechanism that reduces the deformation resistance of non-crimp fabrics. Fabric deformation is also affected by the location of the stitches, with stitches that pass between, rather than through, the <b>tows</b> reducing the <b>resistance</b> to bias deformation, again due to increasing ease of the tow sliding process.

As to the items of the fishing gears used in this research, in table 3, are shown the tonnage of the fishing boat, its number and the scale of the net used in this experiment. Namely, the number of the monther ship is 3; the number of the fishing boats belonging to those mother ships, is as in the following : â€• the number of the side trawlers with tonnage of 370, is 2; that of the stern trawlers with the tonnage of 299, is 3; the total of which being 5; that of the bull trawler with the tonnage of 121 and with the tonnage of 98, is 4 and 2; the total number of with being 6; the total number of the Danish seiner is, 11; with the tonnage range from 65 to 92. In case of those trawling nets, in accordance with varieties in the sort of the net, a considerable difference is to be noted both in the weight of the ground rope and in the buoyancy of the float, but the whole lengths of the nets are almost equal. As may be seen in the introduction of this thesis, the purpose of this research is as in the following : â€• through the three sorts of the fishing net used as the materials of this experimental research, namely, the trawl net, the bull trawl net, and the Danish seine, the following 3 items were aimed : (1) the attempted clarifications of the fishing efficiency of the fishing net by means of actual measurements and the model experiments; (2) the confirmation of the fundamental characteristics in the designing and making-up the respective net; (3) accompanied with the analyses of the physical and biological factors in drawing the design of the trawling net in possession of high effectivity. The experimental methods used in this research are as in the following : 1. With the use of Radar equipped on board of the mother ship lying at anchor, some tracings were made of the towing speed and the removing distance concerning the nets towed by trawlers, bull trawlers and Danish seiners and as the result of the tracings the sweeping area of the actual net towing was counted, and after combining this counted value with the value of the filtering volume, which will by mentioned in item 3, some numerical value, which is assumed to be indispensable for the determination of the fishing efficiency of the fishing net, was obtained. 2. Concerning Danish seine, in the three stages of the commencement of net to wing, its finishing and the end of net-lifting, the gradual changes in the status of boat and net happening in the lapse of time, were ascertained with the use of experimental models in 50 m. -pool, with the counting clarification of the towing speed, interval between the wing ends, and the sweeping area of the towing rope. 3. On the three sorts of trawling net (trawl net, bull trawl net, Danish seine), model experiments were carried out; and in those experiments, first the area of the net mouth under towing was counted, and {{with the use of the}} counted value, the filtering volume was fixed out, and after combining this with the sweeping area mentioned in item 1, some numerical value was fixed, and by which the fishing efficiency of the various kinds of fishing net was compared. 4. For the purpose of using as the fundamental criterion in drawing the basic designs of the respective trawling net, the following experiments were carried out : â€• a) Three sorts of trawling net having the bag nets made to be equal typed, in spite of their being made of 2 sheets, 4 sheets and 6 sheets of net, each of which being typical of the trawling net, were designed, and with the use of these, some model experiments were carried out, and the respective characteristics and efficiency were brought under comparative examinations. b) Concerning the shape of the net under <b>towing,</b> its <b>resistance</b> against the flowing water and the behaviours of the fish schools entering into the net; the causes of such phenomena were put under considerate examinations, and the distribution of the current velocities in and out of the net were measured by using model nets. c) The border line of the limited possibilities of making the turning movements or the respective fish body within the bag net, in other words, the dimension of the swimming capabilities was fixed experimentally. d) The problem of what behaviour is to be taken by the fish schools against the variations of the flowing velocity within the bag net, was put under consideration to bring it to a reasonable solution, in connection with the size of the fish body and in that with the size and the scale of the fish schools, respectively; and at the same, the net formation and the net resistance at that time, were put under investigations. e) In the 50 m. -pool, using gold fish, the behaviours of the fish schools to the rope were brought under grasping, with the investigations of the driving-in effects of the net performed...|$|R

During the 2003 â€“ 04 season (year two), the tractor-trains experienced poor mobility over undisturbed snow on the Ross Ice Shelf. despite relatively low sled ski pressures and encouraging results of pre-departure tests conducted on the McMurdo Ice Shelf. To understand why, we conducted expedient mobility tests, snow-strength measurements, and snow-pit studies along 250 -km of route as the traverse returned to McMurdo. The key phenomenon causing train immobility appears to be tractionâ€“slipâ€“resistance feedback resulting from the sled skis riding in the ruts made by the towing tractors.
