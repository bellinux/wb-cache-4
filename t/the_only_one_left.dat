Her father is normally busy with work but {{he is able to}} spend time with his family for the special occasion. Earlier, he had went to the store to purchase a new toy for his daughter. Yumetaro had been wandering the toy store and became confused when the father came in. He hid with stuffed toys that looked like him, but was picked up by the girl's father. When the girl opens the Yumetaro gift, she is delighted. Yumetaro becomes the girl's favorite, and so her other toys no longer feel loved. One night, the toys come alive and take the girl to another dimension. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> is Yumetaro, who follows the toys in search of the girl.|$|E
5|$|Nine years earlier, Tchaikovsky had penned a {{ruthless}} dissection of The Five for Nadezhda von Meck. At that time, his feelings of personal isolation and professional insecurity {{had been at}} their strongest. In the nine intervening years, Mussorgsky and Borodin had both died, Balakirev had banished himself to the musical sidelines, and Cui's critical missives had lost much of their sting for Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> who was fully active as a composer, and much had changed {{in the intervening years}} between him and Tchaikovsky as a result of Rimsky-Korsakov's change in musical values. Tchaikovsky had also changed. More secure as a composer and less isolated personally than {{he had been in the}} past, Tchaikovsky enjoyed the company he now kept with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov, and found much to enjoy in their music.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when she was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left,</b> she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E

Full USAF ownership of this Stargate was eventually obtained from the Russians {{in exchange for the}} Korolev.|$|E
25|$|The headhouse was {{designed}} in 1891 by Francis H. Kimball, {{and the train}} shed by Wilson Brothers & Company. Construction began that same year, and the station opened on January 29, 1893. At the time, the trainshed {{was one of the}} largest single-span arched-roof structures in the world. The following year, the Wilson Brothers would build an even larger trainshed three blocks away, for the Pennsylvania Railroad's Broad Street Station. The Reading's trainshed is now the world's oldest such structure and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> in the United States.|$|E

60|$|It really {{gave me a}} {{sensation}} as of homesickness, to be thus left behind. Although sixty or seventy men yet remained, they were so scattered among the fleet that {{it seemed as if}} we of the Avenger were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>left</b> to watch <b>the</b> enemy.|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Hook arrives to the mansion to warn Emma, but Gold thwarts his efforts, erases his {{phone calls to}} Emma, and ties him to the fence. Inside the mansion, Elsa finds Emma and tells her that she sees her {{doing the same thing}} that she once did, blaming herself {{for not being able to}} control her powers because her family was harmed, and that she should be blessed to have this gift. Elsa then asks Emma for her hand and she takes it, {{resulting}} in Emma's powers returning to normal. Outside, Gold, upset over what he just saw, becomes furious over his failed attempt to take Emma's power, which pleased Hook. However, Gold says that despite the setback, he will find a way to acquire the power to free him of the Dagger of Kris. But Gold also needs another item: the heart of someone who knew Gold before he became the Dark One. Since Killian is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> alive, Gold takes his heart. By doing so, Gold makes Killian his puppet and vows to use him to find another way to get Emma's powers, before he will kill him. As Hook reunites with Emma and kisses her, Emma wondered what got into him, and after she and Elsa walk away, he grabs the Sorcerer's box and hides it inside the jacket. Regina arrives at the library, where Robin shows her a page that featured the two together at the pub back in the Enchanted Forest, leading to indications that whoever wrote the story wanted them to be together. Back at the Snow Queen's lair, Ingrid, now free of the force field, follows through with her plan to bring her three sisters together by sending out her ribbons to Emma and Elsa. As Emma and Elsa are reunited with David, Mary Margaret, and Henry, she unleashed her magic into the sky, which creates colorful auroras and then fireworks. Unfortunately, Emma and Elsa notice the yellow ribbons on their left wrists too late, and that they can't remove their ribbons, even while the ribbons are siphoning away their power.|$|E

500|$|During the 1960s, Blyth {{entered a}} period of steep decline. [...] Following the Beeching report, the railway into Blyth was closed; and in 1966, {{economic}} depression resulted in {{the closure of the}} shipyards. [...] As the demand for coal fell, due to the increasing use of oil, natural gas and nuclear power as energy sources, the following years saw the closure of many collieries in the area. [...] By the 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> in the town was Bates' Pit, which closed in 1986.

50|$|After the Second World War the {{individuals}} of the breed gradually grew fewer and in 1959 <b>only</b> <b>one</b> place bred Tautersheep.

Scully notes that {{another member of the}} research team, Arthur Grable, had mysteriously died several months earlier, and believes it to be a case of industrial espionage. Mulder examines the handwriting on the team's whiteboard and concludes that it has been written by at least four different people, leading him to suspect that a fourth individual was present. Keats and Nollette both inform the agents that Roland Fuller was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> in the facility at the time of Surnow's death, but do not believe him to be capable of murder.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Cielo {{announced}} {{the creation of}} P.R.O. 16 – the [...] "Going for 2016 Gold" [...] Project. The initiative, designed to serve as Brazilian swimming's [...] "elite squad", gathered Cielo, who would be leading the project, and six other swimmers – André Schultz, Leonardo de Deus, Nicholas Santos, Henrique Rodrigues, Tales Cerdeira and Vinicius Waked – all selected for potential medals in the 2016 Summer Olympics, in Rio de Janeiro. The idea would be to prepare the swimmers also for the main competition in the coming years. For two years, the innovative program, which proposed a system of high level training without relying on the infrastructure of big clubs, worked. But the difficulty of finding sponsors and the change of attitude of the clubs made the training group lose almost all its members. In 2013, Cielo was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> in the project, but highlighted its continuity, with changes in the project, receiving new members and getting new sponsors.|$|E
500|$|Admiral d'Estaing {{rejected}} Macartney's proposed {{terms of}} capitulations, countering {{with a list}} of articles that he had drafted. Macartney found d'Estaing's proposed articles [...] "not merely unprecedented and humiliating, but so ensnaring and uncertain in their nature, extent, and aim that they might at any time supply a pretext for taking away the lives, together with the fortunes, of the capitulants." [...] His council was unanimous in rejecting the proposed capitulation, and the British chose to surrender unconditionally instead. [...] As a consequence, d'Estaing permitted his troops to pillage St. George's. [...] Among the items taken or destroyed were most of Macartney's silver and plate, much of his clothing, and his personal papers. The latter came as a particularly harsh blow to the governor, for copies of those papers sent to St. Lucia with his wife for safeguarding were destroyed by fire. [...] When d'Estaing invited Macartney to dine with him, the governor apologized for his garb, noting that the coat he was wearing was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> him. Macartney and other leading Grenadians were also refused parole, and were sent to France as prisoners of war.|$|E

500|$|Jasmine arrives as a {{grown woman}} and {{immediately}} bewitches everyone to bask in immense joy and do her bidding. Connor is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> in misery because of sharing a blood link with her, which results in his further isolation. As Jasmine enacts her plans for world domination, Angel and his team break free from her spell. Caught between his father and daughter, Connor initially supports Jasmine against Angel, but this conflict, combined {{with the belief that}} neither truly cares about him, eventually makes him completely snap.

Other than Angel, everyone's memories are rewritten to accommodate this new reality.|$|E
500|$|On game night, coach Taylor gives a {{pep talk}} where he warns the players against taking the opponents – Westerby High School – too lightly. They say their {{rallying}} cry, [...] "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose!" [...] and enter the field. The first half is problematic for the Panthers, {{and at the end}} of the second half, the visitors make a potentially game-winning interception. Street is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> to make a tackle. He succeeds, but the tackle is so hard that he remains prone on the ground. The crowd is left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move, and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Coach Taylor now has to put in the highly unprepared Saracen, who initially makes several silly mistakes. The coach tells him to relax and focus, and Saracen manages to connect with Smash, who scores a touchdown. Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers. In the final seconds of the game, Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver, who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown. As the Panthers win the game, both teams gather at mid-field to pray for Jason Street. Team members then head over to the hospital, where Street's condition is still unclear. Riggins and Smash reconcile, while Julie tries to comfort Lyla. In a voice-over, coach Taylor is heard saying that [...] "We are all vulnerable, and we will all at some point in our lives fall." ...|$|E

5000|$|Directly {{translated}}, Volkspele means [...] "folk-games" [...] and can {{be translated}} to folk-dance. Folk-dance was the brain-child of South African Dr. SH Pellisier, who was visiting Sweden in 1915 with a friend to become more proficient in carpentry. After finishing their day's work they met with other young people in their respective countries' national dress to practise their folk-singing and -dancing.
