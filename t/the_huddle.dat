5|$|The main backfield {{positions}} are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB) and fullback (FB). The quarterback {{is the leader}} of the offense. Either he or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in <b>the</b> <b>huddle</b> before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.|$|E
5|$|Warner {{invented the}} single and double wing formations, the three-point stance, {{and the modern}} body block technique. He {{introduced}} several plays, such as the trap run, the bootleg, the naked reverse, and the screen pass. He {{was among the first}} to use <b>the</b> <b>huddle,</b> to number plays, and to teach the spiral pass and spiral punt. He improved shoulder and thigh pads; and was the first to utilize adjustable fiber, rather than cotton. He also had his own helmet color-coding: red for backs and white for ends.|$|E
5|$|However, the discontent {{within the}} locker room and the team's overall struggles culminated with Holmes criticizing and arguing with {{teammates}} in <b>the</b> <b>huddle</b> against Miami. Holmes was benched in the fourth quarter while the Jets subsequently lost 19–17, ending their postseason pursuit. After the Jets finished the season with a disappointing 8–8 record, Ryan admitted to having lost the pulse of the team. Then free agent running back LaDainian Tomlinson remarked that Ryan's Super Bowl predictions had an adverse effect on {{the locker room}} by placing undue pressure on the players. Ryan conceded this point and announced that he would refrain from making such statements publicly in the future.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the outset}} of the 2011 season, head coach Rex Ryan named Sanchez a team captain. The Jets opened the season with a 2–3 record leading to discontent within the clubhouse. The team had begun to stray from their {{philosophy}} of consistently running the ball and began to pass more often; however, the offense struggled with this adjustment. Wide receivers Plaxico Burress, Santonio Holmes, and Derrick Mason approached coach Ryan to question offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's system as Holmes and Mason averaged only three catches per game and Burress only 2.5 catches through four games. Additionally, Sanchez drew criticism for his difficulties to effectively throw the ball to his receivers. The struggles culminated with Holmes getting into a heated argument with another teammate in <b>the</b> <b>huddle</b> during their final regular season game against the Miami Dolphins. Holmes was benched in the fourth quarter while Sanchez threw three interceptions in the Jets' loss that eliminated the team from playoff contention {{for the first time in}} Sanchez's career. Statistically, Sanchez had similar numbers in a comparison to Eli Manning when he concluded his third year of football however, there were concerns that Sanchez was simply an ineffective quarterback and therefore expendable. During the offseason, Sanchez was criticized by anonymous teammates for his poor work ethic and his inability to improve; these claims were publicly refuted by other teammates. Despite questions surrounding his job security, after New York acquired Tim Tebow, the Jets agreed to a 3-year contract extension with Sanchez on March 9, 2012. The contract included $20 million in guarantees.|$|E
25|$|Csonka claims that, as {{he walked}} away from <b>the</b> <b>huddle,</b> he told Pisarcik he would not take the ball if he went through with it. It is not known whether the quarterback heard him or not, however. McVay's headphones, which {{normally}} allowed him to communicate with Pisarcik and Gibson, were not working properly at that point either. McVay has since stated that he would certainly have overruled Gibson had he heard what was coming.|$|E
25|$|With Otto Graham {{and most}} of the other {{original}} Browns in retirement, by 1957, the team was struggling to replenish its ranks. Cleveland was coming off a series of bad drafts, including in 1954, when the team selected quarterback Bobby Garrett with the first pick. Garrett, Graham's presumed successor, did not play a single game for Cleveland, which traded him to Green Bay, brought him back three years later, then released him for good after he could not overcome a stutter that made calling plays in <b>the</b> <b>huddle</b> difficult.|$|E

25|$|Buffalo's miscue {{on their}} final drive was {{particularly}} noteworthy {{in that it}} came after they had called a timeout, making a subsequent delay of game penalty highly unusual. One cited reason for {{this was the last}} second substitution of receivers Piccone and Ron Jessie into <b>the</b> <b>huddle.</b> Bills coach Chuck Knox later explained this was an attempt to prevent the defense from adjusting to new personnel, an attempt that would have paid off if the ball had been snapped on time, as Piccone did make a first down catch on the ensuing play.|$|E
25|$|The Giants wasted {{several seconds}} in <b>the</b> <b>huddle</b> in dismay over the play-calling. At the line, Clack saw the play clock winding {{down and took}} it upon himself to snap it with 31 seconds left in the game to avoid a delay-of-game penalty, which would have stopped the clock and cost the Giants five yards. Had the Giants knelt on the {{subsequent}} play, there still would have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).|$|E
25|$|Late in {{the fourth}} quarter, Stewart {{completed}} seven of eight passes for 68 yards and rushed twice for 11 yards on a 79-yard drive that ended with his 14-yard touchdown pass to Charles Johnson, cutting the score to 24-21 with 2:46 left in regulation. At the two-minute warning, facing third down and 5 on their own 15-yard line on their ensuing drive, Elway connected on an 18-yard completion to Shannon Sharpe for a first down. Then on the next play, he completed a 10-yard pass to McCaffrey for another first down, enabling his team to run {{out the rest of}} the clock. Sharpe later said that Elway made up the converting play in <b>the</b> <b>huddle,</b> seconds before the snap.|$|E

25|$|UCF {{received}} {{the ball with}} 2:04 left in regulation. Bortles made three straight completions {{to move to the}} Temple 30. With 1:06 left, Bortles was under pressure, rolling out to his left. He was hit as he threw, but found J.J. Worton downfield. It appeared Bortles had overthrown his receiver. Worton made a spectacular, one-handed, diving catch, landing just in-bounds to score the game-tying touchdown, a play which made ESPN's SportsCenter Top 10. UCF forced Temple to punt, and {{received the}} ball with 28 seconds left in regulation. Rather than playing for overtime, Rannell Hall urged Bortles in <b>the</b> <b>huddle</b> to go deep against the Temple defense, which appeared unprepared for the play. Bortles connected on a 35-yard pass to Hall, who broke free for a gain of 64 {{all the way to the}} Temple 4 yard line. With 2 seconds left, kicker Shawn Moffitt made a chip-shot field goal, and UCF escaped with an improbable 39–36 victory. It was their fourth comeback win of the season.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Bears quarterback Jim McMahon {{increased}} the Bears lead to 14-0 with a 23-yard {{touchdown pass to}} receiver Dennis McKinnon. Later in the quarter, with Chicago facing second and 12 on their own 34, the Giants made another key error. The Giants defense came out of <b>the</b> <b>huddle</b> planning for a massive blitz, but decided {{to switch to a}} zone defense after reading the Bears formation. However, half the defenders were unable to hear the new play call over the roaring crowd at Soldier Field and ended up blitzing, leaving receiver Tim Wrightman completely uncovered. McMahon threw the ball to Wrightman for a 46-yard gain, and then finished the drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to McKinnon on the next play, making the final score of the game 21-0. The Bears could have had a much larger lead, but the normally reliable rookie kicker Kevin Butler had an uncharacteristically bad day, missing three field goal attempts from distances of 26, 49 and 38 yards.|$|E

500|$|Before {{joining the}} Browns, Humble {{played in the}} College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual matchup between the National Football League (NFL) {{champion}} and a selection of the best college players from around the country. The college all-stars won the game, defeating the Chicago Bears 16–0. In Cleveland, Humble {{was part of an}} offensive line that included Lin Houston, Ed Ulinski and Bob Gaudio. Their job was to protect quarterback Otto Graham from opposing defenders and open up running room for fullback Marion Motley. They chanted [...] "nobody touches Graham" [...] when they broke <b>the</b> <b>huddle.</b>|$|E

[...] His coach couldn't stand it at first and neither could his parents. They'd tie wristbands around his shoes. When that didn't work, they tried athletic tape. They even rolled his socks over his shoes. He was a marvel, and he wasn't even finished with the sixth grade." ...|$|E

40|$|As emperor {{penguins}} have no breeding territories, a {{key issue}} for both members of a pair {{is not to be}} separated until the egg is laid and transferred to the male. Both birds remain silent after mating and thereby reduce the risk of having the pair bond broken by unpaired birds. However, silence prevents finding each other if the pair is separated. Huddles—the key to saving energy in the cold and the long breeding fast—continuously form and break up, but not all birds are involved simultaneously. We studied the behaviour of four pairs before laying. Temperature and light intensity measurements allowed us to precisely detect <b>the</b> occurrence of <b>huddling</b> episodes and to determine the surrounding temperature. <b>The</b> four pairs <b>huddled</b> simultaneously for only 6 per cent of the time when weather conditions were harshest. Despite this asynchrony, <b>the</b> <b>huddling</b> behaviour and <b>the</b> resulting benefits were similar between pairs. By contrast, <b>the</b> <b>huddling</b> behaviour of mates was synchronized for 84 per cent of events. By coordinating their huddling behaviour during courtship despite the apparent confusion within a huddle and its ever-changing structure, both individuals save energy while securing their partnership...|$|R
