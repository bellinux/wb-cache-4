40|$|A {{key element}} in a stream-monitoring {{programme}} for sediment transport is {{the choice of the}} measuring technique for suspended sediment concentration: this can highly affect both project costs and data reliability. The gravimetric method represents the standard analysis to directly measure suspended sediment concentration in a water sample. Indirect techniques are often employed for their inexpensiveness, although they need to be calibrated on gravimetric analysis results. In this study, the reliability of settleable solids in Imhoff cones was addressed as an alternative indirect method to estimate suspended sediment concentration (SSC), verifying the results with the turbidity measures of a laboratory nephelometer. The results show a high correlation of settled solids with suspended sediment concentration. Also, the results from the <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> showed a good correlation with SSC, but limited to water samples that did not need dilution. Measurements were repeated after storing the samples for 1 month: results exhibit an increase in turbidity and settleable solids, probably due to algae growth and anaerobic processes with the production of gases, causing an increase in matter. From our study, the Imhoff cone was shown to be a useful instrument to estimate suspended sediment concentration for the simplicity, the reliability and the low cost of their results. Our results prove how Imhoff cones are preferable to <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> to estimate SSC, specifically for highly turbid samples...|$|E

The palmitoyl derivatization involves the amino groups of the polysaccharide. These are the same groups generally considered responsible for the good mucoadhesive properties of chitosan, due to the ionic interaction with the sialic acidic moieties of the mucin. In the present work, the mucoadhesion properties of GPC micelles were evaluated by comparing the information obtained using different methods described in literature. This is a comparison which is not commonly found in literature.

The effects of mixture composition, pH, and ionic strength on C/PAA complex formation were investigated by gravimetric, <b>turbidimetric,</b> and conductometric <b>analysis.</b> The experimental results indicate that the complexes form through electrostatic interactions. Homogeneous solid films with variable C/PAA ratios were obtained by casting from solutions in which the pH was adjusted just over the isoelectric point of collagen, thus avoiding the attractive ionic interactions responsible for the complexation of collagen and PAA molecules.

The individual blocks are composed of (a) permanently hydrophilic chains with neutral functionality and (b) acrylate polymers with weakly basic side-chains.

Microgels and PS latex particles have been characterised. <b>Turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> and scanning electron microscopy have been employed to determine the state of aggregation of mixtures of {{the two types of}} particles. PS latex particles of varying size (100 – 800  nm) have been studied in mixtures with two cationic microgels.

It has been found that aggregation is induced in the mixtures containing the largest of the PS latex particles by the lowest concentration of microgel. It is also reported that the larger the latex the less is the influence of temperature on the stability of the mixed particulate system. The heteroflocculation/aggregation behaviour is influenced by the relative concentration of the two oppositely charged species. The change from a dispersed to an aggregated system is most likely continuous and the relative concentration at which aggregation begins to occur is somewhere between a 1 : 1 ratio and 10 : 1 excess of the cationic microgel.

40|$|International audiencePhase {{separation}} of thermo-responsive polymers in solution {{is a complex}} process, whose understanding is essential to screen and design materials with diverse technological applications. Here we report on a method based on dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments to investigate the phase {{separation of}} thermo-responsive polymer solutions and precisely define the transition temperature (T$_{PS}$). Our results are applied on hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) solutions as an important biosourced green water-soluble polymer. As determined by DLS, the amplitudes of the fast and slow modes of relaxation dynamics evolve as temperature gets closer to the phase transition point eventually leading to phase separation. The evolution of relaxation modes with temperature is markedly different for concentrations below the overlap concentration (c*) (dilute regime), above c* (semi-dilute regime) and above the entanglement concentration (c$_e$). In the three cases though, the fast and slow mode amplitudes undergo a sharp transition in a narrow temperature range, defining accurately the phase separation locus. The results agree with <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> for the phase transition determination but with a better precision. Our results also show that the one-phase dynamics and phase separation dynamics in the two-phase region are only in continuity for c 4 c e, revealing mechanistic details about the HPC phase separation process.

FG yield, carbohydrate composition, protein content, and zeta potential (ζ) varied among these cultivars. FG solution properties were also affected by temperature, solution pH, NaCl concentration, and sucrose concentration. Detailed studies were conducted on CDC Bethune FG (FGB) proteins that were separated by 2 D-gel electrophoresis. Conlinin was identified as the major protein. Protease treatment decreased FGB solution emulsification properties suggesting that conlinin might enhance emulsification. Formation of BSA-FGB coacervates was monitored by <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> {{as a function of}} solution pH, biopolymer mixing ratio, NaCl and urea. Coacervates were stabilized primarily by attractive electrostatic forces and secondarily by hydrogen bonds.

In this study, we investigated the protective effect of fucoidan, a natural sulfated polysaccharide obtained from the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus, against the cytotoxic and myotoxic activities of a group of phospholipase A 2 myotoxins from crotaline snake venoms: Bothrops asper myotoxins I, II, III, and IV, Cerrophidion godmani myotoxins I and II, Atropoides nummifer myotoxins I and II, and Bothriechis schlegelii myotoxin I. All of the toxins tested were efficiently inhibited by fucoidan, in both their cytotoxic and myotoxic effects. The basis for this inhibition appears to be the rapid formation of complexes between fucoidan and myotoxins, as evidenced by <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis.</b> The possible binding site of fucoidan on the myotoxins was investigated using short synthetic peptides that represent the membrane-damaging region (residues 115 – 129) for three of these toxins. Fucoidan clearly inhibited the cytolytic activity of the peptides, indicating its ability to interact with the C-terminal myotoxic region of these phospholipases A 2. Fucoidan significantly inhibited muscle damage in mice, when administered locally, immediately after experimental envenomation with crude venom from B. asper.

Since, CRP is known to play a role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the serum levels of CRP in periodontitis patients with or without atherosclerosis. Materials and Methods : A total of 45 patients, 15 chronic periodontitis patients with atherosclerosis (Group A), 15 chronic periodontitis patients with no history of any systemic disease (Group B), and 15 clinically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal or systemic disease (Group C) within age range of 30 to 55 years were selected for the study.

In this study we demonstrate that recombinant soluble Fc gamma RII (rsFc gamma RII) is an effective modulator of immune complex formation, delaying immune precipitation in a manner which is dose-dependent, and can be specifically inhibited by anti-Fc gamma RII MoAb Fab' fragments. This inhibitory role in immune precipitation also provides a possible mechanistic explanation for our previous demonstration of the efficacy of rsFc gamma RII as an inhibitor of immune complex-induced inflammation in the Arthus reaction in vivo. RsFc gamma RII inhibited immune complex precipitation in two different experimental systems. First, rsFc gamma RII inhibited the precipitation of 125 I-bovine serum albumin (BSA) -anti-BSA complexes in a dose-dependent manner, while an irrelevant protein (soybean trypsin inhibitor) had no effect on the precipitation of the immune complexes. Moreover, rsFc gamma RII inhibited the precipitation of ovalbumin (OVA) -anti-OVA complexes as determined by <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis,</b> where the inhibition of immune complex precipitation by rsFc gamma RII was dose-dependent and was specifically blocked by prior incubation with Fab' fragments of a blocking MoAb to Fc gamma RII. RsFc gamma RII could inhibit the precipitation of BSA-anti-BSA complexes in the presence of excess bystander IgG and did not inhibit complement-mediated prevention of immune precipitation, demonstrating that rsFc gamma RII did not block C 1 binding to the BSA-anti-BSA complex. Unlike complement, rsFc gamma RII could not cause re-solubilization of pre-formed precipitated BSA-anti-BSA complexes.

The conformational transition temperature (T-m) of the mixed microgel-SDS dispersion, as measured by <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis,</b> was found to increase as a function of SDS concentration. These data were consistent with those obtained by high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC). The same technique revealed that the specific heat (Delta H-cal) of the mixed dispersion decreased as the concentration of SDS increased. However the Delta T- 1 / 2 (the width of the transition in degrees C at 1 / 2 C(p,max)) and the Delta C-p,C-d (the difference in pre- and post-transition heat capacity) both increase with SDS concentration. Viscometric data shows an increase in the reduced viscosity under isothermal conditions at 25 degrees C, while the viscosity-temperature profile of each mixed microgel-SDS dispersion revealed that the conformational transition behaviour mirrored that obtained from the turbidity and HSDSC measurements. Isothermal viscosity data, at 25 degrees C, suggests that the structure of the microgel becomes more extended with increasing SDS concentration. This interpretation is confirmed by dynamic light scattering measurements, which clearly show that the hydrodynamic diameter of the microgel particles increases with SDS concentration, over the range 0 - 12 mM, by approx. 17 %. Sorption isotherm data shows that, below a SDS concentration of 4 mM, sorption is low then increases steadily until a concentration of 12 mM. The results of conductivity measurements, carried out in the presence and absence of SDS (below and above the T-m of the microgel dispersion). are also reported and show that the contraction of the microgel particle results in an expulsion of some surfactant from within the microgel structure...|$|E
40|$|Effects of commercially {{available}} bacterial products were investigated on two common recreational pool contaminants: sunscreen and cyanuric acid (CYA). Microbial products developed by BiOWiSH Technologies, Inc. were tested for enhancing mechanical filtration and water clarification in bench-scale bioreactors, with conditions mimicking those of recreational pool water. Bacterial consortia included proprietary mixes of Bacillus, Lactobacillus and Pseudomonas, and other genera of bacteria. BiOWiSH products are either fermented on a solid substrate consisting of rice bran and soy meal, {{or they are}} mixed with a soluble diluent. Twenty-nine BiOWiSH products were tested throughout forty experiments. Experiments were carried out to determine both the efficacy of BiOWiSH products for turbidity reduction and the mechanism by which BiOWiSH removes sunscreen from solution. In trials without mechanical filtration, the only product which showed a reduction in turbidity relative to the control, albeit inconsistently, was the solid substrate version of BiOWiSH Aqua FOGTM (Thai FOG). Experiments on BiOWiSH coupled with mechanical filtration showed a 79 % average reduction of turbidity in the first 24 hrs. BiOWiSH products containing solid substrate, both active and abiotic, showed an average turbidity reduction of 90 % in the first 24 hrs. In the same timeframe, soluble BiOWiSH products showed a 79 % average reduction in turbidity. Thus, the solid v substrate provided an additional 11 % reduction in turbidity over soluble products and un-amended mechanical filtration. Through experimentation and scanning electron microscopy, {{it was concluded that}} the primary mechanism of clarification by the solid substrate is adsorption of sunscreen to the substrate surface. Further experiments were performed in anaerobic and aerobic environments to determine whether BiOWiSH products can remove cyanuric acid from solution through adsorption or biodegradation. Two measurement methods, turbidimetric and HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) were used to independently quantify CYA. A reverse-phase HPLC method was developed which utilizes a phosphate buffer and methanol for the separation of cyanuric acid from nitrate and other chemical species. The solid BiOWiSH Aqua FOG product (prod. in Thailand) interfered with the <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis,</b> showing false decreases in CYA. Using HPLC, there was no measureable biodegradation or adsorption of CYA by BiOWiSH products in these bench-scale tests.

The experiments conducted in this project were, firstly, to investigate the uptake and release of model compounds with different physico-chemical properties (i. e. solubility and logKoct/w) to and from two colloidal gel systems. Secondly, the permeation of model compounds across a model skin membrane (silicone membrane), and human epidermis was investigated. The first part of the project was to co-synthesise temperature-sensitive colloidal microgels particles based on a co-polymer of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (90 %) -co-butyl acrylate (10 %) (NIPAM/BA) (90 / 10) (w/w) %, in the presence of {{and in the absence of}} ibuprofen (IBU), methyl paraben (MP), and propyl paraben (PP), by a surfactant-free emulsion polymerisation (SFEP) in water. Physico-chemical properties of the microgels were determined using different techniques including photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR spectroscopy), and <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> (UV-vis). The uptake and release of the model compounds to and from colloidal microgel particles was controlled by the solubility and logKoct/w of the drugs. Their subsequent permeation across a model silicone membrane and human skin, were investigated over a range of temperatures (292 K – 313 K). The transport rate of IBU and, PP from poly(NIPAM) microgel is significantly reduced by two and one order of magnitude, respectively, compared with the transport rate of saturated solutions. A huge reduction in the flux indicates that the microgel retards permeation of the drug across both membranes, and hence the microgel can be considered as a permeation retarder. However, fluxes of MP from poly(NIPAM) microgel are equivalents to fluxes of saturated solutions of MP. There is a clear correlation between the solubility and logKoct/w value of the drugs and the flux value for the microgels, incorporating the drugs, across both types of membranes. In the second part of the work, a co-polymer of poly(NIPAM) (85 %) co-butyl acrylate (10 %) co-methacrylic acid (5 %) (NIPAM/BA/MAA) (85 / 10 / 5) microgel was synthesised and investigated as a potential pH and temperature sensitive transdermal delivery device.

A series of multivalent alpha-sialosides were scaffolded onto gallic acid-based dendrimers; and calix[4]arenes. Carbohydrate residues involved in the syntheses of glycoconjugates were all prepared stereoselectively in high yields from phase transfer catalysis (PTC) reaction. These carbohydrate ligands were coupled to the dendritic and calixarene cores through nucleophilic displacement of chlorides by thioglycosides. The conjugation strategy employed herein lead to the study of different chemoselective deprotection of thioacetate glycosides. The methods studied involved, (i) hydrazinium acetate in DMF (one- & two-pot reactions) and (ii) sodium methoxide in MeOH at low temperature (Zemplen conditions). Solid phase synthesis on Wang resin was used to construct the first dendritic athiosialosides. The design of these hyperbranched clusters was based on L-lysine core structures using established Fmoc protecting group and benzotriazolyl activated ester coupling procedures. Chain extension of the lysyl amino groups with chloroacetylglycylglycine active ester allowed introduction of the required functionality necessary for the coupling to an alpha-thiosialoside derivative. The synthesis of hyperbranched glycodendrimers containing sialic acid residues having 3 n in valency, is also described. Gallic acid as trivalent core and oligoethylene glycol derivatives as hydrophilic spacers were used to scaffold the dendritic backbones. alpha-Thiosialoside derivative was conjugated onto N-chloroacetylated dendritic precursors by nucleophilic substitution to afford tri- and nona-valent sialodendrimers. The synthesis of glycocalix[4]arenes was then effected since these glycoconjugates have an extra advantage over chemically well-defined glycodendrimers. They possess the ability to form drug inclusion complexes. p-Tert-butylcalix[4]arene was transformed into its tetraethyl ester. This opened the way to the formation of the acid chloride which was treated with excess mono-Boc- 1, 4 -butanediamine or mono-Boc- 1, 6 -hexanedianiine used as spacer arms. alpha-Thiosialoside derivative was covalently attached to the calix[4]arenes by nucleophilic substitution on the cone-shaped tetra-N-chloroacetylated calix[4]arenes. The glyco-calix[4]arenes were liberated from their protecting groups to afford biologically active clusters where sialic acid is the ligand. A different tetravalent sialocalixarene was synthesized following a convergent approach. Tetraacyl chloride calix[4]arene derivative was reacted by peptide coupling with an aminosialoside having a long spacer arm. Finally, octavalent dendritic sialocalix[4]arene was then synthesized from a tetraamino, calix[4]arene and N-bromoacetylated sialoside derivatives. Both reagents have built-in spacer arms which allowed for an efficient double N-alkylation reaction. Binding studies via <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> confirmed the ability of the glycodendrimers and glycocalix[4]arenes to cross-link and precipitate appropriate lectins (WGA and LFA) ...|$|E
40|$|The Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF or T) antigen {{has been}} known as a {{carbohydrate}} disaccharide, Gal-β-D-(1 - 3) -α-D-GalNAc α-linked to serine or threonine in glycoprotein and other mucins. It is widely distributed on common cancers of epithelial cells including breast cancers. Due to difficulties in isolating them from natural sources, various synthetic methods were developed to achieve the synthesis of multivalent carbohydrate haptens in different forms varying in carbohydrate densities, conformations, and interglycosidic distances. The synthesis of the T-antigen and its derivatives and modification of its aglycons having and give different terminal functional groups is described herein. Several glycosyl acceptors were synthesized and subsequent glycosylations were performed with glycosyl donors using TfOMe, TfOAg/ 2, 4, 6 -collidine, NIS/TfOH, or Hg(CN 2) as promoters to give β-(1 - 3) linked disaccharides. The aglycon was modified to give sulfide bridged spacer arms containing end groups such as alcohol, amine, carboxylic acid, and thiol. Hydroformylation of allyl glycoside using rhodium catalyst afforded linear and branched aldehydes. The synthesis of convergent dendrimers with valencies of between two and six T-antigen residues is described. The synthesis of dendritic cores was based on peptide coupling between N,N'-bis(acrylamido) acetic acid as a seed molecule and hexamethylene diamine or tris(2 -aminoethyl) amine using HOBt/EDC strategy to give tetra- and hexa-valent structures. Conjugate addition of thiolated T-antigen to acrylamido functionality on the seed molecule gave divalent T-antigen in quantitative yield. Tetra- and hexa-valent glycodendrimers bearing T-antigen were prepared by two different methods. First, thiolated T-antigen {{was added to the}} acrylamido functions of the dendritic cores. In addition, divalent T-antigen-bearing terminal carboxylic acid was coupled to polyamines using carbodiimide chemistry. N-substituted glycosyl acrylamides were used as monomers to prepare neoglycoproteins and multivalent synthetic polyacrylamide based glycopolymers. Neoglycoproteins were synthesized by coupling N-acryloylated T-antigen residues onto proteins by conjugate addition. This methodology is simple, efficient and requires no additional reagents. Copolyacrylamide were prepared by two strategies. N-acryloylated carbohydrate and acrylamide were copolymerized using ammonium persulfate in aqueous conditions. Alternatively, preactivated poly(N-acryloxysuccinimide) and its analogues containing active esters were prepared. Graff conjugation of monomeric units bearing amino functional group such as carbohydrate hapten, NH 4 OH, and alkyl amines was performed. Binding assays were performed using double radial immunodiffusion and <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> to confirm the ability of the glycoconjugates to bind to protein such as Arachis Hypogaea from peanut lectin. In addition, competitive enzyme linked immunoassays were performed with monoclonal mouse IgG and peroxidase labeled goat anti-mouse IgG conjugates and all glycoconjugates showed enhanced inhibitory potentials.

40|$|The syntheses and {{in vitro}} {{biological}} evaluation of three series of glycodendrimers is presented herein. This dissertation marks three "firsts" {{in the field}} of glycobiology. Chemically well defined hypervalent neoglycoconjugates, termed glycodendrimers, have been designed and prepared. These concepts were extended to include the enzymatic elongation of a glycoside on a dendritic core. Furthermore, the first direct correlation of the number of carbohydrate residues and the multivalent effect has been reported. To further the understanding of multivalency and its role in carbohydrate-protein interactions, glycoconjugates with differing carbohydrate densities, conformations, and interglycosidic spacings must be prepared. The design and synthesis of glycodendrimers addresses these issues. Solid phase synthesis on Wang resin was used to construct dendritic α-thiosialosides. The design of these new, hyperbranched clusters was based on the rational scaffolding of L-lysine core structures using established 9 -fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protecting group and activated benzotriazolyl ester (HOBt) coupling procedures. Chain extension of the lysyl amino groups with chloroacetylglycylglycine active ester allowed introduction of the required functionality necessary for the coupling to an α-thiosialoside derivative prepared under phase transfer catalysed conditions. Well defined di-, tetra-, octa-, and hexadeca-valent dendritic α-thiosialosides were thus prepared. The synthesis of structurally similar divergent and spherical dendrimers, with even valencies of between two and sixteen and ending with equidistant α-thiosialoside residues is also described. The synthesis of the dendritic core was based on the regioselective protection of the primary amines of 3, 3 '-iminobis(propylamine) using benzylcyanoformate. The resulting secondary amine was monoalkylated with tert-butyl bromoacetate to provide a divalent core structure orthogonally protected with carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) protected amines and a tert-butyl ester. Selective deprotection via hydrogenation or trifluoroacetolysis afforded amine and acid key precursors, respectively. These were conjugated using standard HOBt/DIC strategy to give divergent, Cbz-protected dendrimers with valencies between two and sixteen in the first through fourth generations. Tethering of the dimer and tetramer to both hexamethylenediamine and tris-(2 -aminoethyl) amine provided spherical, hyperbranched dendritic structures with valencies between four and twelve. All Cbz-protected dendrimers were transformed into N-chloroacetylated dendrimers which were coupled to a thiolated sialic acid derivative. Thiourelene p-phenyl α-thiosialoside containing dendrimers scaffolded on Starburst PAMAM dendrimers were prepared using an isothiocyanate conjugation strategy. PAMAM cores, generation G 0 to G 3, were coupled to a sialic acid isothiocyanate derivative to give spherical, hypervalent thiourea derivatives containing four to thirty-two surface sialic acid residues. The above concepts were easily extended to include the preparation of dendrimers with covalently attached N-acetylglucosamine, lactose, N-acetyllactosamine, mannose, Galβ-(1, 3) -GalNAcα (T-antigen), and 3 '-sulfo-Lewis X-(Glc) residues. Furthermore, glycodendrimers were shown to be amenable to both chemical and enzymatic transformations via the 9 -O-acetylation of octavalent α-thiosialodendrimers and the enzymatic galactosylation of dendritic N-acetylglucosamine. The preparation of a custom designed heterobifunctional dendrimer containing biotin and four sialic acid residues is also presented. The synthesis was based on the tethering of a tetravalent, Cbz-protected, 3, 3 '-iminobis(propylamine) -based core to an amine functionalized biotin derivative using established HOBt/DIC coupling chemistry. Cbz deprotection via hydrogenation afforded the biotin-containing tetraamine which was conjugated to a sialic acid p-isothiocyanatophenyl derivative to provide the desired bi-directional glycodendrimer. Binding studies via double immunodiffusion and/or <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> confirmed the ability of the glycodendrimers to cross-link and precipitate appropriate model lectins. In addition, when used in competitive enzyme linked lectin assays, all glycodendrimers showed improved inhibitory potentials...|$|E
40|$|Probiotics and {{prebiotic}} {{are becoming}} increasingly important to consumers to alleviate issues surrounding gut health, {{despite the lack of}} definitive efficacy studies to support health claims. The addition of both probiotics and prebiotics to foods is challenging due to the harsh environmental conditions within the food itself and during transit through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To circumvent these challenges encapsulation technology is being explored to protect sensitive ingredients and to control their release within the lower intestines thereby maximizing the health benefiting effects. The overall goal of this research was to design a protein delivery capsule using phase separated pea protein isolate (PPI) -alginate (AL) mixtures for the entrapment of the synbiot which includes the probiotics, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and the prebiotic, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), such that the capsule design provides highly effective protection and release within the GI tract. Research was carried out in three studies. 	In study 1, PPIn (native isolate) and AL interactions were studied in dilute aqueous solutions as a function of pH and biopolymer mixing ratio. <b>Turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> and electrophoretic mobility during an acid titration was used to determine conditions where phase separation occurred. Critical structure forming events associated with the formation of soluble and insoluble complexes in a 1 : 1 PPIn-AL mixture were found to occur at pH 5. 00 and 2. 98, respectively, with optimal interactions occurring at pH 2. 10. As the PPIn-AL ratio increased, critical pH values shifted towards higher pH until a mixing ratio between 4 : 1 and 8 : 1 was reached, above which structure formation became independent of the ratios through to ratios of 20 : 1. Electrophoretic mobility measurements showed a similar trend, where the isoelectric point (pI) shifted from pH 4. 00 (homogeneous PPIn) to pH 1. 55 (1 : 1 PPIn-AL). As the ratio increased towards 8 : 1 PPIn-AL, net neutrality values shifted to higher pHs (~ 3. 80) before becoming constant at higher ratios. Maximum coacervate formation occurred at a mixing ratio of 4 : 1. Based on these findings, capsule design by segregative phase separation was only used in future studies, due to the acidic nature associated with associative phase separation. 	In study 2, capsule formation using a native and commercial PPI was studied, and showed no difference between the two formulations during challenge experiments in simulated gastric juice (SGJ). As a result study 3 focused on optimization and characterization of capsules prepared using the commercial PPI. Capsule designs were investigated as a function of protein concentration, prebiotic level, and extrusion conditions (20 vs. 27 G needle) in order to determine protective ability for B. adolescentis within SGJ. Capsule designs were also measured in terms of protein and prebiotic retention during the encapsulation process, geometric mean diameter and size distribution, swelling behaviour and release characteristics within simulated intestinal fluids (SIF). All capsules provided adequate protection over the 2 h duration within SGJ. Capsule breakdown and release was similar for all designs within SIF, with a release mechanism believed to be tied to enzymatic degradation of the PPI material within the wall matrix and/or the amount of excessive Na+ present in the SIF. Capsule size was found to be dependent only on the needle gauge used in the extrusion process. Swelling behaviour of the capsules with SGJ was also found to be dependent only on the protein concentration, where capsules shrank once immersed in SGJ. 	A 2. 0 % PPI- 0. 5 % AL capsule without FOS and extruded through a 20 G needle represents the best and most cost effective design for entrapping, protecting and delivering probiotic bacteria. Future work to establish the role FOS could play post-release as the entrapping probiotics colonize the GI tract, and the protective effect of the capsules wall on FOS structure during transit is recommended...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Nutrition), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campusm, 2015 INTRODUCTION AND AIM Black South Africans are {{experiencing}} {{an increase in}} the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Fibrinogen functionality, including total and gamma prime (y’) fibrinogen concentration, as well as fibrin network structure, {{play an important role in}} CVD development and events. Several genetic and environmental factors influence fibrinogen functionality, and in turn, known CVD risk factors associated with total and y’ fibrinogen concentration have also been associated with altered fibrin clot structure. However, the main body of evidence regarding the role of fibrinogen functionality in CVD is based on studies conducted in white ethnicities and/or in vitro. The main aim of this study was, therefore, to determine the relationship between fibrinogen functionality and CVD in black South Africans in a plasma setting. Since there is greater genetic diversity in Africans than in non-black ethnicities, it was also our objective to investigate the influence of genetic polymorphisms in determining fibrinogen synthesis and plasma clot properties, and to determine possible gene-environment interactions altering clot properties. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS The South African arm of the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study included 2010 apparently healthy black men and women between the ages of 35 and 65 years, residing in rural or urban settlements. Blood samples were collected from the participants during a 12 -week period in 2005. The following variables were analysed: total and y’ fibrinogen concentration, CVD risk factors and genetic polymorphisms in the fibrinogen and Factor XIII genes as well as <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> of clot formation and lysis (expressed as clot lysis time (CLT)). RESULTS Increased plasma levels of both total (largest contribution of 33 %) and y’ fibrinogen were associated with increased fibre diameter while y’/total fibrinogen ratio had the opposite effect. The rate of lateral aggregation of fibrin fibres (slope) increased with an increase in total fibrinogen concentration, but not fibrinogen y’. Increasing fibrinogen y’ concentration was associated with longer CLTs and was the largest contributor to its variance (12 %). Increased total and y’ fibrinogen were significantly associated with increased waist circumference, body mass index, C-reactive protein (CRP), glycosylated haemoglobin, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the association of fibrinogen y’ with these CVD risk factors was independent of total fibrinogen levels. C-reactive protein was the largest contributor to variance in fibrinogen y’ levels and y’/total fibrinogen ratio (apart from total fibrinogen). We observed significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at rs 1049636 and rs 2070011 loci and increased total and y’ fibrinogen levels, respectively. Only SNP rs 1800787 was associated with clot properties (increased maximum absorbance). Significant gene-environment interactions were observed between SNPs rs 2227385, rs 1800787, rs 1800788, rs 4220 and rs 5985 and total and/or y’ fibrinogen levels in determining clot properties. The CVD risk factors age, MetS, CRP, HDL-cholesterol and homocysteine associated significantly with clot properties, independent of total and/or y’ fibrinogen plasma concentration. CONCLUSION The results of this thesis provide several novel insights relevant to this research field. Plasma y’ fibrinogen concentration and y’ ratio were found to be associated with altered clot properties in a plasma setting, and are also influenced by CVD risk factors other than fibrinogen. The associations between SNPs, total and y’ fibrinogen and clot properties differ somewhat from evidence reported in white populations. Significant gene-environment interactions between SNPs and total and y’ fibrinogen in determining clot properties existed and had opposing effects, i. e. both prothrombotic and antithrombotic, suggesting that the influence of genetic factors on fibrinogen should focus not only on concentration, but also on functionality. Cardiovascular disease risk factors also influence clot properties in vivo, through mechanisms independent of total and/or y’ fibrinogen concentration. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|The project {{aimed to}} use results of {{contamination}} of city vegetation with heavy metals and sulphur compounds {{as the basis}} for analysing the integral response of trees and shrubs to contamination, through a complex method of phytoindication. The results were used to draw up recommendations on pollution reduction in the city and to develop the method of phytoindication as a means of monitoring environmental pollution in St. Petersburg and other large cities. Field investigations were carried out in August 1996, and 66 descriptions of green areas were made in order to estimate the functional state of plants in the Vasileostrovsky district. Investigations of the spectrum reflecting properties of plants showed considerable variation of albedo meanings of leaves under the influence of various internal and external factors. The results indicated that lime trees most closely reflect the condition of the environment. Practically all the green areas studied were in poor condition, the only exceptions being areas of ash trees, which are more resistant to environmental pollution, and one lime-tree alley in a comparatively unpolluted street. The study identified those types of trees which are more or less resistant to complex environmental pollution and Ms. Terekhina recommends that the species in the present green areas be changed to include a higher number of the more resistant species. The <b>turbidimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> of tree barks for sulphates gave an indication of the level and spatial distribution of each pollutant, and the results also confirmed other findings that electric conductivity is a significant feature in determining the extent of sulphate pollution. In testing for various metals, the lime tree showed the highest contents for all elements except magnesium, copper, zinc, cadmium and strontium, again confirming the species' vulnerability to pollution. Medium rates of concentration in the city and environs showed that city plants concentrate 3 times as many different elements and 10 times more chromium, copper and lead than do those in the suburbs. The second stage of the study was based on the concept of phytoindication, which presupposes that changes in the relation of chemical elements in regional biological circulation under the influence of technogenesis provide a criterion for predicting displacements in people's health. There are certain basic factors in this concept. The first is that all living beings are related ecologically as well as by their evolutionary origin, and that the lower an organism is on the evolutionary scale, the less adaptational reserve it has. The second is that smaller concentrations of chemical elements are needed for toxicological influence on plants than on people and so the former's reactions to geochemical factors are easier to characterise. Visual indicational features of urban plants are well defined and can form the basis of a complex "environment - public health" analysis. Specific plant reactions reflecting atmospheric pollution and other components of urbogeosystems make it possible to determine indication criteria for predicting possible disturbances in the general state of health of the population. Thirdly the results of phytoindication investigations must be taken together with information about public health in the area. It only proved possibly to analyse general indexes of public health based on statistical data from the late 1980 s and early 1990 s as the data of later years were greatly influenced by social factors. These data show that the rates of illness in St. Petersburg (especially for children) are higher than in Russia as a whole, for most classes of diseases, indicating that the population there is more sensitive to the ecological state of the urban environment. The Vasileostrovsky district had the second highest sick rate for adullts, while the rate of infant mortality {{in the first year of}} life was highest there. Ms. Terekhina recommends further studies to more precisely assess the effectiveness of the methods she tested, but has drawn up a proposed map of environmental hazard for the population, taking into account prevailing wind directions...|$|E
