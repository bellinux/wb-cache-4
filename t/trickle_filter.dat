40|$|ABSTRACT: Insufficient oxygen {{transfer}} {{can result in}} anaerobic biofilms and odor generation during biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal in <b>trickling</b> <b>filters,</b> and can limit ammonia oxidation in nitrifying <b>trickling</b> <b>filters.</b> Since {{oxygen transfer}} to biofilms in plastic media <b>trickling</b> <b>filters</b> occurs by diffusion of oxygen through thin fluid films, previous models used solutions based on penetration theory to calculate BOD removal. However, it is shown in this paper that penetration theory is not valid for typical hydraulic onditions in <b>trickling</b> <b>filters</b> since oxygen can diffuse through the fluid film and reach the biofilm surface. As a result, numerical solutions are required to solve the equations describing oxygen mass transport to the biofilm. Computer models are therefore {{used to calculate the}} maximum oxygen transfer during BOD and ammonia oxidation i plastic media <b>trickling</b> <b>filters.</b> These models can be used by design engineers to minimize conditions that may cause odor generation i <b>trickling</b> <b>filters,</b> and to provide an upper limit to the efficiency of nitrifying <b>trickling</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this project is to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility and practicality of operating a methanotrophic mobile <b>trickle</b> <b>filter</b> bioreactor (MMB) unit to effectively reduce or eliminate trichloroethylene (TCE) and associated hydrocarbons from contaminated groundwater. The two-column <b>trickle</b> <b>filter</b> system can process 1. 67 gallons per minute (gpm) of contaminated groundwater. During this project, the pilot system will evaluate, optimize, and demonstrate methanotrophic treatment technology (MTT). The mobile system will receive a 1 [...] 4 % methane to air mixture for stimulating the methanotrophic TCE degrading bacteria, thereby increasing the rates of degradation of these contaminants. This project will also evaluate the efficacy of different bacteria for degrading TCE {{for use in the}} system at the laboratory-scale sample groundwater monitoring wells at TNX and set up the system for continued operation. The <b>trickle</b> <b>filter</b> system may be used to inexpensively treat other small-scale organic waste streams at SRS after the initial start-up. The MTT was demonstrated as an effective and efficient method of degrading TCE in the laboratory and during a field-scale in situ demonstration for degrading TCE in a groundwater plume at SRS. The methanotrophic bacteria increase significantly in population numbers and in the production of methane monooxygenase (MMO), an extremely powerful oxidizer. MMO was demonstrated as effective in oxidizing TCE and other recalcitrant compounds in laboratory studies. In the presence of MMO, TCE is oxidized to TCE-epoxide, which breaks down spontaneously into simple, easily degraded, daughter compounds. The system will receive a 1 [...] 4 % methane to air mixture, which will effectively grow and maintain the methanotrophic bacteria that will degrade TCE.

40|$|The US Department of Energy (DOE) Order 5400. 5, ``Radiation Protection of the Public and Environment'' {{contains}} provisions {{pertinent to}} releasing potentially radioactive materials from DOE facilities for reuse or recycle. A process of authorized release for materials recovered from radiation areas is permitted under Order 5400. 5 {{and the proposed}} rule in Title 10, Part 834, of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR Part 834). A generic disposition protocol to facilitate release of concrete under these provisions has been developed. This report analyzes the application of that generic protocol to site-specific cases at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The potential radiological doses and costs for several concrete disposition alternatives for the sewage treatment plant (STP) at the Central Facilities Area (CFA) of INEEL were evaluated in this analysis. Five disposition alternatives were analyzed for the concrete: (A) decontaminate, crush, and reuse; (B) crush and reuse without decontamination; (C) decontaminate, demolish, and dispose of at a nonradiological landfill; (D) demolish and dispose of at a nonradiological landfill without decontamination; and (E) demolish and dispose of at a low-level radioactive waste (LLW) facility. The analysis was performed for disposition of concrete from four INEEL structures: (1) <b>trickle</b> <b>filter,</b> (2) primary clarifier, (3) secondary clarifier, and (4) CFA- 691 pumphouse for a generic case (based on default parameters from the disposition protocol) and an INEEL-specific case (based on INEEL-specific parameters). The results of the analysis indicated that Alternatives B and D would incur the lowest cost and result in a dose less than 1 mrem/yr (except for the <b>trickle</b> <b>filter,</b> the dose for which was estimated at 1. 9 mrem/yr) for nonradiological workers. The analysis indicated that the main contributor to the radiological dose would be cobalt- 60 contamination in the concrete.

A major problem in manned space flight is the processing of urine. Water is the only component in urine that is recovered, yet. All dissolved substances such as urea and salts are extracted from the urine and then discarded. There was never an attempt to use these valuable commodities and include them in a closed system. The urine of habitat residents can be used to grow fresh fruits and vegetables after proper conversion. Eu:CROPIS shall prove this concept under varying conditions of gravity. Within the compact satellite Eu:CROPIS two life support systems will be combined for producing biomass out of urine. The used biological systems are: a nitrifying <b>trickle</b> <b>filter</b> system (C. R. O. P.) for using the urine as nitrogen source and Euglena gracilis as oxygen producing element. Also Euglena can protect the whole system against high level of ammonia which can occur during a low nitrification process. Euglena gracilis is a motile photosynthetic unicellular flagellate living in ponds and lakes. It uses gravity and light as hints to reach and stay in regions of the water column optimal for photosynthesis and growth. Euglena is considered a ‘professional gravi-sensing organism’, a term that was coined by ESA. In the past 15 years, Euglena has been established as a model organism for studying gravity perception of single cells. The core element of the C. R. O. P. system is a microbiological <b>trickle</b> <b>filter</b> made of lava rock. The lava rock is used as a habitat for a variety of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The high degree of adaptability of this system with respect to organismic diversity allows the use for the degradation and detoxification of various substances passing through the filter tube. The filter is able to adjust dynamically to the fed substances by selective reproduction of the organisms that can degrade and utilize these substances as their food base. As higher plant system small tomatoes (Micro-Tina) will be used for biomass production. Scientific aim is a seed to seed experiment under the gravitational conditions like on moon (0. 16 g) and on mars (0. 38 g) each for 6 months. During the long term experiment ion concentrations in the water based flow will be measured by ion chromatography and molecular biological analysis will be performed with euglena cells.

40|$|Acid mine {{drainage}} is a {{major environmental}} pollution concern associated with the mining of sulphide-containing ore bodies. Both physicochemical and biological options have been investigated {{for the treatment of}} acid mine drainage with recent interest in biological processes targeting low-cost and passive treatment applications. All acid mine drainage biological treatment processes are based to some extent on the activity of sulphate reducing bacteria, and their ability to reduce sulphate to sulphide {{in the presence of a}} range of carbon and electron donor sources. A portion of the sulphide produced may be consumed in the precipitation of heavy metals present in the mine drainage. Residual sulphide must be removed, not only due to its toxicity, but especially to prevent its reoxidation to sulphate where salinity reduction is a target of the treatment process. The partial oxidation of sulphide to elemental sulphur is an option that has received considerable attention and both physicochemical and biological options have been investigated. Biological processes have substantial potential cost advantages and run at ambient temperatures and pressures. However, the oxidation of sulphide to elemental sulphur is poised over a narrow redox range and process control to maintain optimum conditions remains a serious problem. In addition little has been reported in the literature on process control of sulphide oxidation to elemental sulphur, in the heterotrophic conditions prevailing in the reaction environment following sulphate reduction. This study undertook an investigation of biological sulphide oxidation under heterotrophic conditions in order to establish the effect of organic compounds on biological sulphide oxidation, and to determine whether the presence of organics, and associated heterotrophic oxygen consumption, may be manipulated to maintain the defined redox conditions required for the production of elemental sulphur. Biological sulphide oxidation under heterotrophic conditions was investigated in a series of flask experiments. Based on these results three different reactor configurations, a Fixed-Film <b>Trickle</b> <b>Filter</b> Reactor, Submerged Fixed-Film Reactor and a Silicone Tubular Reactor were used to investigate sulphur production. The flask studies indicated that organics, and associated heterotrophic metabolism in the presence of excess oxygen in the sulphide oxidation reaction environment, did contribute to the poising of redox conditions and thereby enabling the production of elemental sulphur. While the Fixed-Film <b>Trickle</b> <b>Filter</b> Reactor was found to be redox unstable, probably due to excess oxygen ingress to the system, a reduced oxygen challenge in the Submerged Fixed-Film Reactor configuration was found to be more successful for production of elemental sulphur. However, due to the production of a predominantly filamentous sulphur producing microbial population, recovery of sulphur from the column was intermittent and unpredictable. Extended residence times for produced sulphur on the column increased the likelihood for its eventual oxidation to sulphate. The Silicone Tubular Reactor was found to support a vigorous sulphide oxidising biofilm and produced elemental sulphur effectively. Electron microscopic studies showed that this occurred as both biologically produced sulphur and, probably mainly, as crystalline sulphur in the ortho-rhomic form. Given the linear extension of the sulphur production reaction environment it is was possible to investigate the sequence of the reaction mechanism in grater detail than is possible in mixed systems. Based on these findings a model explaining sulphur production under heterotrophic conditions has been proposed and is presented. The commercial implications of the development have also been noted...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the High Rate Algal Pond (HRAP) as an independent tertiary treatment unit operation for phosphate and nitrate removal is reported. A novel Integrated Algal Ponding System (lAPS) design is proposed for nutrient removal from the effluents of both a conventional domestic sewage treatment plant and from an Advanced Integrated Wastewater Ponding System (AIWPS). The viability of an independently operated HRAP has been identified and termed the Independent High Rate Algal Pond (l-HRAP). A 500 m² pilot 1 - HRAP was operated {{in such a way}} as to facilitate the precipitation of calcium phosphate, known to be controlled by pH (greater than 9. 4) and resulting in final phosphate levels of less than 1 mg. L⁻¹ as P 0 ₄-P. The incorporation of the I-HRAP into a denitrification process was also investigated. Continuously fed column reactors, utilising algal biomass as a carbon source, showed that the heterotrophic bacterial community dominant in the anaerobic algal sludge were denitrifying the nitrate in the feed. It was demonstrated that as the cultures were stressed (using increased nitrate concentrations, anaerobiosis and light starvation) total polysaccharide (TPS) concentrations increased, with a notable increase 111 the exopolysaccharide (EPS) fraction. These experiments corroborated the hypothesis that harvested microalgal biomass can be manipulated to produce, and release, exopolymeric substances under stress conditions, and which may serve as carbon source for denitrification. In both batch flask studies and in laboratory-scale reactor systems, harvested microalgal biomass from an HRAP was shown to produce exopolymeric substances under stress conditions. Initial high loading-rates of greater than 20 mg. L⁻¹ NO₃-N resulted in double the amount of exopolysaccharide production than in flasks with initial low loading-rates (less than 5 mg. L⁻¹ NO₃-N). Making use of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket-type degrading-bed reactor, and an anaerobic, flooded <b>trickle</b> <b>filter</b> (ANTRIC) receiving HRAP effluent, the relationship between denitrification and the changes in polysaccharide content was investigated. This phenomenon has considerable beneficial implications in biological wastewater treatment systems where high nitrate concentration in the final effluent is a potential mitigating factor. Identification of the heterotrophic bacteria active in the denitrification process was attempted. This study presents a first report on the development and operation of the I-HRAP and has been followed by a technical-scale pilot plant evaluation of the process in the tertiary treatment of domestic wastewaters...|$|E
40|$|Polluted waters, {{arising from}} {{extensive}} past and ongoing mining operations in South Africa, pose serious environmental {{threats to the}} limited fresh water resource. The long time periods, of decades to centuries, over which decanting mine waters {{may be expected to}} flow raises additional concerns about the sustainability of these resources. Responses to the problem have thus increasingly been directed towards the long-term sustainability of mine water treatment technologies (MWTT) as a critical indicator in both their research and development, and application. Bioprocess treatments have been considered in this regard and, among these, the Rhodes BioSURE Process has been investigated in preliminary studies using complex organic carbon wastes as the carbon source and electron donor for the central sulphate reduction unit operation. Although both the mining industry and the related statutory/regulatory authority in South Africa share public commitment to sustainability in the treatment of mine waters, no systematic mechanism has emerged to enable the application of sustainability thinking as a guiding principle in the selection and application of MWTTs, nor in the research and development undertaking. This study undertook the development of a Sustainability Indicator Framework in order to provide a systematic basis for the incorporation of sustainability objectives in MWTT bioprocess development, and specifically to use this framework as an input to the investigation of the scaleup development of the Rhodes BioSURE Process. In the development of the MWTT Sustainability Indicator Framework, an initial survey of industry thinking in this area was undertaken and, based on these outcomes, a detailed questionnaire methodology was developed in order to identify and quantify critical sustainability indicators. These included analysis of environmental, economic, social and technical indicators used in sustainability accounting practice in the industry. Statutory/regulatory sustainability targets in the same categories were derived from State of the Environment Reports (SoER) from Provincial authorities where mining is undertaken in South Africa. A synthesis of industry and SoER values was derived from weighted averages and the Sustainability Indicator Framework based on these outcomes. A Conceptual Decision-Support System, to guide the selection and development of MWTTs, was proposed and also based on these results. In the development of the Rhodes BioSURE Process the use of primary sludge (PS) had been investigated as a potential complex carbon and electron donor source. In this regard the utility operator, and sewage treatment process infrastructure, was identified as potentially meeting aspects of the sustainability objectives identified for MWTT application development. Both the Sustainability Indicator Framework and the Conceptual Decision-Support System provided inputs in the formulation of the experimental programme relating to the scale-up development of the Rhodes BioSURE Process. Based on these outcomes, a series of single- and multi-stage reactor configuration, optimisation and enzymology studies were undertaken at bench-, pilot- and technical-scale operations. These units were operated at hydraulic retention times (HRT) ranging between 22 to 72 hours and at chemical oxygen demand to sulphate ratios (COD:SO[subscript 4]) ranging between 1 : 1 to 2 : 1. Studies undertaken in fed-batch, bench-scale reactors confirmed the preliminary feasibility of using established sewage treatment infrastructure as a replacement for novel reactor configurations that had been used in the initial studies. The results further indicated that the hydrolysis of PS occurred at different rates under biosulphidogenic conditions in the different reactor configurations investigated. Scale-up of these findings in multi-stage pilot- (7. 4 m[superscript 3]) and technical-scale plants (680 m[superscript 3]) showed comparable performances between the unit operations in terms of SO[subscript 4] and COD removal. These results indicated no apparent advantages in the uncoupling of hydrolysis and sulphate reduction in separate unit operations as had been suggested in previous studies. Scale-down/scale-up studies were undertaken in a continuously fed single-stage reactor configuration and showed that the process could be effectively operated in this way. Previous proposals that chemical and biological gradients established in the sludge bed of the Recycling Sludge Bed Reactor (RSBR) exercised an influence on the rates of substrate hydrolysis were investigated and the relative activity of α- and β-glucosidase and protease enzymes was measured. Results provided additional support for this hypothesis and it was shown that enzyme assay may also provide a useful tool in process development and monitoring studies. While sulphide recovery, following the sulphate reduction step in the BioSURE Process, was not investigated as a component of this study, the treatment of final effluent or waste spills was identified as an important sustainability requirement given the toxicity of sulphide to human and ecosystem environments. A conventional <b>trickle</b> <b>filter</b> reactor system was evaluated for this purpose and showed close to 100 % oxidation to sulphate in a short contact time operating regime. Although residual COD removal was low at ~ 20 % of influent, it is considered that high rate recycle biofilter operation could achieve the COD discharge standard of 75 mg/l. The results of the above studies provided inputs into the design, construction and commissioning of the first full-scale commercial application of the Rhodes BioSURE Process for mine wastewater treatment using sewage sludge as the carbon and electron donor source. An adjacent mine and sewage works have been linked by pipeline and an operational capacity of 10 Ml/day water treated has been established with sulphate reduced from ~ 1300 mg/l to < 200 mg/l. These developments constitute a novel contribution in the mine waste water treatment field...|$|E

In South Africa, many {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTP) still make us of their rock filled <b>trickling</b> <b>filters.</b> Instead of using them for organics removal and nitrification, there is growing interest in integrating them with biological excess P removal activated sludge (BEPRAS) systems in an external nitrification flow scheme (Hu et al., 2000). In such a scheme, the full influent flow (after primary settling) is discharged to the anaerobic reactor of the BEPRAS system, after which the activated sludge is separated from the water by internal settling tanks. The clarified supernatant is pumped to the <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> for nitrification and the activated sludge to the anoxic reactor of the BEPRAS system, where the nitrified water rejoins the main BEPRAS system. This external nitrification BEPRAS system has several advantages over continuing to use the <b>trickling</b> <b>filters</b> for organics removal and nitrification, such as significantly reduced oxygen demand (~ 50 %) and biological N and P removal on the full wastewater flow. To date full-scale studies in South Africa have been performed only with rock media <b>trickling</b> <b>filters,</b> for example that at Daspoort WWTP (Muller et al., 2004, 2006 a, b). This report describes an investigation on the full-scale operation of a plastic media nitrifying <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> (NTF) at the 1 Ml/d Citrusdal WWTP...|$|R

40|$|Oxygen Transfer Rate (OTR) is {{considered}} one of the most important factors that affect <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> performance, insufficient OTR limits <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> performance and generate malodor, another factor that affects <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> performance is the percent wetting of the media surface. Effective distribution system may achieve increase in OTR and maintain maximum wetting of the media surface. The present study is an attempt to enhance distribution system efficiency, so the <b>trickling</b> <b>filter</b> performance by using Radial Jet Nozzle (RJN) configuration instead of conventional circular nozzle. The distributoroffset distance from the bed is taken into consideration as a geometric variable parameter. Results show that RJN configuration increased the percentage of dissolved oxygen (DO%) from the saturation value by 15 % than conventional nozzle for the same power consumption in two cases. Results also indicated that increase offset ratio will increase the DO % by 5 & 7 % for RJN and conventional nozzle configurations respectively. The study also evaluated the effect of inner pipe diameter and fluid outlet velocity on DO%...|$|R
