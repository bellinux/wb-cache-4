Problems {{with the size of}} the water wheel, which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of the wheel sagged, putting strain on the bearings and stays.

The changes to the wheel were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing the wheel in two.|$|E

25|$|The north {{transept}} (or Priory End) windows, {{east and}} north, are 19th century but within 14th-century openings. The trussed roof is possibly 16th century with {{tie beam support}} added in the 19th. The south transept (or Hall End) east and south windows are 14th century although partly restored. The 15th-century south transept roof <b>trussing</b> is of hammer beam construction, with curved collar braces springing from beams which are supported by curved chamfered brackets. Running on the wall from the hammer beams to the roof line are wind braces, and to the ridge beam is roof truss framing. Both transepts are separated from the nave by c.20th-century panels and doors rising part {{way to the top}} of the arches. The north transept is solid panelling; the south with clear glazed doors to its full width. The north transept is today used as the church vestry room, and the south transept a meeting room with modern furniture. On the south wall of the south transept is a 14th-century piscina with a recessed trefoiled head, a re-cut quatrefoil drain, a head of a woman in a wimple carved at its apex, and a finial above.|$|E

500|$|The book {{begins with}} general {{chapters}} on {{the duties of}} the [...] "mistress", the housekeeper, and the cook. There follow chapters on the kitchen itself, [...] "marketing" [...] (choosing good-quality produce at the market), and an introduction to cookery (Chapter 6). Together, these take up over 100 pages. Chapters 7 to 38 (roughly 1000 pages) cover English cooking, with recipes for soups, gravies, fish, meat (principally veal, beef, mutton and lamb, and pork), poultry, game, preserves, vegetables, pastries, puddings, sweets, jams, pickles, and savouries. Chapter 39 describes the [...] "art of carving at table", supported by 11 illustrations. Chapters 40 to 50 (some 200 pages) give instructions for dairy products, vegetarian and invalid (sick person) cookery, making bread, biscuits and cakes, and beverages. Chapters 51 to 59 describe cooking in various international styles including French, German, Spanish, Jewish, Australian, South African, Indian, American and Canadian cookery. Chapters 60 to 68 provide guidance on matters from <b>trussing</b> poultry to the definitions of culinary terms, arranging meals, decorating the table, making menus and the duties of domestic servants. Chapters 69 to 73 describe [...] "household recipes" [...] and medical preparations. The final chapter, 74, offers [...] "legal memoranda".|$|E
2500|$|Architectural {{elements}} {{outlined by}} Conrad {{to achieve this}} goal included: brick construction over timber, with bare treatments to interior walls; large windows {{at the rear of the}} church and side windows on the chancel (rather than behind the altar); low-toned cathedral glass in simple leaded design where stained glass was not affordable, naves that were long rather than wide, and internal roofing wholly of wood, with heavy timber for open trussed roofs, stained with a dull finish to create [...] "an interesting and dignified treatment". Such elements are readily apparent at St Paul's and other churches of the 1920s designed by Atkinson and Conrad. In particular, the use of substantial timber roof <b>trussing</b> in the nave (a word derived from the Latin word navis for ship), resembling the interior of a ship's hull, expressed the longstanding symbolism of the church as a ship, guiding its members to safe harbour.|$|E

Into her mind came the thought that for months, perhaps for years, long after she had been utterly forgotten, a white, unheeding face would be seen peering out through those latticed panes, and a weak muttering voice would be heard quavering up and down those flagged passages. She made her way to a narrow barred casement that opened into the farm larder.

His lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely sweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part he bulged out in another, Hook's master mind had gone far beneath Slightly's surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his exultation showed that he had found them.

Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he was in a panic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in consequence to his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit him.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 This study {{presents}} a practical method to model an actual Metal-Plate- Connected (MPC) roof <b>truss</b> assembly using a commercial program, SAP 2000, to investigate its system performance. <b>Truss</b> assembly modeling was examined because the conventional single <b>truss</b> design method ignores system effects, such as variability of {{modulus of elasticity}} (MOE), interaction of sub-assemblies, realistic boundary conditions, etc. Two types of semi-rigid MPC joint models, linear spring (LS) joint model and a <b>truss</b> plate manufacturer's (TPM's) joint model, {{were used for the}} <b>truss</b> and <b>truss</b> assembly models. To verify the <b>truss</b> models using the LS joint model, the predicted deflections of individual <b>trusses</b> and the load sharing of nine-truss roof assembly models were compared with experimental results from the literature. Fourteen individual <b>trusses</b> (the components of the actual roof <b>truss</b> assembly) using TPM's joint models were also verified by comparing the Combined Stress Index (CSI) values with the CSI values provided by the TPM. Both design and one set of random material properties were used in the analysis of the actual roof <b>truss</b> assembly model. The predictions for <b>truss</b> models using the LS joint model for <b>truss</b> deflections and load sharing effect agree with the experimental results. The CSI values for individual <b>trusses</b> with the TPM's joint model matched the CSI values provided by the TPM. The load distribution in an actual roof <b>truss</b> assembly is strongly influenced by the interaction of sub-assemblies and by the boundary conditions. In the <b>truss</b> assembly, the prediction of location and value of maximum CSI are different from those for the single <b>truss.</b> The <b>truss</b> with the maximum CSI value of 0. 91 among fourteen individual <b>truss</b> types decreased to 0. 52 and 0. 51 when this <b>truss</b> is in the assembly with design and random material properties, respectively.
