40|$|Electrophotographic {{printers}} {{are used}} widely in offices. There {{are two types}} of the electrophotographic printers: light emitting diode (LED) printer and laser printer. <b>The</b> <b>LED</b> printer has LED printheads as light sources.

25|$|Some LCDs mimic needle tuners with {{a needle}} graphic that moves {{in the same way}} as a genuine needle tuner. Somewhat misleadingly, many LED {{displays}} have a 'strobe mode' that mimics strobe tuners by scrolling the flashing of <b>the</b> <b>LEDs</b> cyclically to simulate the display of a true strobe. However, these are all just display options. The way a regular tuner 'hears' and compares the input note to a desired pitch is exactly the same, with no change in accuracy.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a thermal analysis and experimental validation of natural convective heat transfer of a high-brightness light-emitting diode (<b>LED)</b> package assembly. <b>The</b> substrate {{materials used in}} <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> package assembly were filled and doped using boron nitride (BN) filler. The thermal conductivity of the BN-filled substrate was measured. The temperature distribution and heat flow of <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> package were assessed by thermal profile measurement using an infrared (IR) camera and thermocouples. In addition, the heat transfer process of <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> package assembly in natural convection was also simulated using the computational fluid dynamics method. The optical performance of <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> package was monitored and investigated with various filler contents. The heat conduction mechanismin the substrate was analyzed.

40|$|A new microelectronic {{package was}} {{designed}} for a high-power light-emitting diode (<b>LED).</b> <b>The</b> objective was to build a package that enables <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> to operate with currents as high as 2 Amps. An innovative thin-film interface has been developed to electrically connect the cathode of <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> die to a 22 AWG Cu wire. This thin-film interface is wirebondable and solderable, and consists of three layers: Au, Ni 93 /V 7, and Si. Four 1 mil Au wirebonds, supporting 2 A of maximum current, connect the Au thin-film to <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> die cathode. Sn 96 Ag 4 solder is used for connecting the Ni 93 /V 7 thin-film to the 22 AWG Cu wire. To provide an electrical, mechanical and thermal platform for the anode of <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> die, a sub-assembly was developed. This sub-assembly utilizes a Cu substrate on which the anode of <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> die is attached with Au 80 Sn 20 solder. <b>The</b> <b>LED</b> die, thin-film interface and Cu substrate integrate into the sub-assembly, which then solders onto a Cu heatsink. Electrical current flows into the heatsink, through <b>the</b> <b>LED,</b> across <b>the</b> thin-film interface, then out the Cu wire. All-metal interfaces from <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> anode to <b>the</b> heatsink provide a thermally conductive path.
