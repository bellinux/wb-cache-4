40|$|Abstract. Recently, a new partial {{discharge}} location technique called three-point <b>technique</b> <b>had</b> {{been introduced to}} locate {{partial discharge}} on underground cable. It is the improvement of double-end technique. In this paper, the mathematical formula of three-point <b>technique</b> <b>had</b> been simplified from previous research. Alternative Transient Program (ATP) was being used to simulate both double-end and three-point technique. The results of the simulation were compared and analysed based on the accuracy, cost of implementation and algorithm complexity of the <b>technique.</b> Three-point <b>technique</b> <b>had</b> shown significant improvement in the accuracy of partial discharge location on underground cable...|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology. Since the 1970s, {{a variety of}} <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> been developed to specifically add, remove and edit genes in an organism. Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired. The related term synthetic biology is sometimes {{used to refer to}} extensive genetic engineering of an organism.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is a semiconductor. Zone {{refining}} <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> led to {{the production}} of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that has an impurity of only one part in 1010, {{making it one of the}} purest materials ever obtained. The first metallic material discovered (in 2005) to become a superconductor in the presence of an extremely strong electromagnetic field was an alloy of germanium, uranium, and rhodium.|$|E
5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{national}} broadcaster, Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi (ERT) broadcasts {{the event}} in Greece each year and organizes the selection process for its entry. Its selection <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> varied from national finals where the public selects the entry, to internal selections like used in 2004, where the broadcaster has complete control over the selection. For the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, ERT decided to hold a televised national final after internally selecting an artist.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve an}} {{adequate}} width and height of bone, various bone grafting <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> been developed. The {{most frequently used}} is called guided bone graft augmentation where a defect is filled with either natural (harvested or autograft) bone or allograft (donor bone or synthetic bone substitute), covered with a semi-permeable membrane and allowed to heal. During the healing phase, natural bone replaces the graft forming a new bony base for the implant.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E
50|$|The ELANA <b>technique</b> <b>has</b> been {{extensively}} described in medical literature. It was developed starting in 1993 {{to find a}} way to treat patients with a bypass to a major cerebral artery without the risk of cerebral ischemia during the procedure.

5|$|Creationists {{claim that}} {{evolution}} relies on {{certain types of}} evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. For example, {{it is argued that}} radiometric dating technique of evaluating a material's age based on the radioactive decay rates of certain isotopes generates inconsistent and thus unreliable results. Radiocarbon dating based on the carbon-14 isotope has been particularly criticized. It is argued that radiometric decay relies on a number of unwarranted assumptions such as the principle of uniformitarianism, consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as closed systems. Such arguments have been dismissed by scientists on the grounds that independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> independently confirmed each other's results.|$|E
5|$|Molecular <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> been {{developed}} to help with conservation efforts of stipitate hydnoid fungi, including H.peckii. While {{the distribution of the}} fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies, this method has a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year, and the absence of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its mycelium in the soil. More modern techniques using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the presence of the fungal DNA in the soil have helped alleviate the issues in monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> {{traditionally been}} applied exclusively to proteins, {{as the primary}} biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be especially difficult to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA {{as well as in}} proteins, and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{vibrations}} in a properly functioning bicycle is the surface over which it rolls. In addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions, a variety of <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> been developed to damp vibrations {{before they reach the}} rider. These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the front fork, seatpost, or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{prevalent}} in most woodland types in its range, {{and also in}} more open country with scattered trees. Eurasian sparrowhawks prefer to hunt the edges of wooded areas, but migrant birds {{can be seen in}} any habitat. The increased proportion of medium-aged stands of trees created by modern forestry <b>techniques</b> <b>have</b> benefited Accipiter nisus, according to a Norwegian study. Unlike its larger relative the northern goshawk, it can be seen in gardens and in urban areas and will even breed in city parks.|$|E
