Tavares' skating speed is something he greatly improved since turning professional, and his speed is no longer considered an issue on the ice.|$|E
5|$|The Jeopardy! staff used {{different}} {{means to}} notify Watson {{and the human}} players when to buzz, which was critical in many rounds. The humans were notified by a light, which took them tenths of a second to perceive. Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds. The humans tried {{to compensate for the}} perception delay by anticipating the light, but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson's response time. Watson did not attempt <b>to</b> <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> notification signal.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5S was {{the best}} selling phone on AT, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile in September 2013 in the United States, outselling the iPhone 5C and Samsung Galaxy S4. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the iPhone 5S outsold the 5C by a two-to-one margin during its September release, {{confirming}} Apple CEO Tim Cook's view that the high-end smartphone market was not reaching a point of market saturation. While commentators viewed the 5C as a flop because of supply chain cuts signifying a decline in demand, the 5S {{was viewed as a}} massive success. Apple admitted that it had failed <b>to</b> <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> sales ratio, leading to an overstocking of the 5C and shortages of the 5S.|$|E

5|$|Lenin {{expected}} Russia's aristocracy and bourgeoisie {{to oppose}} his government, but {{he believed that}} the numerical superiority of the lower classes, coupled with the Bolsheviks' ability to effectively organise them, guaranteed a swift victory in any conflict. In this, he failed <b>to</b> <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> intensity of the violent opposition to Bolshevik rule in Russia. The ensuing Russian Civil War pitted the pro-Bolshevik Reds against the anti-Bolshevik Whites, but also encompassed ethnic conflicts on Russia's borders and conflict between both Red and White armies and local peasant groups, the Green armies, throughout the former Empire. Accordingly, various historians have seen the civil war as representing two distinct conflicts: one between the revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries, and the other between different revolutionary factions.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{had shown}} the {{potential}} of the Soviet armies to successfully conduct an offensive. This battle can be seen {{as one of the first}} major instances in which the Soviets attempted to preempt a German summer offensive. This later unfolded and grew as Stavka planned and conducted Operation Mars, Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn. Although only two of the three were victories, it still offers concise and telling evidence of the ability of the Soviets to turn the war in their favor. This finalised itself after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a positive effect on Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to have the last word in naming front commanders for instance). After the great purge in 1937, failing <b>to</b> <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> war in 1941, and underestimating German military power in 1942, Stalin finally fully trusted his military.|$|E

25|$|Steering a ship {{effectively}} requires skills {{gained through}} training and experience. An expert helmsman has {{a keen sense}} of how a particular ship will respond to the helm or how different sea conditions impact steering. For instance, experience teaches a helmsman the ability to correct the rudder in advance of a ship substantially falling off course. This requires the capacity <b>to</b> <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> delay between when the helm is applied and when the ship responds to the rudder. Similarly, a skilled helmsman will avoid overcompensating for a ship's movement caused by local conditions, such as wind, swells, currents, or rough seas.|$|E
25|$|Commentators viewed iPhone 5C as a flop {{because of}} supply chain cuts {{signifying}} {{a decline in}} demand in October 2013. Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted that the company overstocked the iPhone 5C while having shortages of the iPhone 5S, {{as a result of}} failing <b>to</b> <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> sales ratio between both phones. Six months after the release of the iPhone 5C, on March 25, 2014, Apple announced that sales of the iPhone line has crossed 500 million units, but did not break out how many of these units were the iPhone 5C. iPhone 5C was among the top three best selling phones in the US for three months after its launch.|$|E

25|$|In spring 923, Li Cunxu, then at Wei Prefecture, {{declared}} himself emperor {{of a new}} Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong), effectively claiming to be the legitimate successor to Tang. Shortly after, he had his general Li Siyuan launch a surprise attack across the Yellow River on Later Liang's Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), capturing it. The fall of Tianping's capital Yun Prefecture (鄆州) left few defenses between it and Daliang, causing great panic at Daliang. Zhu Zhen relieved Dai Siyuan of his command for failing <b>to</b> <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> attack, and, {{at the urging of}} the senior chancellor Jing Xiang, named Wang Yanzhang to replace Dai, with Duan Ning serving as his deputy.|$|E
25|$|The {{sudden death}} of Charles Bryant in 1960 while {{editor of the}} Emu was another blow. He had edited, and managed the {{publication}} of, the journal for over 30 years but had neglected <b>to</b> <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> need for a successor. Those who did succeed him during the 1960s, struggled to maintain, let alone develop, the journal {{in a way that}} the membership and the changing times demanded, and its issue, due to problems with the printers, was becoming erratic. Moreover, the accounts were falling into disarray and the administrative backlog was becoming worse each year. There was increasing criticism from members, especially from the ACT branch, which contained a high proportion of the members who were professional scientists.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the German {{withdrawal}} to the Hindenburg Line has been explained as an Allied failure <b>to</b> <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> retirement and in being unable seriously to impede it. Another {{view is that the}} Anglo-French were not pursuing a broken enemy but an army making a deliberate withdrawal after months of preparation, which retained considerable powers of manoeuvre and counter-attack. Belated awareness of the significance of the building work along the base of the Noyon Salient, has also been given as a reason for a cautious pursuit deliberately chosen, rather than an inept and failed attempt to intercept the German retirement. In Cavalry Studies: Strategical and Tactical (1907) Haig had described the hasty retreat of a beaten enemy and an organised withdrawal by a formidable force, capable of rapidly returning to the attack, to defeat a disorganised pursuit.|$|E
