5|$|Apple {{unveiled}} the PowerBook100 on October 21, 1991, at the Comdex computer expo in Las Vegas, {{with two other}} models, the PowerBook 140 and PowerBook 170. The advertisement and the product were both successful. Apple projected US sales of more than 200,000 PowerBooks in the first year, with peak demand {{in the first three}} months of release. By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were in short supply. Apple soon solved the supply problems, and the proceeds from PowerBook sales reached $1billion in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> launch. Apple surpassed Toshiba and Compaq as the market leader in worldwide share of portable computer shipments. The PowerBook100, 140, and 170 contributed greatly to Apple's financial success in 1992. At the end of the financial year, Apple announced its highest figures yet, $7.1billion in revenues and an increase in global market share from 8% to 8.5%, the highest it had been in four years.|$|E
5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a cash prize, {{the winner of the}} tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949, and informally acquired by the champions for many years before that. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon {{after the end of the}} tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the spectators. Winners keep their jacket for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.|$|E

He became disgruntled with a role he felt was powerless and only honorary, and resigned one year later. Richard grew estranged from the organization as his desire {{to be involved in the}} team's operations was ignored, and the split deepened when the Canadiens forced Frank Selke to retire in 1965. He eventually refused to allow his name to be associated with the team.|$|E
5|$|The Second Treaty of Paris in 1783 {{ended the}} American Revolution and {{established}} the United States of America. The treaty extended the new country's western boundary to the Mississippi River and within <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> {{it was signed}} 50,000American settlers crossed the Appalachian Mountains. As {{it was difficult to}} return east across the mountains, the settlers began looking toward the Spanish colonies of Louisiana and Texas to find places to sell their crops. Spain closed the mouth of the Mississippi to foreigners from 1784 until 1795 despite Thomas Jefferson's 1790 threat to begin an Anglo-Spanish war over the matter. Americans risked arrest to come to Texas, many of them desiring to capture wild mustangs in West Texas and trade with the Indians. In 1791, Philip Nolan became the first Anglo-American known to pursue horse-trading in Texas, and he was arrested several times for being within Spain's borders. The Spanish feared that Nolan was a spy, and in 1801 they sent 150troops to capture Nolan and his party of 6men; Nolan was killed during the ensuing battle. By 1810, many Americans were trading guns and ammunition to the Texas Indians, especially the Comanche, in return for livestock. Although some chiefs refused to trade with them and reported their movements to Spanish authorities, other bands welcomed the newcomers. A drought made rangeland scarce and stopped the Comanche's herds from increasing. To meet the American demand for livestock, the Comanche turned to raiding the area around San Antonio.|$|E
