5|$|A droving dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are {{understood}} {{to have been}} of the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly referred to as}} Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
5|$|Among {{his famous}} {{drawings}} are the Vitruvian Man, {{a study of}} the proportions of the human body; the Head of an Angel, for The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre; a botanical study of Star of Bethlehem; and a large drawing (160×100cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist in the National Gallery, London. This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mona Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E

5|$|Before the Eighty Years' War began, people {{realized}} that the West Indies trade might bring great prosperity {{to the country and}} that more power might be developed against Spain. Rather than travel to the area singly on an armed ship or {{in the company of a}} few other vessels, traders could do business in <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large and prosperous East India Company. A company for carrying on commerce in the West Indies and Africa could be organized, which might, like the sister company, act as the war-waging power in those parts and be supported by the treasury, ships, and troops of the United Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy {{were well aware}} of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E
5|$|External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were {{designed}} for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade, leading to a courtyard within. An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard to the piano nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn inwards and outwards {{as many as four}} times. Owing to the topography of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases, in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), in <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E

5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intervention.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XII, the Light of Kiltia, a polytheistic religion, is the {{dominant}} church in Ivalice, having influence in the political affairs of the region around the Galtean Peninsula. Despite this, the church maintains an apolitical stance, with its most high-ranking officials banned from participating in political affairs altogether. At its head is the Gran Kiltias, being the Helgas Anastasis {{at the time of}} Final Fantasy XII, until his death during the events of the story. Like Glabados followers in Final Fantasy Tactics, Kiltias swear on the name of Faram, the Father of All, in <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian amen. The Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Ω guide considers the Glabados Church a possible branch of Kiltia.|$|E

Piller {{could not find a}} {{feasible}} way to include this in the script, and the budget ruled out the creation of Alamo-like structures in the mountains. Several titles were considered for the film as shooting approached. Star Trek: Where Time Stands Still, Star Trek: Forever and Star Trek: Beyond Paradise were all considered but were rejected. Piller's favorite was Star Trek: Sacred Honor, but the studio rejected this because they were concerned that it sounded too religious. When shooting began, the film was still called Star Trek IX.|$|E

5|$|At Kelmscott Press the {{perfection}} of book-making was under his constant supervision and practical assistance. It was his ambition to produce a perfect work to restore all the beauty of illuminated lettering, richness of gilding and grace of binding that {{used to make a}} volume the treasure of a king. His efforts were constantly directed towards giving the world at least one book that exceeded anything that had ever appeared. Morris designed his type after the best examples of early printers, what he called his “golden type” which he copied after Jenson, Parautz, Coburger and others. With this in mind, Morris took equal care on the choice of his paper which he adapted to his subject with the same care that governed his selection of material for binding. As a result, few but only the wealthy could purchase his lavish works, mainly due to how intrinsic his work was. However, he realized that creating works in <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle ages was difficult in a profit-grinding society.|$|E

5|$|Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons, and {{physicians}} were suspected because of <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City Police, {{indicates that the}} alibis were investigated of local butchers and slaughterers, {{with the result that}} they were eliminated from the inquiry. A report from Inspector Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months. Some contemporary figures, including Queen Victoria, thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks, and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday. The cattle boats were examined but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The Final Fantasy I•II {{collection}} {{included the}} original game with only minor changes. The WonderSwan Color {{remake of the}} game was first released on May 3, 2001, and later included as a bundle with a special Final Fantasy II edition of the console. It included completely redone graphics in <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16-bit generation Final Fantasy games and includes larger character sprites, remixed music by Tsuyoshi Sekito, and full graphical backgrounds in battle mode. The PlayStation version featured even more graphical updates over the WonderSwan version, and the soundtrack was again remixed by Tsuyoshi Sekito to a higher quality so as to utilise the audio capabilities of the PlayStation. Sekito also composed a few new tracks {{to be used in}} the new cutscenes. It was published both individually (in Japan only) and alongside Final Fantasy I in a collection entitled Final Fantasy Origins (or Final Fantasy I+II Premium Collection in Japan); this was the first release of the game outside Japan. On December 18, 2012 the port was re-released as part of the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box package.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved {{the relationship between}} the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were pleased that Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession. The 1996 Treasure Act is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so that the owner of the land and the person who finds the hoard have a strong stake {{in the value of the}} discovery. <b>The</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the previous system of common law for dealing with treasure trove into a statutory legal framework that takes into account technology such as metal detectors, provides incentives for treasure hunters to report finds, and considers the needs of museums and scholars.|$|E

5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the alliance with France had virtually ceased after Verneuil and its renewal in 1428 did not alter that—James adopted a much more non-aligned position with England, France and Burgandy {{while at the same}} time opening up diplomatic contacts with Aragon, Austria, Castile, Denmark, Milan, Naples and the Vatican. Generally, Scotto–English relations were relatively amiable and an extension of the truce until 1436 helped the English cause in France and the promises made in 1428 of a Scottish army to help Charles VII and the marriage of James's eldest daughter to the French king's son Louis were unrealised. James had to balance his European responses carefully, because England's key ally, the Duke of Burgundy was also in possession of the Low Countries, a major trading partner of Scotland's at the time, and therefore James' support for France was muted. The truce with England expired in May 1436 but James's perception of the Anglo-French conflict changed following a realignment of the combatants. The breakdown of the talks between England and France in 1435 precipitated an alliance between Burgundy and France and a request from France for Scottish involvement in the war and for the fulfilment of the promised marriage of Princess Margaret to the Dauphin. In the spring of 1436 Princess Margaret sailed to France and in August Scotland entered the war with James leading a large army to lay siege to the English enclave of Roxburgh Castle. The campaign was to prove pivotal, the Book of Pluscarden describes ' a detestable split and most unworthy difference arising from jealosy ' within the Scottish camp and the historian Michael Brown explains that a contemporary source has James appointing his young and inexperienced cousin Robert Stewart of Atholl as the constable of the host ahead of the experienced march wardens, the earls of Douglas and Angus. Brown explains that both earls possessed considerable local interests and that the effects of such a large army living off the land may have created considerable resentment and hostility in the area. When the militant prelates of York and Durham together with the Earl of Northumberland took their forces into the marches to relieve the fortress, the Scots swiftly retreated – a chronicle written a year later said that the Scots 'had fled wretchedly and ignominiously' – but what is certain is that the effects and <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defeat and the loss of their expensive artillery was a major reversal for James both in terms of foreign policy and internal authority.|$|E
