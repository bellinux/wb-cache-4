5000|$|.....drivers {{generally}} {{prefer the}} feel, i.e., the tactile response, of conventional cable-driven <b>throttle</b> <b>systems.</b> Designers have therefore attempted {{to address this}} preference with mechanisms for emulating the tactile response of cable-driven accelerator pedals.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{electronic}} <b>throttle</b> valve <b>systems</b> has been very popular in the automotive industry. It is used to regulate the amount of air flow into the engine. Due {{to the existence of}} multiple nonsmooth nonlinearities, the controller design to the electronic throttle valve becomes difficult task. These nonlinearities including stick–slip friction, backlash, and a discontinuous nonlinear spring involved in the system. In {{the first part of this}} paper the electronic <b>throttle</b> valve <b>system</b> is presented first, and then the model is derived for each components of the <b>throttle</b> valve <b>system.</b> Later, the system dimension is reduced to two by ignoring the motor inductance at the end of this part of work. Actually this step enables us to design a nonlinear PID controller electronic <b>throttle</b> valve <b>system.</b> The simulation results, of applying a nonlinear PID controller to the electronic <b>throttle</b> valve <b>system,</b> show the effectiveness of the proposed controller in forcing the angle of the throttle valve to the desired opening angle in presence of nonlinearities and disturbances in <b>throttle</b> valve <b>system</b> model...|$|R
5000|$|Additional changes {{included}} a <b>throttling</b> <b>system</b> for wider mission flexibility, which also required a variable mixture system to properly mix the fuel and oxygen {{for a variety}} of different operating pressures. It also {{included a}} new [...] "Idle Mode" [...] that produced little thrust for on-orbit maneuvering or to settle the fuel tanks on-orbit prior to a burn.|$|R

50|$|After {{developing}} the Stall Warning Device, Greene continued developing aviation inventions. He and his engineering staff at Safe Flight {{went on to}} conceive devices now commonplace in aircraft, including an automatic <b>throttle</b> <b>system</b> in 1956 and a wind-shear warning system that warns a pilot if an aircraft enters a dangerous microburst and provides escape guidance. He developed the latter in the late 1970s {{after a series of}} wind-shear-related crashes that claimed hundreds of lives.|$|E
5000|$|The Honda R {{engine is}} an {{inline-four}} engine launched in 2006 for the Honda Civic (Non-Si). It is fuel injected, has an aluminum-alloy cylinder block and cylinder head, is a SOHC 16-valve design (four valves per cylinder) and utilizes Honda's i-VTEC system. The R series engine has a compression ratio of 10.5:1, features a [...] "drive by wire" [...] <b>throttle</b> <b>system</b> which is computer controlled to reduce pumping losses {{and create a}} smooth torque curve.|$|E
5000|$|On Feb. 8, 2010 the NHTSA and NASA {{concluded}} the electronics {{were not to}} blame after reviewing the electronics and electromagnetic interference. The finding was based on studying over 280,000 lines of software coding on nine vehicles involved in earlier sudden acceleration incidents. [...] And studying the <b>throttle</b> <b>systems</b> at NASA's Langley Research Center and Chrysler's Auburn Hills headquarters.|$|R
40|$|The {{project was}} {{performed}} at Siemens Industry Drive Technologies {{with the objective}} to provide actual values for the energy savings potential within Siemens scope of practice. In Sweden the electrical drives stand for about 30 % of the total electricity consumption and about 60 % of the electricity consumption within the industry. During the pre-study phase electrical drives with pump applications were identified as large energy users. Because of this a case study at one of Siemens customers, Stora Enso Fors was performed. The system that was evaluated during the case study was a <b>throttled</b> <b>system</b> with a centrifugal pump for pumping pulp. The results yielded that a saving of over 50 % could be achieved by replacing the throttle valve with a variable speed drive, a frequency converter. The payback period was two years and two months and the present value for the total life cycle cost of the variable speed system was 662. 566 SEK lower than for the <b>throttled</b> <b>system.</b> As a consequence, Stora Enso Fors is advised {{to invest in a}} frequency converter for regulation of the system. The general conclusion is that a focus on system efficiency is {{the most important factor in}} energy efficiency projects and that the system regulation method has a large impact on the overall system losses and hence its efficiency. Energy efficiency potential for <b>throttled</b> <b>systems</b> with centrifugal pumps is large and significant economical savings can be made through investments with short payback time...|$|R

5000|$|On February 8, 2011, the NHTSA, in {{collaboration}} with NASA, released its findings into the investigation on the Toyota drive-by-wire <b>throttle</b> <b>system.</b> After a 10-month search, NASA and NHTSA scientists found no electronic defect in Toyota vehicles. Driver error or pedal misapplication was found {{responsible for most of}} the incidents. The report ended stating, [...] "Our conclusion is Toyota's problems were mechanical, not electrical." [...] This included sticking accelerator pedals, and pedals caught under floor mats.|$|E
50|$|Airbus Industrie {{was aware}} of the {{automatic}} <b>throttle</b> <b>system</b> (ATS) malfunction. This defect could cause either the jamming of both throttles and ATS disconnection, or one throttle moving to idle while the other remained above climb power, without ATS disconnection. Investigators stated that the most probable cause of this malfunction was due to the excessive friction in the cinematic linkages between the throttle and the ATS coupling units. At the time of the accident, the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) issued by Airbus Industrie didn't include the procedures to cope with the anomaly. However, the FCOM issued by TAROM and Swissair did include these procedures.|$|E
5000|$|An all-new YZF-R1 for the 2007 {{model year}} was {{announced}} on 8 October 2006. It had an all-new inline four-cylinder engine, {{going back to}} a more conventional four-valves per cylinder, rather than Yamaha's trade mark five-valve Genesis layout. It also had the Yamaha Chip Control Intake (YCC-I) electronic variable-length intake funnel system, Yamaha Chip Control Throttle (YCC-T) fly-by-wire <b>throttle</b> <b>system,</b> slipper-type clutch, all-new aluminum Deltabox frame and swingarm, six-piston radial-mount front brake calipers with 310 mm discs, a wider radiator, and M1 styling on the new large ram-air ports in the front fairing.

50|$|IAI {{installed}} one PW1120 in {{the starboard}} nacelle of an F-4E-32-MC of the IDF/AF (Number 334/66-0327) {{to explore the}} airframe/powerplant combination for an upgrade program of the F-4E, known as Kurnass 2000 ("Heavy Hammer") or Super Phantom and {{to act as an}} engine testbed for the Lavi. The powerplant was more powerful, and more fuel efficient than the General Electric J79-GE-17 turbojet normally installed in the F-4E. The structural changes included modifying the air inlet ducts, new powerplant attachment points, new or modified powerplant baydoors, new airframe mounted gearbox with integrated drive generators and automatic <b>throttle</b> <b>system.</b> It also included a modified bleed management and air-conditioning ducting system, modified fuel and hydraulic systems, and a powerplant control/airframe interface. It was first flown on 30 July 1986.|$|E
50|$|However, on October 24, 2013, a jury {{ruled against}} Toyota {{and found that}} {{unintended}} acceleration could have been caused due to deficiencies in the drive-by-wire <b>throttle</b> <b>system</b> or Electronic Throttle Control System (ETCS). Michael Barr of the Barr Group testified that NASA {{had not been able}} to complete its examination of Toyota's ETCS and that Toyota did not follow best practices for real time life critical software, and that a single bit flip which can be caused by cosmic rays could cause unintended acceleration. As well, the run-time stack of the real-time operating system was not large enough and that it was possible for the stack to grow large enough to overwrite data that could cause unintended acceleration. As a result, Toyota has entered into settlement talks with its plaintiffs.|$|E
50|$|The engine, {{known as}} Galileo, {{spent three years}} in {{development}} prior to MG Rover Group’s collapse in 2005. To be used across the MG Rover Group range of cars, {{with the exception of}} the TF sports car, the new engine’s targets were to emulate the BMW M47R in power, torque and refinement and meet Euro 4 emissions compliance.To achieve these targets, MG Rover Group engineers introduced a new cylinder head, valves, pistons and a Siemens engine management system using a common-rail system equipped with the latest injector technology available at the time to the L-Series’ existing architecture, carrying over the cylinder block and sump. A new acoustic engine cover was designed for the engine. The <b>throttle</b> <b>system</b> was redesigned and relocated from the engine bay to the top of the throttle pedal. However, due to ongoing throttle calibration throughout development, the engine was reportedly hard to start in cold conditions. Engineers let the engine warm up before using it.|$|E

5000|$|On November 25, 2009, ABC News quoted Sean Kane, head of {{the for-profit}} firm Safety Research & Strategies, stating that he had {{uncovered}} hundreds of [...] "non-floor mat sudden acceleration cases" [...] which the floor mat recall did not address. Kane, who works with attorneys suing Toyota, said his firm had discovered over 2,000 Toyota sudden acceleration cases involving 16 deaths and 243 injuries, publishing its most comprehensive report on the issue on Feb 5th, 2010. Kane alleged that the problem was not with the accelerator pedals, but with the electronic <b>throttle</b> control <b>systems</b> (ETC). [...] An electronic <b>throttle</b> control <b>system</b> is a drive-by-wire system, in which the accelerator pedal and the engine are indirectly linked electronically, instead of directly linked mechanically. This means that input from the accelerator pedal is just one input used to decide how wide the throttle is opened. On Feb 13, 2010, The Wall Street Journal reported that Kane's company was [...] "controversial" [...] because its income comes from lawsuits against auto manufacturers, which was not disclosed in media reports; auto journalists noted that the firm had a [...] "vested interest" [...] in blaming manufacturer defects while avoiding operator error. The Los Angeles Times reported that since Toyota and Lexus began installing electronic <b>throttle</b> control <b>systems</b> in 2001, complaints of unintended acceleration with vehicles from both those brands rose sharply. Electromagnetic interference with the electronic <b>throttle</b> control <b>system</b> is another possible cause of unintended acceleration. Some speculated that cosmic rays, or radiation from outer space, was a possible source for alleged electronic malfunctions.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is called}} [...] "Flight Stick EX" [...] in Japan. It {{is very similar}} to the Saitek X45 HOTAS {{joystick}} / <b>throttle</b> <b>system</b> popular with PC flight simulation players. The throttle unit is identical, while the control column is slightly different (likely to better accommodate Xbox button maps). The top of the X45 stick featured two 8-way hat switches, one on the left and one at the bottom, and three thumb buttons above them with one under a safety cover; the Ace Edge retains the left 8-way hat switch, but swaps the positions of the thumb buttons and the second hat switch, with three of the Xbox controller's four main buttons in a rearranged order (Y, B and X, left to right, A being the trigger) below an analog mini-stick rather than a second hat switch. The stick also featured both a flexible sleeve over the shaft and spring, and a wrist pad, neither present on the Saitek X45.|$|E
5000|$|The {{car was a}} {{huge success}} in Japan, and {{featured}} in the best sellers chart regularly, no mean feat for an MPV. The Toyota Wish was updated {{at the end of}} 2005 with the introduction of a facelifted model. The original car was fundamentally well designed and that meant that few changes were necessary. Cosmetic changes to the headlights, bumpers, LED tail-lights and dashboard were made, together with revised switchgear for the climate control and automatic transmission (The 2.0Z received a seven-gear transmission.) As the changes were minor the fuel consumption figures, which are the best in the compact MPV class, remain the same. The 2005 Wish was also the third model to be sold exclusively through Toyota's NETZ dealer network, hence the replacement of the Wish's signature [...] "W" [...] front emblem with a generic NETZ oval (As seen on the 2005 Vitz & Ist.). Feedback on the electronic throttle control has been mixed, with claims that the original <b>throttle</b> <b>system</b> used in the 2003 car is quicker off the mark. The drivetrain and engines remained the same.|$|E
5000|$|The {{nameplates}} FX35 and FX45 {{refer to}} the two available engines. The FX35 is available in two drivetrains, the RWD and the AWD, which are both fitted to a dual overhead cam 3.5-liter 24-valve V6 VQ35DE gasoline engine, with aluminum-alloy block and heads, electronically controlled <b>throttle</b> <b>system,</b> and low-friction molybdenum-coated pistons that makes use of the continuous variable valve timing which in part optimizes the opening of intake valves. This is also coupled with an electronically controlled super-wide ratio five-speed automatic with a manumatic shift mode that includes the option of sequentially selected manual gearshifts and downshift rev matching.The FX45 incorporates a 4.5-liter (4,494 cc) 32-valve V8 DOHC VK45DE gasoline engine with four valves per cylinder, microfinished camshafts with aluminum-alloy block and heads, low-friction molybdenum-coated pistons, titanium intake and exhaust valves, modular cylinder heads, microfinished crankshaft, lightweight pistons, super-silent single stage cam drive chain, and a Continuously Variable Valve Timing Control System that optimizes opening of intake valves. Development began in 1999 under newly appointed CEO Carlos Ghosn's NRP. Design work was completed in rapid succession in 2000, for late 2002 production. Designed prior to that, earlier on in 2000 under the [...] "Bionic Cheetah" [...] theme, the 2001 Infiniti FX45 Concept was introduced at the NAIAS in January 2001. From mid-2001, a new concept based on the production design was developed and completed in late 2001. Sketches were first released in late November 2001. The second-generation 2002 FX45 Concept was introduced in January 2002 at the NAIAS '02 as a thinly-veiled production FX (S50) and planned production was announced for early 2003. In January 2003, the 2003 FX45 made its debut at the 2003 NAIAS and went on sale January 24, 2003.|$|E
