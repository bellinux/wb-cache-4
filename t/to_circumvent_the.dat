5|$|A scheme <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> settler grants {{altogether}} soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A. Douglas Puter {{to round}} up people from Portland saloons, and then {{take them to the}} land office where they would register for an O parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E

50|$|In theory, it is {{possible}} to bypass all these measures by constructing a player that creates a copy of every frame and sound it plays. Although this is not within the capability of most people, many bootleggers simply record the video being displayed with a video camera or use recording and playing devices that are not designed to use the protection measures. In fact, the Motion Picture Association of America has recommended use of a camcorder as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>circumventing</b> <b>the</b> Content Scrambling System on DVDs.|$|R
5|$|Browning, Gyles' attorney, cited a case {{which had}} also {{appeared}} before Hardwicke, that of Read v Hodges. In that case, a publisher attempted <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> {{rights of the}} author of Czar Peter the Great by including all three volumes in one and cutting several pages. Hardwicke rejected the argument, however, declaring that the former case had been decided merely on a motion, {{and that he had}} given his decision and statements without the thought he would have given a normal hearing. Hardwicke further took contention with the Attorney General for England and Wales' assertion that the Statute of Anne provided a publishing monopoly, instead interpreting the act as one meant to promote public education and the public good.|$|E

His grandfather attempted to negotiate a £500 signing-on fee on his behalf but was rebuffed after the club alerted Charles Sutcliffe, Secretary of the Football League, who informed them that any attempt <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> league's maximum wage was illegal. Lawton scored in his first appearance since signing the contract after just 30 seconds, before going on to record a hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a goal with either foot and one with his head.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Thai government’s {{department}} of irrigation met {{the demands of}} Living River Siam and the Assembly of the Poor with a promise to halt all future dam projects, which was accepted with cautious optimism. <b>To</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> issue of domestic damming, in 2007 the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) announced {{plans to build a}} series of dams on Burma's Salween River along its border with Thailand. Living River Siam opposed this plan, citing the threat of environmental destruction in Burma's Shan, Karenni, and Karen states as well as Mae Hong Son Province.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner {{also changed}} the {{extradition}} policy, allowing extradition for people prosecuted abroad and not facing charges in Argentina. He also supported the requests by {{human rights organizations}} to turn the former detention centers into memorials for the disappeared. Argentina became a signatory of the UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in 2003. A creative interpretation of the convention by the courts allowed them <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> statutory limitations to crimes committed decades in the past, and also the ex post facto applicability of laws that were not in force {{at the time of}} the crimes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sequence}} alignment {{and protein}} structure alignment algorithms {{have been developed}} assuming linear data representations and as such {{are not able to}} detect circular permutations between proteins. Two examples of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are dynamic programming and many hidden Markov models. As an alternative to these, a number of algorithms are built on top of non-linear approaches and are able to detect topology-independent similarities, or employ modifications allowing them <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> limitations of dynamic programming. The table below is a collection of such methods.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September, XXXVI Corps {{launched}} a frontal assault against the Soviet fortifications but made only slow progress. XXXVI Corps attempted another flanking attack similar to Kayrela, with one German regiment trying <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> Soviet defenses in the south. This time {{it did not}} work as well, and the German effort bogged down against heavy resistance. After days of fighting, the Germans were finally able to push behind the Voyta River only to be confronted by another even stronger Soviet defense line. The so-called VL or Verman Line stretched from Lake Verkhneye Verman to Lake Tolvand and included heavy Soviet pre-war fortifications.|$|E

5|$|Several days later, on September 2, the Canucks {{announced}} that they had signed Luongo to a 12-year contract extension worth $64million for a $5.33million annual salary cap hit. The front-loaded deal, which will expire by the time Luongo is 43 and includes a no-trade clause, sees him make $10million in 2010–11, then approximately $6.7million annually through to 2017–18, $3.3million and $1.6million the subsequent two seasons, before tailing off to $1million for the final two years. The contract contains two additional clauses <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> no-trade clause that allow Luongo to facilitate a trade after the fifth year and for the Canucks to also facilitate a trade after the seventh year.|$|E
5|$|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom {{satisfied}} both {{of these}} categories. Aside from the original arcade version, the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum system had released ports of the arcade game in 1987. By December 1988, the Nintendo Entertainment System had already seen two separate editions of the Temple of Doom game. The first version, distributed by Tengen, came in a black cartridge that was different from Nintendo's traditional grey colour format. By this point, however, Tengen had split from Nintendo and was producing unlicensed games that attempted <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> need for a 10NES lockout chip. Nintendo filed suit and Tengen lost, forcing it to remove its NES games from the market. The officially licensed version was released by Mindscape {{in the form of}} a standard Nintendo cartridge. Aside from the differences in cover art and cartridge form, however, the actual software of the two games is identical. After the NES version, the game was subsequently released for Atari ST and MSX in 1987, and Amiga, DOS, and Apple in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{most loyal}} subject was John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. The duke had served Richard's brother {{for many years}} and had been one of Edward IV's closer confidants. He was a {{military}} veteran, having fought in the Battle of Towton in 1461 and served as Hastings' deputy at Calais in 1471. Ross speculates that he may have borne a grudge against Edward for depriving him of a fortune. Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old Anne de Mowbray, the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament <b>to</b> <b>circumvent</b> <b>the</b> law of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne. Consequently, Howard supported Richard III in deposing Edward's sons, for which he received the dukedom of Norfolk and his original share of the Mowbray estate.|$|E
40|$|The failure {{properties}} of rubbery networks exhibit a maximum {{as a function}} of cross-link density or modulus. To avoid excess creep, elastomers are usually formulated such that their state of cure falls past this maximum, which means there is an inevitable compromise between modulus and failure properties (stiffness and strength). This review describes various approaches <b>to</b> <b>circumventing</b> <b>the</b> problem by the use of unconventional network structures. The obtainable improvements in mechanical properties can be substantial (e. g., threefold increases or greater in strength), although these methods entail additional processing steps or the use of blends and may affect the hysteresis of an elastomer; thus, their practical utility cannot be assessed a priori.
