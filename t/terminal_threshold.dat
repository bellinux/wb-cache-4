5000|$|Experimental Psychology: For {{most of his}} career, Weber {{worked with}} his brothers, Wilhelm and Eduard, and partner Gustav Theodor Fechner. Throughout these working relationships, Weber {{completed}} research on the central nervous system, auditory system, anatomy and function of brain, circulation, etc., and {{a large portion of}} research on sensory physiology and psychology. The following items are part of Weber’s contributions the experimental psychology: Experimental Wave Theory: studied flow and movement of waves in liquids and elastic tubes. Hydrodynamics: discovered laws and applied them to circulation. in 1821, Weber launched a series of experiments on the physics of fluids in 1821 with his younger brother Wilhelm. This research was the first detailed account of hydrodynamic principles in the circulation of blood. Weber continued his research on blood and in 1827, he made another significant finding. Weber explained the elasticity of blood vessels in the movement of blood in the aorta in a continuous flow to the capillaries and arterioles. [...] Two-point Threshold Technique: helped map sensitivity and touch acuity on the body using compass technique. Points of a compass would be set at varying distances in order to see at what distance are the points of the compass perceived as two separate points instead of one single point. [...] Weber also wrote about and tested other ideas on sensation including a <b>terminal</b> <b>threshold,</b> which is the highest intensity an individual could sense before the sensation could not be detected any longer. Weber’s Illusion: an [...] "experience of divergence of two points when stimulation is moved over insensitive areas and convergence of two points when moved over sensitive areas". Weber’s use of multivariate experiment, precise measurements, and research on sensory psychology and sensory physiology laid the groundwork for accepting experimental psychology as a field and providing new ideas for fellow 19th century psychologists to expand.|$|E

And another approach is to detect the <b>terminal</b> voltage <b>threshold</b> of converters under harmonic distortions. But voltage protection schemes are recommended {{to be used as}} back-up ones because sometimes dynamic loads would fail the accuracy of voltage detection.

The method used micro-electrode stimulation within the dorsal horn and the recording on a distant dorsal root filament of the antidromic action potentials evoked by the stimulation of axons within the spinal cord. 2. It was found that all filaments examined in the L 2, 3 and 4 dorsal roots contained axons which projected {{at least as far}} as the S 1 segment. The axons descended in or near the dorsal columns and from there penetrated into the grey matter. 3. The course of single fibres was followed to their apparent <b>terminals.</b> <b>Thresholds,</b> latencies and relative and absolute refractory periods were measured for single axons. These measurements confirmed that continuous axons ran from dorsal roots to distant segments and that the action potentials recorded were not dorsal root reflexes. 4. The majority of fibres with long range central arborizations were shown to have normal receptive fields in the dermatome of their parent dorsal root. They were not aberrant fibres leaving the spinal cord. 5. The long range afferents exist in substantial numbers since fifteen of eighty axons isolated by micro-electrode recording in the L 2 dorsal root sent their axons as far as the S 1 segment. The presence of these afferents from five segments away does not fit the data published on the inhibitory and excitatory receptive fields or dorsal horn cells which appear adequately explained by afferents arriving over nearby dorsal roots up to two segments away...|$|R

40|$|Opportunistic {{detection}} rules (ODRs) are {{variants of}} fixed-sample-size detection rules {{in which the}} statistician is allowed to make an early decision on the alternative hypothesis opportunistically based on the sequentially observed samples. From a sequential decision perspective, ODRs are also mixtures of one-sided and truncated sequential detection rules. Several results regarding ODRs are established in this paper. In the finite regime, the maximum sample size is modeled either as a fixed finite number, or a geometric random variable with a fixed finite mean. For both cases, the corresponding Bayesian formulations are investigated. The former case is a slight variation of the well-known finite-length sequential hypothesis testing procedure in the literature, whereas the latter case is new, for which the Bayesian optimal ODR is {{shown to be a}} sequence of likelihood ratio threshold tests with two different thresholds: a running threshold, which is determined by solving a stationary state equation, is used when future samples are still available, and a <b>terminal</b> <b>threshold</b> (simply the ratio between the priors scaled by costs) is used when the statistician reaches the final sample and thus has to make a decision immediately. In the asymptotic regime, the tradeoff among the exponents of the (false alarm and miss) error probabilities and the normalized expected stopping time under the alternative hypothesis is completely characterized and proved to be tight, via an information-theoretic argument. Within the tradeoff region, one noteworthy fact is that the performance of the Stein-Chernoff Lemma is attainable by ODRs...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 A lexicon {{describing}} the sensory perception of carbonated water was developed. Temporal aspects and differing ingestion conditions were investigated for Bite and Burn sensation using time-intensity (T-I). Four CO₂ levels (0, 1. 7, 2. 8, and 4. 6 volumes) at 3 °C and 10 °C were tested. Trained panelists used a 16 -pt category scale for evaluation {{in the first}} study. One swallow (15 ml) and four continuous swallows were evaluated by trained subjects using T-I in the subsequent studies. Lexicon included: salty, sour, bitter, cooling, astringency, bubbly, bubble size, bubble sound, gas expansion feeling, bite, burn, and numbing. Descriptor ratings, except cooling, increased as CO₂ level increased. Bubble size and bubble sound were rated higher for 10 °C. Cooling, bite, burn, and numbing were rated higher for 3 °C. Descriptors were divided into cooling, taste (salty, sour, bitter, astringency), trigeminal (bite, burn, and numbing), and mechanoreception descriptors (bubbly, bubble size, bubble sound, gas expansion feeling) based on PCA. Average temporal curves for Bite and Burn demonstrated that Burn sensation (steep linear rise and long-lived exponential decay slope) was similar to previously investigated irritants while Bite (steep linear rise and decay slopes, and relatively short duration) was unlike other irritants. Sensations were qualitatively and quantitatively different. Intensity and duration of Bite and Burn were concentration dependent. Cold temperature enhanced perception. Possible psychological habituation or desensitization was observed. Most T-I parameters were correlated for both Bite and Burn. These included CO₂ level dependent and CO₂ level independent parameters. Considerable subject variability was found. Increased exposure to CO₂ solution and increased cooling with ingestion of four continuous swallows was compared to one swallow. T-I curves for Bite (four swallows) were of higher intensity, longer duration, and developed maximum intensity plateaus. Those for Burn exhibited higher maximum intensities. At four swallows, T-I parameter correlations were strengthened, subject variability reduced and replication reproducibility improved by ease of rating afforded subjects by higher intensity sensations. Increased oral CO₂ perception with higher CO₂ levels and enhancement by cold temperature was reconfirmed. Beginnings of maximum intensity, Duration, and reaction time perceptual <b>terminal</b> <b>thresholds</b> were seen for the highest 3 °C, CO₂ level. High CO₂ concentration, cold temperature, and exposure time induced these effects...|$|R
30|$|The {{authors in}} [8] propose another dynamic {{hierarchical}} mobility management scheme for MIPv 4 networks. In this scheme, when an MN changes its subnet and obtains a new CoA {{from the new}} FA, the new FA updates the new address to the MN's previous FA so that the new FA forms a new location management hierarchical level for that user. Packets to be delivered to the MN can be tunneled via the multiple levels of FAs. In order to avoid long packet delivery delays, there is an optimal level number for the hierarchy for each user according to his/her call-to-mobility ratio. The threshold can be dynamically adjusted based on the up-to-date mobility and traffic load for each <b>terminal.</b> When the <b>threshold</b> is reached, the MN performs a home registration and sets up a new hierarchy for its further movements.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Strained carrot quality is impacted by color degradation and flavor changes. Maceration, followed by heating in open holding tanks may cause chemical changes that lead to brown color formation. Processing carrots in low oxygen environments may result in better color and flavor retention after processing and during storage. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate mechanisms for loss of strained carrot quality and to determine chemical attributes responsible for improved carrot color and flavor. Chemical and sensory attributes were evaluated for ten genotypes. Additional thermal processing treatments included a control (21 % 02) nitrogen (N 2) sparge, blanch/freeze/nitrogen sparge (BFN 2), oxygen (02) sparge and glucose oxidase-catalase (GOC). Samples were stored for various times and temperatures and monitored periodically for chemical and sensory attributes. Changes in color, soluble phenolics, carotenoids, molecular weight, sugars and pH were measured during storage. Sensory attributes were monitored in samples spiked with various concentrations of 6 -methoxymellein (6 -NM) to determine how this stress induced metabolite affects carrot quality. Phenolic polymerization due to autoxidation was associated with color loss in strained carrots. Declines in pH, soluble phenolics and total carotenoids all correlated with decreased chroma values. Significant losses in color, phenolics and carotenoids were found in the control and O 2 sparged samples compared to N 2 sparged and BFN 2 samples. Molecular weight of phenolic compounds was lower in nitrogen sparged samples than oxygen sparged samples. Sucrose values were slightly higher in BFN 2 and N 2 sparged samples while changes in glucose and fructose were not significant. Oxygen control strategies improved overall color of strained carrots. Genotypic evaluation indicated that pre-harvest stress induced formation of phytoalexins was detrimental to sensory quality. Addition of the phytoalexin 6 -@ to commercial strained carrots resulted in a just noticeable difference at 48. 4 - 71. 0 ppm, a 93. 7 ppm recognition threshold and a <b>terminal</b> <b>threshold</b> at > 180 ppm for bitterness.

40|$|Development of {{algorithms}} {{and growth}} of computational resources in the past decades have enabled simulations of sediment transport processes with unprecedented fidelities. The Computational Fluid Dynamics [...] Discrete Element Method (CFD [...] DEM) {{is one of the}} high-fidelity approaches, where the motions of and collisions among the sediment grains as well as their interactions with surrounding fluids are resolved. In most DEM solvers the particles are modeled as soft spheres due to computational efficiency and implementation complexity considerations, although natural sediments are usually mixture of non-spherical particles. Previous attempts to extend sphere-based DEM to treat irregular particles neglected fluid-induced torques on particles, and the method lacked flexibility to handle sediments with an arbitrary mixture of particle shapes. In this contribution we proposed a simple, efficient approach to represent common sediment grain shapes with bonded spheres, where the fluid forces are computed and applied on each sphere. The proposed approach overcomes the aforementioned limitations of existing methods and has improved efficiency and flexibility over existing approaches. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate the merits and capability of the proposed method in predicting the falling characteristics, <b>terminal</b> velocity, <b>threshold</b> of incipient motion, and transport rate of natural sediments. The simulations show that the proposed method is a promising approach for faithful representation of natural sediment, which leads to accurate simulations of their transport dynamics. The proposed method also opens the possibility for first-principle-based simulations of the flocculation and sedimentation dynamics of cohesive sediments. Elucidation of these physical mechanisms can provide much needed improvement on the prediction capability and physical understanding of muddy coast dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Background Presynaptic GABA A receptors (GABA A Rs) {{located on}} central <b>terminals</b> of low <b>threshold</b> afferent fibers {{are thought to}} be {{involved}} in the processing of touch and possibly in the generation of tactile allodynia in chronic pain. These GABA A Rs mediate primary afferent depolarization (PAD) and modulate transmitter release. The objective of this study was to expand our understanding of the presynaptic inhibitory action of GABA released onto primary afferent central terminals following afferent stimulation. Results We recorded evoked postsynaptic excitatory responses (eEPSCs and eEPSPs) from lamina III/IV neurons in spinal cord slices from juvenile rats (P 17 –P 23, either sex), while stimulating dorsal roots. We investigated time and activity dependent changes in glutamate release from low threshold A fibers and the impact of these changes on excitatory drive. Blockade of GABA A Rs by gabazine potentiated the second eEPSC during a train of four afferent stimuli in a large subset of synapses. This resulted in a corresponding increase of action potential firing after the second stimulus. The potentiating effect of gabazine was due to inhibition of endogenously activated presynaptic GABA A Rs, because it was not prevented by the blockade of postsynaptic GABA A Rs through intracellular perfusion of CsF. Exogenous activation of presynaptic GABA A Rs by muscimol depressed evoked glutamate release at all synapses and increased paired pulse ratio (PPR). Conclusions These observations suggest that afferent driven release of GABA onto low <b>threshold</b> afferent <b>terminals</b> is most effective following the first action potential in a train and serves to suppress the initial strong excitatory drive onto dorsal horn circuitry...|$|R
40|$|Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is a {{significant}} side effect of chemotherapeutic agents and {{is the most common}} reason for stopping chemotherapy. The aim {{of the present study was}} to find the major site and mechanisms of action by which rolipram, a selective phosphodiesterase- 4 inhibitor, alleviates paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel on four alternate days. Rolipram was administered systemically or locally into the lumbar spinal cord, L 5 dorsal root ganglion, sciatic nerve, or skin nerve <b>terminal.</b> The mechanical <b>threshold,</b> the protein level of several inflammatory cytokines, and the cellular locations of phosphodiesterase- 4 and interleukin- 1 β in the dorsal root ganglion were measured by using behavioral testing, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The local administration (0. 03 -mg) of rolipram in the L 5 dorsal root ganglion ameliorated paclitaxel-induced pain behavior more effectively than did local administration in the other sites. Paclitaxel significantly increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (2. 2 times) and interleukin- 1 β (2. 7 times) in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion, and rolipram significantly decreased it. In addition, phosphodiesterase- 4 and interleukin- 1 β were expressed in the dorsal root ganglion neurons and satellite cells and paclitaxel significantly increased the intensity of interleukin- 1 β (2 times) and rolipram significantly decreased it. These results suggest that the major site of action of rolipram on paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain in rats was the dorsal root ganglion. Rolipram decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the dorsal root ganglion. Thus, phosphodiesterase- 4 inhibitors may ameliorate chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain by decreasing expression of inflammatory cytokines in the dorsal root ganglion...|$|R

There is extensive evidence for localisation of Kv 1 subunits at many central synaptic terminals but few clues to their presynaptic function. We {{have used the}} calyx of Held to investigate the role of presynaptic Kv 1 channels in the rat by selectively blocking Kv 1. 1 and Kv 1. 2 containing channels with dendrotoxin-K (DTX-K) and tityustoxin-Kα (TsTX-Kα) respectively. We show that Kv 1. 2 homomers are responsible for two-thirds of presynaptic low threshold current, whilst Kv 1. 1 /Kv 1. 2 heteromers contribute the remaining current. These channels {{are located in the}} transition zone between the axon and synaptic terminal, contrasting with the high threshold K+ channel subunit Kv 3. 1 which is located on the synaptic terminal itself. Kv 1 homomers were absent from bushy cell somata (from which the calyx axons arise); instead somatic low threshold channels consisted of heteromers containing Kv 1. 1, Kv 1. 2 and Kv 1. 6 subunits. Current-clamp recording from the calyx showed that each presynaptic action potential (AP) was followed by a depolarising after-potential (DAP) lasting around 50 ms. Kv 1. 1 /Kv 1. 2 heteromers had little influence on terminal excitability, since DTX-K did not alter AP firing. However TsTX-Kα increased DAP amplitude, bringing the <b>terminal</b> closer to <b>threshold</b> for generating an additional AP. Paired pre- and postsynaptic recordings confirmed that this aberrant AP evoked an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). We conclude that Kv 1. 2 channels have a general presynaptic function in suppressing terminal hyperexcitability during the depolarising after-potential...|$|R
