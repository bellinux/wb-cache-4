50|$|Mentsen {{was born}} in Ballangen, Ofoten. He was a <b>timberer</b> by {{education}} and occupation, but soon joined trade union and the Norwegian Labour Party in Narvik. He became sectretary of the trade union (Samorg) in Finmark in 1936 and worked at the Tromsø office of Confederation of Trade Unions from 1940. In 1946 he was elected secretary of the Confederation of Trade Unions with office in Oslo.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} <b>timber</b> {{entrepreneurs}} in Eastern Visayas and Metro Cebu {{has been conducted}} {{as part of the}} ACIAR Tree Farm Project to investigate the use, attitudes and preferences of <b>timber</b> entrepreneurs for smallholder <b>timber.</b> It was found that gmelina and mahogany are widely used by <b>timber</b> enterprises in the study area. The majority of <b>timber</b> enterprises obtain most of their <b>timber</b> requirement from <b>timber</b> dealers while some obtain <b>timber</b> directly from tree farmers. Smallholder <b>timber,</b> e. g. gmelina and mahogany, are found to be suitable for <b>timber</b> businesses but current government regulation concerning harvest and transport, declining <b>timber</b> resources and a poor <b>timber</b> market are some of the problems affecting the use of smallholder <b>timber</b> in <b>timber</b> enterprises...|$|R

The parapet consists of <b>timber</b> pilasters and deep <b>timber</b> cornices, {{with much of}} the original fanciful <b>timber</b> work including pediment, finials and scrolls having been removed. The verandah has paired <b>timber</b> posts, a panelled frieze with <b>timber</b> mouldings, a <b>timber</b> rail supported by scroll shaped brackets, and wide <b>timber</b> entrance steps. The twin entrance doors with fanlight are framed by <b>timber</b> pilasters, and the paired <b>timber</b> sashes to either side have wide <b>timber</b> surrounds with deep cornices above.|$|R

A second arch is located separating the front section of the hallway from the rear, and has pronounced <b>timber</b> imposts, extrados and keystone. The rear of the hallway has a panelled <b>timber</b> door with sidelights and fanlight with leadlight panels, leading to the rear landing.|$|R
30|$|The {{bending test}} results showed no {{significance}} at the 5  % significance level on average regarding the Young’s modulus {{obtained by the}} longitudinal vibration method, and the apparent Young’s modulus for green round <b>timbers</b> and air-dried round <b>timbers.</b> Meanwhile, the average bending strength showed significant differences at the 5  % significance level between green round <b>timbers</b> and air-dried round <b>timbers.</b> When considering that the average for green round <b>timbers</b> would actually increase because the green round <b>timbers</b> included those that did not show failure, {{it was difficult to}} simply conclude that there were differences between green round <b>timbers</b> and air-dried round <b>timbers.</b> The 5  % PTL of bending strength was slightly higher for air-dried round <b>timbers</b> than green round <b>timbers,</b> although we should also consider the fact that the bending strength of green round <b>timbers</b> would actually increase.|$|R

50|$|The European Union <b>Timber</b> Regulation (EUTR) aims {{to counter}} illegal logging and {{associated}} trade in <b>timber</b> and <b>timber</b> {{products in the}} member states of the European Union, and ultimately contribute to sustainable management of forests and reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation beyond EU borders. The EUTR establishes obligations on 'operators' who place <b>timber</b> and <b>timber</b> {{products on the market}} and on 'traders' who buy or sell <b>timber</b> or <b>timber</b> products already on the internal market.|$|R
40|$|Prior to 1977, each {{county in}} California {{assessed}} all nonexempt standing <b>timber</b> for ad valorem taxation. Since {{the value of}} <b>timber</b> {{was added to the}} value of land and then taxed annually, property owners had an incentive to harvest trees to reduce their property taxes, thereby threatening to erode the <b>timber</b> base of California. Each forested county had to maintain a staff who established the values of standing <b>timber.</b> Owners of large <b>timber</b> properties were displeased with the variation in appraisal values that often occurred between counties and with the need to discuss values with county assessors in multiple counties. These owners strongly supported the centralized appraisal and determination of taxable value for <b>timber.</b> The Z'berg-Warren-Keene-Collier Forest Taxation Reform Act of 1976 dramatically changed the method of taxing <b>timber</b> in California. The Act encouraged the protection of immature trees and the continued use of timberlands for the production of trees for <b>timber</b> products, and provided restrictions on the use of timberland to the production of <b>timber</b> products and compatible uses. The Act, codified as the <b>Timber</b> Yield Tax Law, replaced the ad valorem tax on standing <b>timber</b> with a yield tax on felled <b>timber.</b> The resulting <b>timber</b> yield tax is imposed on every <b>timber</b> owner who harvests <b>timber</b> or causes it to be harvested...|$|R

If <b>timber</b> is of {{heterogeneous}} quality and <b>timber</b> pri ces reflect this heterogeneity, then charging a fixed stumpage rate per cubic meter of <b>timber</b> harvested independent of <b>timber</b> quality can induce the economically inefficient practice of harvesting only the best grades of <b>timber,</b> "high-grading.

50|$|<b>Timber</b> {{recycling}} or wood {{recycling is}} the process of turning waste <b>timber</b> into usable products. Recycling <b>timber</b> is a practice that was popularized in the early 1990s as issues such as deforestation and climate change prompted both <b>timber</b> suppliers and consumers to turn to a more sustainable <b>timber</b> source. Recycling <b>timber</b> is the environmentally friendliest form of <b>timber</b> production and is very common in countries such as Australia and New Zealand where supplies of old wooden structures are plentiful. <b>Timber</b> can be chipped down into wood chips which can be used to power homes or power plants.|$|R
