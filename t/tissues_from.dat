5|$|As Kupfer explains, Rehm did {{not justify}} why he {{believed}} Urnula craterium should be allied to Geopyxis, or why Podophacidium terrestre {{should be considered}} an Urnula. Kupfer's macro- and microscopic analysis of <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> these and related genera clearly showed the inconsistency in Rehm's taxonomical choices, and that Urnula craterium represented an entirely different genus not related to Geopyxis; Fries's naming was restored.|$|E
5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard <b>tissues</b> (<b>from</b> hardest to softest: enamel, dentin, and cementum), and an inner soft tissue core (the pulp system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by enamel) — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E

Further exposure of pituitary <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> gonad-ectomized steroid-pretreated male and female rats to LH-RH (5 ng/ml) induced an increase in the level of LH even greater than that seen after the initial exposure (priming action of LH-RH); in <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> ovariectomized rats receiving no pretreatment, less LH was released than after the first exposure to LH-RH and in <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> normal male rats the response was unchanged...|$|R
40|$|Mature-green tomato fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) {{were treated}} asymmetrically with 2 millimolar silver thiosulfate (STS) through a cut {{portion of the}} {{peduncle}} while still attached to the plant. One-half of the fruit received silver and remained green while the other half ripened normally and was silver-free (less than 0. 01 parts per billion). Harvested mature-green fruit were also treated with STS through the cut pedicel. Green <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> silver-treated fruit had levels of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC, the immediate ethylene precursor) slightly less or {{similar to that of}} turning or red-ripe <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> the same fruit, and similar to that of mature-green <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> control fruit. Ethylene production was higher in green <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> silver-treated fruit than <b>from</b> either red <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> the same fruit, or mature-green <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> control fruit. By inhibiting ACC synthesis with aminoethoxyvinyl glycine, and by applying ACC ± silver to excised disks of pericarp <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> control or silver-treated tomatoes, we showed that short-term silver treatment did not affect the biological conversion of ACC to ethylene, while long-term treatment stimulated both the conversion of ACC to ethylene and the synthesis of ACC...|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the idea that plants could {{synthesise}} almost all their <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> atmospheric gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would take many more years. Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between the pigment chlorophyll and starch production was finally made in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915.|$|E
5|$|Burnet was, however, {{unable to}} prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet's {{hypothesis}} in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite the rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.|$|E
5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the <b>tissues.</b> <b>From</b> this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to staining <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> treated subjects, {{positive and negative}} controls should be included to ensure method specificity and validity. Typically <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> untreated control subjects is included to show specificity for degenerating neurons as fluoro-jade should not stain non-degenerating tissue. Additionally, a positive control is included to ensure validity of staining procedures; to show that degenerating neurons will be stained with fluoro-jade. An acceptable positive control includes neurodegenerative <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> subjects where fluoro-jade has already been validated, such as kainic acid treated animals.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the association between}} alcohol consumption, GSTM 1 genotype, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) -DNA adduct levels in breast tissue. Women referred for breast surgery were enrolled prior to surgery, responded to an interview, and gave a blood sample. Women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal or lobular cancer were defined as cases, and women with benign conditions without atypia were defined as controls. Paraffin-embedded tumor and nontumor <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> cases and benign <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> controls were retrieved from the pathology samples. GSTM 1 genotype status was determined by PCR using WBC DNA, and PAH-DNA adduct levels were measured in breast tissue using immunohistochemistry. In tumor and nontumor <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> cases, the GSTM 1 -null genotype was associated with increased adduct levels among current alcohol consumers but not among nondrinkers. In nontumor tissue, the interaction between genotype and alcohol consumption was significant (P 0. 02), but in tumor tissue, the interaction did not achieve statistical significance (P 0. 10). In benign <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> controls, there was no association between genotype and adducts, regardless of drinking status. Among subjects with the null genotype who drank alcohol, adduct levels were significantly higher in tumor and nontumor <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> cases than in benign <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> controls. These results indicate {{the presence of a}} novel gene-lifestyle interaction that influences PAH-DNA adduct levels in breast <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> cases but not controls. This apparent difference in PAH metabolism in response to alcohol may be an important clue as to how alcohol influences breast cancer risk...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} whether the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in villous cytotrophoblast could distinguish between placental <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> a hydropic abortion and that from a partial hydatidiform mole. METHODS: <b>Tissue</b> <b>from</b> 18 partial hydatidiform moles, 15 hydropic abortions, five normal first trimester placentas and five normal full term placentas were immunostained for expression of PCNA, using the monoclonal antibody PC 10. RESULTS: PCNA immunoreactivity was very much higher in the cytotrophoblast of normal first trimester placentas than in normal term placentas. Villous <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> partial hydatidiform moles showed, on average, less immunoreactivity for PCNA than did villous <b>tissue</b> <b>from</b> hydropic abortions. CONCLUSIONS: Immunostaining for PCNA is of no value for differentiating between partial hydatidiform moles and hydropic abortions. The findings indicate that trophoblastic proliferation or hyperplasia is not a feature of partial hydatidiform moles...|$|R

25|$|Menopause {{occurs because}} of the sharp {{decrease}} of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries.

The substantial fall in circulating estradiol levels at menopause impacts many <b>tissues,</b> <b>from</b> brain to skin.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{angiogenesis}} and vascular remodelling is {{an important}} aspect of wound healing and the long-term stability of tissue grafts.

25|$|Upshaw–Schulman {{syndrome}} (USS) is the recessively inherited form of {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} (TTP), a {{rare and}} complex blood coagulation disease.

These obstructions deprive downstream <b>tissues</b> <b>from</b> blood and oxygen, which can result in tissue damage and death. The presentation of an acute USS episode is variable but usually associated with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) with schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear, fever and signs of ischemic organ damage in the brain, kidney and heart.|$|E
