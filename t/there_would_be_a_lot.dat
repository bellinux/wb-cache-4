Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the setting, {{part of the original}} concept for the show was that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of advanced technology similar to that seen in Star Trek, but it would be constantly malfunctioning. The automatic doors at Applied Cryogenics resemble those in however, they malfunction when Fry remarks on this similarity. In another twist, the two policemen who try to arrest Fry at the head museum use weapons which are visually similar to lightsabers used in the Star Wars film series; however, they are functionally more similar to nightsticks. The interaction between the characters was not overlooked. The relationship formed between Fry and Bender in this episode has been compared to the relationship between Will Robinson and the robot in Lost in Space.|$|E

Belle becomes trapped and her injuries have [...] "consequences that change their relationship" [...] forever. Lasance had previously been in caught up in a real house fire; he said the director of the episode [...] "milked" [...] the fictional situation to make it seem more dramatic than a real fire. He also stated that in the months following <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of [...] "tense moments" [...] between the pair. Aden and Belle can acknowledge what they have found in each other - so [...] "it would be hard to split them up". After the attack and fire, Belle refuses to leave the hospital, even with Aden supporting her, because it is the only place she [...] "feels secure". Belle is prescribed with painkillers to help combat her anxiety disorder. However she becomes addicted to them. Tovey said she does not want Aden to know because of the [...] "shame" [...] and she doesn't want him to know she has failed. She further explained that [...] "addicts withdraw from those around them - which is exactly what she is doing." ...|$|E

Prager wrote [...] "It is not I, but Keith Ellison, who has engaged in disuniting the country. He can still help reunite it by simply bringing both books to his ceremonial swearing-in.

[...] In a December 7, 2006 interview, Prager continued along these lines, saying [...] "I'm afraid we are becoming a diverse, secular society without any roots, and this is symbolically an example of that.

6000|$|He {{sat with}} {{compressed}} lips. The {{idea of going}} for news straight to the shop lacked charm. His notion was that Verloc’s shop might have been turned already into a police trap. They will be bound to make some arrests, he thought, with something resembling virtuous indignation, for the even tenor of his revolutionary life was menaced by no fault of his. And yet unless he went there he ran the risk of remaining in ignorance of what {{perhaps it would be}} very material for him to know. Then he reflected that, if the man in the park had been so very much blown to pieces as the evening papers said, he could not have been identified. And if so, the police could have no special reason for watching Verloc’s shop more closely than any other place known to be frequented by marked anarchists—no more reason, in fact, than for watching the doors of the Silenus. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of watching all round, no matter where he went.
