5|$|On 3 April 1970, a B-52D {{assigned}} to the 28th Bomb Wing caught fire and crashed while landing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota; sliding {{to a halt and}} burning atop a 25,000 gallon fuel storage tank. Efforts by fire department personnel saved the 9 man crew and prevented a catastrophic explosion of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} investigation conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), the crash {{was caused by a}} metallic strip that fell from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.|$|E
50|$|Halon 1301 is {{also used}} in the F-16 fighter to prevent <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> vapors in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> from {{becoming}} explosive; when the aircraft enters an area {{with the possibility of}} attack, Halon 1301 is injected into <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> for one-time use. Due to environmental concerns, trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) is being considered as an alternative.|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} stages of {{emptying}} <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks,</b> it was estimated that they would be empty after a 40-minute burn on 2 September 2011. However, the spacecraft survived both this maneuver and a second 40-minute burn on 3 September. On 5 September a third burn was initiated and <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> were finally drained.|$|R
5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met {{their need for}} a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. <b>The</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. <b>The</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E

25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to facilitate the}} use of biodiesel in cold conditions is by employing a second <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> for biodiesel in addition to <b>the</b> standard diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> can be insulated and a heating coil using engine coolant is run through <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> can be switched over when <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> is sufficiently warm. A similar method {{can be used to}} operate diesel vehicles using straight vegetable oil.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{lessons learned}} in the Vietnam War, the use of Halon 1301 began in the F-16 fighter {{aircraft}} to prevent vapors in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> from becoming explosive. Upon entering areas with possible unfriendly fire, Halon 1301 is injected into <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> for one-time use. Due to environmental concerns, trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) is being considered as an alternative.|$|R
5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|No. 80 Squadron was re-equipped with newer model Hawker Hurricane Mk Is on 20 February 1941. That day, Pattle, flying Hurricane Mk I V7724, {{was leading}} {{a group of}} six Hurricanes escorting 16 Blenheim light bombers — eight from No. 84 Squadron RAF, six from No. 211 Squadron and three from No. 30 Squadron RAF—to Berat. Fiat G.50bis from the 361a and 395a Squadriglia, 154° Autonomo Gruppo were {{scrambled}} from Berat airfield, but they were attacked by the higher altitude Hurricanes. Pattle led his section straight towards four Fiat G.50s and selected the leading aircraft as his own target. It {{was the first time}} he had fired the eight guns of the Hurricane, and the G.50 exploded. The Fiat G.50 was from 154° Gruppo and it was the first Hurricane victory that Pattle would claim. Tenente Livio Bassi was killed in this battle. Another CR.42 fell to Pattle on 27 February 1941 — his 17th victory. His Hurricane sustained a bullet hole in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, if {{the liquid}} propane in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> is too cold (0 °C/32 °F or less) {{it does not}} {{generate}} sufficient vapor pressure to adequately feed the burner(s). This can be overcome by charging <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> with inert gas such as nitrogen or by warming them, with electric heat tapes for example, and insulating them against the cold.|$|R
50|$|Hydrogen from <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> enters <b>the</b> compressor, which {{compresses}} the gas {{in preparation}} for <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> cell process.|$|R

5|$|One {{young man}} kicked and smashed {{the window of}} a police car, lit a pack of matches, and set the {{upholstery}} on fire. After burning for a short time, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> exploded; a dozen more police cars and eight other automobiles would be destroyed in a similar fashion. The photo on the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break out, with one mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their overhead wires were pulled down, and violence broke out against the police officers, who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This {{was the first}} launch delay in the Apollo program due to a {{technical}} problem. During the delay, the space suits, a spacecraft separation mechanism and batteries in the Lunar Module (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the Command Module (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations in {{the capacity of the}} Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a routine test. The rocket was returned to the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) and <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> replaced, and the rocket returned to the launch pad in February in time for the scheduled launch.|$|E
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. <b>The</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} a fast motion night view of several skyscrapers located in Houston. It {{transitions}} to quick looks of various houses and people. Scenes filmed at the SLAB parade, an annual celebration of car culture in Houston were also featured in the clip set in slow motion. Houston residents posing for the camera are featured throughout the video as well as scenes of children playing football. During several scenes, Beyoncé is seen lip-syncing the song wearing a white-hooded fur mink coat and a matching one piece {{in front of a}} tumbledown house holding a pit bull on a leash. This scene was filmed in the suburb of Brunswick, during her Melbourne, Australia part of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and is the only scene from the music video, to be filmed outside of Houston.

Beyoncé also appears at a gas station filling <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> of a car and later goes to the streets in it.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users are not aware they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, {{and even though the}} newer models have a yellow cap in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users are still not aware because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E
5|$|Brains pilots {{the plane}} {{onto the top}} deck but is confronted by Foster and his two {{surviving}} associates. Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit, Foster intends to abandon the others, but Alan shoots and kills Foster. The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all hanging on to either the wings or undercarriage, just before Skyship One crashes {{to the ground and}} obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction. A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading them to believe he never made it off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he was caught up in a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Further, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> have {{a maximum}} capacity. On some occasions, {{commercial}} flight planning systems find that an impossible flight {{plan has been}} requested. The aircraft cannot possibly reach the intended destination, even with no cargo or passengers, since <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> are not {{big enough to hold}} <b>the</b> amount of <b>fuel</b> needed; it would appear that some airlines are over-optimistic at times, perhaps hoping for a (very) strong tailwind.|$|R

50|$|It {{was also}} found that the Dateline report was dishonest about <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> rupturing and <b>the</b> alleged 30 mph (48 km/h) speed at which the {{collision}} was conducted. The actual speed was found to be higher, around 40 mph (64 km/h), and after x-ray examination of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> from <b>the</b> C/K pickups used in the staged collision, it was discovered they had not ruptured and were intact.|$|R
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. <b>The</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E
