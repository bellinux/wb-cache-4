He had agents go through historical documents and photos in order to attempt to erase Trotsky's memory from the history books. According to the historian Mario Kessler, Stalin's supporters turned to anti-semitism <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> sentiment against Trotsky (as Trotsky was a Jew). Stalin's daughter later claimed that his fight with Trotsky laid the foundations for his later anti-semitic campaigns.|$|E
5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues {{differed}} in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British {{rhythm and blues}} singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the line was {{finished}} there were public calls from {{inside and outside the}} company for Helm to resign, mostly because of his support for a proposed Memphis branch of the railroad. To complete the branch, the Louisville and Nashville would have to complete a line from Bowling Green to Guthrie, Kentucky. There it would join a line owned by the Memphis and Ohio Railroad that began across the state line at Clarksville, Tennessee and extended to Memphis. Supporters believed the branch would economically help both Louisville and Memphis and would lessen their dependence on trade along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. Opponents argued that the project was simply a ploy <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> new support for the struggling railroad. Helm endorsed the Memphis branch in his annual report in 1857.|$|E

25|$|Hearst's use {{of yellow}} journalism {{techniques}} in his New York Journal <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> {{popular support for}} U.S. military adventurism in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines in 1898 was also criticized in Upton Sinclair's 1919 book, The Brass Check: A Study of American Journalism. According to Sinclair, Hearst's newspapers distorted world events and deliberately tried to discredit Socialists. Another critic, Ferdinand Lundberg, extended the criticism in Imperial Hearst (1936), charging that Hearst papers accepted payments from abroad to slant the news. After the war, a further critic, George Seldes, repeated the charges in Facts and Fascism (1947).|$|E
500|$|Roy {{was created}} by the author Frank S. Pepper, who had created the similar strip, Danny of the Dazzlers, but he only wrote four {{instalments}} of Roy of the Rovers, because of his commitments to another of his characters, Captain Condor. His role was taken by the strip's first artist Joe Colquhoun, who used the pen-name [...] "Stewart Colwyn". He was replaced after four-and-a-half years by Derek Birnage, the editor of Tiger, who had commissioned the strip. In 1960, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> publicity, it was announced that the footballer Bobby Charlton had taken over as writer, although in reality it was still written by Birnage (who claimed that he did consult with Charlton occasionally for story ideas). The longest-serving writer of the strip was Tom Tully, who began in 1969 on an intermittent basis and then continuously from 1974 {{until the end of the}} weekly comic in 1993. Ian Rimmer became the main writer for the strip during the Match of the Day years, until the magazine's closure in May 2001.|$|E

Democracies are instituted to ensure freedom for all and popular control over government authority; demagogues turn power deriving from popular support into a force that undermines the very freedoms and rule of law that democracies are made to protect. The Greek historian Polybius thought that democracies are inevitably undone by demagogues. He said that every democracy eventually decays into [...] "a government of violence and the strong hand," [...] leading to [...] "tumultuous assemblies, massacres, banishments." ...|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reception}} was overwhelmingly positive, and Housewives {{was considered}} the breakout hit of the season. Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the pilot a score of four stars out of four, calling it [...] "efreshingly original, bracingly adult and thoroughly delightful", and going {{on to say that}} [...] " [...] Housewives is a brightly colored, darkly comic take on suburban life, sort of Knots Landing meets The Golden Girls by way of Twin Peaks." [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle thought that Desperate Housewives was [...] "a brilliantly conceived and relentlessly entertaining new drama". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe commented that the series had [...] "marvelous tonal elasticity". Peter Schorn of IGN felt that season one was [...] "blessed with an attractive cast (sing the praises of older women!), sharp writing and a funky vibe of its own" [...] and that [...] "Desperate Housewives was able {{to take some of the}} oldest formulas in the book and infuse them with their own subversive twists <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> a frothy confection of sly wit and dark motives."

500|$|In {{the general}} election, {{candidates}} for the Referendum Party stood in 547 constituencies, the most that any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. None of these candidates were in Northern Ireland. This was because Goldsmith had made an agreement with Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist Party {{that he would not}} field any candidates against them if their one MEP joined his Europe of Nations grouping in the European Parliament, something that ensured that the grouping remained large enough to retain its Parliamentary funding. It also avoided putting up candidates in constituencies where the leading candidate (65 of them Conservatives, 26 Labour and 2 Liberal Democrats) was considered sympathetic to the Referendum Party's call for a referendum. Goldsmith appeared to acknowledge that it was unlikely to win any of the contested seats, stating that the party's success would be [...] "judged solely by its total number of votes". The party officially launched its electoral campaign on 9 April 1997 at Newlyn in Cornwall, where Goldsmith sought <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> Eurosceptic sentiment among fishermen who were angry with the restrictions imposed by EU fishing quotas.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. Goebbels {{was one of the most}} enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: [...] "ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing." [...] In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda <b>to</b> <b>whip</b> <b>up</b> sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government. Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing [...] "war panic" [...] in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity. After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war. He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.|$|E

5000|$|In the South, the Fire-Eaters - antebellum pro-slavery extremists - {{proposed}} {{repealing the}} act {{and once more}} legalizing the international slave trade in the United States. Historian Erskine Clarke writes that this call [...] "was a shameless expression of their contempt for any antislavery sentiment {{and a part of}} their stratagem to divide the nation and create a slaveholding confederacy. Among other things, the fire-eaters hoped that a reopened international slave trade would incense the North, and that Northern outrage would cause white Southerns to unite and move toward secession." [...] In addition <b>to</b> <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> sectional tensions, Fire-Eaters advocated the reopening of the slave trade in order to drive down the price of slaves; to balance the millions of European immigrants who had settled in the North and maintain Southern representation in Congress; and assert the morality of slavery: [...] "Slave trading had to be made right, otherwise slavery was imperiled." [...] Fire-Eaters essentially desired to [...] "legitimize the slave trade {{in order to make the}} point that both slavery and the African slave trade were morally acceptable practices" [...] - a view intended to be precisely opposite that of the abolitionists, who affirmed the immorality of both slavery and the slave trade. The view alarmed even pro-slavery figures, such as former President John Tyler, who in a widely-republished letter written in his retirement condemned the Fire-Eaters' call to abrogate article 8 of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty (which barred the slave trade), noting that the South had voted to ratify the treaty.|$|R

Historically, the avoidance of the title of [...] "Primate" [...] was <b>to</b> eschew <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> anti-Catholic tension, in the same way the bishops of the restored hierarchy avoided using current titles of Anglican sees (Archbishop of Westminster rather than [...] "Canterbury" [...] or [...] "London").

Asa Kasher wrote that the IDF was pulled into fighting [...] "that is both strategically and morally asymmetric" [...] and that like any other army it made mistakes, but the charges it faces are [...] "grossly unfair". The Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence, reporting on its analysis of 111 testimonies concerning the war by some 70 IDF soldiers and officers, cited one veteran's remark that [...] "Anyone found in an IDF area, which the IDF had occupied, was not a civilian," [...] to argue {{that this was the}} basic rule of engagement. Soldiers were briefed to regard everything inside the Strip as a threat. The report cites several examples of civilians, including women, being shot dead and defined as [...] "terrorists" [...] in later reports. Since leaflets were dropped telling civilians to leave areas to be bombed, soldiers could assume any movement in a bombed area entitled them to shoot.
