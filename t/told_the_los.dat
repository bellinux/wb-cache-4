Throughout all that you have Tom Morello as the coach of Team USA - he's a fiery coach and he's out for blood!

5000|$|Bayley was a Los Angeles {{surgeon who}} lived one block {{south of the}} vacant lot in which Short's body was found, until he left his wife in October 1946.

After his death, his widow alleged that his mistress knew a [...] "terrible secret" [...] about Bayley and was made the main beneficiary upon his death as a result. Bayley was never a suspect in the case, but many medical doctors and others with medical training were. In secret testimony, Detective Harry Hansen, one of <b>the</b> original investigators, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> 1949 <b>Los</b> Angeles County grand jury that in his opinion the killer was a [...] "top medical man" [...] and [...] "a fine surgeon."

500|$|After {{at first}} {{having failed to}} see {{the appeal of the}} image, Tittle {{eventually}} grew to embrace it, putting it on the back cover of his 2009 autobiography. [...] "That {{was the end of the}} road," [...] he <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles Times in 2008. [...] "It was the end of my dream. It was over." [...] Pittsburgh player John Baker, who hit Tittle right before the picture was taken, ran for sheriff in his native Wake County, North Carolina in 1978, and used the photo as a campaign tool. He was elected and went on to serve for 24 years. Tittle also held a fundraiser to assist Baker in his bid for a fourth term in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary {{records and}} Hubbard's {{relatives}} contradict this depiction. Hubbard's grandfather, Lafe Waterbury, briefly owned {{a plot of}} land covering 320acres (0.5mi2) near Kalispell, where he pastured horses {{and worked as a}} veterinarian. A local city directory for 1913 stated Waterbury's assets as a relatively modest $1,550. The Hubbards and Waterburys lived in a pair of townhouses, not a ranch, in the center of Helena, only two blocks from each other and not far from the Montana State Capitol. They also owned a small plot outside the city.

McCain strategist Steve Schmidt called a meeting and demanded to know who let Palin talk to the fake Sarkozy without checking with senior advisors first.

500|$|Before {{principal}} photography, {{the cast}} and crew bought season passes to both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. They spent ten days in Florida, then returned to California for two weeks at Disneyland, making the parks depicted in the film a combination of both resorts. Actors and crew entered the parks in small groups to avoid attracting attention. [...] "At one point, I even made the camera department shave off their facial hair and dress in tourist attire, which almost provoked a mutiny," [...] says Moore. Despite the actors wearing the same clothes for days on end, Moore <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles Times, park personnel never appeared to notice them, save for one day near the end of filming when Disneyland security thought they were paparazzi harassing a celebrity family.|$|E

LaBeouf <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles Times that he felt he as an actor [...] "dropped the ball" [...] on Jones' legacy, and [...] "there was a reason" [...] the film wasn't universally accepted.

[...] The Boston Globes Wesley Morris wrote, [...] "Watching Amy Adams sing... makes you appreciated [...] the magic of the movies." [...] However, the performance generated some mild controversy revolving around the fact that while Adams was selected to perform [...] "Happy Working Song", Broadway actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth was hired to sing [...] "That's How You Know" [...] live at the ceremony. When questioned about this, Disney executives <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles Times that [...] "it's best [...] sing 'Happy Working Song' because it has so many parallels to Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins".|$|E

[...] By exaggerating the character's shape and face, the animators eventually [...] "amped [...] up" [...] in order to make him funnier. The name [...] "Pascal" [...] was borrowed from a pet chameleon owned by Tangled animator Kellie Lewis.

500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided. Bo’s {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society, and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo-leftists. One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, [...] "When I sing red songs, I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs…To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time." [...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles Times [...] "We know these songs from our youth.
