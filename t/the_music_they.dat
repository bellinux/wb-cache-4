5|$|A {{variety of}} artists, musical and otherwise, have collaborated with Stereolab. In 1995 the group {{teamed up with}} {{sculptor}} Charles Long for an interactive art show in New York City, for which Long provided the exhibits and Stereolab <b>the</b> <b>music.</b> <b>They</b> have released tracks by and toured with post-rock band Tortoise, while John McEntire of Tortoise has in turn worked on several Stereolab albums. In the 1990s Stereolab and veteran industrial band Nurse With Wound released two limited-edition records together; both contained Nurse With Wound remixes of original tracks provided by Stereolab.|$|E
5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about <b>the</b> <b>music,</b> <b>they</b> decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal {{groups such}} as Barnabas and Extol have criticized bands within the {{industry}} {{for a lack of}} innovation and for isolating bands within the industry. Pastor Bob Beeman of Sanctuary International stated that this is a compliment to secular music, as it lets people to listen to <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>they</b> enjoyed without feeling like they are giving up on the style they love and allows bands to crossover into mainstream success.|$|E

5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>they</b> were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, choral music, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply <b>the</b> <b>music.</b> <b>They</b> work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E
5|$|The Propaganda Ministry {{took over}} the {{broadcasting}} facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers {{as a way to}} gain the trust of the citizens. Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department. The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>they</b> were allowed to play. Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans. Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people. From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in Das Reich which were later read aloud over the radio. He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio. At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the Wehrmacht).|$|E

25|$|In 1989, James befriended Grant Wilson-Claridge {{when they}} were working {{alternate}} weeks as a DJ at the Bowgie pub near Newquay. Wilson-Claridge was intrigued by his sets, and when he discovered that James was playing tapes of his own music he suggested that they make records. At first, putting Aphex Twin’s recordings on vinyl {{was a way of}} making music the duo's friends wanted to hear; because of their geographic isolation they could not access <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>they</b> wanted to hear, so they decided to create their own.|$|E
25|$|While not recording, {{the band}} members at times ventured onto The Strip, but they also {{made an effort to}} {{experience}} Las Vegas as locals rather than merely a tourist destination. Howling Bells believed that their Las Vegas surroundings infused the spirit and the ambience of the desert and very much affected the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>music.</b> <b>They</b> spent time jamming on Doors and John Lennon songs, whereupon Stoermer joined them, sometimes filling in on drums. Stoermer also brought his collection of Hitchcock and cult films into the studio late at night and entertained the band with the old movies.|$|E

25|$|Rome {{has also}} had a major impact in music history. The Roman School {{was a group of}} composers of {{predominantly}} church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. The term also refers to <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>they</b> produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.|$|E
25|$|Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager, had {{intended}} that 1966 {{would follow the}} format of the previous two years, in which the Beatles had made a feature film with an accompanying soundtrack album, toured in North America and select countries during the summer months, and then recorded a second album for a pre-Christmas release. Following the group's UK tour in December 1965, however, the band members decided to reject the planned film project, an adaptation of Richard Condon's novel A Talent for Loving, for which Epstein had purchased the film rights. The band therefore had an unprecedented three months free of professional engagements. The group resumed work in early April, when they began recording Revolver, an album that reflected a more experimental approach as well as the increasing division between <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>they</b> made as live performers. The band briefly interrupted the sessions to perform at the NME Poll-Winners Concert on 1 May.|$|E
25|$|In all the band's album notes, all of Bring Me The Horizon's {{lyrics are}} said to be written by lead vocalist Oliver Sykes while all five members—as a band—were {{credited}} with writing the music. With the exception of Count Your Blessings, the band has always written in a secluded area to avoid being distracted. The members of the band have stated how the debut album was written in inner-city areas of Birmingham while being pressured to write and record songs in the deadlines given. This led to the band being unimpressed with the final product. However, for the writing process of Suicide Season, the band realised that they much preferred picking areas with less human contact in order to focus on <b>the</b> <b>music,</b> <b>they</b> wrote their second album in the Swedish countryside. During the writing of Suicide Season, former and founding rhythm guitarist Curtis Ward wrote only two riffs of his rhythm parts of the album, mostly relying on Lee Malia to write all of the guitar sections of the album.|$|E

25|$|Music {{theory as}} a {{practical}} discipline encompasses the methods and concepts composers and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense {{may be found in}} oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from Mesopotamia, China, and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>they</b> produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see History of music and Musical instrument). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music making. Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.|$|E
