5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of <b>tasks,</b> <b>such</b> as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E

5|$|Early {{encryption}} {{techniques such}} as the Hill cipher also used matrices. However, due to the linear nature of matrices, these codes are comparatively easy to break. Computer graphics uses matrices both to represent objects and to calculate transformations of objects using affine rotation matrices to accomplish <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> as projecting a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional screen, corresponding to a theoretical camera observation. Matrices over a polynomial ring are important {{in the study of}} control theory.|$|E
5|$|In {{a pair of}} studies, high-functioning {{children}} with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals {{are more likely to}} overestimate what their audience comprehends.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative <b>tasks,</b> <b>such</b> as {{the painting of}} banners and stage scenery. Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake’s work is not recorded there, {{it seems as if}} De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued his work as a royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.|$|E

5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that {{this has to do}} with the idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive <b>tasks,</b> <b>such</b> as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E
5|$|After all the {{interviews}} concluded, {{the group of}} 208 men were convicted in summary courts-martial of disobeying orders, Article 4 of the Articles for the Government of the United States Navy (Rocks and Shoals). Each man was subject to forfeiture of three months' pay. A few of them were held as witnesses in the upcoming mutiny trial. The rest were split into smaller groups and shipped out to various places in the Pacific Theater. Carl Tuggle, one of the 208, said in 1998 {{that a group of}} prisoners including himself were assigned menial <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> as cleaning latrines and picking up cigarette butts at a series of Pacific islands. After returning from active duty they each received bad conduct discharges, which meant the loss of virtually all veterans' benefits.|$|E

5|$|Asian {{elephants}} perform <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to {{rivers and}} roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, {{the animals are}} used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous {{to work with and}} are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.|$|E
5|$|Australia also formed {{small-scale}} raiding and reconnaissance forces, most {{of which}} were grouped together as the Allied Intelligence Bureau. Z Special Unit conducted raids far behind the front line, including a successful raid on Singapore in September 1943. M Special Unit, coastwatchers and smaller AIB units also operated behind Japanese lines to collect intelligence. AIB parties were often used to support Australian Army units and were assigned to inappropriate <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> as tactical reconnaissance and liaison. AIB missions in Timor and Dutch New Guinea were also hampered by being placed under the command of unpopular Dutch colonial administrators. The RAAF formed a specially-equipped unit (No.200Flight) in 1945 to support these operations by transporting and supplying AIB parties in areas held by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday <b>tasks</b> <b>such</b> as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E
