5|$|The Deseret {{alphabet}} was purposely {{designed so}} as <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> ascenders and descenders. This was envisioned {{as a practical}} benefit for the alphabet {{in an era of}} metal type: after many uses, the edges of type sorts become dull, and narrow ascenders and descenders are most prone to this effect.|$|E

5|$|Baggio was {{controversially}} {{excluded from}} Italy's 2002 World Cup squad by coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who believed him <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> fully {{recovered from the}} serious injury he had sustained during the season. Although he was initially keen to include Baggio in the final 23-man list, he ultimately excluded him from the squad; Baggio had made a direct appeal to him prior to the tournament by writing him a letter. Fans and pundits criticised the omission, as Italy were eliminated by co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16.|$|E
5|$|CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) {{plans on}} firing Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{due to his}} missing work for acting gigs. However, Andy tells David he is resigning to pursue his dreams of stardom full-time, and David is {{relieved}} <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to dismiss him. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) receives his black belt in karate from his new sensei (Michael Imperioli). Seeing Dwight's tenacity and devotion, David is inspired to make Dwight Andy's replacement.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{significant}} {{loss of life}} caused by the storm, the name Lucille was retired. This {{marked the first time}} that a tropical cyclone in the Western Pacific had its name removed following its usage. For unknown reasons it was not replaced with any particular name, making it one of two storms in the basin <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a replacement, although Lucy took the name's place in 1962.|$|E

5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes during the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans unbeaten on 47. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller {{at the start of}} the morning, which would help break up the wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia before setting England a target. The hosts needed to beat Australia to avoid a series defeat. Bradman elected <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would make the surface less favourable for batting.|$|E

Bradman elected <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the Germans, Emirau {{was one of}} the few {{islands in}} the region <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a Royal Australian Navy-supplied radio to contact the Australian authorities. The two European {{families}} on the island provided the released prisoners with supplies, and sent a canoe to Kavieng in New Ireland to notify the Australian colonial government. A schooner was dispatched to bring additional supplies to Emirau, and arrived there on 24December. The colonial administrator of New Britain and further supplies was also flown to Emirau on board a flying boat. The released prisoners were embarked onto the steamer Nellore on 29December to be transported to Townsville in Queensland, where they arrived on 1 January1941. They provided useful intelligence on the German raiders' operations, and the German Naval Staff issued a directive on 19February 1941 prohibiting raiders from releasing further prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Havins was {{influenced}} in {{her decision to}} accept the part by her husband's appreciation of the series. Like Rex, Esther is used by executive producer Russell T Davies {{as a means of}} introducing new American audiences to the established mythos of Torchwood. Havins stated the character to have an unrequited love for Rex, but explained that he does not appear to notice. Response to the character varied; some critics praised her characterisation and portrayal whilst others felt her to display incompetency and <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been taken to by the audience. The nature of her exit from the show was generally praised, though some reviewers felt it lacked the desired emotional impact.|$|E
5|$|Healthcare {{reform was}} a major topic during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, {{attention}} focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45million Americans estimated <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's proposal would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy but rejected {{the use of an}} individual mandate.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Norwegian {{authorities}} {{decided to}} extend its operations in Antarctica by establishing an all-year research station. By then, Norway was the only country with a territorial claim to Antarctica <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an all-year research station on the continent. Construction was carried out from December 2004 through February 2005. To ease logistics, Norway took the initiative to establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline transport costs. The permanent Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, it {{was decided}} that Norway was to extend its {{operations}} in Antarctica by establishing an all-year research station. By then, Norway was the only country with a territorial claim to Antarctica <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an all-year research station on the continent. The government stated that the investment was motivated to improve climate research, to strengthen Norway as a bi-polar research nation and to strengthen Norway's role as a premise-maker in the environmental policy of the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, the name Ophelia was retired from usage. For unknown reasons it was not {{replaced}} with any particular name, making it one of two storms in the basin <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a replacement, although Ora took Ophelia's place in 1963. The reason behind Ophelia's removal is unique among Pacific typhoons. Normally, names are stricken from usage due to loss of life and/or damage; however, Ophelia was deemed meteorologically significant for its long track and significant intensity for a prolonged duration.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Tech Red Raiders {{football}} team, representing Texas Tech University, has had 151players {{drafted into}} the National Football League (NFL) since the league began holding drafts in 1936. This includes six players taken {{in the first round}} and one overall number one pick, Dave Parks in the 1964 NFL Draft. The Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears have drafted the most Red Raiders, eleven and nine, respectively. The Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars are the only current franchises <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> drafted a player from Texas Tech. Three former Red Raiders have been selected to a Pro Bowl, seven former Red Raiders have won a league championship with their respective teams, and three former Red Raiders have been selected to both a Pro Bowl and won a league championship.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, though the {{original}} draft of the plot was much different. Originally, Homer was to learn {{that he was a}} Native American, and would try to exploit it <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to pay taxes. The idea had been going well for a few days, but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to pay taxes. When the writers found out that they did, the whole plot had to be scrapped. Executive producer Mike Scully's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion-dollar bill, which they accepted, as they were out of ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} created <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> direct {{connections}} to the first Shin Megami Tensei, {{to ensure that it}} was interesting independently; this led character designer Kazuma Kaneko to create the concept of a story vaguely based on Shin Megami Tensei future. Reviewers enjoyed the gameplay and the lowered difficulty compared to the prior game; some appreciated the plot and themes, but some thought that certain themes, while fresh at the time of release, felt clichéd in retrospect.|$|E
5|$|After Final Resolution with Kurt Angle {{retaining}} the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, TNA had {{to determine who}} he would face at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. On the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!, Samoa Joe, Christian Cage, and A.J. Styles fought in a Three Way match {{to determine the number}} one contender. Stipulations for the match were that the winner would get a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Angle at Against All Odds, however if Styles won he could choose instead of the title match to allow Angle <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to defend his title for two months. Cage ended up winning the contest, setting up Angle versus Cage at Against All Odds. On the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Joe would be the Special Outside Enforcer at Against All Odds due him being controversially disqualified during the match. Angle defeated Cage at Against All Odds after interference from Tomko.|$|E
