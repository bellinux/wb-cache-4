5|$|From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took {{advantage}} of the computing power of PlayStation 3s. At the time of its inception, its main streaming Cell processor delivered a 20x speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the Xbox 360. The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to Amdahl's law, and significantly changed the <b>tradeoff</b> between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost. This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.|$|E
5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, {{if there is no}} increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the <b>tradeoff</b> between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.|$|E

In particular, user preferences and <b>tradeoffs</b> are represented as soft constraints and as an entailment operator, respectively.

25|$|In {{the case}} of bi-objective problems, informing the {{decision}} maker concerning the Pareto front is usually carried out by its visualization: the Pareto front, often named the <b>tradeoff</b> curve in this case, can be drawn at the objective plane. The <b>tradeoff</b> curve gives full information on objective values and on objective tradeoffs, which inform how improving one objective is related to deteriorating the second one while moving along the <b>tradeoff</b> curve. The decision maker takes this information into account while specifying the preferred Pareto optimal objective point. The idea to approximate and visualize the Pareto front was introduced for linear bi-objective decision problems by S.Gass and T.Saaty.

Different classes of <b>tradeoffs</b> are known to con-strain the evolution of phenotypes, but current theories incorporate only a subset of these <b>tradeoffs.</b> Conse-quently, these theories cannot account for some of the variation in reaction norms that has been observed within and among species.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the <b>tradeoffs</b> between organ at risk sparing and tumour coverage for IMRT treatment of lung tumours, {{and to develop}} a tool for clinical use to graphically represent these <b>tradeoffs.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: For 5 patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) different IMRT plans were generated using a standard TPS. The plans were automatically generated for a range of IMRT settings (weights and dose levels of the objective functions) and were systematically evaluated, focusing on the <b>tradeoffs</b> between organ at risk (OAR) dose and target coverage. A method to analyze and visualize planning <b>tradeoffs</b> was developed and evaluated. RESULTS: Lung and oesophagus were identified as the critical organs at risk for NSCLC, the sparing of which strongly influences PTV coverage. Systematically analyzing the <b>tradeoffs</b> between these organs revealed that the sparing of these organs was approximately linearly related to PTV coverage parameters. Using this property, a tool was developed to graphically present the <b>tradeoffs</b> between the sparing of these organs at risk and the PTV coverage. The tool is an effective method to visualize the <b>tradeoffs.</b> CONCLUSIONS: A tool was developed to assist IMRT plan design and selection. The clear presentation of the <b>tradeoffs</b> between OAR dose and coverage facilitates the optimization process and offers additional information to the clinician for a patient specific choice of the optimal IMRT plan...|$|R
