Mitchell's case was tried by county {{attorney}} Scott Tidwell, a political supporter of Roberts {{and the personal}} attorney for Arafiles, in February 2010. Both the TMB executive director and the county attorney in nearby Andrews County discouraged Tidwell from trying the case. At trial, Mitchell did not testify. The relationship between Arafiles and Roberts was explored during the proceedings. Arafiles introduced Roberts to a supplement-selling program known as Zrii, and recommended the supplements to his patients. Roberts sold the supplements, {{but he said that}} his friendship with Arafiles had not impacted his actions with <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> {{that he did not have}} a business relationship with Arafiles.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{probably}} {{was hit by}} a Bf 109 flown by Müncheberg himself—the German fighter leader had reported his 26th victory as a Hurricane with the pilot bailing out. He was the only British pilot to bail out in the battle. The Hurricane crashed near Addolorata Cemetery near Paola. MacLachlan remained in hospital with a severely wounded left arm. He was pumped with saline solution to prevent blood clotting but his arm was too badly damaged and it was amputated below the elbow. His determination and reputation was as such, <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> squadron were already taking bets on whether or not he would return to action within a fortnight {{on the day of the}} operation. While in hospital he began speaking with Luigi Armanino, the pilot he had shot down days earlier. Among the topics of discussion were strengths of the Italian aircraft and Armanino's exploits piloting CR.42s during the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> Midwives Tribunal is {{a former}} {{tribunal}} that {{was established in the}} Australian state of New South Wales which dealt with appeals and complaints of professional misconduct by nurses and midwives. The tribunal generally heard matters after <b>the</b> <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> Midwives Board has made a decision or a professional association had referred an issue to the tribunal.

40|$|The use of {{computers}} {{in the delivery of}} health care has significantly improved the way health service is delivered to clients and patients in the world. Despite the importance of computing to the delivery of health service, developing countries have not greatly benefited from it. Nursing informatics has been in existence and part of academic curriculum for the past 2 decades in some advanced countries. <b>The</b> Ghana <b>Nursing</b> <b>and</b> Midwifery Council introduced <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> midwifery informatics course during the 2015 / 2016 academic year. This seeks to train student <b>nurses</b> on <b>the</b> relevance {{of computers}} to health care. Two separate workshops were organised to ascertain the preparedness of tutors (teachers at <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> midwifery training institutions) for teaching <b>the</b> new <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> midwifery informatics course as well as to compare the curriculum with other international recommendations. <b>The</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> midwifery informatics course is taught at the first year where students have not been introduced to <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> processes for them to appreciate <b>the</b> use of <b>nursing</b> informatics skills. It would be better if <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> midwifery informatics course is rather introduced during the second year second semester when students are about going for the hands-on training at the various health care institutions. Examining the course content reveals that the practical aspect within the course is very small. It is expected that more practical contents will be introduced. Tutors are not adequately prepared to teach this new course. More training is therefore needed to make tutors fully prepared to teach both the theory and practical aspects of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> midwifery informatics course. It is expected that <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> midwifery informatics course would prepare student nurses on all nursing informatics competencies. It is essential that <b>nurse</b> educators incorporate <b>the</b> entire concept of informatics into <b>the</b> education of <b>nurses...</b>|$|R

25|$|In addition, {{there is}} the {{department}} of nursing, often headed by a chief nursing officer or director of nursing. This department {{is responsible for the}} administration of professional nursing practice, research, and policy for the hospital. Nursing permeates every part of a hospital. Many units or wards have both a nursing and a medical director that serve as administrators for their respective disciplines within that specialty. For example, in an intensive care nursery, the director of neonatology is responsible for the medical staff and medical care while the nursing manager/director for the intensive care nursery is responsible for all of <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> nursing care in that unit/ward.|$|E

The ONP had to be undertaken by the candidate after NMC makes necessary checks and issue the candidate with a decision letter stating that the person may join a university to undertake the ONP. However, due to shortage of nurses and NMC striving for gold standards in nursing they have now updated their new process to a two part test of competence. The first part is called CBT and Part 2 (objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).|$|E

Due to the prospect that Port Moresby might fall, it was sent without its nurses or Australian Army Medical Women's Service physiotherapists. Staffed as a 600-bed hospital, it held 732 patients on 6 October. Its commanding officer, Colonel A. H.

500|$|Graham Keal of the Birmingham Post {{observed}} that Meyer begins the series as a [...] "hate figure"–ferocious, unbending and unsmiling, but is actually more complex a character than that, with [...] "much to admire too."

[...] Paterson called Meyer [...] "saturnine and sinister in appearance", likening him to James Robertson Justice's Doctor in the House consultant Lancelot Spratt. Shane Donaghey of The People compared Meyer to Hannibal Lecter, describing him as [...] "Part panto villain, part grim reaper, with a bedside manner of a cruel vet" [...] and commenting that he manages his department [...] "with an iron fist veiled in a concrete glove."

Don Fellows, the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots. [...] Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship. [...] Of the mood backstage, [...] "everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive." [...] He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in Allegro), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless. [...] He soon had the Seabees pacing back and forth like caged animals during [...] "There Is Nothing Like a Dame", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show. One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking. As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage.
