40|$|AbstractDuration is {{a salient}} feature of {{acoustic}} signals including speech. <b>Duration</b> <b>tuning</b> was first reported in frogs {{and later in}} echolocating bats. More recently, <b>duration</b> <b>tuning</b> {{has been reported in}} non-echolocating mammals and appears to be a fundamental encoding mechanism throughout the animal kingdom. However, the <b>duration</b> <b>tuning</b> reported in these non-echolocating mammals appears to be much weaker than that in the previous studies on bats. In contrast to this finding, our recent study reported that <b>duration</b> <b>tuning</b> in the IC in guinea pigs appeared to be strong when it was measured using an appropriate temporal window. With such a temporal window, <b>duration</b> <b>tuning</b> was found to be compatible with that of echo-locating bats. In the present report, we further demonstrate that <b>duration</b> <b>tuning</b> in the IC of this species is established by interaction between excitation and GABAergic inhibition. In addition to overall increase in responsiveness, application of bicuculline(BIC), a GABA-A receptor antagonist, was found to significantly reduce or eliminate duration selectivity in 44 out of the 67 neurons that showed clear <b>duration</b> <b>tuning</b> from a sample of 340 neurons...|$|R

40|$|A {{suitable}} coupling of the inflaton phi to a vector kinetic term F^ 2 gives {{frozen and}} scale invariant vector perturbations. We compute the cosmological perturbations zeta {{that result from}} such coupling by {{taking into account the}} classical vector field that unavoidably gets generated at large scales during inflation. This generically results in a too anisotropic power spectrum of zeta. Specifically, the anisotropy exceeds the 1 % level (10 % level) if inflation lasted ~ 5 e-folds (~ 50 e-folds) more than the minimal amount required to produce the CMB modes. This conclusion applies, among others, to the application of this mechanism for magnetogenesis, for anisotropic inflation, and for the generation of anisotropic perturbations at the end of inflation through a waterfall field coupled to the vector (in this case, the unavoidable contribution that we obtain is effective all throughout inflation, and it is independent of the waterfall field). For a <b>tuned</b> <b>duration</b> of inflation, a 1 % (10 %) anisotropy in the power spectrum corresponds to an anisotropic bispectrum which is enhanced like the local one in the squeezed limit, and with an effective local f_{NL} ~ 3 (~ 30).

40|$|Animal sounds, as well {{as human}} speech sounds, are {{characterized}} by multiple parameters such as frequency, intensity, duration, etc. The central auditory system produces neurons <b>tuned</b> to particular <b>durations</b> and frequencies of sounds emitted by a species. In bats, “duration-tuned” neurons are mostly sensitive to short durations and high frequencies of sounds used for echolocation. They are scattered in the frequency maps of the inferior colliculus and auditory cortex. We found that electric stimulation of cortical duration-tuned neurons modulates collicular duration-tuned neurons in both <b>duration</b> and frequency <b>tuning</b> only when collicular and cortical neurons paired for studies are within ± 4 ms in best duration and within ± 6 kHz in best frequency. There are four types of modulations: sharpening or broadening of <b>duration</b> <b>tuning,</b> and lengthening or shortening of best duration.

The approach marries step-and-repeat nanoimprint lithography (NIL) and metal-catalyzed electroless etching (MCEE), enabling near perfectly ordered Si nanostructure arrays of user-defined patterns to be controllably and rapidly generated on a wafer scale. Periodic features possessing circular, hexagonal, and rectangular cross-sections with lateral dimensions down to sub- 50 nm, in hexagonal or square array configurations and high array packing densities up to 5.13 [*]×[*] 107 structures/mm 2 not achievable by conventional UV photolithography are fabricated using this top-down approach. By suitably <b>tuning</b> the <b>duration</b> of catalytic etching, variable aspect ratio Si nanostructures can be formed. As the etched Si pattern depends largely on the NIL mould which is patterned by electron beam lithography (EBL), the technique {{can be used to}} form patterns not possible with self-assembly methods, nanosphere, and interference lithography for replication on a wafer scale. Good chemical resistance of the nanoimprinted mask and adhesion to the Si substrate facilitate good pattern transfer and preserve the smooth top surface morphology of the Si nanostructures as shown in TEM. This approach is suitable for generating Si nanostructures of controlled dimensions and patterns, with high aspect ratio on a wafer level suitable for semiconductor device production.|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{firing pattern}} of neurons {{is shaped by}} the {{convergence}} of excitation and inhibition, each with finely <b>tuned</b> magnitude and <b>duration.</b> In an auditory brainstem nucleus, glycinergic inhibition features fast decay kinetics, the mechanism of which is unknown. By applying glycine to native or recombinant glycine receptors, we show that response decay times are accelerated by addition of GABA, a weak partial agonist of glycine receptors. Systematic variation in agonist exposure time revealed that fast synaptic time course may be achieved with submillisecond exposures to mixtures of glycine and GABA at physiological concentrations. Accordingly, presynaptic terminals generally contained both transmitters, and depleting terminals of GABA slowed glycinergic synaptic currents. Thus, coreleased GABA accelerates glycinergic transmission by acting directly on glycine receptors, narrowing the time window for effective inhibition. Packaging both weak and strong agonists in vesicles may be a general means by which presynaptic neurons regulate the duration of postsynaptic responses...|$|R
40|$|Although {{psychological}} and computational models of time estimation have postulated {{the existence of}} neural representations <b>tuned</b> for specific <b>durations,</b> empirical evidence of this notion has been lacking. Here, using a {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) adap-tation paradigm, we show that the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (corresponding to the supra-marginal gyrus) exhibited reduction in neural activity due to adaptation when a visual stimulus of the same duration was repeatedly presented. Adaptation was strongest when stimuli of identical durations were repeated, and it gradually decreased as the difference between the reference and test <b>durations</b> increased. This <b>tuning</b> property generalized across a broad range of durations, indicating the presence of general time-representation mechanisms in the IPL.

40|$|In nature, {{communication}} sounds among {{animal species}} including humans are typical complex sounds {{that occur in}} sequence and vary with time in several parameters including amplitude, frequency, duration as well as separation and order of individual sounds. Among these multiple parameters, sound duration is a simple but important one {{that contributes to the}} distinct spectral and temporal attributes of individual biological sounds. Likewise, the separation of individual sounds is an important temporal attribute that determines an animal’s ability in distinguishing individual sounds. Whereas duration selectivity of auditory neurons underlies an animal’s ability in recognition of sound duration, the recovery cycle of auditory neurons determines a neuron’s ability in responding to closely spaced sound pulses and therefore it underlies the animal’s ability in analyzing the order of individual sounds. Since the multiple parameters of naturally occurring communication sounds vary with time, the analysis of a specific sound parameter by an animal would be inevitably affected by other co-varying sound parameters. This is particularly obvious in insectivorous bats which rely on analysis of returning echoes for prey capture when they systematically vary the multiple pulse parameters throughout a target approach sequence. In this review article, we present our studies of dynamic variation of duration selectivity and recovery cycle of neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus of the frequency-modulated bats to highlight the dynamic temporal signal processing of central auditory neurons. These studies use single pulses and three biologically relevant pulse-echo (P-E) pairs with varied duration, gap and amplitude difference similar to that occurring during search, approach and terminal phases of hunting by bats.

Offset neurons are found in most ascending auditory nuclei; however, the neural mechanisms that evoke offset responses are not well understood. In this study, we examined offset neural responses to tonal stimuli in the inferior colliculus (IC) in vivo with extracellular and intracellular recording techniques in mice. Based on peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) patterns, we classified extracellular offset responses into four types: Offset, Onset-Offset, Onset-Sustained-Offset and Inhibition-Offset types. Moreover, using in vivo whole-cell recording techniques, we found that offset responses were generated in most cells through the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. However, in {{a small number of}} cells, the offset responses were generated as a rebound to hyperpolarization during tonal stimulation. Many offset neurons fired robustly at a preferred duration of tonal stimulus, which corresponded with the timing of rich excitatory synaptic inputs. We concluded that most IC offset neurons encode {{the termination}} of the tone stimulus by responding to inherited ascending synaptic information, which is <b>tuned</b> to sound <b>duration.</b> The remainder generates offset spikes de novo through a post-inhibitory rebound mechanism...|$|R
5000|$|Until the 1970s it was {{traditional}} to play {{a single}} <b>tune</b> for the <b>duration</b> of a contra dance (about 5 to 10 minutes). Since then, contra dance musicians have typically played tunes in sets {{of two or three}} related (and sometimes contrasting) tunes, though single-tune dances are again becoming popular with some northeastern bands.

Here, D is related to G as its dominant (5th), while D and Bm share a key signature of two sharps. In the old-time tradition the musicians will either play the same tune for the whole dance, or switch to tunes in the same key. This is because the tunings of the five-string banjo are key-specific. An old-time band might play a set of tunes in D, then use the time between dances to retune for a set of tunes in A.

Because the inferior colliculus (IC) receives convergent inputs from lower brainstem auditory nuclei that process sounds from each ear, many midbrain neurons have responses shaped by binaural interactions and are selective to binaural cues important for sound localization.

40|$|The {{population}} {{over the}} age of 65 years old is rapidly increasing around the world. Presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) {{is one of the most}} prevalent disabilities associated with age and can impair speech understanding and social and emotional well-being. Deficits in auditory processing, including speech understanding are likely caused by an interaction between changes in the way the brain processes sound and peripheral sensory hearing loss. It is difficult to disambiguate changes that occur within the brain independent of peripheral hearing loss and those that change because of it. To that end, this dissertation provides a framework for beginning to tease out how the relative contributions of peripheral sensory hearing loss (loss of cochlear hair cells) on cortical processing of frequency modulated (FM) sweeps in a mouse model of presbycusis (strain C 57 /bl 6). FM sweeps are sounds that change in frequency over time. Human language and animal vocalizations contain FM sweeps. The genetic engineering tools present in the mouse make it a suitable model for probing the genetic roots and underlying mechanisms of neural dysfunction, such as is seen in presbycusis. This C 57 /bl 6 mouse strain undergoes predictable high frequency hearing loss by 6 months of age, continuing to profound hearing loss by 12 months of age. The purpose of this dissertation was to establish cortical response properties to FM sweeps as a function of age in a mouse model of presbycusis. Three experiments were performed. In the first experiment, FM sweep response properties were profiled in the young adult core auditory cortex. The main findings of the first experiment indicate that the young adult mouse auditory cortex is selective for a narrow range of FM sweep rates (between 0. 5 and 3 kHz/msec) and this selectivity is depth dependent, suggesting FM sweep processing undergoes changes within the a cortical column. The second experiment explored the mechanisms that shape FM sweep rate selectivity. The main findings of the second experiment were that two mechanisms shape FM sweep rate selectivity in the young adult cortex, <b>duration</b> <b>tuning</b> for tones and sideband inhibition. Sideband inhibition is the dominant mechanism in the auditory cortex, shaping FM sweep rate selectivity in approximately 84 % of neurons tested. <b>Duration</b> <b>tuning</b> shaped FM sweep rate selectivity in approximately 34 % of neurons tested. The third experiment compared direction selectivity, FM rate selectivity, variability, and mechanisms between three age groups, young (1 - 3 months), middle (6 - 8 months), and old (14 - 20 months). The main findings of the third experiment were that presbycusis results in decreased selectivity, slowed FM rate selectivity, increased variability and decreased reliance on sideband inhibition. The results of these studies serve as a framework for comparisons with mouse strains who do not experience age-related hearing loss...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether quantum fluctuations {{can have a}} significant impact on the evolution of the universe, by studying the (late-time) backreaction of a massless scalar field with a possible coupling xi to the Ricci scalar on an FLRW background. The main motivation for this work is the observed late-time acceleration of the universe, for which no satisfactory explanation has been given yet. At the same time, cosmological perturbation theory establishes that we can take quantum fluctuations in a gravitational setting seriously, and some of their effects are well studied and in agreement with observations. This opens up the question if the energy density and pressure of these quantum fluctuations could account for the observed late-time acceleration of the universe. In addition to the usually assumed history of the universe (an inflationary, radiation and matter dominated period), we assume an initial radiation period in order to resolve IR divergences that are otherwise present in two point correlation functions for nonzero ξ. We canonically quantize the field and compute the one loop expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor with respect to the Bunch-Davies vacuum during radiation and matter domination. We compare the expectation values with the background quantities in order to estimate the significance of the quantum backreaction. For xi< 0, we find that this backreaction can become significant, but the quantum energy density is negative during inflation and radiation. For xi<- 0. 057, the quantum energy density becomes comparable to the background energy density already during inflation, which makes late-time predictions for these values unreliable. For - 0. 057 <xi< 0, we find a transient phenomenon when the conformal Hubble rate becomes comparable to the conformal Hubble rate at the beginning of inflation. That is, when those scales become comparable, the quantum energy density goes from a period where it is negative but grows with respect to the background to a period where it is positive but decays with respect to the background. In between, there is a period where the energy density seems to grow from negative to positive rather quickly and during which the quantum fluid has negative pressure. We can <b>tune</b> the <b>duration</b> of inflation and the value of xi such that the backreaction is not too big during inflation and radiation and for which this transient behavior becomes significant at low redshift, rendering it potentially observable...|$|R

We describe how biocytin cell injections and vesicular glutamate transporter - 1 and - 2 stainings {{can be used to}} confirm localization of measured cells and to identify the central nucleus of the IC. Next, constant current injections were used to characterize the firing patterns and basic membrane properties of IC neurons. New findings include the presence of electrical synapses (spikelets), the absence of onset firing, the absence of a classic pause in buildup neurons and a description of accelerating cells. In addition, spontaneous excitatory synaptic potentials contributed to the irregularity of spike patterns!. The clearest mechanism in <b>duration</b> <b>tuning</b> seems to be synaptic integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs and synaptic adaptation, while AM tuning seems to be more influenced by the presence of calcium-dependent potassium channels and the absence of adaptation. Hyperpolarization-activated voltage-dependent sodium/potassium channel Ih can additionally shape the incoming auditory signal. FM tuning is largely determined by the synaptic integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, while membrane properties and ion-channels play a lesser role. By showing how the diversity in membrane properties and synaptic inputs can lead to specific tuning for complex sounds, we provide a cellular explanation for the contribution of the IC to central auditory processing...|$|R
40|$|Data-Centric Storage (DCS) {{appears as}} a novel {{information}} storage and delivery mechanism for Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks in which a rendezvous node (home node) is selected to store and serve all the information of a particular application. However, DCS was not designed to provide long-term data availability. In this paper we present a Dynamic DCS solution to enable a long-term storage system. Dynamic DCS proposes to periodically change home nodes over the time based on periods of fixed duration called epochs. This {{makes it possible to}} perform temporal queries to previous home nodes in order to retrieve information from the past. We evaluate our proposal using extensive simulations, and reveal that Dynamic DCS makes sensor events available at least 85 % of the maximum lifetime provided by an optimal (but non practical) solution. Finally, we show that Dynamic DCS could easily adapt its storage performance to the requirements of an application by just <b>tuning</b> the epoch <b>duration.</b> The research leading to these results has been partially funded by the Spanish MEC under the CRAMNET project (TEC 2012 38362 C 03 01) and eeCONTENT Project (TEC 2011 29688 C 02 02), by the General Directorate of Universities and Research of the Regional Government of Madrid under the ME DIANET Project (S 2009 /TIC 1468), and by the the INDECT project (Ref 218086) of the 7 th EU Framework Programme.

40|$|Auditory neurons in the {{inferior}} colliculus (IC) of the pallid bat have strong rate selective responses to downward frequency modulated (FM) sweeps {{attributable to the}} spectrotemporal pattern of their echolocation call (a brief FM pulse). Several mechanisms are known to shape FM rate selectivity within the pallid bat IC. Here we explore how two mechanisms, stimulus duration and high-frequency inhibition (HFI), can interact to shape FM rate selectivity within the same neuron. Results from extracellular recordings indicated that a derived duration-rate function (based on tonal response) was highly predictive of {{the shape of the}} FM rate response. Longpass duration selectivity for tones was predictive of slowpass rate selectivity for FM sweeps, both of which required long stimulus durations and remained intact following iontophoretic blockade of inhibitory input. Bandpass duration selectivity for tones, sensitive to only a narrow range of tone durations, was predictive of bandpass rate selectivity for FM sweeps. Conversion of the tone duration response from bandpass to longpass after blocking inhibition was coincident with a change in FM rate selectivity from bandpass to slowpass indicating an active inhibitory component to the formation of bandpass selectivity. Independent of the effect of <b>duration</b> <b>tuning</b> on FM rate selectivity, the presence of HFI acted as a fastpass FM rate filter by suppressing slow FM sweep rates. In cases where both mechanisms were present, both had to be eliminated, by removing inhibition, before bandpass FM rate selectivity was affected. It is unknown why the auditory system utilizes multiple mechanisms capable of shaping identical forms of FM rate selectivity though it may represent distinct but convergent modes of neural signaling directed at shaping response selectivity for important biologically relevant sounds...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{responses}} in the mammalian auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus; IC) arise from complex interactions of synaptic excitation, inhibition and intrinsic properties of the cell. Temporally selective duration-tuned neurons (DTNs) in the IC are hypothesized to arise through the convergence of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs offset in time. Synaptic inhibition can be inferred from extracellular recordings by presenting pairs of pulses (paired tone stimulation) and comparing the evoked responses of the cell to each pulse. We obtained single unit recordings from the IC of the awake big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) and used paired tone stimulation to measure the recovery cycle times of DTNs and non-temporally selective auditory neurons. By systematically varying the interpulse interval (IPI) of the paired tone stimulus, we determined the minimum IPI required for a neuron’s spike count or its spike latency (first- or last-spike latency) {{in response to the}} second tone to recover to within ≥ 50 % of the cell’s baseline count or to within 1 SD of it’s baseline latency in response to the first tone. Recovery times of shortpass DTNs were significantly shorter than those of bandpass DTNs, and recovery times of bandpass DTNs were longer than allpass neurons not selective for stimulus duration. Recovery times measured with spike counts were positively correlated with those measured with spike latencies. Recovery times were also correlated with first-spike latency. These findings, combined with previous studies on <b>duration</b> <b>tuning</b> in the IC, suggest that persistent inhibition is a defining characteristic of DTNs. Herein we discuss measuring recovery times of neurons with spike counts and latencies. We also highlight how persistent inhibition could determine neural recovery times and serve as a potential mechanism underlying the precedence effect in humans. Finally, we explore implications of recovery times for DTNs in the context of bat hearing and echolocation...|$|R
40|$|Feedback {{is useful}} in memoryless {{channels}} for decreasing complexity and increasing reliability; {{the capacity of the}} memoryless channels, however, can not be increased by feedback. For fixed length block codes even the decay rate of error probability with block length does not increase with feedback for most channel models. Consequently for making the physical layer more reliable for higher layers one needs go beyond the framework of fixed length block codes and consider relaxations like variable-length coding, error- erasure decoding. We strengthen and quantify this observation by investigating three problems. 1. Error-Erasure Decoding for Fixed-Length Block Codes with Feedback: Error-erasure codes with communication and control phases, introduced by Yamamoto and Itoh, are building blocks for optimal variable-length block codes. We improve their performance by changing the decoding scheme and <b>tuning</b> the <b>durations</b> of the phases, and establish inner bounds to the tradeoff between error exponent, erasure exponent and rate. We bound the loss of performance due to the encoding scheme of Yamamoto-Itoh from above by deriving outer bounds to the tradeoff between error exponent, erasure exponent and rate both with and without feedback. We also consider the zero error codes with erasures and establish inner and outer bounds to the optimal erasure exponent of zero error codes. In addition we present a proof of the long known fact that, the error exponent tradeoff between two messages is not improved with feedback. 2. Unequal Error Protection for Variable-Length Block Codes with Feedback: We use Kudrayashov's idea of implicit confirmations and explicit rejections in the framework of unequal error protection to establish inner bounds to the achievable pairs of rate vectors and error exponent vectors. Then we derive an outer bound that matches the inner bound using a new bounding technique. As a result we characterize the region of achievable rate vector and error exponent vector pairs for bit-wise unequal error protection problem for variable-length block codes with feedback. Furthermore we consider the single message message-wise unequal error protection problem and determine an analytical expression for the missed detection exponent in terms of rate and error exponent, for variable-length block codes with feedback. 3. Feedback Encoding Schemes for Fixed-Length Block Codes: We modify the analysis technique of Gallager to bound the error probability of feedback encoding schemes. Using the encoding schemes suggested by Zigangirov, D'yachkov and Burnashev we recover or improve all previously known lower bounds on the error exponents of fixedlength block codes. by Bariş Nakiboḡlu.

40|$|Sphingomyelinase (SMase) {{has been}} shown to be {{involved}} in a variety of cell regulation processes. It can convert sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide (Cer) and has been suggested to influence the cellular processes by reorganizing the cell membrane morphology. This thesis aims at a more comprehensive understanding of how sphingomyelinase (SMase) can regulate lipid membrane heterogeneity. We develop corralled model raft membranes in a microfluidic device to study the complex phase phenomena induced by SMase. The mass balance of lipid molecules in each confined corral greatly helps us to interpret results. By using the corralled membrane arrays, we are able to obtain the overall statistical distribution of the induction time of a slow domain nucleation and therefore fairly compare the membrane responses caused by different factors. In addition, the flow control by a microfluidic device solves the difficulty of distributing SMase uniformly to membrane systems. Furthermore, the laminar flow in a microchannel allows us to create model membrane arrays with a variety of lipid membrane compositions or solution conditions, which can serve as a screening tool to study a broad range of parameters associated with the interactions between lipid membranes and SMase or other peripheral proteins. We report that SMase can induce both a reaction-induced and a solvent-mediated phase transformation, causing switches of three stationary membrane morphologies and multiple-time-domain ceramide generation in model raft membranes. (cont.) During the reaction-induced phase transformation, the ceramide generated by SMase causes the disintegration of pre-existing rafts rich in sphingomyelin and cholesterol, and recruit sphingomyelin to form SM-enriched domains which are relatively inaccessible to SMase. Once most of the sphingomyelin is physically trapped in SM-enriched domains and the SM concentration in the SMase-accessible region becomes low, the morphology pauses. The pause situation is resolved after the formation of a 3 -D feature, rich in SMase, sphingomyelin (SMase's substrate), and ceramide (SMase's product), which triggers the solvent-mediated phase transformation. This 3 -D feature is hypothesized as a slowly nucleating SMase-enriched phase where SMase processes sphingomyelin at low concentration more efficiently. The disparate time-scales of the formation of these SMase-features and the SM-enriched domains allow for the development of a significant duration of the middle pause morphology between the two transformations. The results show that SMase can be actively involved in the lipid membrane phase changes. The SMase-induced multi-stage morphology evolution is not only due to the membrane compositional changes caused by SMase,but also due to the selective binding of SMase, and SMase's special phase behavior during the solvent-mediated phase transformation. We further demonstrate that lipid membrane composition and SMase concentration can be used to tune the two phase transformations and therefore the intervals and spatial patterns of Smase-induced multi-stage morphology evolution. (cont.) At a physiologically relevant concentration of SMase, we observe that membrane composition can influence the formation of SM-enriched domains and the nucleation of SMase-features at different extents of time scale and thus significantly <b>tune</b> the stable <b>duration</b> of the middle pause morphology. More importantly, the induction time of SMase-feature nucleation can be significantly decreased by increasing the supersaturating level of its three components in the membrane system. We further model the spatio-temporal morphology change during the solvent-mediated phase transformation. Three major kinetic processes are described in the model: the consumption of SM by the enzymatic reaction at an SMase-feature, the diffusion of SM from SM-enriched domains to an SMase-feature, and the release of SM due to the dissolution of SM-enriched domains. We combine MATLAB coding with Comsol, a software using finite element method to solve partial differential equations, to solve the model numerically due to the complex geometry and the moving boundary of our membrane systems. The non-dimensionality of the model allows the system to be characterized by three non-dimensional parameters. We show all of the possible scenarios of spatial pattern change during the phase transformation. The modeling results are shown to be consistent with our experimental results and can provide insights into the system parameters which are difficult to measure. by Ling Chao. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the manufacturing of complex three-dimensional structures using planar nano-fabrication techniques and a stress-driven self-assembly process in group IV semiconductors. In {{the state of}} the art, the method called nanostructured origami, advocated here, has been used to achieve controlled fabrication of rolled-up, wrinkled and folded structures in different material systems. At the same time a new field of silicon technology based on transferable and engineered nanomembranes has developed with the realization of the fact that excellent properties of bulk Si are preserved in nm-thin layers released from the substrate surface. Furthermore, strained Si and SiGe membranes have received much attention as efficient templates to improve Si based device performance. This work focuses on finely tuning the inherent strain in Si-based membranes in order to reliably fold them into rolled-up and wrinkled structures. The topics include manufacturing, in depth characterization and potential applications of the fabricated objects. All samples investigated here have a multilayered structure comprising a sacrificial layer and an all semiconductor or hybrid functional layer. A selective underetching procedure is used to release the nanomembranes from their substrates. The strain profile in the growth direction of the functional layer {{is one of the key}} parameters to define the 3 D objects forming during the release of the membranes from the substrate. Rolled-up tubes are achieved, for instance, by defining a bilayer strip in the region where bending is to take place. The upper layer of these areas is intentionally deposited with as much residual stress as possible. This intrinsic stress causes the defined slab to curl in a predictable fashion when released from the substrate by selective etching of the sacrificial film. Wrinkled structures are achieved by release of films with a uniform compressive strain from the substrate surface. Three different multilayer stacks are used here, i. e., Si:B/SiGe:B, SiGe and Si functional layers on a Si, SiO 2, and Ge sacrificial layer, respectively. Major contributions of this thesis are the fabrication of integrated microtube resistors based on Si:B/SiGe:B tubes; the use of the Ge condensation technique to tailor the strain distribution in SiGe films on insulator; the manufacturing of fully scalable and CMOS compatible all-semiconductor and hybrid tubes; the development of the REBOLA (RElease and BOndback of LAyers) technology for the fabrication of linear and circular networks formed by interconnected wrinkled structures; the experimental demonstration of light emission from Ge and Si nanoparticles integrated in a tube wall; the observation and investigation of the waveguiding effect along the axis of SiO x /Si tubes. For manufacturing of integrated microtube resistors, two-dimensional strained templates are created by MBE growth of Si:B/SiGe:B bilayers on an intrinsic Si sacrificial layer. Conventional patterning techniques are used to define a mesa for a rolled-up tube bridged between two electrodes on the strained film. The pattern is designed taking into account the anisotropic nature of Si etching by the used solution, and a preferential rolling of the film in the direction of the Si crystal. After definition of the electrical contacts in the dedicated areas, rolled-up tubes bridged between two large terminal areas are fabricated by selective etching of the Si sacrificial layer. Linear I-V curves are recorded both for unreleased and rolled-up films, and an increase of the bilayer resistance after release from the substrate is observed. Scalability of the electrical resistance of tubes is achieved by tuning the rolled-up bilayer thickness and the tube diameter. SGOI substrates with various thicknesses and Ge composition profiles are fabricated by using the Ge condensation technique. For this purpose a SiGe layer with low Ge content is epitaxially grown on an ultra-thin SOI wafer and the obtained heterostructure undergoes dry thermal oxidation. Upon exposure to oxygen gas, Si in the SiGe layer is selectively oxidized, and the Ge piles up in the semiconductor layer at the receding SiO 2 /SiGe interface. The growing and the buried oxides act as barriers for the Ge out-diffusion, leading to the simultaneous thinning and Ge enrichment of the semiconductor film. Different Ge distribution profiles are created in the SiGe films by <b>tuning</b> the <b>duration</b> and/or the temperature of the oxidation process. An in-situ post-annealing step in nitrogen atmosphere is also used to tailor the composition profile in the film. Rolled-up microtubes and interconnected wrinkled structures are fabricated by releasing SiGe films graded and homogeneous in composition, respectively, by selective etching of the buried SiO 2 layer. Hybrid metal/semiconductor tubes are fabricated by using Si and SiGe films on insulator as templates. A patterned Cr film is thermally evaporated on the SOI and SGOI substrates and a starting edge for the rolling process is defined by photolithography and RIE (reactive ion etching). The inherent tensile strain in the Cr layer creates a strain gradient sufficient to drive the upward bending of the Cr/Si or Cr/SiGe bilayer once the film is released from the substrate. The third part of the thesis focuses on functionalization of rolled-up tubes as optical devices. SiO x /Si and SiGe tubes undergo high temperature annealing treatment to induce the formation of Si and Ge nanostructures in the tube wall. Intense photoluminescence in the visible spectrum range is acquired at room temperature from these structures. A detailed investigation of light emission and propagation in SiO x /Si tube is performed. Finally the rolled-up microtubes are shown to work as optical ring-resonators and waveguides. These results conclusively demonstrate the ability to pattern Si-based membranes with nanoscale features and controllably fold them into a predetermined 3 D configuration by finely tuning the strain distribution in the membranes by well-estabilished deposition and growth processes i. e., molecular beam epitaxy, physical vapor deposition, and thermal oxidation. Future work may involve the use of selective epitaxy, local oxidation and strained metal or insulator film deposition to locally engineer the strain distribution on the same template. Selecting an appropriate geometry of starting etching windows allows in that case a batch production of different kinds of interconnected structures (tubes, coils and channel networks) by selective etching of a sacrificial buffer layer. This is a promising step to implement various functionalities, i. e, electron devices (SiGe/Si tubes as rolled-up resistors, or metal/semiconductor tubes as inductors), fluidic devices (interconnected wrinkled structures as nanofluidic channel networks), or optical devices (Si-based tubes with integrated emitters as ring-resonators or waveguides) on the same substrate and eventually on a transferable membrane. Diese Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Herstellung von komplexen dreidimensionalen Strukturen unter der Verwendung planarer Nano-Fabrikationsmethoden und Verspannungsgetriebener Selbstordnungsprozesse. Die hier vorgestellte Methode, das sogenannte nanostrukturierte Origami, wird benutzt, um gezielt gerollte und gefaltete Strukturen verschiedener Materialklassen herzustellen. Gleichzeitig hat sich ein neues Feld der Siliziumtechnologie etabliert, welches darauf beruht, dass in ultradünnen, von der Substratoberfläche losgelösten Schichten die sehr guten Eigenschaften des Siliziumfestkörpers erhalten bleiben. Des Weiteren wurde Si und SiGe Membranen vermehrt Aufmerksamkeit als Ausgangsmaterial für Si-basierte Bauelemente zuteil. Diese Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Feineinstellung der Verspannung in Si-basierten Membranen zur reproduzierbaren Herstellung von aufgerollten und gefalteten Strukturen. Die Aufgabenstellung schließt die Fertigung, die weitgehende Charakterisierung und potentielle Verwendung der Strukturen ein. Alle in dieser Arbeit verwendeten Proben bestehen aus Multilagen, die sowohl eine Opferschicht als auch eine funktionelle Halbleiter- oder Hybridlage enthalten. Durch einen selektiven Prozess werden die Nanomembranen von ihrem Substrat abgelöst. Das Verspannungsprofil in Wachstumsrichtung der funktionellen Schicht ist einer der Schlüsselparameter, um die Art der 3 D Objekte vorherzubestimmen, die sich während des Ablösens vom Substrat bilden. Die obere Lage wird dazu absichtlich mit einer maximalen Verspannung aufgebracht. Diese intrinsische Verspannung bewirkt, dass sich das zuvor festgelegte Gebiet in vorhersagbarer Weise aufrollt, wenn es durch selektives Ätzen vom Substrat abgelöst wird. Gefaltete Strukturen erhält man, wenn Lagen mit einer gleichmäßigen kompressiven Verspannung vom Substrat abgelöst werden. Drei verschiedene Multilagen werden in dieser Arbeit verwendet: Si:B/SiGe:B, SiGe und Si-basierte funktionale Schichten, die auf Si-, SiO 2 - oder Ge-Opferschichten aufgebracht werden. Die Schwerpunkte dieser Arbeit sind: die Herstellung von integrierten Mikroröhren- Transistoren auf der Basis von Si:B/SiGe:B-Röhren; die Ausnutzung von Ge-Kondensation um die Verspannung von SiGe auf Isolator-Substraten einzustellen; die Herstellung von skalierbaren und CMOS-kompatiblen Halbleiter- und Hybridröhren; die Entwicklung der REBOLA-Technik (RElease and BOnd-back of LAyers) zur Herstellung von linearen und kreisförmigen Netzwerken, die durch gefaltete und verbundene Strukturen gebildet werden; die experimentelle Demonstration der Emission von in den Tubewänden integrierten Si und Ge Nanopartikeln; sowie die Beobachtung und Untersuchung von Wellenleitung entlang der Achse von SiO x /Si Röhren. Für den Bau von integrierten Mikroröhren-Widerständen werden verspannte zweidimensionale Vorlagen mittels MBE-Wachstum aus Si:B/SiGe:B-Doppelschichten auf intrinsischen Si-Opferschichten verwendet. Klassische Strukturierungsmethoden werden verwendet, um Stege zu definieren, die zwei Elektroden mittels einer aufgerollten Mikroröhre verbinden. Die Strukturierungsmasken werden entsprechend ausgelegt, um sowohl das anisotrope selektive Ätzverhalten der verwendeten Ätzflüssigkeit, als auch die bevorzugte Rollrichtung der Doppelschicht in die -Richtung des Si-Kristalls zu berücksichtigen. Nach der Abscheidung der beiden Elektroden werden deren Anschlussgegenden durch eine Röhre miteinander verbunden, die beim selektiven entfernen der Opferschicht entsteht. Lineare I-V Kennlinien werden sowohl für den flachen, als auch den aufgerollten Film gemessen, wobei ein erhöhter Widerstand für die aufgerollte Doppelschicht beobachtet wird. Eine Skalierbarkeit des Widerstandes der Röhren wurde durch Einstellen der Wandstärke und des Röhrendurchmessers erreicht. SGOI-Substrate verschiedener Dicken und Ge-Konzentrationsprofilen werden mittels der Ge-Kondensationsmethode hergestellt. Für diesen Zweck werden dünne SiGe-Schichten mit geringer Ge-Konzentration epitaktisch auf ultra-dünnen SOI-Wafer eptiaktisch aufgewachsen und anschließend einer trockenen, thermischen Oxidation unterworfen. Wenn diese Schicht dem Sauerstoff ausgesetzt wird, oxidiert Silizium an der Oberfläche und Ge sammelt sich in der Halbleiterschicht unter der SiO x /SiGe Grenzfläche an. Sowohl das aufwachsende als auch das vergrabene SiO 2 wirken als Diffusionsbarrieren für das Ge, was zu einem simultanen Ansteigen der Ge-Konzentration und dem Abdünnen der verbleibenden Halbleiterschicht führt. Verschiedene Ge-Verteilungsprofile wurden durch gezielte Variation der Dauer und/oder der Temperatur während des Oxidationsprozesses hergestellt. Ein in-situ Nachtempern in einer Stickstoffatmosphäre wird ebenfalls benutzt, um das Verteilungsprofil im Film anzupassen. Sowohl aufgerollte Mikroröhren als auch verbundene gefaltete Netzwerkstrukturen werden durch gezieltes Ablösen von gradierten oder homogenen SiGe Schichten mittels selektiven Ätzens des SiO 2 hergestellt. Hybride Metall/Halbleitende Röhren wurden fabriziert, wobei Si- und SiGe-Schichten auf Isolator als Template dienten. Dafür wurde eine strukturierte Cr-Schicht thermisch auf ein SOI- oder SGOI-Substrat aufgedampft und Startkanten für den Aufrollprozess mittels Fotolithographie und RIE-Ätzen definiert. Die inhärent dehnungsverspannten Cr-Schichten erzeugen einen Verspannungsgradienten, der beim Ablösen der Cr/Si- oder Cr/SiGe-Doppelschichten ein Aufwärtsrollen sicherstellt. Der dritte Teil der Arbeit fokussiert sich auf die Funktionalisierung von aufgerollten Röhren als optische Bauelemente. SiO x /Si-Röhren werden hohen Temperaturen ausgesetzt, um Si- und Ge-Nanostrukturen in der Röhrenwand zu bilden. Bei Raumtemperatur wird eine intensive Fotolumineszenz der Strukturen beobachtet. Eine detaillierte Untersuchung der Lichtemission und der Lichtausbreitung in den SiO x /Si-Röhren wurde durchgeführt. Dabei wird nachgewiesen, dass aufgerollte Mikroröhren als optische Ringresonatoren und Wellenleiter genutzt werden können. Die Ergebnisse zeigen klar, dass es unter der Benutzung von wohl etablierten Abscheidungsmethoden wie Molekularstrahlepitaxie, physikalischer Gasphasenabscheidung oder thermischer Oxidation möglich ist, Si-basierte Membranen mit nanometergroßen Strukturen herzustellen und in vorherbestimmte 3 D-Konfigurationen zu überführen. Um die Verspannung auf dem benutzten Film-Template lokal einzustellen, könnten zukünftige Arbeiten von selektiver Epitaxie, lokaler Oxidation, sowie von verspannten Metallen, als auch von Isolatorschichten Gebrauch machen. Durch Auswahl einer entsprechenden Geometrie der Startfenster würde in diesem Fall die Herstellung verschiedener miteinander verbundener Strukturen (Röhren, Spulen und Kannalnetzwerken) möglich werden. Dies stellt einen vielversprechenden Ansatz dar, verschiedene funktionelle elektrische Bauelemente (SiGe/Si-Röhren als Widerstände oder Metall/Halbleiterspulen), Flüssigkeitsbauelemente (verbundene, gefaltete Netzwerkstrukturen als Nanokanäle) oder optische Bauelemente (Si-basierte Röhren mit integrierten Emittern als Ringresonatoren oder Wellenleiter) auf dem gleichen Substrat oder eventuell auf einer transferierbaren Membran unterzubringen...|$|R
