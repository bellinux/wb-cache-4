40|$|Abstract In {{this project}} we have aimed at {{covering}} {{the dimension of}} Humanities, Science and Philosophy, {{by looking at the}} debate of African philosophy. By making use of hermeneutic approaches, we have analysed <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> four different African philosophers. We have chosen to use two <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> the 1960 s and two <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> the 1980 s. This is done in order to relate the debate to the socio-historical context of Africa, and to discuss the development that has occurred in the debate. The <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> the sixties are John Mbiti´s African Religions and Philosophy(1968) and W. E. Abraham´s In the Mind of Africa(1962). The <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> the eighties are The Question of African Philosophy by P. O. Bodunrin (1984) and What Philosophy can do by Paul Hountondji (1987) ...|$|R

5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) is sick of Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) {{pointless}} text messages.

Darryl then gets a <b>text</b> <b>from</b> Andy telling {{him to come to}} the parking lot, where there are pigeons eating an ice cream cone. Darryl laughs and gives Andy a high five.|$|E

5|$|An astronomical text {{recovered}} from Tomb no.3 in Mawangdui contains images {{and descriptions of}} 29 different comets. The descriptions often include the comet's name, notes about its apparition, and its associated portent, usually military, but lack detailed dates of the comets' sightings. This text can be solidly dated as being prior to 168 BC, the date assigned to the tomb. It {{may be associated with}} a similar astronomical <b>text</b> <b>from</b> the same tomb, which details planetary motions for the seventy years ending 177 BC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} section in {{spirited}} 3/8 time, the predominant mood is of joyous exaltation reflecting the <b>text</b> <b>from</b> Isaiah. The structure of the choral material in this final section complements that of the first section; there a fugal passage was enclosed between two homophonic episodes; here a homophonic episode is preceded and followed by fugal passages. While the first section is preceded by the lengthy orchestral sinfonia, the final section ends with a short coda for full chorus and orchestra.|$|E

5|$|Much of the wordplay in {{the book}} stems {{from the use of}} {{multilingual}} puns which draw {{on a wide range of}} languages.

5|$|The most {{important}} <b>text</b> <b>from</b> the Northern Wei {{period of the}} Northern Celestial Masters is the Laojun Yinsong Jiejing (New Code). This text was revealed to Kou Qianzhi in 415, and is now mostly lost apart from a few fragments. The surviving text contains thirty-six precepts that outline rules which a Daoist had to abide by. The behavioral rules outlined proper public conduct {{and what to do}} in case of sickness. There were also guidelines describing how banquets were to be set up, as well ritual instructions concerning funeral rites, immortality practice and petitions.|$|E
5|$|At its height, Nagar {{encompassed}} most of {{the southwestern}} half of the Khabur Basin, and was a diplomatic and political equal of the Eblaite and Mariote states. The kingdom included at least 17 subordinate cities, such as Hazna, and most importantly Nabada, which was a city-state annexed by Nagar, {{and served as a}} provincial capital. Nagar was involved in the wide diplomatic network of Ebla, and the relations between the two kingdoms involved both confrontations and alliances. A <b>text</b> <b>from</b> Ebla mention a victory of Ebla's king (perhaps Irkab-Damu) over Nagar. However, a few years later, a treaty was concluded, and the relations progressed toward a dynastic marriage between princess Tagrish-Damu of Ebla, and prince Ultum-Huhu, Nagar's monarch's son.|$|E

5|$|B'alam Nehn (often {{referred}} to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring that he was seventh in line from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. Stela15 records that he was already ruling Copán by AD504. B'alam Nehn is the only king of Copán to be mentioned in a hieroglyphic <b>text</b> <b>from</b> outside of the southeastern Maya region. His name appears in a text on Stela16 from Caracol, a site in Belize. The stela dates to AD534, but the text is not well understood. B'alam Nehn undertook major construction projects in the Acropolis, building over an early palace {{with a number of}} important structures.|$|E
5|$|During the North American {{localization}} of Pokémon, a small {{team led}} by Hiro Nakamura went through the individual Pokémon, renaming them for western audiences based on their appearance and characteristics after approval from Nintendo Co. Ltd. In addition, during this process, Nintendo trademarked the 151 Pokémon names {{in order to ensure}} they would be unique to the franchise. During the translation process, it became apparent that simply altering the games' <b>text</b> <b>from</b> Japanese to English was impossible; the games had to be entirely reprogrammed from scratch due to the fragile state of their source code, a side effect of the unusually lengthy development time. Therefore, the games were based on the more modern Japanese version of Blue; modeling its programming and artwork, but keeping the same distribution of Pokémon found in the Japanese Red and Green cartridges, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In Jainism, God has no {{role to play}} in an individual's destiny; one's {{personal}} destiny is {{not seen}} as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather {{as a result of its}} own personal karma. A <b>text</b> <b>from</b> a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati sūtra 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven.|$|E
