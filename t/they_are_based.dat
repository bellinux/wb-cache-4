5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E
5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other organisms in that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty acids in the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E

These are {{generated}} {{in line with}} the reporting requirements in the country <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> or if they are large enough they may produce them under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), an example of this is the UK based charity Oxfam. If the organisation is small it may use a cash basis accounting but larger ones generally use accrual basis accounting for their funds.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bronze and}} silver coins have mainly {{been found in}} Aksum territory, with very few pieces found in Judea, Meroë and Egypt. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> roughly {{on the size of}} older Roman As and Sestertius in shape and thickness.

The name is unknown so it is referred to as an Æ diameter in mm Unit, like Æ17 for a coin of 17mm.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large {{boulders}} and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> on previous art works, {{rather than on}} direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.|$|E

Afterwards, an artificial weathering process was applied to give the appearance of a historic train.|$|E
5|$|Third dance {{movement}} (Scherzo or minuet) in the tonic, {{in overall}} A–B–A ternary form, with a trio in either ternary or binary form, {{and in a}} conventionally related key (relative major, subdominant, and parallel minor respectively). <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> on their sonata's first movements, with a similar tonal scheme and/or motivic reference. The B section of each piece features tonalities serving important dramatic functions in previous movements. Each features animated, playful figurations for the right hand and abrupt changes in register.|$|E
5|$|A {{defining}} {{aspect of}} the series is the Personas, manifestations of a person's psyche. Many Personas used up to Persona 3 are inspired by Graeco-Roman mythology. In Persona 4 <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> on Japanese deities; Persona 5 uses characters inspired by popular fictional and historical outlaws. The summoning ritual for Personas in battle varies throughout the series: in early games, the party gains the ability to summon through a short ritual after playing a parlor game; in Persona 3, they fire a gun-like device called an Evoker at their head; in Persona 4, they summon their Personas using Tarot cards; in Persona 5, they are summoned through the characters' masks.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of these new agents are still uncertain, because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> {{on the results of}} a relatively small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E

He offers to arrange a Purple Heart for Staros, to avoid the unit's name being stained by having an officer removed from command. Witt comes across the locals and notices that they have grown distant and distrustful of him and quarrel regularly with one another.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the game}} include a mixture of platforming, {{swimming}} and on-rails levels. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> around several returning themes including forests, cliff-sides, factories and mountain tops. The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors, which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles. Every level has an enemy called a Koin; each of these enemies bears the DK Coin of their respective level, holding it as a shield. As these enemies always face towards the player, they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel over them so it bounces off a wall behind {{them in order to}} strike them from behind. The game overworld is also more complex, allowing players to explore between each area instead of forcing them along a linear path. To achieve this, the game includes several vehicles such as a speedboat and hovercraft which can be used to traverse the overworld and access different worlds.|$|E

5|$|The Lord of the Rings film {{series is}} a series of epic fantasy-drama films {{directed}} by Peter Jackson. The three films, entitled , , and , were released serially worldwide between December 2001 and 2003. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> on J. R. R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novel, The Lord of the Rings, adapted for the screen by Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens. Set in Tolkien's fictional Middle-earth, the plot follows the hobbit Frodo Baggins and his fellow members of the Fellowship of the Ring as they embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, which will rid Middle-earth of the Dark Lord Sauron. A large ensemble cast was featured in the series, which included Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Andy Serkis, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, John Noble, Bernard Hill, David Wenham, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, and Brad Dourif.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{forecasting}} also {{relies on}} {{data provided by}} numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist: Statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that {{is not based on}} the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.|$|E
