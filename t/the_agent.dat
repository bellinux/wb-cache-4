40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} multiagent search in an unknown environment. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> are autonomous in nature and are equipped with necessary sensors {{to carry out the}} search operation. The uncertainty, or lack of information about the search area is known a priori as a probability density function. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> are deployed in an optimal way so as to maximize the one step uncertainty reduction. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> continue to deploy themselves and reduce uncertainty till the uncertainty density is reduced over the search space below a minimum acceptable level. It has been shown, using LaSalle’s invariance principle, that a distributed control law which moves each of <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> towards <b>the</b> centroid of its Voronoi partition, modified by the sensor range leads to single step optimal deployment. This principle is now used to devise search trajectories for <b>the</b> <b>agents.</b> <b>The</b> simulations were carried out in 2 D space with saturation on speeds of <b>the</b> <b>agents.</b> <b>The</b> results show that the control strategy per step indeed moves <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> to <b>the</b> respective centroid and the algorithm reduces the uncertainty distribution to the required level within a few steps.
