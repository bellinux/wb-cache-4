5|$|A {{controller}} in {{the cockpit}} allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and <b>take-off.</b> Following <b>take-off</b> and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E

And in May, {{acting on a}}nother NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for <b>take-off</b> at night.|$|E

5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field <b>take-off</b> and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter <b>take-off</b> and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had not had}} any mechanical {{or technical}} errors or problems prior to <b>take-off.</b> The turbulence and wind shear caused a crack in either the tail rudder, the tailplane, or both. This was caused by strong winds acting {{on both sides of}} the structure, due to shifting winds. These structural failures caused the aircraft to crash. Out of the 63 seconds from <b>take-off</b> to impact, the aircraft was under control for the first 55 seconds; only during the last 8 seconds did the crew not have control over the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|They {{were also}} able to {{determine}} all of the flight control surfaces, including the elevators, ailerons and rudder, were functioning properly {{at the point of}} the crash, and there were no faults in the flight control system. The flaps were extended to between 15° and 20°, the standard setting for <b>take-off.</b> The propeller blades of No. 4 engine on the far right side of the aircraftwere reversedminus 8°, while the blades of Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines were at 34° positive pitch (also standard for <b>take-off).</b>|$|E
5|$|As well as {{supplying}} {{air to the}} engine, {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Korean War, {{a number}} of {{aircraft}} companies in both Europe and America separately decided to investigate the prospective of vertical <b>take-off</b> and landing (VTOL) aircraft, which would eliminate the requirement for vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach. In addition to military applications, the prospect of applying such technology to commercial airliners was also viewed with considerable interest by the mid 1950s, thus the value of developing viable vertical <b>take-off</b> systems was judged to be substantial. However, even during this era, few companies had envisioned that a VTOL aircraft would also be realistically compatible with the characteristics of high performance military aircraft.|$|E

5|$|On 12 April 1990, Widerøe Flight 839 crashed {{one minute}} after <b>take-off,</b> killing all five on board.

5|$|On 16 December 1982, B-52G 57-6482, {{assigned}} to 328th BS, 93rd BW, Castle AFB, California, was {{participating in a}} Minimum Interval <b>Take-Off</b> (MITO; 12 seconds between each aircraft on takeoff) from Mather AFB, CA. The incident aircraft was in the number two position of a three-ship group. The B-52G was equipped with water injection to give additional thrust for <b>take-off,</b> but the lead aircraft was not equipped with this system. After takeoff the aircraft began to rapidly overtake the lead, so the pilot retarded the throttles rapidly, causing flameout of four engines. The aircraft then stalled and crashed. Nine crew members were killed.|$|E

On 6 February 1958, the {{flight back to}} Manchester carrying the Manchester United team and journalists made a refuelling stop at Munich-Riem Airport in poor weather. Two <b>take-off</b> attempts were abandoned due to engine problems, with the weather continuing to deteriorate. On the third attempt, slush on the runway prevented the aircraft from reaching the required speed for <b>take-off.</b> The plane veered off the runway and crashed into a house. One of 23 victims of the disaster, Swift {{was one of two}} journalists pulled alive from the wreckage but died on his way to hospital, as his seat belt had cut into his aorta.|$|E
5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the {{propellers}} were reversed prior to <b>take-off</b> they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again {{in the air to}} produce forward thrust if full power was applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except <b>take-off)</b> power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E
