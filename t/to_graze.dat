5|$|A herd {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s. It is unclear whether the Bankers swam over from nearby Shackleford or were left by residents who had used the islands <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> livestock. They are owned and managed {{by the state of}} North Carolina and regarded as a cultural resource.|$|E
5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which enables them <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> on the periphyton, the biological film that grows on stones and other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped in the net as water flows through.|$|E

5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed {{regularly}} and the giant is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, coupled with a wet spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E
5|$|Stroma is now abandoned, {{with the}} houses of its former {{inhabitants}} unoccupied and falling into ruin. Its population fell gradually through {{the first half of}} the 20th century as inhabitants drifted away to seek opportunities elsewhere, as economic problems and Stroma's isolation made life on the island increasingly unsupportable. From an all-time peak of 375 people in 1901, the population fell to just 12 by 1961 and the last islanders left at the end of the following year. Stroma's final abandonment came in 1997 when the lighthouse keepers and their families departed. The island is now owned by one of its former inhabitants, who uses it <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> cattle and sheep.|$|E
5|$|The common {{hippopotamus}} inhabits rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps, where territorial bulls preside over {{a stretch of}} river and groups of five to thirty females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near {{each other in the}} water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land. The hippopotamus is a highly aggressive and unpredictable animal and has attacked humans. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.|$|E

5|$|The first {{pavilion}} {{was designed}} by architect C.H. Strange. It was built in 1903 {{at a cost of}} £1,200 and was destroyed in a suffragette arson attack in April 1913. During the First World War, the Nevill Ground was requisitioned by the British army <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> cavalry horses. This damaged the pitch and it took a few years for it to recover. During the Second World War, the Nevill Ground was again requisitioned for military purposes, this time to hold soldiers. In 1946, ownership of the ground was transferred from the Tunbridge Wells Cricket, Football and Athletic Club to Tunbridge Wells Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|Though quite agile on land (capable {{of running}} {{as fast as}} a horse), capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are {{excellent}} swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes, an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out of the water. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing in mud. They rest around midnight and then continue <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> before dawn.|$|E
5|$|Feral {{horses are}} {{documented}} as {{living in the}} Pryor Mountains by the early 1700s, although {{they may have been}} there since the late 1600s. By the late 1800s, thousands of feral horses inhabited the area. In the early 1900s, many of the unbranded horses were rounded up, to allow domesticated livestock <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> the range without competition, and by 1964 there were only around 200 horses left. In 1964, the BLM announced that the horses would be removed altogether, to the outrage of the public. The controversy continued until 1968, when the BLM was legally stopped from removing all of the horses, and the area declared a Wild Horse Refuge. After the 1971 signing of the WFRHBA, the BLM spent the 1980s and 1990s conducting population studies and developing management and adoption policies; during this time, numerous genetic studies were also completed.|$|E

5|$|Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, {{producing}} strongly flavoured {{lamb and}} mutton and a coarse, grey wool. This slowly maturing breed {{is one of}} the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her heaf (the local term for heft), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%. This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models in this study was Diplodocus, which they found would have held its neck at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.|$|E
5|$|Like Yellowstone National Park before it, Yosemite National Park was {{at first}} {{administered}} by various units of the United States Army. Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the new park on May 19, 1891, and set up Camp A.E. Wood (now the Wawona Campground) in Wawona. Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park. Approximately 100,000 sheep were illegally led into Yosemite's high meadows each year. The Army lacked legal authority to arrest the herders, but instead escorted them several days' hike from their flock, which left the sheep vulnerable. By the late 1890s sheep grazing {{was no longer a}} problem, but at least one herder continued <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> his sheep in the park into the 1920s.|$|E
30|$|Ease {{of access}} <b>to</b> <b>grazing</b> areas {{within the region}} was {{negatively}} affecting forage availability indicating that the easier the access, the more forage pastoralists had access to, to compared to when access is restricted.

5|$|Sawtooth National Forest {{balances}} {{interests of}} different groups, {{such as those}} interested in recreation, preservation, or resource extraction. The forest practices conservation of resources, in some areas allowing for production of raw materials, such as lumber for construction purposes and wood pulp for paper products, alongside recreational uses, while in other areas only recreation is permitted. Additionally, mineral extraction through mining and {{oil and natural gas}} exploration and recovery are also conducted, though in Sawtooth National Forest this has become less common due to a consensus to protect the natural surroundings. Leases offered to ranchers to allow them <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> cattle and sheep on the forest are common. The forest provides guidelines and enforces environmental regulations to ensure that resources are not overexploited and that necessary commodities are available for future generations.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
5|$|The Bow Back Rivers cross an area {{originally}} {{known as}} Stratford Marsh, {{an area of}} common Lammas land, where inhabitants had common rights <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> horses and cattle between Lammas Day (1 August) and Lady Day (25 March), but which was used for growing hay {{for the rest of}} the year. The Marsh was between Stratford-Langthorne and Stratford-at-Bow. Little remains from pre-history, but the names suggest that the two settlements lay at either end of a stone causeway across the marsh. Remains of a stone causeway have been found, but no traces of an associated road. The ford at Old Ford is of pre-Roman origin, part of a route from London to Essex which crossed Bethnal Green. In the Roman era, a new road was built from London to the ford, which carried the principal road to Colchester. There may also have been a ford further south at Bow, and a further causeway existed between Homerton and Leyton, known as Wanstead Slip.|$|E

40|$|Grazing at low {{stocking}} {{rates is}} often recommended {{for the preservation}} of the characteristic biodiversity of open landscapes. However, the fine-tuning of grazing management still lacks a good evidence base. This is particularly true for insect communities, as available evidence indicates that these are more vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>grazing</b> than plant communities. The outcome, however, may be expected to differ between insect species. Here, we analysed the impact of different grazing intensities on insect communities from lowland heathlands in the Netherlands. Firstly, we use detailed data on butterfly distribution and abundances to analyse population responses of 10 butterfly species <b>to</b> heathland <b>grazing</b> management. Secondly, we investigated species responses <b>to</b> <b>grazing</b> intensity on 16 field locations across a range of insect groups (butterflies, day-active moths, grasshoppers, and ants). We hypothesized that species from early successional stages would benefit from grazing whereas late-successional species would suffer from grazing. Moreover, we expected summer <b>grazing</b> <b>to</b> have less beneficial effects than year-round grazing. Both hypotheses were largely supported by our results. Species responses <b>to</b> <b>grazing</b> contrasted between early and late successional species. Variation in species responses were strongly linked <b>to</b> <b>grazing</b> intensity and soil moisture, reflecting species-specific niches in relation to vegetation structure and microclimate. We conclude that low-intensity year-round cattle grazing or herded sheep grazing may promote insect biodiversity in large, heterogeneous heathlands, whereas targeted or rotational grazing may be advisable in smaller areas. </p...|$|R
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{stated in}} its {{forecast}} on September3 that Gabrielle had a 10percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days. On September5, meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass {{north of the}} Virgin Islands and told the press {{that it is too}} early to suggest that the storm might hit the United States four or five days ahead of its current position. As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, the National Hurricane Center forecast the outer edge of the hurricane <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies.|$|E
5|$|Towns {{around the}} forest, {{including}} Stanley, Ketchum, and Sawtooth City, were founded as mining {{towns in the}} latter part of the 19thcentury by prospectors and trappers, including Civil War veteran Captain John Stanley, after whom the town of Stanley is named. Ketchum is named after the trapper and guide David Ketchum, while the Sublett Mountains are named after trapper William Sublette, who lived in the area in the 1830s. Most of the logging in the region was for firewood and timber for miners and homesteaders. For much of the 20thcentury, sheep and cattle grazing were the primary large-scale land uses of the forest. Sheep drives were common in the Wood River Valley after the mining boom and shepherds from southern Idaho drove their flocks north <b>to</b> <b>graze</b> the upper elevation areas in Sawtooth National Forest. The original sheepherders were Basque Americans, while today many of the sheepherders are Peruvians contracted through the Department of Labor.|$|E
5|$|Among harem-holding species, {{the adult}} females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more {{promiscuous}} and the males have larger testes for sperm competition. Estrous in female equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread {{and raise their}} tails when {{in the presence of}} a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares will come into estrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals will attempt <b>to</b> <b>graze,</b> but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like the Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{theoretical}} frameworks suggest three predictions relevant <b>to</b> <b>grazing</b> {{effects in}} Australian aridlands: grazing {{has a negative}} but moderate effect on plant species richness; a separate "state" resulting from degradation caused by extreme grazing will be evident; some plant species will have a strong association with grazing relief refuges that have only ever been subject <b>to</b> light <b>grazing.</b> These predictions were examined in the dune swales of an Australian desert, with data on herbaceous species collected along transects up to 14 km from artificial water points between four and 33 years old. A cumulative grazing index was constructed utilizing both the spatial occupation patterns of cattle {{and the length of}} exposure. Despite restricting sampling to a narrow habitat, silt/clay content and soil pH influence floristic patterns independent of grazing. The analysis of quadrat data in relation <b>to</b> <b>grazing</b> revealed almost no patterns in plant cover, species richness (at two different scales), or abundance across plant life-form groups. Five species had an increasing response, and seven a decreasing response, while the only species restricted to areas of extremely low grazing pressure was sufficiently rare that it could have occurred there by chance. The dominant annual grass, the most common shrub, and a perennial tussock-forming sedge all decrease with high levels of grazing. Most species exhibit an ephemeral life strategy in response to unreliable rainfall, and this boom and bust strategy effectively doubles as an adaptation <b>to</b> <b>grazing.</b> After 20 years of exposure <b>to</b> managed <b>grazing</b> with domestic stock in Australian dune swales, patterns in species richness have not emerged in response <b>to</b> <b>grazing</b> pressure, the ecosystem has not been transformed to another degradation "state," and {{there is no evidence that}} grazing relief refuges provide havens for species highly sensitive <b>to</b> <b>grazing...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out to assess farmers’ views on dairy cow grazing in a region where, {{due to a lack}} of water and {{biodiversity}} protection, the replacement of maize by grass is encouraged. The results show that farmers think that grass is possible only for certain types of farm and cattle. Reverting <b>to</b> <b>grazing</b> involves a decrease in production per cow per year, and farmers with huge investments in cowsheds or who exhibit at agricultural shows cannot accept these consequences. But there are some young farmers, with the ‘right’ type of fields, who are concerned with ecological issues, and whose fathers have grazed cattle in the past, who are reverting <b>to</b> <b>grazing.</b> Issues related <b>to</b> <b>grazing</b> management, especially how to manage a mixed ration with grazing and winter feed, are discussed...|$|R
