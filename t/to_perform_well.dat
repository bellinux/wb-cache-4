WhiteWater World continued to exceed Macquarie Leisure's expectations {{during its first}} year of operation. The first year saw 493,227 guests, exceeding the 450,000 estimate, earning the park over $8.4million in revenue. The park continued <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> in subsequent years with an 18.4% increase in attendance in 2008.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} format {{was used}} for the 1999 and 2003 World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the Super 6. The Super 6 teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> in the group stages. The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} as an All-Star, McGrady was {{frequently}} criticized for not having led any team beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, feeling that he was the victim of bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and toughness were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and ability <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> in big games.|$|E
5|$|On the {{defensive}} line, defensive tackle Jonathan Lewis {{was considered a}} key player. Though limited by a cast protecting a broken pinky finger suffered during Virginia Tech's game against Virginia, Lewis was expected to continue <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well.</b> Heading into the Sugar Bowl, Lewis had 38tackles, including 10tackles for loss and foursacks. Also on {{the defensive}} line was Darryl Tapp, who led the team in sacks, tackles for loss, and quarterback hurries. Tapp earned first-team All-ACC honors and had 55tackles and one interception during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{military}} {{record in}} 1862–63 was mixed. In December 1862, forces {{under his command}} suffered a severe repulse at the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou, just north of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Soon after, his XV Corps was ordered to join Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand in his successful assault on Arkansas Post, generally regarded as a politically motivated distraction from the effort to capture Vicksburg. Before the Vicksburg Campaign {{in the spring of}} 1863, Sherman expressed serious reservations about the wisdom of Grant's unorthodox strategy, but he went on <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> in that campaign under Grant's supervision.|$|E

Monteiro continued <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> {{as a starter}} in replacing Melquan Bolding, leading the team with 21 points. Next up for the team was the annual City Game match-up between Duquesne and its crosstown rival Pitt. In front of 12,336fans at the Mellon Arena, Duquesne sprang out to a 16-point lead before slipping and losing 58–67 in double overtime. Bill Clark led all players with 23points but the team hit foul trouble, with Saunders, Monteiro, and Peggau all fouling out in the final minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies' All-American {{tailback}} Lee Suggs {{had suffered}} a season-ending injury {{in the first game}} of the season, but freshman Kevin Jones had carried the offense for the season, and continued <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> in the post-season Gator Bowl game. With a 5-yard run from Jones and a 55-yard pass from Grant Noel to André Davis, Tech took a 1713 lead going into the fourth quarter. But the lead quickly evaporated on a 77-yard catch and run from Chris Rix to Javon Walker.|$|E
5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> in sunny climates when {{not exposed to}} {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier {{than they have in}} the past.|$|E

Megadeth continued the Tour of Duty in South America and Mexico in May and June. A compilation album, , {{was released in}} September 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Clarke to the ODI {{team for the}} Pakistan series also saw White move down the order again, {{although}} batting at number five, he made his second international century in the first match, scoring 105 from 88 balls to help drive Australia to victory. White continued <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> with the bat in the series, making a half-century in the second match and making decent totals {{in a number of}} the other games as Australia swept the series 5–0.|$|E
5|$|Franchitti was {{considered}} one of the favorites to win the race having won the event two years previously and hoped to keep a recent string of good results in the 2001 season going at the track. Bräck expected <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> despite retiring from the previous year's event and hoped he could regain the momentum he built {{from the start of the}} season. The race's defending champion Michael Andretti had secured six of his 40 career victories in Toronto and stated that he did not know if luck played a part but noted his driving style was suited to the circuit. Having finished in the points-scoring position in three of the previous four races, Alex Tagliani said it encouraged him heading into the Indy Toronto.|$|E

5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{to begin}} the 1975 season, Ellis {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> {{at the beginning of}} the season. In August, the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights. On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day. Ellis called for a team meeting the next day, where he was expected to apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher out of the clubhouse and attempting to fight him. Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis. The Pirates suspended Ellis for thirty days and fined him $2,000. The suspension was lifted on August 30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.|$|E
5|$|Heskey's {{place in}} the England squad had been placed under {{scrutiny}} in 2003 {{with the emergence of}} Wayne Rooney into the England squad. However, despite being criticised for his lack of international goals, he continued to {{be an integral part of}} the international squad and took over the captaincy from Michael Owen after he was substituted when England beat Serbia and Montenegro 2–1 in his hometown of Leicester in June 2003. Heskey was named in the England squad for UEFA Euro 2004, but failed <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well,</b> and was the subject of much criticism. He came on as a substitute while England were leading 1–0 against France and fouled Claude Makélélé on the edge of the penalty area, giving away a direct free kick from which France equalised. England eventually lost 2–1.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, Oklahoma {{promoted}} Bud Wilkinson, then {{an assistant}} coach, to head coach. Wilkinson led the Sooners to national championships in 1950, 1955, and 1956, {{as well as}} a stretch of 47 consecutive victories that began in 1953 and ended in 1957. Wilkinson's tenure included a streak of 13consecutive conference championships (in addition to one by his predecessor). Oklahoma continued <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> after Wilkinson left, but only returned to the national title picture following the hiring of Barry Switzer in 1973. Switzer began similarly to Wilkinson, with eight consecutive conference championships in addition to national championships in 1974 and 1975. Switzer added Oklahoma's sixth national championship in 1985.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the Tornado <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E
5|$|One {{month after}} moving to Diego-Suarez, Jaojoby entered a local talent {{competition}} and managed to win despite singing unaccompanied and without a microphone. He began to perform in nightclubs whenever the opportunity presented itself. The uncle with whom he was lodging sent word of Jaojoby's activities to the young singer's parents, who consulted a priest before giving their son permission to continue exploring his musical talents {{on the condition that}} he continue <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> at school. Jaojoby agreed to this provision, studying during the day and performing at night for several years. In 1972 he began singing with Los Matadores, the well-established house band of the Saigonais nightclub in Diego-Suarez. This group catered to the club's primarily Western clientele by performing cover songs and rhythm and blues compositions in French and English, occasionally incorporating traditional instruments like kabosy and drums, or experimenting with local musical styles using electric guitar, bass, and drum kit, accompanied by traditional Malagasy language vocal performance.|$|E
