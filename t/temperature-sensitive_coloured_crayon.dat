He also received several commissions from the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia.|$|R

According to Evans [...] "I {{was sure he was}} writing under the table; I heard the faint rubbing of a soft bit of pencil upon the surface of a slate... several times I saw him put his fingers into his vest pockets, and he appeared to bring up small particles of something, which I believe were bits of the white and <b>coloured</b> <b>crayons</b> used in writing the messages." ...|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from her}} ceramic work at Kiel, it is {{extremely}} difficult to date Marquardt’s work. This is because her principal expressionist style remained remarkably consistent. Most of the work known to survive probably post-dates the Second World War. Whether more of her earlier work will be discovered remains to be seen. Her most typical work favours strong outlines and sweeping diagonals, often with stern, unsmiling faces. However, there are also gentler, more naturalistic depictions, particularly of trees, that look back to German Romanticism of the nineteenth century, also powerful woodcut-like pen and ink portraits that owe much to Dürer. She very rarely dated her work. On works where a date appears it is very likely that they have been subsequently added to make them appear earlier than they in truth are. Though some pictures are signed, many are not. There are paintings in oil, but most of her known surviving work is on paper, using a variety of media, often mixing <b>coloured</b> <b>crayons</b> with water colour.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the changes}} {{occurring}} in the plasma levels of progesterone and LH during the oestrous cycle of sheep have been well documented, there is some doubt about the pattern of plasma FSH concentrations. We present some data on the levels of all three hormones in {{a limited number of}} plasma samples taken from ewes experiencing normal oestrous cycles. Eight 3 -year-old Cheviot ewes were kept in a paddock with a vasectomized ram during October and November. The ram was fitted with a marking harness and the <b>coloured</b> <b>crayon</b> on the harness was changed every 15 days. The ewes were examined daily and the day that a ewe was first marked by the ram was designated Day 0 of the cycle. Blood samples were taken from thejugular vein into heparinized 10 ml Vacutainers (Becton-Dickinson U. K. Ltd) and were centrifuged at 4 =deg 1 hr. Plasma was stored at 15 =deg until required for hormone assays. Blood samples were generally taken between 09. 30 and 11. 30 hours each day, but around the time of oestrus samples were taken at approximately 09. 00 hours (Sample a), 12. 00 hours (Sample b) an...|$|R

This contains items all starting with a particular letter of the alphabet which he then uses to produce a piece of art. He also presented another segment where he demonstrates effective methods to make pictures like <b>coloured</b> pencils, wax <b>crayons</b> and so on.|$|R
40|$|Sketches, {{mainly in}} pencil and crayon, made by Olive Muriel Pink of flowers {{found in the}} north of South Australia, Central and North Australia. The {{majority}} were made between June and December 1930, after a five year drought in Central Australia had broken earlier that year, at various places along the railway between Port Augusta and Alice Springs, especially Beltana, Callanna Resevoir and Edwards Creek in South Australia and Finke, Horseshoe Bend and Rodinga in the Northern Territory, and a few at Darwin, the McDonnell Ranges and one near The Granites. Later sketches were made in various parts of Australia between 1931 and 1960, but often without a note of the place and date. The sketches were often hurriedly made on pieces of thin, cheap paper, or even pieces of cardboard or brown paper. Some were <b>coloured</b> with <b>crayon</b> and a few, more finished drawings were coloured with water colours...|$|R
50|$|Prudence 'Prue' Charity King Prue is a fourteen-year-old {{girl who}} is homeschooled by her father. She is rather artistic but is {{not very good at}} maths. Prudence wants to go to art college but her father does not allow her. However, she {{continuously}} spends all her pocket money on sketchbooks, soft pencils and <b>coloured</b> <b>crayons</b> in hope of becoming a professional artist. Her father later sent her to math classes with Miss Roberts, but after the first time, Prue did so badly and hated it there, so she gives up and skives from her classes, spending £60.00 in the process on chocolate which she later shares with Grace, magazines, food from McDonald's, art materials and some expensive lingerie. Prue's father finds out and gets so worked up about it that he has a stroke and has to leave for the hospital immediately. After much thinking over, the girls’ mother decides to send them to the nearest public school, Wentworth High, while still keeping it a secret from their father. In her art classes, Prue gets a crush on her art teacher, Rax. She grows closer to him, especially when he invites her to babysit for him, which she accepts. The last time she babysits, she confronts Rax about her love for him, and they kiss. After her father finds out they are going to school, Prue goes to Rax, upset and distraught that her father might stop her going. Sarah walks in and sees Prue hugging Rax and telling him she loves him. After Prue's English class goes badly, Ms Godfrey asks them to name some modern-day versions of Romeo and Juliet, before Sarah says Prue and Rax. Ms Godfrey contacts Ms Wilmot, who sees Sarah and then Prue, whom she expels. After her last session in the Success Maker, Prue is met by Grace, who tells her what she has heard. Prue tells her that she has been expelled. Rax is waiting for her in his car. They drive off, and although Prue begs to go with him, they say goodbye and Rax drives to her house, before she leaves him.|$|R
