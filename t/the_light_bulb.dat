50|$|Consider a {{very simple}} circuit {{consisting}} of four <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> and one 6 V battery. If a wire joins the battery to one bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, {{then back to the}} battery, in one continuous loop, the bulbs are said to be in series. If each bulb is wired to the battery in a separate loop, the bulbs are said to be in parallel. If <b>the</b> four <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> are connected in series, there is same current through all of them, and the voltage drop is 1.5 V across each bulb, which may not be sufficient to make them glow. If <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> are connected in parallel, the currents through <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> combine to form the current in the battery, while the voltage drop is across each bulb and they all glow.|$|R
25|$|Since a {{filament}} {{breaking in}} a gas-filled bulb can form an electric arc, which may spread between the terminals and draw very heavy current, intentionally thin lead-in wires or more elaborate protection devices are therefore {{often used as}} fuses built into <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b> More nitrogen is used in higher-voltage lamps to reduce the possibility of arcing.|$|E
25|$|In 1875 Swan {{returned}} {{to consider the}} problem of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> {{with the aid of}} a better vacuum and a carbonized thread as a filament. The most significant feature of Swan's improved lamp was that there was little residual oxygen in the vacuum tube to ignite the filament, thus allowing the filament to glow almost white-hot without catching fire. However, his filament had low resistance, thus needing heavy copper wires to supply it.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighting}} is usually embedded into the circular {{walls of the}} tunnel and shines in through windows. If the light were mounted on the inside surface of the tunnel in a conventional manner, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> would generate turbulence as the air blows around it. Similarly, observation is usually done through transparent portholes into the tunnel. Rather than simply being flat discs, these lighting and observation windows may be curved to match the cross-section of the tunnel and further reduce turbulence around the window.|$|E

25|$|An {{incandescent}} light bulb, incandescent lamp or {{incandescent light}} globe is an electric light {{with a wire}} filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.|$|E

500|$|During shooting, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes.
