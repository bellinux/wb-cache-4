25|$|The {{case was}} filed by {{attorneys}} {{in private practice}} on July 1, 2014, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs were six same-sex couples. Two of the couples had been refused marriage licenses in Colorado. Another two had been married in California and one on Washington state. The sixth couple, like several others, had a Colorado civil union. The complaint referenced the recent Tenth Circuit decision in Kitchen v. Herbert. The main defendants, the state's governor and attorney general, agreed with the plaintiffs that the court should issue an injunction declaring the same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional, but wanted the court <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> injunction pending resolution of the question by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|During the {{previous}} day at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Italy's World Cup hopes seemed to be diminishing fast as goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off with the game still at 0–0. Yet despite this, Italy {{was still able to}} salvage an important 1–0 victory. Norway would ultimately pay a price for their inability to take advantage of Pagliuca's dismissal. With the four teams level on points, the final two group games would each have to finish as draws for things <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> way. Republic of Ireland made it through after a dreary 0–0 draw with Norway; midfielders Massaro and Bernal traded strikes as Italy and Mexico played to a 1–1 draw.|$|E

500|$|Davies {{created the}} {{expectation}} of Rose's return in the fourth series by mentioning her in dialogue and featuring Piper in cameo appearances in [...] "Partners in Crime", [...] "The Poison Sky", and [...] "Midnight". Speaking on how Rose's character had changed between her appearances, Davies described the fourth series Rose as [...] "tougher, more independent, and [...] might, at times, seem a little harder". Piper stated she rewatched her earlier episodes to remember how the character spoke and acted as {{she felt she had}} [...] "been playing posh birds" [...] since she left the programme and by contrast [...] "Rose {{is a bit of a}} chav". Rose is re-united with the Doctor near the climax of [...] "The Stolen Earth". Director Graeme Harper insisted that the scene appear [...] "mystical" [...] because the characters' reunion was [...] "the most magical moment" [...] in the entire episode and Ernie Vincze, the Director of Photography for the show, compared the scene's feeling to the 1980s science-fiction film Blade Runner. Davies characterised the reunion between Rose and the Doctor as [...] "the biggest romance [...] has ever seen" [...] and joked that seminal films such as Gone with the Wind should have ended with a Dalek shooting the male lead. He had difficulty splitting up the characters for a second time for the necessity of the plot. He felt that [...] "Rose has to be stupid to fall in love with Doctor #2" [...] because [...] "she's doing what the plot demands, not what she'd demand". At one stage he considered giving an explanation that Rose's dimension hopping and the Dalek's meddling with reality had contaminated her with [...] "voidstuff" [...] and that she would die if she stayed in her original universe. In the final episode it is enough for her <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> the human Doctor needs her and is able to reciprocate her love. Porter felt that the climax of [...] "Journey's End" [...] indicated that [...] "Rose's role as a sidekick has been completed" [...] as she has a second Doctor to humanise, one who she can be equals with.|$|E
500|$|Katherine Tina Valentine was {{introduced}} by former executive producer Edward J. Scott, born onscreen during the episode that aired July 30, 1990. She was portrayed by twins Darla and Sandra Greer from 1990 to 1991, with child actress Danielle Ryah taking over the role briefly in 1994. Upon the character's re-introduction as an adult by executive producer Maria Arena Bell on February 6, 2008, actress Elizabeth Hendrickson assumed the role. Hendrickson was previously known {{for her role as}} Maggie Stone on All My Children, one half of the iconic Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone lesbian supercouple. Having been offered the part in 2007 as a ten-episode guest stint, she was soon promoted to a contract status. Reflecting on her casting, Hendrickson described the process as a [...] "lovely surprise" [...] and said, [...] "I used to always watch Y when I was on AMC. I always liked {{the look and feel of}} the show, so I’ve always been a big fan. Chloe wasn’t even on the page when I came in for a chemistry audition." [...] As a result of the character's positive response, Bell decided to write Chloe's backstory which revealed her to be the daughter of long-running character Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) while also providing her with additional storyline. [...] "Everyone is so pleasant here and it's such a great, warm environment and it just feels really right. If they ask me <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> would be a blessing," [...] Hendrickson said, before being offered a contract. In March 2014, following increased speculation, Hendrickson confirmed her exit from the series, stating: [...] "I need to stretch my wings and fly into the unknown. The one thing that remains true and what I will hold close to my heart as I embark on this new adventure is that I will ALWAYS have you." [...] She made her last appearance on May 27, 2014. Hendrickson reprised the role for one episode on October 14, 2014 to commemorate the passing of Chloe's daughter, Delia. In October 2015, Hendrickson also reprised the role of Chloe from October 12 to 28.|$|E

He lingered {{long enough to see}} Anna, too, go down on her knees in the stillness. Was she praying? Again he had the turbulent feeling with which he had watched her pluck those flowers. She looked so splendid kneeling there! It was caddish to feel like that, when she was praying, and he turned quickly away into the road. But that sharp, sweet stinging sensation did not leave him. He shut his eyes to get rid of her image--and instantly she became ten times more visible, his feeling ten times stronger. He mounted to the hotel; there on the terrace was his tutor. And oddly enough, the sight of him at that moment was no more embarrassing than if it had been the hotel concierge. Stormer did not somehow seem to count; did not seem to want you to count him.

[...] "And we will make it a wedding supper, my dear," [...] says he; and with that word took me in his arms, and kissed me so vehemently that I made no question but he intended to do everything else that Amy had talked of.|$|E
