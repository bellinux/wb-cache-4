25|$|After {{his release}} from prison Carlos Duarte Costa soon found himself in trouble again. This {{time it was a}} result of his accusations <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Secretariat of State had issued Vatican {{passports}} to some high-ranking German Nazis, a practice referred to as the Ratlines.|$|E
25|$|The {{cardinal}} said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> {{was preparing}} to instruct seminaries to teach all students the Tridentine form of the Roman Rite. The complexity of the rubrics {{makes it difficult for}} priests accustomed to the simpler modern form to celebrate the Tridentine form properly, and it is unclear how many have the required knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The {{office of}} the Israeli President is largely ceremonial, with no {{executive}} powers save pardoning prisoners and commuting sentences. Nevertheless, each president emphasizes {{different aspects of the}} role during his tenure. In 2003, on a visit to Italy, he demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> restore treasures allegedly brought to Rome after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} press {{launched a}} campaign to safeguard Poland from subversion (this was in reference to <b>the</b> <b>Vatican).</b> <b>The</b> government conducted a propaganda campaign in <b>the</b> early years <b>that</b> depicted <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> and polish hierarchy as germanophiles; <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> refused to change Poland's diocesan boundaries to mark the state's new territory.|$|R
5000|$|Pope Pius IX and <b>the</b> claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> First <b>Vatican</b> Council and <b>the</b> papal infallibility were to dogmatize papal {{temporal}} power.|$|R
5000|$|Canada.com {{called it}} a [...] "controversial new book <b>that</b> portrays <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> as a hotbed of jealousy, intrigue and underhanded {{factional}} fighting." [...] When first published, <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> called <b>the</b> book [...] "criminal" [...] and vowed to take legal action against the author, publisher, and whoever leaked the documents.|$|R
25|$|The King of Kings tells major Bible {{stories in}} comic form while The Big Betrayal is the {{biography}} of another ex-Catholic priest named Charles Chiniquy who claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> was behind the American Civil War and Lincoln's assassination. The Big Betrayal is the comic version of Charles Chiniquy's autobiography 50 Years In The Church of Rome.|$|E
25|$|Osborne himself {{considered}} {{the odds of}} such a kidnapping incredibly unlikely, as the Pope's presence in the Vatican prevented the British from bombing the key communications center of the German army in Southern Italy, which was adjacent. Weizsäcker, the German ambassador, had already ensured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> itself would not be occupied by the Germans when they occupied Rome {{after the collapse of}} Mussolini's government.|$|E
25|$|Responses to {{the speech}} {{ignore the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> advised against the US led {{invasion}} of Iraq, supports Turkey's entry into the EU, supports allowing Muslims in France the freedom to wear headscarves, and {{has been part of}} a long campaign to promote basic human rights for Christians in Muslim dominated countries where they are persecuted and killed (Sudan, Somalia, post-war Iraq) or marginalized (most {{of the rest of the}} Islamic world including secular Turkey).|$|E
50|$|Roman canonists {{have stated}} before <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Second <b>Vatican</b> Council and Code of Canon Law gave full {{authority}} to bishops within their capacities as diocesan administrators.|$|R

25|$|On March 11, 2010, in {{the wake}} of the sexual abuse scandal that had come to light in Europe, Burke said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> needed to prepare a {{document}} that outlined a set of explicit guidelines rooted in Canon Law that would guide bishops and their local tribunals worldwide in determining how to report the cases to the Holy See, so as to speed up the process by which justice is done for the victims. Changes would also be made to a policy that provided for high levels of secrecy in the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{relations}} with Russia changed drastically {{for a second}} reason. The Baltic states and Poland gained their independence from Russia after World War I, thus enabling a relatively free Church life in those former Russia-controlled countries. Estonia was the first country to look for Vatican ties. On 11 April 1919, Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri informed the Estonian authorities <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> would agree to have diplomatic relations. A concordat was agreed upon in principle a year later in June 1920. It was signed on 30 May 1922. It guaranteed freedom for the Catholic Church, established archdioceses, liberated clergy from military service, allowed the creation of seminaries and Catholic schools and enshrined church property rights and immunity. The Archbishop swore alliance to Estonia.|$|E
25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E
50|$|In 1330, the Carmelite bishop Guido Terreni {{described}} the pope's charism of infallibility in terms {{very similar to}} those <b>that</b> <b>the</b> First <b>Vatican</b> Council was to use in 1870.|$|R
50|$|The Passetto is {{a passage}} <b>that</b> links <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> City with Castel Sant'Angelo. Pope Alexander VI crossed it in 1494, when Charles VIII invaded the city, and Pope Clement VII escaped to safety through {{it during the}} Sack of Rome, in 1527.|$|R

2500|$|In September 2005, ICTY's chief {{prosecutor}} Carla Del Ponte claimed she had {{information that he}} was hiding in a Franciscan monastery in Croatia or in Bosnian Croat territory. She went to the Vatican {{to ask for help}} in locating him, but told The Daily Telegraph <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Secretary for Relations with States, Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo, had refused to help, telling her <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> was not a state and thus had [...] "no international obligations". Her comments infuriated the Church in Croatia as well as the Vatican, whose spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the archbishop asked Del Ponte what evidence she had for her claims but which she reportedly did not provide. Del Ponte was later criticized for making contradictory statements about Gotovina's whereabouts in September 2005.|$|E
50|$|Granderath {{was also}} the author of many apologetic, dogmatic, and {{historical}} articles in the Stimmen aus Maria-Laach (1874-99), the Zeitschrift für kath. Theologie (1881-86), and the Katholik (1898). The second edition of the Kirchenlexikon contains several lengthy articles by him, among others <b>that</b> on <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (XII, 607-33).|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> setting <b>that</b> {{escaped from}} <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> is {{actually}} a conflation of verses set by Gregorio Allegri around 1638 and Tommaso Bai (also spelled [...] "Baj"; 1650-1718) in 1714.|$|R
5|$|Another {{attack was}} made in 1521 by Paulus Bombasius, the prefect of <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Library, because in Greek text Erasmus {{departed}} from the common readings of the Vulgate. He informed Erasmus <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Library is held an extremely ancient copy of the Scriptures (i.e. Codex Vaticanus). He sent two extracts from this manuscript containing 1 John 4:1-3 and 1 John 5:7-11 (it did not include Comma).|$|R

2500|$|Sister Sharon Holland said [...] "We {{learned that}} what we hold in common {{is much greater than}} any of our differences." [...] Müller said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> is certain that the LCWR is [...] "fostering a vision of {{religious}} life that is centered on the Person of Jesus Christ and is rooted in the Tradition of the Church." [...] Phil Lawler of catholicculture.org said that while Catholics should be able to take these things for granted, a Vatican intervention had been necessary in this case. He said that their statements do not guarantee <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> intervention will prove successful, but that they do demonstrate that the process was necessary. When the conclusion was announced in April 2015, Christopher Bellitto, a church historian at Kean University, noted, [...] "Anything coming out of the Vatican this morning is nothing other than a fig leaf because they can't say 'oops' in Latin." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2007, the Church {{announced}} that {{the first stage of}} Father Ignatius' cause for beatification had been completed and that all the necessary documents had been forwarded to Rome.

2500|$|When the {{contents}} of Article 44 were put to Pope Pius XI by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (then Cardinal Secretary of State, later Pope Pius XII), the pope stated in diplomatic language: [...] "We do not approve, nor do we not disapprove – we will remain silent". It was said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> was privately more appreciative of the constitution, and Pius XII later praised it.|$|E
2500|$|Calvi, often {{referred}} to as [...] "God's Banker", was also involved the Vatican Bank, Istituto per le Opere di Religione, in his dealings, and was close to Bishop Paul Marcinkus, the bank's chairman.
