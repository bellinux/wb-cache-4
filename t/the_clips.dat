5|$|Director Rob Bowman {{initially}} {{thought that}} the episode could be filmed in five days, two fewer than usual. However, it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent only on the sickbay set. He later said that he simply shot the framework for <b>the</b> <b>clips</b> to be added in later, and never saw a final cut of the episode. Production assistant Eric A. Stillwell was responsible for selecting <b>the</b> <b>clips</b> {{that went into the}} episode, with 21 different clips included. The prop used on Riker to fight the infection was created from drawings by designer Rick Sternbach.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February 2008 the Australian Family Association (AFA), was {{publicly}} {{outraged that}} Underbelly would be screening at 8:30pm, well {{within reach of}} children, after clips of the series were leaked onto the internet. <b>The</b> <b>clips</b> highlighted the use of extreme profanities, and scenes that show a violent bashing, a cold-blooded murder, and a sexual encounter. The Nine Network defended the timeslot and the M classification, saying <b>the</b> <b>clips,</b> leaked from the Network's production department, were indeed from the series, {{but not all of}} them made the final cut. The Network set its own classification, under the accepted rules of the Australian Commercial Television Code of Conduct. The Australian Family Association threatened to take the matter to Communications Minister Stephen Conroy if the content of the show was anything near that of an unauthorised promotional clip leaked from Nine's production department.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. <b>The</b> <b>clips</b> {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained <b>the</b> <b>clips</b> of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
5|$|Cayce {{flies to}} Moscow to meet Stella {{in person and}} watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an {{assassination}} attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal {{that they have been}} spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that <b>the</b> <b>clips</b> may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track <b>the</b> <b>clips</b> to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father's disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert.|$|E
5|$|Her Story is an {{interactive}} movie video game {{written and directed}} by Sam Barlow. It was released on 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and iOS, and the following year for Android. In the game, players search and sort through a database of video clips from fictional police interviews, and use <b>the</b> <b>clips</b> to solve the case of a missing man. The police interviews focus on the man's wife, Hannah Smith, portrayed by British musician Viva Seifert.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, two further short {{clips from}} The Power of the Daleks– {{along with a}} higher-quality version {{of one of the}} extant scenes– were {{discovered}} in a 1966 episode of the BBC science series Tomorrow's World. <b>The</b> <b>clips,</b> lasting less than 10 seconds each and on film (as opposed to film recordings), came to light when the Tomorrow's World segment was broadcast as part of the 11 September 2005 edition of the clip-based nostalgia show Sunday Past Times on BBC Two. After being alerted to the footage, Paul Vanezis of the Doctor Who Restoration Team tracked down the uncut version of the clip.|$|E
5|$|The music video, like {{previous}} X Factor winners singles, is very simple, with Jackson {{singing the}} song {{in front of a}} large projection, with swooping shots of various landscapes behind him. It also features several clips from his time in The X Factor, from his first audition to the moment he was announced the winner and performed his single to close the series. Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, Dannii Minogue, Louis Walsh, Dermot O'Leary and runner-up Rhydian Roberts all feature within <b>the</b> <b>clips.</b>|$|E
5|$|After his death, MGM {{tried to}} {{continue}} with Romance of the Pink Panther and offered the role of Clouseau to Dudley Moore, who turned it down. The studio subsequently turned back to Blake Edwards, who was adamant not to recast the character, feeling certain {{that no one could}} adequately replace Sellers. In 1982 Edwards released Trail of the Pink Panther, which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three Panther films. Frederick sued, claiming the use of <b>the</b> <b>clips</b> was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1million ($ million today), plus 3.15 per cent of the film's profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.|$|E

5|$|He {{originally}} recorded Lagos for his use in-studio, {{but when}} presented {{with the idea of}} sharing the sound for artistic installation, he began to edit <b>the</b> <b>clips</b> for their best representation of Lagos and considered the best method of public dissemination. Home from his Egyptian art program, Ogboh was inspired to create the Lagos Soundscapes project when the artist was able to identify the sounds of his city during a phone call with a friend. As he transitioned to the field, he turned to online help in discussion forums and email. In his installations, Ogboh prefers audio that requires minimal studio manipulation, and does not significantly alter the sounds. Some audio effects come from the recording environment, both surfaces that echo and distort sound, and the effect of traveling with a recorder. His first sound installation was in the Fayoum academy's bathroom, followed by his first Lagos Soundscapes installation at the Lagos African Artists' Foundation in 2009. Ogboh remembered reception mostly around his work's novelty.|$|E
5|$|LucasFilm was {{hesitant}} to grant {{access to the}} Star Wars library of sound effects for the game's sound designer, Rudolph Stember. As a compromise, the company provided Stember with sounds sampled at the relatively low rate of 22kHz, half the standard rate. Stember objected, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>clips</b> sounded worse than effects he had lifted from VHS tapes for a previous Star Wars project. The game includes voice work from several notable persons, including screen actors Olivia Hussey and Raphael Sbarge as well as voice actors Bob Bergen, Neil Ross and Terence McGovern. Instead of using Nintendo's default sound drivers, Factor 5 developed its own tool called MOsys FX Surround. The Factor 5 drivers use Nintendo 64 processors, but tax them less; advanced compression techniques were also employed. As a result, the game includes over 80minutes of high-quality stereo sound.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is described for detecting misformed clips in hermetically sealed packages. The technique involves {{use of a}} machine vision system incorporating an image processing algorithm, that calculates the directions of contours of intensity in grey-scale images of <b>clips.</b> <b>The</b> algorithm approximately locates <b>the</b> <b>clip</b> by scanning a box over the contour direction transformed image, and finding {{the position of the}} box such that the standard deviation of the directions in the box is a minimum. <b>The</b> <b>clip</b> is accurately located by scanning a rectangular template over the contour direction transformed image {{in the vicinity of the}} approximate location of <b>the</b> <b>clip,</b> and determining <b>the</b> best-fit position of the template. Accurate location of <b>the</b> <b>clip</b> enables <b>the</b> critical <b>clip</b> dimensions to be calculated and used for assessment of <b>clip</b> integrity. <b>The</b> <b>clip</b> integrity is considered acceptable if all of the critical dimensions lie within an acceptable range, as defined by predetermined upper and lower thresholds...|$|R
