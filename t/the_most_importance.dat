25|$|Matthew {{opens with}} the {{genealogy}} of Jesus, {{set out in}} three stages each of 14 generations: from Abraham to David, from David to the Babylonian exile and thence to Jesus' legal father Joseph, the husband of Mary his mother. The opening words of the gospel show that it is written by a Jew for Jewish readers. The genealogy demonstrates that Jesus comes from the seed of Abraham and belongs to the House of David, and thus is their heir. The Gospel also asserts Jesus is, in fact, the Son of God, and Joseph is, thus, not actually Jesus' father. Legally, however, Joseph is Jesus' father and some scholars contend legal parentage is of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>importance.</b> Ra McLaughlin argues that the central event in this passage is actually the adoption of Jesus by Joseph (signified by his naming of the child), which alone makes Jesus eligible to be the messiah from the line of David.|$|E
2500|$|Those from {{cultures}} {{that do not}} carve totem poles often assume that the linear representation of the figures places <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>importance</b> on the highest figure, an idea that became pervasive in the dominant culture after it entered into mainstream parlance by the 1930s with the phrase [...] "low man on the totem pole" [...] (and {{as the title of}} a bestselling 1941 humor book by H. Allen Smith). However, Native sources either reject the linear component altogether, or reverse the hierarchy, with the most important representations on the bottom, bearing the weight of all the other figures, or at eye level with the viewer to heighten their significance. Many poles have no vertical arrangement at all, consisting of a lone figure atop an undecorated column.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dominant}} {{interpretation of}} the buddha-kami relationship came to be questioned by what modern scholars call the [...] or [...] paradigm, a theology that reversed the original theory and gave <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>importance</b> to the kami. Supporters of the theory believed that, while those who have achieved buddhahood have acquired enlightenment, a kami shines of his own light. The doctrine was first developed by Tendai monks, and its first full formulation is attributed to Jihen, a monk tied to the great Ise shrine who was most active around 1340. In the first fascicle of the Kuji hongi gengi he argued that, in the beginning, Japan had only kami and that only later did buddhas take over. He believed that for this reason {{there had been a}} decadence in the country's morals and that a world where kami dominated would soon reappear. In the fifth fascicle of the same work, he compared Japan to a seed, China to a branch and India to a flower or fruit. Just like flowers that fall and return to the roots, India had come back to its roots, the kami were the honji and the buddhas their manifestations.|$|E
2500|$|The passage goes on {{to state}} {{incorrectly}} that the MacDonnells had by 1649 been in possession of the Glens of Antrim for 227 years, but above we are provided with our only surviving mention of what was a tradition current in Ireland {{some period of time}} before the mid-17th century. Duald Mac Firbis reported pedigrees and traditions as he found them and so it is not his own speculation. Without offering an opinion on this claim of Greek origins, John O'Donovan wondered if this should really mean (to Scotland with) William the Lion, it being the well known case that the Scottish king brought a number of Norman families with him to Scotland, from 1174, following his captivity in England. In fact the first known Byset in Scotland, Henricus Byset, witnessed a charter by William circa 1198. But this is not of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>importance,</b> as the family are typically classed as Norman in any case, even if their origins beyond that grouping are uncertain. Edmund Chisholm-Batten took the Irish tradition seriously and offered some possibilities, first noting the similarity of the arms of the Byzantine Greek family named Dassiotes to those of the Bissetts. Alternatively, noting an instance of the name being spelled Buset in 1294, he suggests the family name Βυσσητòς, from the word for [...] "fine linen", Βυσσoς.|$|E
2500|$|Scone's role {{therefore}} {{came under}} threat as Scotland's twelfth century kings gradually became more French and less Gaelic. Walter of Coventry {{reported in the}} reign of William I of Scotland that [...] "The modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude." [...] Though exaggerated, there was truth in this. Apparently for this reason, when the Normanized David I of Scotland (...) went to Scone to be crowned there {{in the summer of}} 1124, he initially refused {{to take part in the}} ceremonies. According to Ailred of Rievaulx, friend and one time member of David's court, David [...] "so abhorred those acts of homage which are offered by the Scottish nation in the manner of their fathers upon the recent promotion of their kings, that he was with difficulty compelled by the bishops to receive them". Inevitably then this was bound to affect the significance of Scone as a ritual and cult centre, yet the inauguration ceremony was preserved with only some innovation through the thirteenth century and Scottish kings continued to be crowned there until 1651, when Charles II became the last King of Scotland to have a coronation there (see List of Scottish monarchs). Moreover, until the later Middle Ages kings continued to reside there, and parliaments, often some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>importance</b> parliaments in Scottish history, frequently met there too.|$|E
