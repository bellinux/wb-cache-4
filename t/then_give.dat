5|$|The {{earliest}} known hatt-ı hümayun {{is the one}} sent by Sultan Murad I to Evrenos Bey in 1386, commending {{the commander}} for his conquests and giving him {{advice on how to}} administer people. Until the reign of Murad III, Viziers used to present matters orally to the Sultans, who would <b>then</b> <b>give</b> their consent or denial, also orally. While hatt-ı hümayuns were very rare prior to this, they proliferated afterward, especially during the reigns of Sultans such as Abdülhamid I, Selim III and Mahmud II, who wanted to increase their control and be informed of everything.|$|E
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would <b>then</b> <b>give</b> nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Sarcophaga bullata is {{characterized}} by holometabolous development, though, like all known sarcophagids, the species is larviparous, meaning that the egg develops internally and females <b>then</b> <b>give</b> birth to first-instar larvae.

The strategy was to lure Mansfeld, also governor of Luxembourg to pursue Nassau {{to the south of}} the Netherlands.

25|$|It can {{sometimes}} be difficult to distinguish between eye symptoms due to hyperthyroidism and those due to Graves' antibodies, {{not in the least}} because the two often occur coincidently. What can make things particularly difficult, is that many patients with hyperthyroidism have lid retraction, which leads to stare and lid lag (due to contraction of the levator palpebrae muscles of the eyelids). This stare may <b>then</b> <b>give</b> the appearance of protruding eyeballs (proptosis), when none in fact exists. This subsides when the hyperthyroidism is treated.|$|E

25|$|When a {{sophisticated}} reproductive strategy is used, only females {{are present in}} the population {{at the beginning of the}} seasonal cycle (although a few species of aphids have been found to have both male and female sexes). The overwintering eggs that hatch in the spring result in females, called fundatrices. Reproduction is typically parthenogenetic and viviparous. Eggs are parthenogenetically produced without meiosis and the offspring are clonal to their mother. The embryos develop within the mothers' ovarioles, which <b>then</b> <b>give</b> live birth to first-instar female nymphs (viviparous). The offspring resemble their parents in every way except size, and are called virginoparae.|$|E

25|$|Neutral lipid {{fatty acid}} {{analysis}} of AM fungi is typically {{looked upon as}} a method to indicate energy storage, but most importantly, the ratio of NLFA (16:1ω5) to PLFA (16:1ω5) can potentially be used to indicate nutritional status of AM fungi in soils. Energy is mainly stored in AM fungi as neutral lipids in storage structures like spores and vesicles. Because of this NLFA correlates quite well {{with the number of}} spores in a given volume of soil. The ratio of NLFA concentration to PLFA concentration (active mycelia) can <b>then</b> <b>give</b> the proportion of carbon allocated to storage structures (spores, measured as NLFA).|$|E
25|$|There is also {{evidence}} of a relationship between wages and perceived race. Jeffrey Grogger conducted a study in which listeners were to categorize English-speakers based upon race; listeners would <b>then</b> <b>give</b> opinions regarding the speakers’ level of education, region of origin, and native language. Listeners could correctly perceive race, but not level of education. Furthermore, there was a correlation between the perceived race of the speaker and the speaker’s total earnings: African American workers who could be identified as black in the study based upon speech earned 12% less than African American workers who were not identified as black; those African American workers {{that could not be}} identified by phonetic cues earned as much white workers.|$|E
25|$|Her life {{career is}} full of controversy. According to the Roman {{historian}} Justin, Eurydice conspired with her son-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros to kill Amyntas, then marry Ptolemy, and <b>then</b> <b>give</b> the throne to her lover. But the queen’s daughter, Eurynoe, foiled the plot by revealing it to her father, Amyntas, who, nevertheless, spared Eurydice from punishment because of their common children. Eventually in 370/369 BC, Amyntas III died, and his eldest son, Alexander II succeeded him. In 368 BC, Ptolemy of Aloros killed Alexander II, despite an earlier settlement between them, worked out by Pelopidas, a Theban statesman and general. Then Ptolemy was forced by Pelopidas to agree merely to be regent for Alexander’s two younger brothers, Perdiccas III and Philip II.|$|E

25|$|From 1951 to 1971, {{instead of}} 12 {{senators}} elected every three years, the electorate voted for eight senators {{every two years}} in the same format. From 1941 to 1949, all elections to the senate were by block voting: the voters may write a name for every seat contested, or they can write the name of the party, which would <b>then</b> <b>give</b> all of the voters' votes to that party's ticket. Compounded with the Nacionalista Party's dominance, this caused a sweep of 24 seats for them in 1941. From 1916 to 1934, voting was via senatorial districts; voters vote for one candidate every three years, except for the first election in 1916 where they'd vote for two candidates; the second-placed candidate would only serve for three years.|$|E
25|$|The {{constancy}} of {{the decay}} rates of isotopes is well supported in science. Evidence for this constancy includes the correspondences of date estimates taken from different radioactive isotopes {{as well as}} correspondences with non-radiometric dating techniques such as dendrochronology, ice core dating, and historical records. Although scientists have noted slight increases in the decay rate for isotopes subject to extreme pressures, those differences were too small to significantly impact date estimates. The constancy of the decay rates is also governed by first principles in quantum mechanics, wherein any deviation in the rate would require {{a change in the}} fundamental constants. According to these principles, a change in the fundamental constants could not influence different elements uniformly, and a comparison between each of the elements' resulting unique chronological timescales would <b>then</b> <b>give</b> inconsistent time estimates.|$|E
25|$|A {{more complex}} {{model of the}} point charge array {{introduces}} an effective medium by averaging the microscopic charges; for example, the averaging can arrange that only dipole fields play a role. A related approach is to divide the charges into those nearby the point of observation, and those far enough away to allow a multipole expansion. The nearby charges <b>then</b> <b>give</b> rise to local field effects. In a common model of this type, the distant charges are treated as a homogeneous medium using a dielectric constant, and the nearby charges are treated only in a dipole approximation. The approximation of a medium or an array of charges by only dipoles and their associated dipole moment density is sometimes called the point dipole approximation, the discrete dipole approximation, or simply the dipole approximation.|$|E
