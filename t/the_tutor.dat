5|$|Recognising the {{potential}} of the young boy, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for James's early education, which in the Victorian era was largely the job of the woman of the house. At eight he could recite long passages of Milton and the whole of the 119th psalm (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of scripture was already very detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with abdominal cancer and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. James's education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life. His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a sixteen-year-old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man John hired to instruct his son, except that he treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward. John dismissed <b>the</b> <b>tutor</b> in November 1841 and, after considerable thought, sent James to the prestigious Edinburgh Academy. He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Dr Math is a mobile, online {{tutoring}} project {{which allows}} {{primary and secondary}} school pupils to contact tutors in mathematics using text based chat systems on their cell phones. <b>The</b> <b>tutors</b> use traditional Internet based workstations. Dr Math is extremely popular with school pupils and Dr Math tutors are often chatting to twenty pupils concurrently. It is important that <b>the</b> <b>tutors</b> are as efficient as possible. This paper describes the implementation of an automated topic spotter in a mobile chat-based <b>tutoring</b> environment. <b>The</b> <b>tutors,</b> although well versed in mathematics, were not all home language English speakers. They often struggled with the cryptic abbreviations which the pupils used in their queries. In addition, the number of pupils asking questions far exceeded <b>the</b> number of <b>tutors</b> available. It became important to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>tutors</b> were as efficient as possible. The automated topic spotter would process the cryptic questions, determine the general mathematical topic, and automatically provide supporting material to <b>the</b> <b>tutors.</b> <b>The</b> learning gained on this project could be easily reimplemented in other domains besides education including health and public services...|$|R
