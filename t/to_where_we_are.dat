500|$|On February 23, 2009, {{the band}} {{released}} their sixth studio album internationally via Roadrunner Records, titled Wrath {{and one day}} later in America via Epic Records. The album is dedicated to Mikey Bronsnan, who helped them get started in Philadelphia, PA. In November 2008, Bronsnan {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. According to drummer Chris Adler, [...] "Without Mikey, we'd very well might not be a band today." [...] Drummer Chris Adler was quoted saying [...] "This album is going to surprise a lot of people. Typically bands that get <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in our career begin to slack off, smell the roses and regurgitate. We chose a different path. No one wants to hear another band member hyping a new record. ‘Wrath’ needs no hype. We have topped ourselves and on February 24 you will feel it." [...] "Wrath" [...] debuted on the Billboard 200 at number two, selling over 68,000 copies in its first week.|$|E
2500|$|He {{wrote that}} [...] "Christian faith has {{been central to}} the {{emergence}} of the nation and its development. We cannot really understand the nature and achievements of British society without reference to it. In a plural, multifaith and multicultural situation, it can still provide the resources for both supporting and critiquing public life in this country. We have argued {{that it is necessary to}} understand where we have come from, to guide us <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going, and to bring us back when we wander too far from the path of national destiny." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{is a war}} in Vietnam and we are a Vietnam within America. We {{are small}} but we have stepped {{in the way of}} history. We are going to change this country. ... The battle of Vietnam is one battle in the world revolution. It is the Stalingrad of American imperialism. We are part of that Stalingrad. We are the guerrillas {{fighting}} behind enemy lines. ... We will not commit suicide. We will not fight here. We will march <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> within the symbol-the very pig fascist architecture. ... But we will make a political stand today.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right; {{you shall}} skip back <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{under the first}} Jolyon in 1760. It'll prove the cycle theory, and incidentally, no doubt, you may grow a better turnip than he did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps he did," [...] Francis said; [...] "but {{he would}} have been a hundred miles further north by daybreak, and it would have taken him a couple of days to get back <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> lying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, sir, we've {{got to go}} back {{pretty well}} <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>was</b> in 1820, and begin it all over again. It is {{somewhat}} aggrawatin'! Might have been avoided, too, if they'd kep' a few more troops on the frontier." ...|$|R
2500|$|After signing their {{deal with}} Forefront, the band started writing and {{recording}} demo songs similar to [...] "My God" [...] {{for the first}} album. The band has described this period as one of adaptation and experimentation since ForeFront wanted a hip-hop act. As a result, Dave Stuart and Ron Gibson left the band. Singer Mark Stuart {{said in an interview}} [...] "We had no idea what we were doing. Forefront signed us to do this rap/metal stuff, and we only had one song" [...] while original guitarist Barry Blair said [...] "We thought 'If they liked My God, we'll send them more songs like that." [...] Blair added that it was a [...] "big, long process of getting <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now, of creating music we like, not music we think is what they [...] would like." ...|$|E
2500|$|The launch {{edition of}} Standpoint {{magazine}} caused {{controversy in the}} United Kingdom, in which Nazir-Ali called for Christianity to regain a prominent position in public life and blamed the [...] "newfangled and insecurely founded doctrine of multiculturalism" [...] for entrenching the segregation of communities. Nazir-Ali argued that the decline of Christianity {{and the rise of}} liberal values in the UK during the 1960s had created a moral vacuum which radical Islam threatened to fill. He wrote that [...] "We have argued {{that it is necessary to}} understand where we have come from, to guide us <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going, and to bring us back when we wander too far from the path of national destiny." [...] The Guardian newspaper devoted its leader to criticising Nazir-Ali, although it described his writing as [...] "neatly underlining 's expressed intent ‘to defend and celebrate Western civilisation’". Nazir-Ali was condemned by the Ramadhan foundation and the President of the National Secular Society, who accused him of [...] "doing the BNP’s work", but was praised by The Daily Telegraph newspaper. Nazir-Ali has himself written against Christian involvement in far-right organisations like the BNP.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must {{cross the}} road, first," [...] the girl said. [...] "Nearly {{opposite}} <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{there is a}} little path through the wood, leading straight down to the river. The boat lies only a short distance from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I am {{sure you}} would not. You have too much pity for me. Mary, look across the room <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just now--to <b>where</b> my father is--my father, so {{compassionate}} and loving to me--and {{tell me what you}} see." ...|$|R
6000|$|The men at once threw their oars [...] "apeak," [...] as they say; that is, {{raised them}} {{straight}} up in the air, and waited for further orders. We expected the whale would rise near <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and thought it best to rest and look out.|$|R
60|$|While Jerry and I were grumbling {{because of}} what seemed to us unseemly haste, Jim Freeman, who had been lying down a short {{distance}} away, came over <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sitting, his eyes bulging {{as if he had}} seen two or three ghosts at the very least.|$|R
6000|$|... "'We {{must go back}} to {{the tomb}} in the Valley of the Sorcerer. Show no {{hesitation}} in the morning when I give the orders! If you ask any questions as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going it will create suspicion, and will defeat our purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we'll soon {{know the}} truth of the matter," [...] came from Sam. [...] "If this good weather {{continues}} we ought to get <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going inside of ten days. Of course, if we are held up by fogs or storms it will take longer." ...|$|E
60|$|RAILROAD, n. The {{chief of}} many {{mechanical}} devices enabling {{us to get}} away from where we are <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> no better off. For this purpose the railroad is held in highest favor by the optimist, for it permits him to make the transit with great expedition.|$|E
60|$|I asked Perry {{if he had}} {{any idea}} as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> or in what {{direction}} lay Hooja's island or the continent. He replied by producing his map, on which he had carefully marked the newly discovered islands--there described as the Unfriendly Isles--which showed Hooja's island northwest of us about two points West.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Micawber {{looking up}} at this {{juncture}} <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> standing, I had only time to repeat my caution. Traddles thanked me, and descended. But I was much afraid, when I observed the good-natured manner in which he went down with the cap in his hand, and gave Mrs. Micawber his arm, {{that he would be}} carried into the Money Market neck and heels.|$|R
60|$|The door opened, and Staunton himself appeared. He looked {{years older}} than the strong, debonair man to whom I had told my story a few hours ago, but in his face was none of the despair which I had feared. He was pale, {{and his eyes were}} shining with {{suppressed}} excitement, but he had by no means the air of a beaten man. He came over <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> standing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fourthly, as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going, I don't know. Our compass was smashed {{to pieces}} in the fight, and I've been running {{for the last three}} weeks right before the wind. So now you know all, and as you've {{finished}} your soup I'll go and get you a lump of boiled junk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it won't do--it won't do!" [...] Ransom went on, laughing. [...] "You are on {{the wrong}} tack altogether. Do you really take the ground that your sex has been without influence? Influence? Why, you have led us all by the nose <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now! Wherever we are, it's all you. You are {{at the bottom of}} everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} way of arguing against a course because it may be ridden down to an absurdity would soon bring life to a standstill," [...] said Deronda. [...] "It is not the logic of human action, but of a roasting-jack, that must {{go on to the}} last turn when it has been once wound up. We can do nothing safely without some {{judgment}} as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to stop." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{more than}} one {{occasion}} Gann has suggested that part of the reason the show had poor ratings in the US was because the show got bogged down in mythology and at times made comedy secondary stating, [...] "Season Three, we really tried to steer it back closer <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> Season One, and make it really comedically satisfying. I really felt we achieved that, but it wasn’t enough, I guess." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{came close}} <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> hidden, then entered {{the woods and}} circled silently about our camp to get our wind. In the morning his tracks, within five feet of my rear tent pole, showed how little he cared for the {{dwelling}} of man. But though he circled {{back and forth for}} an hour, answering Simmo's low call with his ridiculous little grunt, he would not show himself again on the open shore.|$|R
5000|$|Labelle member Nona Hendryx {{explained}} the album's title to noted R&B writer Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "It basically stemmed {{from two of}} the songs on this album being songs I'd specifically written for {{what would have been}} the next Labelle album back in 1977. So the title 'Back To Now" [...] is really signifiying that this record represents us really getting back <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> It's basically a continuation from <b>where</b> <b>we</b> stopped off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{before we}} go down we will {{get a couple of}} pieces of flat wood, and drive a peg into each, {{sharpened}} at the upper end. Candles stuck on these will stand upright, and we can put them down close <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> working. They will give a better light than a torch, and leave us all free to use the tools. Did you think of buying some more tinder?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it?" [...] said Molly. [...] "I'm so {{glad you}} like it. I always feel as if I had invented {{everything}} round here. It hurts me if people don't appreciate it. Once I took Sir Thomas Blunt up here. It was as much as I could do to induce him to come at all. He simply won't walk. When we got <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> standing now, I pointed and said: 'There!'" ...|$|E
60|$|Here a {{discussion}} commences as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going. We had agreed among {{ourselves that we}} would visit the Mer de Glâce. We fully meant to go there, and had so told the guide on starting; but it appears he had other views for us. There is a regular way of seeing things, orthodox and appointed; and to get sight of any thing in the wrong way would {{be as bad as}} to get well without a scientific physician, or any other irregular piece of proceeding.|$|E
40|$|My {{primary goal}} in {{teaching}} this unit {{will be to}} encourage my students to draw a connection from <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> today in commercial art and printing <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in the past. It will give them the history of printing and commercial art in general by using fine art as a bench gauge. I will show them that what was important in society is reflected in fine art. By showing them advertisements of the period, I will {{also be able to}} teach the...|$|R
6000|$|Just {{then the}} great Zulu, Bombyane, {{who had left}} my side to indulge in the congenial {{occupation}} of looting, {{came out of a}} waggon crying that he had got the [...] "little white one." [...] I looked; he was carrying the child Tota, gripping her frock in one of his huge black hands. He stalked up <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and held the child before the chief. [...] "Is it dead, father?" [...] he said, with a laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "We found {{a street}} near the depot {{with a high}} hill behind it, and close to it. There were walls and {{terraces}} all the way up, and trees here and there. We looked up, and {{we could see the}} heads of some children over the topmost wall. They <b>were</b> looking down <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> Presently <b>we</b> came to an opening, and some flights of steps and steep walks, and so we thought we would go up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Half of it, half of two million!" [...] Young Dick cried. [...] "At {{that rate}} I'm a million richer every year. Get that, and {{hang on to}} it, and listen to me. When I'm good and willing to go back--but not for years an' years--we'll fix it up, you and I. When I say the word, you'll write to your father. He'll jump out <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> waiting, pick me up, and cart me back. Then he'll collect the thirty {{thousand}} reward from my guardians, quit the police force, and most likely start a saloon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allan, {{my father}} says that he asked your father to collect some monies that were owing to him. If it were {{possible}} for you or other friends to come to Delagoa in a ship with that money, I think that it might serve to buy some oxen, enough for a few wagons. Then perhaps we might trek back and fall in with a party of Boers who, we believe, have crossed the Quathlamba Mountains into Natal. Or perhaps we might get to the Bay and find a ship to take us anywhere from this horrible place. If you could come, the natives would guide you <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If I told you, Percival, {{we should}} only {{come back at}} the end <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now. Enough that I have found it out--and the finding has caused that trouble and anxiety which made me so {{inaccessible}} to you all through to-day. Now, to refresh my memory about your affairs--it is some time since I talked them over with you. The money has been raised, {{in the absence of}} your wife's signature, by means of bills at three months--raised at a cost that makes my poverty-stricken foreign hair stand on end to think of it! When the bills are due, is there really and truly no earthly way of paying them but by the help of your wife?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{nearly two}} hours we drove without my having the least clue as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going. Sometimes the rattle of the stones told of a paved causeway, and at others our smooth, silent course {{suggested}} asphalt; but, save by this variation in sound, there was nothing at all which could in the remotest way help me to form a guess as <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> The paper over each window was impenetrable to light, and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front. It was a quarter-past seven when we left Pall Mall, and my watch showed {{me that it was}} ten minutes to nine when we at last came to a standstill. My companion let down the window, and I caught a glimpse of a low, arched doorway with a lamp burning above it. As I was hurried from the carriage it swung open, and I found myself inside the house, with a vague impression of a lawn and trees on each side of me as I entered. Whether these were private grounds, however, or bona-fide country was more than I could possibly venture to say.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll draw such rations as may {{be served}} out, lad, and then push ahead <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> can <b>be</b> {{in the company of}} {{sensible}} people, meaning our two selves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been tryin' my best <b>to</b> think <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> without askin' any questions, and I'm dead beat. I don't {{remember}} no such {{house as}} {{this on the}} road." ...|$|R
