40|$|The {{initiation}} {{and maintenance}} of physiological and pathophysiological oscillatory activity depends on the synaptic interactions within neuronal networks. We studied the mechanisms underlying evoked <b>transient</b> network <b>oscillation</b> in acute slices of the adolescent rat somatosensory cortex and modeled its underpinning mechanisms. Oscillations were evoked by brief spatially distributed noisy extracellular stimulation, delivered via bipolar electrodes. Evoked <b>transient</b> network <b>oscillation</b> was detected with multi-neuron patch-clamp recordings under different pharmacological conditions. The observed oscillations are in the frequency range of 2 - 5 Hz and consist of 4 - 12 mV large, 40 - 150 ms wide compound synaptic events with rare overlying action potentials. This evoked <b>transient</b> network <b>oscillation</b> is only weakly expressed in the somatosensory cortex and requires increased [K+]o of 6. 25 mM and decreased [Ca 2 +]o of 1. 5 mM and [Mg 2 +]o of 0. 5 mM. A peak in the cross-correlation among membrane potential in layers II/III, IV and V neurons reflects the underlying network-driven basis of the evoked <b>transient</b> network <b>oscillation.</b> The initiation of the evoked <b>transient</b> network <b>oscillation</b> is accompanied by an increased [K+]o and can be prevented by the K+ channel blocker quinidine. In addition, a shift of the chloride reversal potential takes place during stimulation, resulting in a depolarizing type A GABA (GABAA) receptor response. Blockade of alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole-proprionate (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), or GABA(A) receptors as well as gap junctions prevents evoked <b>transient</b> network <b>oscillation</b> while a reduction of AMPA or GABA(A) receptor desensitization increases its duration and amplitude. The apparent reversal potential of - 27 mV of the evoked <b>transient</b> network <b>oscillation,</b> its pharmacological profile, {{as well as the}} modeling results suggest a mixed contribution of glutamatergic, excitatory GABAergic, and gap junctional conductances in initiation {{and maintenance of}} this oscillatory activity.

40|$|Effects of inertia on {{oscillations}} in ring {{networks of}} unidirectionally coupled sigmoidal neurons are studied. It {{is known that}} ring neural networks without inertia are bistable and the duration of <b>transient</b> <b>oscillations</b> increases exponentially {{with the number of}} neurons. In this paper, kinematical description of traveling waves in the oscillations in the networks is extended to networks with inertia. When inertia is below a critical value and the state of each neuron is over damped, properties of the networks are qualitatively the same as those without inertia. The duration of the <b>transient</b> <b>oscillations</b> then increases with inertia, and the increasing rate of the logarithm of the duration becomes more than double. When inertia exceeds a critical value and the state of each neuron becomes under damped, properties of the networks qualitatively change. The periodic solution is then stabilized through the pitchfork bifurcation as inertia increases. More bifurcations occur so that various periodic solutions are generated, and the stability of the periodic solutions changes alternately. Further, stable oscillations generated with inertia are observed in an experiment on an analog circuit...|$|R

In the model, frequency-dependent core and copper losses are included. Numerical computations are done with and without taking into account the core losses. Two types of measurements are done to verify the validity of the model. First, the voltage transients are measured and computed by applying a step impulse with a rise time of 50 ns. Then, the transformer is switched by a vacuum circuit breaker and the multiple reignitions are analysed. The results verify that the model is applicable to simulate the voltage distribution in transformer windings in a wide frequency range. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo {{types of}} {{transient}} responses {{have been investigated}} in fly motion-sensitive neurons in the past: the impulse and the step response. In response to a brief motion pulse, cells show a sudden rise in activity followed by an exponential decay (‘impulse response’). In response to the onset of a constant velocity stimulus, cells exhibit <b>transient</b> <b>oscillations</b> before settling to a steady-state value (‘step response’). Since the impulse response {{has been shown to}} shorten when tested after presentation of an adapting motion stimulus, we investigated whether adaptation also occurs during the step response. We tested this hypothesis by recording extracellularly the response of the H 1 -cell in the lobula plate of the blowfly Calliphora vicina to gratings of varying pattern contrasts and drift velocity. We found that the <b>transient</b> <b>oscillations</b> of the step response strongly depend on the pattern contrast: at low contrasts, oscillations lasted for several seconds, whereas at high contrasts, they settled within fractions of a second. This suggests that motion adaptation occurs during the initial period of the stimulus presentation and is dependent on the contrast of the motion stimulus. Using identical stimulus parameters (contrast and temporal frequency) for the adapting stimulus and testing the impulse response afterwards, we found that the impulse response and the transient period in the step response shortened in a similar way. We then analyzed the dynamic of the <b>transients</b> <b>oscillations</b> produced by ongoing motion of a square wave pattern in the anti-preferred direction (null direction) of H 1. As observed for preferred direction motion, we found that the duration and amplitude of those transients shortened as the contrast and the velocity of the pattern increased, and that the oscillations disappeared when a blank screen instead of a pattern was presented before the onset of motion. Under both stimulus conditions, i. e. grating and blank screen before motion onset, the steady-state response level showed the same dependence on the contrast and temporal frequency of the pattern. When we analyzed the responses of the cell to pattern of various sizes and contrasts moving in the preferred direction of the cell, we found that increments in the size affected the overall amplitude of both the <b>transient</b> <b>oscillations</b> and the steady-state response level, whereas the duration of the oscillations only depended on the local pattern contrast. We also tested the impulse response before and after the presentation of an adapting stimulus presented in either the same or a different location of the visual field.

These last experiments demonstrate a strictly local mechanism of adaptation affecting the response transients of both the impulse and the step response...|$|R
