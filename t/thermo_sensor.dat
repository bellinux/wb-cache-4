40|$|Fiber optic sensors have progressed {{rapidly in}} recent year as {{because it has}} many {{advantages}} over other types of sensors in terms of freedom from electromagnetic radiation, wide bandwidth, economy, can withstand high temperature and under harsh environment. Due to those reason a <b>thermo</b> <b>sensor</b> based on fiber optic which utilizes a thin-film optical band-pass filter has been developed. However, the proposed system has advantages over the fiber Bragg grating sensor which can observe the temperature in small area and low transmission loss. The simulation software is used to design a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI system allows the user to monitor the condition {{and the status of}} the current temperature. The monitoring system presented in this paper is divided into three basic sub-systems which are retrieve the real-time data system, displaying out the data system, and warning system. This GUI system used to collect the data and process the data for displaying the current data and further checking as a history data has been keep. The values obtained of <b>thermo</b> <b>sensor</b> are measured as 30 °C till 330 °C and the wavelength values are between 1552. 93 nm till 1557. 25 n...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the excellent temperature sensing property of a chemically synthesized reduced graphene oxide (rGO). It is found that with increase in temperature from 80 to 375 K, the resistivity of reduced graphene oxide monotonically decreases. The ultra-fast temperature sensing property {{is demonstrated by}} keeping and removing a block of ice under the rGO sensor, which shows the resistance of rGO increases by 15 % in 592 miliseconds and recovers in 8. 92 seconds. The temperature sensing of rGO is compared with a standard platinum <b>thermo</b> <b>sensor</b> (Pt 111) and found the sensitivity is much better in rGO. Comment: Paper is withdraw...|$|E

40|$|In {{continuous}} casting steel production a significant loss reduction – {{in terms of}} scrap material, time and money – {{can be achieved by}} developing an appropriate algorithm for the prevention of molten steel sticking onto mould. The logic of such algorithm should be simple and manageable to ensure its practical implementation on a computer system via the usage of <b>thermo</b> <b>sensors.</b> This suggests that both the algorithm and the automated data collection can be implemented by means of applicative software. Despite its simplicity, the algorithm should accurately trace physical phenomena in molten steel...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a concept of an {{application}} of UAV drones as a possible low-cost device to avoid pirate attacks. Recent UAV drone can be operated {{in the range of}} more than 2 km and transmit very clear images. Pirates will be approaching using a small boat and they will be climbing up along the sidewall of the ship. We tried several experiments in our laboratory to check how the drone can be applied to interfere the pirate approaching and climbing. We present a conceptual structure of an anti-piracy drone system and fabricated a part of device including a <b>thermo</b> camera <b>sensor</b> and a net launcher to stall the boat. The results showed this method seems effective considering the cost, although the operator must be trained to control the drone properly...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} mobile {{biological}} sensor {{system that can}} assist in earlydetection of forest fires {{one of the most}} dreaded natural disasters on the earth. The main ideapresented in this paper is to utilize animals with sensors as Mobile Biological Sensors(MBS). The devices used in this system are animals which are native animals living inforests, <b>sensors</b> (<b>thermo</b> and radiation <b>sensors</b> with GPS features) that measure thetemperature and transmit the location of the MBS, access points for wireless communicationand a central computer system which classifies of animal actions. The system offers twodifferent methods, firstly: access points continuously receive data about animalsÃ¢Â€Â™ locationusing GPS at certain time intervals and the gathered data is then classified and checked tosee if there is a sudden movement (panic) of the animal groups: this method is called animalbehavior classification (ABC). The second method can be defined as thermal detection(TD) : the access points get the temperature values from the MBS devices and send the datato a central computer to check for instant changes in the temperatures. This system may beused for many purposes other than fire detection, namely animal tracking, poachingprevention and detecting instantaneous animal death...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the experiments performed in the hypersonic wind tunnel H 2 K in the framework of the ESA technology research project “laminar to turbulent transition in hypersonic flows”. The investigations include the free boundary-layer transition on a flat plate as well as the influence of a shock wave–boundary layer interaction on the transition. The shock is created by a wedge with a small angle of attack resulting in a moderate shock intensity. The experiments were performed at Mach 6. 0, at three different unit Reynolds numbers and with a translational displacement of the shock generator. Besides the optical methods—Schlieren photography and infrared thermography—several intrusive sensors were used. High-speed measurements were carried out using PCB and atomic layer <b>thermo</b> pile <b>sensors.</b> Kulite sensors were used for low- and mid-speed pressure measurements. The data analysis includes the comparison of the absolute values, the frequency spectra and wavelets and their distributions in time and space...|$|R
30|$|The {{rheological}} properties of hydrogels were measured using a Haake RheoScope RO 1 version 3.61. 0000 from <b>Thermo</b> Scientific. The <b>sensor</b> {{used for all}} measurements was PP 20 with a gap of 2  mm. The samples were cut in uniform dimensions with diameter of 2  cm and height of 2  mm. The measurements were set as an oscillation model and frequency experiments were first performed {{in the range of}} 1 – 15  Hz to establish the extent of the linear viscoelastic region. Based on the data, all subsequent oscillation time-dependent experiments were performed at a fixed frequency of 1  Hz and controlled stress (CS) of 1.0  Pa to obtain the values of elastic modulus, (G’) and viscous modulus, (G’’) as a function of time. All runs were repeated at least three times.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to determining the optimal viscosity, {{the influence of}} pH and dispersant concentration on the viscosity of concentrated ZrO 2 nanosuspensions (with constant 77  mass% solids loading) at shear rate of 50  s− 1 was investigated, separately. Separate samples were prepared at the required dispersant concentrations (in the range of 0.9 – 1.5  mass%) and pH. Immediately, rheological measurements of all formulated suspensions were carried out at 23  °C by pouring suspensions into a concentric cylindrical rheometer (<b>Thermo</b> Haake Ltd., <b>Sensor</b> Z 41 -DIN measurement system, RV 1, Germany). A volume of 14  ml {{was used in the}} cylinder for each measurement. To avoid undesired influence from different mechanical histories, the fresh samples were presheared at an identical rate of 100  s− 1 for 1  min, followed by an equilibrium period of 2  min prior to viscosity measurement. Three measurements were made for each suspension, and each result was identical on the whole. Immediately, the viscosity of the suspensions was determined.|$|R
