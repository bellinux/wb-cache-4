5|$|The Civil War {{had a major}} {{effect on}} the {{development}} of Indiana. Before the war, the population was generally in the south of the state, where many had entered via the Ohio River, which provided a cheap and convenient means to export products and agriculture to New Orleans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold.</b> The war <b>closed</b> the Mississippi River to traffic for nearly four years, forcing Indiana to find other means to export its produce. This led to a population shift to the north where the state came to rely more on the Great Lakes and the railroad for exports.|$|R
5|$|Kosmos {{was bought}} by the Skaugen Group in 1988, and on 21 October, Kosmos' Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bjørn Bettum and Chairman Otto Grieg Tidemand were fired. The Skaugen Group decided to {{integrate}} Kosmos' shipping and oil-related activities into their group. All other investments, including Norsk Air, <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> or <b>closed.</b> At the time, Norsk Air had 140 employees. Norsk Air's CEO, Mr. Røsjodet, made contact with Bård Mikkelsen, who was CEO of Widerøe, {{to try to convince}} them to purchase Norsk Air. Widerøe was a that time solely occupied with flying on the subsidized regional routes. The company was interested in having some non-subsidized routes to better benchmark its operations. The two largest owners, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE, did not want to purchase Norsk Air, but the third-largest owner, Fred. Olsen & Co. liked the idea, and bought SAS' and Braathens SAFE's 62.3 percent stake in Widerøe to make the deal possible. Other possible purchasers who had negotiated with Norsk Air were Sterling Airlines, Partnair and Jan Einar Johansen, former owner of Scandi Line.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} strike, it was {{announced}} that Delphi would be spun off in 1999 into what is now Delphi Corporation, and Flint East was for a time part of Delphi's Energy and Engine Management Systems division. In 2002, ongoing financial problems caused the plant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> placed in the Automotive Holdings Group, a collection of under performing plants that Delphi felt needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fixed, <b>sold,</b> or <b>closed.</b> Delphi declared bankruptcy in October 2005, and announced plans to close or sell 21 of its 29 US plants by Jan 1, 2008, including Flint East. Spark plug production, already greatly reduced, ended in early 2006.The plant has since been razed since early 2010 according to Flint-based newspaper The Flint Journal and WJRT-12, an ABC affiliate.|$|R
50|$|President Haile Mariam Mengistu's March 1990 {{speech to}} the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Ethiopia {{was a turning point}} in Ethiopia's recent {{economic}} history. Acknowledging that socialism had failed, Mengistu proposed implementing a mixed economy. Under the new system, the private sector would <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> participate {{in all parts of the}} economy with no limit on capital investment (Ethiopia had a US$ 250,000 ceiling on private investment); developers would <b>be</b> allowed <b>to</b> build houses, apartments, and office buildings for rent or sale; and commercial enterprises would <b>be</b> permitted <b>to</b> develop industries, hotels, and a range of other enterprises on government-owned land <b>to</b> <b>be</b> leased on a concessionary basis. Additionally, state-owned industries and businesses would <b>be</b> required <b>to</b> operate on a profit basis, with those continuing to lose money <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> or <b>closed.</b> Farmers would receive legal ownership of land they tilled and the right to sell their produce in a free market. Whereas there were many areas yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> addressed, such as privatization of state enterprises and compensation for citizens whose land and property had been confiscated, these proposals generated optimism among some economists about Ethiopia's economic future. However, some observers pointed out that Mengistu's proposals only amounted to recognition of existing practices in the underground economy.|$|R

50|$|After {{serving as}} the Methodist Church, first {{at the corner of}} Huron County Road 12 (Brussels Line) and McKillop Twp. Conc. 14 (Canada Company Rd.), then moved to Lot 18, Conc. 1 of Grey Twp., the {{building}} was used as an Orange Hall from 1927 to 1938. When the Ancient Order of United Workmen’s hall <b>was</b> <b>sold</b> and converted <b>to</b> residential use, the community purchased the Orange Hall in 1938 for $50. When the hall was moved back across the highway to its present location, hydro lines were an obstacle. The roof and gables were dismantled for the move and the side walls lowered two feet before reconstruction. In 1945, four acres next <b>to</b> the hall <b>were</b> purchased for use as a ball diamond and picnic area. A recreation committee was set up in 1968. In 1976, the park <b>was</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> the recreation committee for $1 and the Walton Area Sports Club <b>was</b> formed. Due <b>to</b> extensive repairs needed at that time, and the increasing difficult task of getting volunteer help, the building <b>was</b> <b>sold</b> <b>to</b> the Women's Institute. By 1955, there was fear the hall would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>sold</b> or torn down. However, the community once again came to the rescue. A committee to oversee operations and fundraising formed and the hall was busier than it had been for many decades.|$|R
25|$|In 2000, former NHL players Dale Hunter, Mark Hunter and Basil McRae {{bought the}} Knights from Doug Tarry Jr. The sale was {{brokered}} by George Georgopoulos, who was {{negotiating with the}} city of London {{for the development of a}} state of the art multpurpose entertainment centre and arena – the John Labatt Centre. The Hunters began the process of rebuilding by firstly joining in the lobbying for a new 9,900 seat arena in Downtown London and putting together a smart scouting network. The Ice House <b>was</b> scheduled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sold</b> and <b>closed</b> at the conclusion of the 2001–02 OHL season, and as a treat for their fans, the Knights changed back to their 1986–94 green and gold uniforms in February 2002. In October that year the Labatt Centre opened, and new, modernized versions of the old green and gold uniforms debuted. The 2003–04 OHL season would mark the beginning of a remarkable dynasty. The Knights had the best regular season record in the CHL and set an OHL record with 110 points, but lost the OHL Western Conference final to the Guelph Storm. In the 2004–05 season, the Knights set a new CHL record by going 31 games in a row without a loss (29–0–2). The previous record of 29 games, held by the 1978–79 Brandon Wheat Kings (who went 25–0–4 during their streak), was broken with a 0–0 tie against the Guelph Storm on December 10, 2004. The streak ended at 31 games after a 5–2 loss to the Sudbury Wolves on December 17. The Knights finished the season with 120 points (59 wins, 7 losses, 2 ties), breaking their own OHL record set the previous season. In the playoffs, the Knights started by sweeping two best-of-seven series against the Guelph Storm and Windsor Spitfires. In the Western Conference final, the Knights defeated the Kitchener Rangers 4–1 to win the Wayne Gretzky Trophy. In the OHL finals against the Ottawa 67's, the Knights won the series 4–1 to win their first J. Ross Robertson Cup, ending the longest championship drought in the CHL. That same year, the London Knights and the John Labatt Centre (renamed Budweiser Gardens in 2012) were awarded the right to host 2005 Memorial Cup Tournament, which was played from May 21 to May 29. In the tournament, they defeated the Rimouski Océanic 4–3 on May 21, the Kelowna Rockets 4–2 on May 23, and the Ottawa 67's 5–2 on May 26. This earned the Knights a bye into the championship game. On May 29, the Knights defeated Rimouski 4–0 to win their first Memorial Cup. In 2005–06, the team won their third consecutive Hamilton Spectator Trophy for winning the regular season title, but their run into the playoffs ended with a loss to Peterborough in the OHL final. In 2006–07 the Knights continued their run of success, winning their fourth consecutive Hamilton Spectator Trophy as regular season champions. However, they lost the Western Conference Championship to the Plymouth Whalers.|$|R
