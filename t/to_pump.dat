5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{exhibits}} {{include two}} small de Laval steam turbines by Greenwood & Batley, {{and a small}} 'Wessex' steam turbine milk bottle washer. A winch used to move railway wagons at Hemyock Dairy near Wellington was built by J. Lynn of Sunderland. There is a runnable Crossley diesel engine dating from 1935. There is a Spirax Sarco 'Ogden pump' used <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> condensate from steam lines. The collection includes the boiler which powered the Telescopic Bridge, Bridgwater.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1959 to {{coincide}} with the Hunterston A nuclear power station in Ayrshire. Cruachan uses cheap off-peak electricity generated at night <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> water to the higher reservoir, which can then be released during the day to provide power as necessary. The power station is open to visitors, and around 50,000 tourists visit it each year.|$|E

5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Mount Sion Mill along Sion Street {{was founded}} in the early 19th century and during the First World War {{manufactured}} guncotton. A weir was constructed along with a goit, used to turn a water wheel which powered a beam engine <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> water to the reservoirs above.|$|E
5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous {{and it requires}} considerable pressure <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.|$|E

5|$|The Han Chinese also {{employed}} chemical warfare. In quelling {{a peasant}} revolt near Guiyang in 178 CE, the imperial Han forces had horse-drawn chariots carrying bellows {{that were used}} <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> powdered lime (calcium oxide) at the rebels, who were dispersed. In this same instance, they also lit incendiary rags tied to the tails of horses, so that the frightened horses would rush through the enemy lines and disrupt their formations.|$|E
5|$|The current Laplace {{resonance}} {{is unable}} <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede {{to a higher}} value. The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible. The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; {{if it is not}} pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede. This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years ago. Because Ganymede's orbital eccentricity is relatively low—on average 0.0015—tidal heating is negligible now. However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances that were able <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01–0.02. This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.|$|E

25|$|A related {{approach}} is the solar updraft tower, which heats air in glass enclosures at ground level and sends the heated air up a tower driving turbines at the base. Updraft towers do not pump water, which increases their efficiency, but do require large amounts of land for the collectors.

5|$|The left {{ventricle}} is much thicker {{as compared with}} the right, due to the greater force needed <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> blood to the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The {{left ventricle}} pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E
5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} {{of a cell}} has multiple functions. These include transporting nutrients into the cell, allowing waste to leave, preventing materials from entering the cell, averting needed materials from leaving the cell, maintaining the pH of the cytosol, and preserving the osmotic pressure of the cytosol. Transport proteins which allow some materials to pass through but not others are used for these functions. These proteins use ATP hydrolysis <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> materials against their concentration gradients.|$|E

5|$|After the Gas Boom {{began to}} sweep {{the state in the}} 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} the creation of a public corporation <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> natural gas from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{hydraulic}} response <b>to</b> <b>pumping</b> of leaky perched aquifers that receive continuous recharge. We explore whether distinct drawdown curves result that might reveal boundary effects or {{the position of}} the production well within the aquifer. Three-dimensional saturated-unsaturated simulations were developed to generate both circular (point-source recharge) and rectangular (line-source recharge) perched aquifer systems. Once the simulations stabilized at quasi steady-state in response <b>to</b> recharge, <b>pumping</b> at a constant-rate was imposed on the perched aquifer system. Diagnostic plots of the simulated log drawdown log time, as well as time-derivative curves, were analyzed. Results showed a repeatable, distinctive pattern of late-time negative slope-derivative curves that result from the size of the perched aquifer decreasing due <b>to</b> <b>pumping</b> and from continuing leakage through the aquitard as the system returns to steady-state. Because leakage decreases as the size and saturated thickness of the perched aquifer diminishes, additional water is available <b>to</b> meet <b>pump</b> demands and the rate of drawdown in the well decreases. This behavior is due to the small and constrained geometry of the aquifer. A lower pump rate required less reductio...|$|R
5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 29 Pump intake is {{designed}} to provide adequate water supply <b>to</b> <b>pumps.</b> It is essential <b>to</b> design the <b>pump</b> intake <b>to</b> provide fairly uniform and swirl free flow <b>to</b> <b>pumps.</b> However, it is not always possible due to site constraints. Investigation of pump intake is required prior <b>to</b> installing the <b>pumps</b> at site. There are two approaches (experimental and numerical) followed for such investigation. The present paper describes a case study wherein air entrainment (vortex with full air-core) was observed in experimental study at lowest water level (LWL) in the original geometry. The pump intake was modified with a goal to eliminate air entrainment. The experimental model was built with these modifications and the air entrainment was seen to be eliminated. The model was investigate using a numerical approach. A commercial code was used to carry out two-phase flow studies to capture air entrainment. The paper brings out results and observations for both numerical and experimental approaches...|$|R
