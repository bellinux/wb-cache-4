40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} complete non-collapsed three dimensional Riemannian manifolds (M 3, g) with Ricci curvature bounded from below and controlled growth: that is (M 3, g) satisfies (a) Ricci(g) ≥ k for some k ∈ R (Ricci curvature bounded from below), (b) vol (g B 1 (x)) ≥ v 0 > 0 for all x ∈ M, for some v 0 ∈ R + (non collapsed), (c) supg Br(x) |Riem(g) | ≤ h(r) (controlled growth) where h(r) = exp oexp o [...] . exp(r) is {{the composition of}} the exponential function l times with itself for some l ∈ N. If (M 3, g 0) is in this class, then we show that there exist a constant T(v 0) > 0 and a smooth solution to Ricci flow (M 3, g(t)) t∈[0,T) with (M 3, g(0)) = (M 3, g 0).

First published July 6, 2011; doi: 10. 1152 /jn. 01063. 2010. -How {{the central nervous system}} coordinates the many intrinsic degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal system is a recurrent question in motor control. Numerous studies addressed it by considering redundant reaching tasks such as point-to-point arm movements, for which many joint trajectories and muscle activations are usually compatible with a single goal. There exists, however, a different, extrinsic kind of redundancy that is target redundancy. Many times, indeed, the final point to reach is neither specified nor unique. In this study, we aim to understand how the central nervous system tackles such an extrinsic redundancy by considering a reaching-to-a-manifold paradigm, more specifically an arm pointing to a long vertical bar. In this case, the endpoint is not defined a priori and, therefore, subjects are free to choose any point on the bar to successfully achieve the task. We investigated the strategies used by subjects to handle this presented choice. Our results indicate both intersubject and intertrial consistency with respect to the freedom provided by the task. However, the subjects' behavior is found to be more variable than during classical point-to-point reaches. Interestingly, the average arm trajectories to the bar and the structure of intertrial endpoint variations could be explained via stochastic optimal control with an energy/smoothness expected cost and signal-dependent motor noise. We conclude that target redundancy is first overcome during movement planning and then exploited during movement execution, in agreement with stochastic optimal feedback control principles, which illustrates how the complementary problems of goal and movement selection may be resolved at once.
