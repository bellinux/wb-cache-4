5|$|On January 3, 1963, NATO Supreme Commander General Lauris Norstad visited Ottawa, {{in one of}} {{a series}} of visits to member nations prior to his retirement. At a news conference, Norstad stated that if Canada did not accept nuclear weapons, it would not be {{fulfilling}} its commitments to NATO. Newspapers across Canada criticized Diefenbaker, who was convinced <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>was</b> part of a plot by Kennedy to bring down his government. Although the Liberals had been previously indecisive on the question of nuclear weapons, on January 12, Pearson made a speech stating that the government should live up to the commitments it had made.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>was</b> {{the result}} of an intense {{argument}} in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said the statement represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E

5|$|As Prime Minister from 14 January 1991 to 22 August 1991 Pavlov {{initiated}} the 1991 Soviet monetary reform, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, in early 1991. Early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of Soviet roubles transported to the Soviet Union from abroad. Although ridiculed at the time, <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>was</b> later proven to be true. In June the same year, Pavlov called for a transfer of power from the President of the Soviet Union to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. When that failed, he joined a plot to oust Gorbachev. In August, he participated in the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, which tried to prevent the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-Soviet Russia. He was succeeded as premier by Ivan Silayev.|$|E
5|$|In June 1866 the Claimant {{moved to}} Sydney, {{where he was}} able to raise money from banks {{on the basis of a}} {{statutory}} declaration that he was Roger Tichborne. <b>The</b> <b>statement</b> <b>was</b> later found to contain many errors, although the birthdate and parentage details were given correctly. It included a brief account of how he had arrived in Australia: he and others from the sinking Bella, he said, had been picked up by the Osprey, bound for Melbourne. On arrival he had taken the name Thomas Castro from an acquaintance from Melipilla and had wandered for some years before settling in Wagga Wagga. He had married a pregnant housemaid, Mary Ann Bryant, and taken her child, a daughter, as his own; a further daughter had been born in March 1866.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>was</b> not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E

5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of fuzzy logic {{is that a}} real number is {{assigned}} to each statement written in a language, within a range from 0 to 1, where 1 means that <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> completely true, and 0 means that <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> completely false, while values less than 1 but greater than 0 represent that <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> [...] "partly true", to a given, quantifiable extent.

50|$|The Epimenides paradox in this form, however, can be solved. There are two options: it {{is either}} true or false. First, assume that it is true, but then Epimenides, being a Cretan, would be a liar, and making the {{assumption}} that liars only make false <b>statements,</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> false. So, assuming <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true leads us to conclude that <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> false. This is a contradiction, so the option of <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> being true <b>is</b> not possible. This leaves the second option: that it is false.|$|R

5000|$|Consider the statement: [...] "I am hungry." [...] Though {{its meaning}} is {{constant}} in time, the truth value of <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> can vary in time.
