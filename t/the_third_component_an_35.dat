The second <b>component,</b> <b>an</b> amusement park, is laid out along an axial landscaped mall at roughly 90 degrees to the Parkway approach.

A midway cross-axis terminates in a gate at the large parking lot on its inland end and at a promontory at its waterside end. The main axis terminates in a 100 foot tall Music Tower that now has a performance stage at its base.
