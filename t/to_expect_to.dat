The brigade's mission was to restore law and order and disarm the Japanese military forces in the area. They were told <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> remain in Java until relieved by units of the Royal Netherlands Army. Under the command of the 23rd Indian Infantry Division, the brigade carried out Operation Pounce, clearing the town and surrounding region of dissidents.

25|$|Many salient {{characteristics}} of the fundamental molecules of life (those found in all three domains) all point directly to the involvement of UV-C light in the dissipative structuring of incipient life. Some {{of the most difficult}} problems concerning the origin of life, such as enzyme-less replication of RNA and DNA, homochirality of the fundamental molecules, and the origin of information encoding in RNA and DNA, also find an explanation within the same dissipative thermodynamic framework by considering the probable existence of a relation between primordial replication and UV-C photon dissipation. Michaelian suggests that it is erroneous <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> describe the emergence, proliferation, or even evolution, of life without overwhelming reference to entropy production through the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential, in particular, the prevailing solar photon flux.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were made to}} detect a link between Australian and Papuan languages, the latter being represented by those spoken on the coastal areas of New Guinea facing the Torres Strait and the Arafura Sea. In 1986 William A. Foley noted lexical similarities between Robert M. W. Dixon's 1980 reconstruction of proto-Australian and the East New Guinea Highlands languages. He believed that it was naïve <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find a single Papuan or Australian language family when New Guinea and Australia had been a single landmass (called the Sahul continent) for most of their human history, having been separated by the Torres Strait only 8000 years ago, and that a deep reconstruction would likely include languages from both. Dixon, in the meantime, later abandoned his proto-Australian proposal.|$|E
50|$|Jung {{concluded}} that, {{in addition}} to our Personal Unconscious, we each possess a deeper aspect of the unconscious. It was in identifying this second unconscious region that Jung’s model differentiated itself from Freud’s. Naming it the Collective Unconscious, Jung theorized that this region contained psychological elements not developed {{during the course of}} our own lives, but passed on through our common evolutionary history to all members of our species. There are shared, fundamental elements that make up the Collective Unconscious and generate a limiting framework around which our psychic material organizes. He referred to those as Archetypes. Archetypes are the fundamental elements of the collective unconscious. Jung, states that every human being is born with a psyche that <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> engage, influence, and to undergo certain life milestones. For instance, our psyches have evolved <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> us <b>to</b> be born, <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> us <b>to</b> have parents, <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> us <b>to</b> encounter particular types of other people and creatures with which we share the earth, <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> us <b>to</b> have children, and <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> us <b>to</b> eventually die. These fundamental psychological expectations have become embodied, Jung claimed, in a common set of basic tendencies in the unconscious that predispose us to generate particular ideas, concepts and imagery related to them. These tendencies are the Archetypes.|$|R

The Cat Nation Neighbored the Upper Algonquians {{to the east and}} scattered around the southern shore of Lake Erie. From the other direction, kindred Kentaientonga villages were destroyed by Iroquois as they told to the French years afterward. At Le Chine in 1669 at Montreal Island, La Salle was told <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find Chaouanon (Algonquian) and Honniasontkeronon (Iroquois) villages on the Ohio above the falls or above Louisville, Kentucky.

25|$|Peterson's father, Nelson Peterson, was {{released}} from prison during the 2006 college football season and was able to watch his son as a spectator {{for the first time on}} October 14, 2006, when Oklahoma played Iowa State. Oklahoma defeated Iowa State in that game; however, on the final drive for the Sooners, Peterson broke his collar bone when he dove into the end zone on a 53-yard touchdown run. During a press conference on October 18, Peterson said he was told by doctors <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> be out for 4–6 weeks. At the time of the injury, Peterson needed only to gain 150yards to pass Billy Sims as the University of Oklahoma's all-time leading rusher. He was unable to return for the rest of the Sooners' regular season and missed seven games. The Sooners would turn to Allen Patrick, a junior, and Chris Brown, a freshman, to replace Peterson. The team went on a seven-game winning streak including winning the Big 12 Championship game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers. He returned for their last game against Boise State in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, where he rushed for 77yards and a touchdown. He refused to discuss his plans beyond the end of this season with the press. He concluded his college football career with 1,112 rushing yards his final season, even after missing multiple games due to injury for a total of 4,245 rushing yards (only three seasons). He finished 73yards short of passing Billy Sims as Oklahoma's all-time leading rusher.|$|E

IGN UK expressed a mixed opinion about the character, feeling his personality was sometimes annoying, although it served to contrast with the serious attitudes of the other main characters.
