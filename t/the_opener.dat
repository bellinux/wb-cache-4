5|$|<b>The</b> <b>opener</b> against Missouri was a {{much closer}} contest than the {{previous}} year's record-setting game. Ed Vereb rushed for a 14-yard touchdown and Tamburello passed for another, but only failed extra-point attempts by Missouri {{in the second half}} preserved victory, 13–12.|$|E
5|$|This {{decision}} garnered {{national attention}} {{as an example}} of conflict between professional pressures and personal religious beliefs. Don Drysdale pitched <b>the</b> <b>opener,</b> but was hit hard by the Minnesota Twins.|$|E
5|$|Australian Merv Hughes is {{the only}} bowler to take a hat-trick where the wickets fell over three overs. He took a wicket with the final ball of an over. With the first ball of the next over he took the final wicket of the West Indies innings. He then removed <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> Gordon Greenidge with the first ball of the West Indies second innings.|$|E
5000|$|... (Note: some {{partnerships}} use a [...] "forcing pass" [...] by {{the partner}} of <b>the</b> 1NT <b>opener.</b> <b>The</b> 1NT <b>opener</b> is then obliged to redouble. The partner of <b>the</b> 1NT <b>opener</b> may then pass the redouble {{with a good}} hand and 1NT redoubled is judged to be makeable, or with a poor hand initiate bidding 4-card suits up-the-line until at least at 4-3 suit fit is found).|$|R
50|$|They {{toured the}} United States several times, {{including}} stints as <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> for Desmond Dekker and Bad Manners. In addition, they toured Europe in 1998 supporting Laurel Aitken.|$|R
5000|$|Limit Raises: A jump-raise of <b>the</b> <b>opener's</b> suit by responder, in {{the absence}} of {{opponent}} interference, is invitational to game. In Goren's system, this was a strong game-forcing raise.|$|R
5|$|Despite the Wales loss against Australia, the {{selectors}} kept {{faith with}} John, and he retained his {{place for the}} next Wales international. Played away from home, <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> of the 1967 Five Nations Championship against Scotland had him paired at half-back with Cardiff's Billy Hullin. John played badly while carrying a leg injury, and the very next match he was dropped, replaced by the more experienced Watkins.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> of the World Cup 2007, Argentina {{defeated}} France 17–12. However, after defeating Ireland 25–3, France {{qualified for}} the quarter-finals. After defeating the New Zealand All Blacks 20–18, they lost to England 14–9 in the semi-final. France then lost {{for a second time}} to Argentina 34–10 in the third-place match. In 2010, France won its ninth Grand Slam.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2015, it was {{confirmed}} that Hamburg had exercised their option to make Holtby's loan move permanent for a reported fee of £4.6million. He scored his first {{goal for the}} club on 29 August 2015, netting <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> in a 2–1 loss to Köln, and scored twice more for the season, including one in a 3–1 win over Dortmund in November, as Hamburg improved to end the campaign in tenth position.|$|E
25|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> is <b>the</b> No. 3 or one-drop batsman. His {{job is to}} {{take over}} from <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> and {{typically}} play a careful and prolonged innings, effectively tying up {{one end of the}} batting. This brings in some stability in the batting, as new batsmen find it difficult to settle down and it helps to have a settled batsman at the other end. The best batsman of the team is usually put at number 3 or 4, to protect him from the difficulties of batting against the best bowlers on a fresh pitch and to allow him to play a long innings.|$|R
50|$|On 14 September, the Eagles {{made their}} {{first-class}} debut against the Mountaineers. It was also <b>the</b> tournament <b>opener.</b> <b>The</b> match was drawn.|$|R
5000|$|Peters {{included}} a machine called a [...] "Language Integrator" [...] {{in front of}} the sealed chamber to teach <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> how to speak English, which was another concept carried on to the Westinghouse Time Capsules.|$|R
5|$|Sanchez entered spring {{practice}} {{after the}} 2008 {{season as the}} front-runner {{to take over the}} starting quarterback position, but faced strong competition from redshirt freshman Aaron Corp and Mitch Mustain, a transfer from Arkansas, where he had been the starting quarterback; Mustain, like Sanchez, was named the top quarterback in the nation upon the conclusion of high school career in 2006. By the end of spring practice, Carroll announced Sanchez would be the starting quarterback heading into the fall. During the first week of fall camp, Sanchez dislocated his left kneecap during warm-ups prior to practice; trainers immediately put the kneecap back into place. After missing nearly three weeks, Sanchez was cleared to play in <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> against Virginia. Before <b>the</b> <b>opener,</b> Sanchez was contacted by USC's previous three quarterbacks—Carson Palmer, Leinart and Booty—who wished him well and offered general advice.|$|E
5|$|Their final {{series of}} the season, at home, was three games with the Braves. The Phillies won <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> with a strong start by Williams, who ended his Phillies season with a 2.83 ERA. Although Burnett pitched decently in game two, the Braves won 4–2. The Phillies' season ended when Hamels, despite a quality start, was on the losing end of a 2–1 final score.|$|E
5|$|Under Healey's captaincy, Darlington won the North-Eastern League {{title in}} 1920–21. In the FA Cup, they hosted Second Division club Blackpool {{in the first}} round. Healey scored <b>the</b> <b>opener,</b> was {{involved}} in Darlington's late equaliser, and missed another chance by heading wide when well placed; they lost the replay.|$|E
40|$|We {{have been}} {{investigating}} DNA state machines, especially those {{based on the}} opening of hairpin molecules in which state transitions are realized as hairpin loops are opened by molecules called openers. This paper introduces photo- and thermoregulation of such hairpin-based DNA machines, in which <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> become active by sensing external signals {{in the form of}} light or heat. We conducted fluorescence experiments and show that photo- and thermoregulation is possible. In <b>the</b> experiments, <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> become active when they are irradiated by UV light or when they receive heat as external input. For photoregulation, we use azobenzene-bearing oligonucleotides developed by the third author. ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{first-class}} cricket, {{the rate}} at which <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> score runs is not as important as [...] "taking the shine off" [...] the new ball. This is the process of softening and roughening the cricket ball, whose condition tends to degrade the longer it is in play. By occupying the crease {{for a long time and}} taking the shine off <b>the</b> ball, <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> themselves are able to score more freely later on. This also makes batting easier for the rest of the order. Because of the defensive technique required early on, openers are sometimes less fluent stroke-players than the specialist batsmen who follow.|$|R
50|$|As a {{freshman}} in 1926, Bennett scored {{two touchdowns in}} <b>the</b> season <b>opener</b> against DePauw. Indiana won <b>the</b> season <b>opener</b> 31-7 but finished {{the season with a}} 3-5 record. Bennett scored seven of the team's eleven touchdowns.|$|R
5|$|Arsenal played Newcastle United in {{the sixth}} round on 9 March 2002. It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, {{and in spite of}} Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> in the cup tie, Newcastle held them to a 1–1 draw. A replay was {{scheduled}} two weeks later at noon. Arsenal won by three goals to nil, but during the match lost Robert Pirès to injury; he was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season with medial knee ligament damage. An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick, was enough for Arsenal to win the semi-final.|$|E
5|$|Benzema {{made his}} 2011–12 {{competitive}} debut for Madrid {{in the first}} leg of the 2011 Supercopa de España against Barcelona. In the match, he started and assisted on the opening goal of the match, scored by Mesut Özil. In the second leg, with Madrid trailing 4–3 on aggregate late in the match, Benzema scored the equalizing goal to even the tie at 4–4. However, six minutes later, a Lionel Messi strike gave Barcelona the supercup. Benzema made his league debut for Madrid in the team's 6–0 away win over Real Zaragoza. In the team's next league match two weeks later against Getafe, Benzema scored a double in a 4–2 victory. After going scoreless in three consecutive league matches, he scored his third league goal of the campaign against Rayo Vallecano in a 4–2 win. In the team's ensuing match against Ajax in the Champions League, Benzema scored Madrid's third goal in a 3–0 home win. He also assisted on <b>the</b> <b>opener,</b> which was scored by Ronaldo. In the club's next Champions League match against Lyon, Benzema scored again netting <b>the</b> <b>opener.</b> He also turned provider for the second consecutive match assisting on a goal by Sami Khedira. Madrid won the match 4–0.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{returned}} {{to lead the}} Australians in the next match against Surrey at The Oval in London; Australia won the toss and batted first. Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris put on 136, before Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 before <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> fell for 176. Hassett came in and Bradman was dismissed for 146 at 3/403. Hassett struck form and reached his first century for the English summer, posting 110 before being clean bowled by Test seamer Alec Bedser as Australia were bowled out for 632. Bedser pitched an outswinger on leg stump and it moved away to clip Hassett's off stump. Bradman’s men then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings.|$|E
50|$|On September 12, 2011, Red Fang was {{announced}} {{as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> (<b>the</b> other being The Dillinger Escape Plan) for Mastodon's 2011 and 2012 tours in the United States and Europe respectively. Later in 2012, Red Fang embarked on a European headlining tour with Black Tusk, performing {{for the first time}} in various countries including Russia, Ukraine, and Greece.|$|R
5000|$|Canapé. With two-suited hands, <b>the</b> <b>opener's</b> second bid is in {{the longer}} suit, whereas other more popular systems bid their shorter suit second. However, unlike the [...] "fellow" [...] Roman Club, there are many {{exceptions}} to this rule in Blue Club.|$|R
5|$|In {{the week}} prior to <b>the</b> 2007 home <b>opener,</b> <b>the</b> Ramblin' Wreck was {{featured}} on ESPN First Take. ESPN showed old clips of the Wreck leading {{the football team}} onto the field and discussed {{the possibility of the}} Wreck not making <b>the</b> football <b>opener</b> after 45 consecutive years of never missing a game.|$|R
5|$|Brown thus gained {{selection}} for the First Test, batting {{out of position}} in the middle order while Sid Barnes and Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches when Australia fielded their first-choice team; Harvey did not play and Brown batted out of position in the middle order. There was a chance of Harvey receiving a last-minute call-up when Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week {{leading up to the}} Test, but <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> recovered.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2016 season, Morris {{announced}} that he would be transferring from Michigan for the 2017 football season. On January 21, 2017, he announced he would join the Central Michigan Chippewas. Morris entered the season with an unresolved status following a quarterback battle with redshirt freshman Tony Poljan; both were expected to play in <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> against Rhode Island. Morris ended up playing the majority of the opening triple overtime victory. In week 2, Morris posted 467 yards passing and 5 touchdowns in an upset victory against Kansas. The performance earned Morris recognition as the Mid-American Conference West Division Player of the Week and as one of eight NCAA finalists for the weekly Manning Award for quarterback performances.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013 Rehman {{represented}} Pakistan at the SAFF Championship {{which was}} held in Nepal. He played all of the games for Pakistan who narrowly missed out on a semi-final spot despite beating Bangladesh in the last group game. His commanding displays during the tournament earned him {{a place in the}} Team of the Tournament. In October 2013, Rehman captained Pakistan in both of their games at The Peace Cup held in the Philippines, and scored the winning goal in <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> against Chinese Taipei.|$|E
50|$|Currently, LSU {{does not}} wear the {{traditional}} white jerseys for every home game. LSU only wears white jerseys for <b>the</b> home <b>opener</b> and for home games against SEC opponents. For non-SEC home games other than <b>the</b> home <b>opener,</b> LSU wears purple jerseys at home.|$|R
5000|$|The limit {{raises and}} {{preemptive}} raises of major suits in the Standard American Yellow Card bidding system also {{conform to the}} Law of Total Tricks. By opening a major suit normally, the opening bidder promises at least five cards of the major suit. A [...] "limit" [...] raise, which is a response of three of <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> suit, requires ten to twelve high card points and four cards in the responders suit, {{for a total of}} nine. Likewise, a preemptive raise, which is a bid of four of <b>the</b> <b>openers</b> suit, requires five cards in that suit, for a total of ten. The Law of Total tricks allows the opening bidder to raise such responses by the number of cards in excess of five in that suit.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> season <b>opener,</b> <b>the</b> Gators met the Charleston Southern Buccaneers in Gainesville. In a {{game that}} was never close, the Gators won 62-3. John Brantley threw for 67 yards and 2 touchdowns.|$|R
5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once. At the other end, Morris {{continued}} {{to take advantage}} of Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> on 63 and his captain on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} playoff {{starting}} debut against the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2009 National League Division Series (NLDS). He went 6 innings, striking out 4, walking 1, {{and ended up}} getting a no-decision (the Dodgers {{went on to win}} the game in the 9th inning). At 21 years old, he started <b>the</b> <b>opener</b> of the 2009 NLCS against the Philadelphia Phillies and was the third youngest pitcher to ever start a playoff series opener, behind only Fernando Valenzuela in the 1981 NLDS and Rick Ankiel in the 2000 NLDS.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers {{appeared}} for Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW), in the ECW arena, on March 24, 2001 at March Madness Night 2, {{losing to}} Insane Dragon and Dixie in <b>the</b> <b>opener.</b> It is unclear how, if at all, JAPW's {{ownership and management}} worked around Pennsylvania's child labor law, as both brothers were underage {{at the time of}} this and two subsequent appearances in the old ECW arena. They made three other appearances in JAPW in 2001, all against Insane Dragon & Dixie – one a victory, one that ended in a no contest due to outside interference, and the last an unsuccessful challenge for Dragon and Dixie's JAPW Tag Team Championship on June 15 at Here to Stay.|$|E
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to beat the {{scorching}} heat, the event date was changed to become <b>the</b> season <b>opener</b> <b>the</b> next year. It was held on March 11, 1990. Senna won. Jean Alesi finished 2nd.|$|R
