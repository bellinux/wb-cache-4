5|$|During the Civil War, a {{group of}} secessionists met at the Russellville to form a Confederate {{government}} for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. While <b>this</b> <b>government</b> never successfully displaced the government in Frankfort, two men were elected governor of the Confederate government: George W. Johnson, who served from November 20, 1861 to his death on April 8, 1862 at the Battle of Shiloh, and, on Johnson's death, Richard Hawes, who served until the Confederate surrender on April 9, 1865. The Confederate government disbanded shortly {{after the end of}} the war in 1865.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy of}} <b>this</b> <b>Government</b> is universally known. The {{people of the}} United States are opposed to predatory {{activities}} no matter whether they are carried on {{by the use of}} force or by the threat of force. They are likewise opposed to any form of intervention on the part of one state, however powerful, in the domestic concerns of any other sovereign state, however weak.|$|E
5|$|The state {{responded by}} {{establishing}} the Department of Divinity ("jingikan") in 1869. <b>This</b> <b>government</b> bureaucracy encouraged the segregation of Kami spirits from Buddhist ones, and emphasized the divine lineage of the Emperor from the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu. This action sought to reverse {{what had been}} a blending of Buddhist and Shinto practices in Japan. That department was unsuccessful, and demoted to a Ministry. In 1872, policy for Shrines and other religions was taken over by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry intended to standardize rituals across shrines, and saw some small success, but fell short of its original intent.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Oregon Territory in 1848, the Oregon Country provisional government, through legislation on June 27, 1844 and December 19, 1845, selected Oregon City as the capital. Thus Oregon's first capitol was in Oregon City. One of the private buildings used by <b>this</b> <b>government</b> was constructed by John L. Morrison in 1850; it served as a capitol until the government moved to Salem. The designation of Oregon City as the seat of power was by proclamation of Governor Joseph Lane. In 1850, the legislature passed an act designating Salem the capital. However, Governor John P. Gaines refused to relocate and remained in Oregon City along with the Oregon Supreme Court (except justice Orville C. Pratt) until an act of Congress on May 14, 1852 settled the matter in Salem's favor.|$|E
5|$|Krug {{strongly}} opposed {{the notion that}} libraries ought to censor the material that they provide to patrons. She supported laws and policies protecting the confidentiality of library use records. When the United States Department of Justice used {{the authority of the}} USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of once-confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against <b>this</b> <b>government</b> action. When shortly after the September 11 attacks a Florida librarian told police that one of the attackers had been using the Delray Beach public libraryalthough Florida law guarantees confidentiality to library patronsKrug criticized the action. She stated she wished the librarian had adhered to Florida law, but empathized with the situation and said that most individuals would likely have done the same thing.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} impacts of the {{revolution}} in Zanzibar was to break {{the power of the}} Arab/Asian ruling class, who had held it for around 200 years. Despite the merger with Tanganyika, Zanzibar retained a Revolutionary Council and House of Representatives which was, until 1992, run on a one-party system and has power over domestic matters. The domestic government is led by the President of Zanzibar, Karume being the first holder of this office. <b>This</b> <b>government</b> used the success of the revolution to implement reforms across the island. Many of these involved the removal of power from Arabs. The Zanzibar civil service, for example, became an almost entirely African organisation, and land was redistributed from Arabs to Africans. The revolutionary government also instituted social reforms such as free healthcare and opening up the education system to African students (who had occupied only 12% of secondary school places before the revolution).|$|E

5|$|The 1st Battalion, The Rhodesian Light Infantry, {{commonly}} the Rhodesian Light Infantry (1RLI or RLI), {{served in}} the Rhodesian Bush War {{as part of the}} Rhodesian Security Forces between 1964 and 1979, under the unrecognised government of Rhodesia following its 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain. During the second half of 1979 it fought for Zimbabwe Rhodesia, a black majority-ruled version of the same state which also failed to win international recognition. After an interim period under British control from December 1979 to April 1980, the RLI briefly remained active within the armed forces of Zimbabwe, but did not see action under <b>this</b> <b>government.</b> It disbanded on 31 October 1980.|$|E
5|$|The PKWN was {{reshaped}} {{into the}} Provisional Government (Rząd Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej; RTRP), which functioned from January 1945. <b>This</b> <b>government</b> was headed by Edward Osóbka-Morawski, a socialist, but the communists, mostly non-PPR Soviet employees, such as Michał Rola-Żymierski, held {{a majority of}} key posts. In April 1945, a Polish-Soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed; it severely limited the possibilities of future Western or émigré impact or internal cooperation with non-communist political forces in Poland. The consecutive early Soviet-influenced governments were subordinate to the unelected, communist-controlled parliament, the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa; KRN), formed by Gomułka and his PPR in occupied Warsaw in January 1944. The communist governmental structures were not recognized by the increasingly isolated Polish government-in-exile, which had formed its own quasi-parliament, the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej; RJN).|$|E
5|$|On {{becoming}} king in 1272, Edward I reestablished royal power, overhauling {{the royal}} finances and {{appealing to the}} broader English elite by using Parliament to authorise the raising of new taxes and to hear petitions concerning abuses of local governance. This political balance collapsed under Edward II and savage civil wars broke out during the 1320s. Edward III restored order once more {{with the help of}} a majority of the nobility, exercising power through the exchequer, the common bench and the royal household. <b>This</b> <b>government</b> was better organised and on a larger scale than ever before, and by the 14th century the king's formerly peripatetic chancery had to take up permanent residence in Westminster. Edward used Parliament even more than his predecessors to handle general administration, to legislate and to raise the necessary taxes to pay for the wars in France. The royal lands—and incomes from them—had diminished over the years, and increasingly frequent taxation was required to support royal initiatives. Edward held elaborate chivalric events in an effort to unite his supporters around the symbols of knighthood. The ideal of chivalry continued to develop throughout the 14th century, reflected in the growth of knightly orders (including the Order of the Garter), grand tournaments and round table events.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{in early}} 1993, when the teams in Arusha signed a full power sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF {{and other major}} opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. <b>This</b> <b>government</b> was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until {{free and fair elections}} could be held. The agreement was reasonably equitable given the balance of power at the time and Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition and the RPF all accepted it; however, the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting both the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger scale killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole northwest of Rwanda and lasted for six days, with numerous houses burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed. Paul Kagame, reacting to stories brought to him first hand by survivors seeking refuge in rebel territory, announced that he was pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six month cease-fire.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "The {{real question is}} what form of instability would be more dangerous — that caused by <b>this</b> Iranian <b>government</b> with nuclear weapons, or that caused by attacking <b>this</b> <b>government's</b> nuclear weapons program. It's time to have a serious debate about the choice between these two kinds of destabilization, instead of just refusing to confront the choice." ...|$|R
