50|$|A Stevenson {{screen or}} {{instrument}} shelter is a shelter or an enclosure to shield meteorological instruments against precipitation and direct heat radiation from outside sources, while still allowing air to circulate freely around them. It forms {{part of a}} standard weather station. The Stevenson screen holds instruments that may include thermometers (ordinary, maximum/minimum), a hygrometer, a psychrometer, a dewcell, a barometer and a thermograph. Stevenson screens may also {{be known as a}} cotton region shelter, an instrument shelter, a thermometer shelter, a thermoscreen or a <b>thermometer</b> <b>screen.</b> Its purpose is to provide a standardised environment in which to measure temperature, humidity, dewpoint and atmospheric pressure.|$|E
50|$|It was {{designed}} by Thomas Stevenson (1818-1887), a British civil engineer who designed many lighthouses, and was father of the author Robert Louis Stevenson.Thomas Stevenson’s development of his small <b>thermometer</b> <b>screen</b> with double louvered walls on all sides and no floor was reported in 1864. After comparisons with other screens in the UK, Stevenson’s original design was modified. The modifications by Mawley of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1884 included a double roof, a floor with slanted boards, and a modification of the double louvers. This design {{was adopted by the}} British Meteorological Office and eventually other national services such as Canada. The national services developed their own variations such as the single louvered Cotton Region design in the United States.|$|E

Under low ventilation (2 mwind speed u 2 2 m s− 1, L ∼ 2. 5 min, increasing, when calm, {{to at least}} 15 min. Spectral response properties of the screen to air temperature fluctuations vary with wind speed because of the lag changes. Ventilation effects are particularly apparent at the higher (> 25 ◦C) temperatures, both through the lag effect and from solar heating. For sites where wind speed decreases with increasing daytime temperature, <b>thermometer</b> <b>screen</b> temperatures may consequently show larger uncertainties at the higher temperatures.

40|$|<b>Thermometer</b> <b>screen</b> {{properties}} are poorly characterised at low wind speeds. Temperatures {{from a large}} <b>thermometer</b> <b>screen</b> have been compared with those from an automatically shaded open-air fine-wire resistance thermometer. For the majority of 5 -minute average measurements obtained between July 2008 and 2009, the screen and fine-wire temperatures agreed closely, with a median difference < 0. 05 ◦C. At low wind speeds however, larger temperature differences occurred. When calm (wind speed at 2 metres, u 2, ≤ 0. 1 m s− 1), the difference between screen and open-air temperatures varied from − 0. 25 ◦C to + 0. 87 ◦C. At night with u 2 < 0. 5 m s− 1, this difference was − 0. 14 ◦C to 0. 39 ◦C, and, rarely, up to − 0. 68 ◦C to 1. 38 ◦C.

40|$|Relative {{humidity}} (RH) measurements, as {{derived from}} wet-bulb and dry-bulb thermometers operated as a psychrometer within a <b>thermometer</b> <b>screen,</b> have limited accuracy because of natural ventilation variations. Standard RH calculations generally assume a fixed screen psychrometer coefficient, {{but this is}} too small during poor ventilation. By comparing a reference humidity probe—exposed within a screen containing a psychrometer—with wind-speed measurements under controlled conditions, a wind-speed correction for the screen psychrometer coefficient has been derived and applicable when 2 -metre wind speeds fall below 3 ms– 1. Applying this to hourly-averaged data reduced the mean moist RH bias of the psychrometer (over the reference probe) from 1. 2 % to 0. 4 %, and reduced the inter-quartile range of the RH differences from 2. 0 % to 0. 8 %. This correction is particularly amenable to automatic measurement systems...|$|E
40|$|Air {{humidity}} is {{an important}} input variable to estimate terrestrial evapotranspiration based on satellite remote sensing. The air humidity obtained by the observations from surface meteorological stations is limited in their spatial and temporal representation. The validated GDAS (Global Data Assimilation System) dataset can provide the simulated data every 3 hours [1]; and the FY- 2 C (the first operational geostationary meteorological satellite FengYun- 2 C from China) can provide the data of land surface temperature hourly. Moreover, they are of great value in downscaling the air humidity. Air humidity (2 m height above the ground level) both from <b>thermometer</b> <b>screen</b> to high ground {{is driven by the}} advection, the turbulence and the radiation processes [2]. As Zent et al. [3] put it in 1993, thermal inertia can be used to study the changes of air humidity. North China was chosen as the study area. Using the GDAS forcing dataset, the MODIS, FY- 2 C and ground observations, a new method is proposed to downscale the near surface air humidity based on thermal inertia. Finally, in order to evaluate the performance of our method, Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation, SPLINE interpolation, together with the ground measurements were used to compare with our method...|$|E
40|$|Extract: Background There {{are more}} {{survivors}} {{of prostate cancer}} (PCa) than any other cancer [1]. Although {{there are a number}} of successful treatments for PCa such as prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy or active surveillance (for men with low grade cancer that is monitored until there is evidence of need for curative treatment), there is evidence that each of these carries some adverse symptomatic side effects which last into ‘survivorship’, or at least 5 years post-diagnosis as defined by the American Cancer Society [2]. These symptomatic side effects have been investigated by measures such as the EORTC QLQ PR- 25 and associated scales, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s Distress <b>Thermometer</b> <b>Screening</b> Tool and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice. Self-report scales that measure anxiety, depression and quality of life are also used when investigating the longer-term effects of PCa treatment upon survivors...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To quantitatively summarize, in a meta-analysis, the {{existing}} literature concerning the effect of rapid screening for depression / distress in cancer settings and to examine the benefits of rapid screening for emotional distress in local cancer patients. Methods. For the meta-analysis, a search and critical appraisal was made of observational studies and interventional implementation trials studies to August 2012. After excluding quality of life studies, 29 publications were located, involving a total of 15, 176 unique cancer patients. In the primary local implementation study using a sequential cohort design, 50 chemotherapy nurses and treatment radiographers were asked to implement a screening programme for distress/depression/unmet needs as part of routine care and record their feedback before and after application of the distress thermometer (DT) and emotion <b>thermometer</b> (ET) <b>screens.</b> Data were available on 539 clinician-patient assessments involving 379 patients.

40|$|Background: The recent Ebola {{virus disease}} (EVD) {{outbreak}} {{has been described}} as unprecedented in terms of morbidity, mortality, and geographical extension. It also revealed many weaknesses and inadequacies for disease surveillance and response systems in Africa due to underqualified staff, cultural beliefs, and lack of trust for the formal health care sector. In 2014, Ghana had high risk of importation of EVD cases. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the EVD surveillance and response system in northern Ghana. Design: This was an observational study conducted among 47 health workers (district directors, medical, disease control, and laboratory officers) in all 13 districts of the Upper East Region representing public, mission, and private health services. A semi-structured questionnaire with focus on core and support functions (e. g. detection, confirmation) was administered to the informants. Their responses were recorded according to specific themes. In addition, 34 weekly Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response reports (August 2014 to March 2015) were collated from each district. Results: In 2014 and 2015, a total of 10 suspected Ebola cases were clinically diagnosed from four districts. Out of the suspected cases, eight died and the cause of death was unexplained. All the 10 suspected cases were reported, none was confirmed. The informants had knowledge on EVD surveillance and data reporting. However, there were gaps such as delayed reporting, low quality protective equipment (e. g. gloves, aprons), inadequate staff, and lack of laboratory capacity. The majority (38 / 47) of the respondents were not satisfied with EVD surveillance system and response preparedness due to lack of infrared <b>thermometers,</b> ineffective <b>screening,</b> and lack of isolation centres. Conclusion: EVD surveillance and response preparedness is insufficient and the epidemic is a wake-up call for early detection and response preparedness. Ebola surveillance remains a neglected public health issue. Thus, disease surveillance strengthening is urgently needed in Ghana...|$|R
40|$|Air {{and soil}} {{temperatures}} were measured in 1974 - 85 in 3 clear felled areas and 3 neighbouring forest stands dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) in N. Finland. Daily temperatures were measured with thermograph plotters and maximum and minimum <b>thermometers</b> in meteorological <b>screens</b> (2 m {{above the ground}}), and a Grant device at 10 cm above the ground and at 5, 50 and 100 cm below ground level. Clear felling had no significant influence on air temperature at 2 m above the ground. The daily air temperature maxima at 10 cm were greater in the clear fell area than in the forest; the daily temperature minima at 10 cm were less in the clear fell area. Night frosts were {{more common in the}} clear fell area. Daily soil temperatures at 5 cm depth were 2 - 3 degrees C greater in the clear fell area than in the forest; temperatures at 50 cm and 100 cm depth were 3 - 5 degrees C greater. A sparse sapling stand developed from plantings and natural regeneration. Consequently, the differences between the clear fell area and the forest did not diminish during the 12 years following clear felling...|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} random and {{systematic}} uncertainties affecting the central England temperature (CET) record since 1878 on daily, monthly and annual time scales. The largest contribution to uncertainty in CET {{on all these}} time scales arises from areal sampling, followed for annual and monthly CET by thermometer calibration. For the daily series, random <b>thermometer</b> precision and <b>screen</b> errors are the second largest source of uncertainty. Annual CETs are least uncertain, whereas daily CETs are most uncertain. Despite the uncertainties in annual mean CET, the trend of 0. 077 °C per decade since 1900 is significant at the 1 % level. In an additional investigation, we detect biases in the published series of central England maximum and minimum temperatures, and implement systematic adjustments of up to ± 0. 2 °C to the values up to 1921 and up to ± 0. 1 °C tothe values since 1980. These adjustments are of opposite sign in maximum and minimum temperature, so they do not affect mean CET, but they improve the homogeneity of the diurnal temperature range, which then shows little trend before 1980 and a reduced rising trend thereafter. The uncertainties in maximum and minimum temperature make the data inadequat...|$|R
40|$|Many of {{scientific}} researchers used {{data collected from}} meteorology to compute for the level of discomfort index for prediction but no attempt by scientist in third world nations, Nigeria inclusive to measure level of discomfort index directly. In this paper {{attempt was made to}} measure level of discomfort index using Thom model directly. In this model, dry and wet temperatures are required. The dry and wet thermometer was designed using microcontroller and Thom model equation was embedded inside the microcontroller. The system uses dry and wet temperature developed using semiconductor temperature sensors (LM 35) for computing discomfort level of the room or/and hall in question. Other material require in the system are multiplexer (CD 4052), analog to digital converter (ADC 0804), microcontroller (AT 80 S 52) and intelligent display unit (Hitachi's LCD HD 44780). An assembly language was written to take in data and compute for the Thom model. The temperature measurement using LM 35 for dry and wet was completely in agreement with convention built using mercury in glass <b>thermometer</b> in Steven <b>Screen</b> in The Federal University of technology, Akure meteorological garden. Also, the output of the discomfort level index was in agreement with computed data for each set of measurement by equipment...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} the Distress Thermometer in an Australian population using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as the criterion measure for case detection. Patients and methods: A cross-sectional survey of 439 cancer patients (61. 2 % response) under current medical care at a regional tertiary cancer centre was undertaken. Assessments included general distress, anxiety and depression, general health and well-being, cancer-specific distress, social support, and social constraints. The screening properties of the Distress Thermometer were evaluated against cases identified using the full-scale scores of the HADS as has been done previously. In addition, we used the separate scores on the depression and anxiety scales to {{evaluate the}} utility of the Distress Thermometer in detecting cases of anxiety only, depression only, and depression and anxiety together. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the Distress Thermometer with the HADS full scale were found to be similar to that of previous research. Use of the sub-scale scores of the HADS to detect cases led to some differences in the Distress Thermometer performance. In particular, detection of cases of depression only was quite poor. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the HADS generally and specifically was noted to be problematic. Conclusions: Although we obtained similar results to previous research, our results suggested that caution may need to be exercised when using the Distress <b>Thermometer</b> as a <b>screening</b> instrument. It may not be as effective a screen for depression symptoms and has a high rate of false positives. No Full Tex...|$|R
