5|$|Although Fox {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} CinemaScope for a time, some actors disliked the system. For Fox's 1965 production Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar lenses be used. Such pressures led Fox <b>to</b> <b>completely</b> abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars that year; Von Ryan's Express was the studio's first picture with Panavision lenses. To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection lenses, Gottschalk had Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses retrofitted into Panavision housings {{with a new}} astigmatic attachment, improving them greatly. This was revealed many years after Gottschalk's death; a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had {{been involved with the}} original CinemaScope project, came to work as a designer for Panavision and—after opening some of the older lenses—figured out the secret.|$|E

5|$|At about 7:30 PM Khartoum time (17:30 GMT), two American {{warships}} in the Red Sea fired thirteen {{missiles at}} Sudan's Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons. The entire factory was destroyed {{except for the}} administration, water-cooling, and plant laboratory sections, which were severely damaged. One night watchman was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for hazardous chemical leakages, analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of collateral damage. Regardless, planners added more cruise missiles to the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming <b>to</b> <b>completely</b> destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.|$|E

The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery, which was liberally employed {{in the early stages of}} the operation. Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour, the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced, ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed; thousands more died from disease, malnutrition, exhaustion and suicide. The Allies failed to seize the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>completely</b> destroy the Japanese forces.|$|E

5|$|Barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould {{species of}} the order Echinosteliales, and the only {{species of the}} genus Barbeyella. First {{described}} in 1914 from the Jura mountains, its habitat is restricted to montane spruce and spruce-fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere, {{where it has been}} recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America. It typically colonises slimy, algae-covered logs that have lost their bark and have been partially <b>to</b> <b>completely</b> covered by liverworts. The sporangia are roughly spherical, up to 0.2mm in diameter, and supported by a thin stalk up to 0.7mm tall. After the spores have developed, the walls of the sporangia split open into lobes. The species is one of the smallest members of the Myxogastria and is considered rare.|$|E
5|$|Because it cannot {{compete with}} {{established}} plants, great mullein {{is no longer}} considered a serious agricultural weed and is easily crowded out in cultivation, except in areas where vegetation is sparse to begin with, such as Californian semi-desertic areas of the eastern Sierra Nevada. In such ecological contexts, it crowds out native herbs and grasses; its tendency to appear after forest fires also disturbs the normal ecological succession. Although not an agricultural threat, its presence can be very difficult <b>to</b> <b>completely</b> eradicate, and is especially problematic in overgrazed pastures. The species is legally listed as a noxious weed in the American state of Colorado (Class C) and Hawaii, and the Australian state of Victoria (regionally prohibited in the West Gippsland region, and regionally controlled in several others).|$|E
