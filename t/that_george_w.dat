Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush was unfit to be president.|$|E

25|$|Some of Horowitz's {{accounts}} of U.S. {{colleges and universities}} as bastions of liberal indoctrination have been disputed.

Lott's argument {{is used in the}} influential social science methodology textbook Rethinking Social Inquiry (edited by Henry Brady and David Collier) as an example of poor methodology, and showed how the number of lost Bush votes ranged from 28 to 56.|$|E

500|$|The Spiegel article accuses von Bülow of {{accepting}} without due scrutiny any fragment or urban legend that fits his suspicions of foul play, and describes {{him as a}} [...] "dreamer". However, {{in his analysis of}} von Bülow's book and the response to it in Germany, Stefan Theil has contended that Der Spiegel is, itself, not unknown to publish speculative or conspiratorial theories, and suggests that the surprisingly strenuous article had deeper motivations than high feelings over journalistic quality. He speculates that the fact that Germans who claimed to believe <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush masterminded 9/11 were not actually demonstrating in the streets was a sign that they simply regarded the conspiracy theorist literature as [...] "political entertainment". With American difficulties in Iraq intensifying, and the possibility of Europe becoming dragged in, politicians and journalists alike were being forced to turn away from the escapism the plots offered.|$|E
