5|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, but {{the extent of}} <b>their</b> <b>intelligence</b> and {{learning}} capability are not well defined. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory.

Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.|$|E

5|$|Strongly built, {{and compact}} yet elegant, Andalusians have long, thick manes and tails. Their most common coat color is gray, {{although}} {{they can be}} found in many other colors. They are known for <b>their</b> <b>intelligence,</b> sensitivity and docility. A sub-strain within the breed known as the Carthusian, is considered by breeders to be the purest strain of Andalusian, though there is no genetic evidence for this claim. The strain is still considered separate from the main breed however, and is preferred by breeders because buyers pay more for horses of Carthusian bloodlines. There are several competing registries keeping records of horses designated as Andalusian or PRE, but they differ on their definition of the Andalusian and PRE, the purity of various strains of the breed, and the legalities of stud book ownership. At least one lawsuit is in progress , to determine the ownership of the Spanish PRE stud book.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Soc. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2005. This study {{investigated}} Black and Indian South African's estimates of <b>their</b> own <b>intelligence</b> {{and that of}} their first two children. Parents gave estimates for seven types of intelligence (Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences) and overall intelligence. The {{purpose of this study}} was to establish if gender and/or cultural differences existed in the estimates of intelligence. The participants were asked to complete a brief one-page questionnaire, the 'estimates of intelligence' questionnaire, which has been used in previous studies in this field (Furnham et al, 2004; Furnham et al, 2002 a; Furnham & Mkhize, 2002; Furnham, 2000; Furnham et al, 1999; Furnham & Baguma, 1999, Furnham & Gasson, 1998). The results indicated that Indian South Africans gave higher estimates of intelligence than Black South Africans for <b>their</b> own <b>intelligence</b> and that of their children (first and secondborn children). In addition, mothers were found to give higher self-estimates for musical <b>intelligence</b> than <b>their</b> male counterparts. No gender differences were found for parents' estimates of their first and second-born children. In comparing parents' estimates of <b>their</b> own <b>intelligence</b> as compared to their children, parents gave higher estimates of <b>their</b> own <b>intelligence.</b> The predictors of overall intelligence were also explored. Parents were also asked to answer six close-ended questions, which investigated <b>their</b> views of <b>intelligence</b> and intelligence tests...|$|R

5|$|The Percheron is a {{breed of}} draft horse that {{originated}} in the Huisne river valley in western France, part of the former Perche province from which the breed takes its name. Usually gray or black in color, Percherons are well muscled, and known for <b>their</b> <b>intelligence</b> and willingness to work. Although their exact origins are unknown, the ancestors of the breed {{were present in the}} valley by the 17th century. They were originally bred for use as war horses. Over time, they began to be used for pulling stagecoaches and later for agriculture and hauling heavy goods. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Arabian blood was added to the breed. Exports of Percherons from France to the United States and other countries rose exponentially in the late 19th century, and the first purely Percheron stud book was created in France in 1883.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet leadership, through <b>their</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{agencies}} and foreign sources, {{learned about the}} German intentions, and therefore the multiple delays by the German high command, OKW, allowed them {{a great deal of}} time to prepare their defences. Employing defence in depth, they constructed a series of defensive lines to wear down the attacking panzer formations. Three belts made up of extensive minefields, anti-tank ditches, and anti-tank gun emplacements were created; behind those were an additional three belts, which were mostly unoccupied and less fortified. The Voronezh Front, commanded by General Nikolai Vatutin, defended the southern face of the salient. The Steppe Front, commanded by Colonel General Ivan Konev, formed the strategic reserve. It was to be held back east of the salient until the time was right for the Soviet counteroffensive. This formation included Lieutenant General Alexei Zhadov's 5th Guards Army and Lieutenant General Pavel Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{was involved in}} establishing {{the ability of the}} Abwehr (German military intelligence). A German-published order of battle of the British army based within the United Kingdom, dated 10 April 1942, was captured. This document included the division and had a near perfect listing of its subordinate units, with one exception. Rather than including the 1st Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment, the Germans believed the 18th Battalion, Welch Regiment had already replaced it. This and similar errors led the British to understand the capability of the Germans to intercept wireless communications in the United Kingdom. In 1943, this, in part, led to the Operation Fortitude a plan to exploit the German ability and deceive <b>their</b> <b>intelligence</b> community about future Allied operations like Operation Overlord.|$|E

5|$|Wade also {{discusses}} {{the origin of}} Jews; they descend from the Middle East through their Y chromosomes, but their mitochondrial DNA resembles that of their host countries. Citing Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, Wade argues that Ashkenazi Jews were historically forced into intellectually demanding occupations by their European hosts, and these selective pressures favoured genes that raised <b>their</b> <b>intelligence.</b> The consequence of this, however, {{was an increase in}} sphingolipid diseases. The final chapter, Evolution, gives a summary of human evolution from its origins to the present, and declares that it is unlikely that it will ever cease. Wade speculates where evolution will lead humans in the future, suggesting further skeletal gracilisation, increases in intelligence, adaptations to the changing climate, and even the possibility of speciation.|$|E
5|$|James H. Doolittle {{commanding}} Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF) {{was ordered}} to formulate an air interdiction campaign. He named it Operation Flax. Operation Flax called for Allied fighters to intercept the aerial convoys over the Sicily-Tunisia strait. Allied units were also briefed to carry out major offensive operations against Axis airfields in Tunisia and the overcrowded staging fields in Sicily. They were also ordered to carry out anti—shipping sweeps. Flax was an operation which was unlikely to work {{more than a few}} times, as shown by the relative impunity with which the surviving Axis air transports operated at night after the operation had begun. The flight time across the Strait of Sicily was so short that aerial interception could be made only with precise intelligence. The Germans understood this but did not know that their communications had been compromised and were being read by Allied intelligence. Ignorant of <b>their</b> <b>intelligence</b> leaks, they operated by day. Since their enemy had the option of flying by night, and the weather conditions were not ideal for interception operations, the Allies delayed the implementation of Operation Flax until the most German transport aircraft were in operation so that the blow would be as decisive as possible. Allied intelligence listened in to the Y-stations until they were sure they could strike.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, 1973, an air battle {{took place}} between Syrian and Israeli fighters. It was an {{alarming}} skirmish in which twelve Syrian aircraft were shot down while the Israelis lost only one fighter. Tension ran high between both countries. The Egyptians in particular were very concerned; on April 7, 1967, an air battle between Syria and Israel had escalated the military situation {{and was one of}} the causes of the Six Day War. Aware that war was to be launched only days later, the Syrians chose not to retaliate. The air battle aided the Syrians in concentrating their forces for the war, as the Israelis interpreted it to be a defensive reaction on the part of the Syrians.
