50|$|CDAD {{recurrence}} {{in patients}} reaching clinical success was reduced significantly by <b>tolevamer</b> (6% recurrence rate), vancomycin (18%) and metronidazole (19%). However, the good result of <b>tolevamer</b> is {{partly due to}} the high drop-out rate in this group.|$|E

50|$|In early 2008, a noninferiority study versus {{vancomycin}} or metronidazole for Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) {{found that}} about half of the patients in the <b>tolevamer</b> group did not complete the treatment, versus 25% in the vancomycin and 29% in the metronidazole groups.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolevamer</b> was {{designed}} to bind the enterotoxins rather than attack Clostridium difficile directly. Since it has no antibiotic properties, it does not harm the gut flora. Early studies used the sodium salt, but it was soon replaced with the potassium sodium salt to prevent hypokalaemia, which {{is often associated with}} diarrhea.|$|E
50|$|Genzyme {{focuses on}} six areas of {{medicine}} relating to lysosomal storage diseases, renal disease, orthopedics, transplant and immune diseases, oncology, genetics and diagnostics. The first orphan-drug for Genzyme that FDA approved was Ceredase, a drug for treating Gaucher disease. Ceredase was eventually replaced by Cerezyme, which, {{at a cost}} of $200,000 per patient annually for life, currently accounts for approximately 30% of Genzyme's revenue. Other important drugs made by Genzyme are Renagel, used in treatment of dialysis patients, and Fabrazyme, used to treat patients with Fabry's disease. Other products in development are <b>Tolevamer</b> for Clostridium difficile colitis and Campath for Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tolevamer,</b> (GT 160 - 246), is a {{sodium salt}} of styrene {{sulfonate}} polymer that is under development {{for the treatment of}} diarrhea caused by infection with Clostridium difficile. Pulsed ultrafiltration binding experiments in phosphate buffer containing 0. 15 M Na+ provide per polymer chain dissociation constants of 133 nM and 8. 7 μM for the binding of <b>tolevamer</b> to C. difficile toxins A and B, respectively. At 0. 05 M Na+, the binding of toxin A to <b>tolevamer</b> is irreversible, whereas the dissociation constant to toxin B under these conditions is 120 nM. Binding constants obtained from fluorescence polarization data for toxin A binding to <b>tolevamer</b> at 0. 15 M Na+ agree substantially with those obtained by pulsed ultrafiltration. The binding activity of <b>tolevamer</b> reported here correlates well with previously reported results for the inhibition of the biological activity of C. difficile toxins A and B.

40|$|Clostridium difficile-associated {{diarrhea}} (CDAD) {{is caused}} by the toxins the organism produces when it overgrows in the colon as a consequence of antibiotic depletion of normal flora. Conventional antibiotic treatment of CDAD increases the likelihood of recurrent disease by again suppressing normal bacterial flora. <b>Tolevamer,</b> a novel toxin-binding polymer, was developed to ameliorate the disease without adversely affecting normal flora. In the current study, <b>tolevamer</b> was tested for its ability to neutralize clostridial toxins produced by the epidemic BI/ 027 strains, thereby preventing toxin-mediated tissue culture cell rounding. The titers of toxin-containing C. difficile culture supernatants were determined using confluent cell monolayers, and then the supernatants were used in assays containing dilutions of <b>tolevamer</b> to determine the lowest concentration of <b>tolevamer</b> that prevented ≥ 90 % cytotoxicity. <b>Tolevamer</b> neutralized toxins in the supernatants of all C. difficile strains tested. Specific antibodies against the large clostridial toxins TcdA and TcdB also neutralized the cytopathic effect, suggesting that <b>tolevamer</b> is specifically neutralizing these toxins and that the binary toxin (whose genes are carried by the BI/ 027 strains) is not a significant source of cytopathology against tissue culture cells in vitro...|$|E

40|$|See the IDSA lecture by Bartlett {{on pages}} 1489 – 92) The epidemiology, {{clinical}} severity, and case-fatality ratio of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) changed dramatically {{with the emergence}} of a toxin hyperproducing strain (BI/NAP 1 / 027) in North America and Europe in 2000. For the treatment of CDI, metronidazole and vancomycin remain the 2 most commonly used drugs. The 3 randomized controlled trials published thus far, as well as the upcoming <b>tolevamer</b> trial, use intermediate outcomes, rather than the outcomes that now preoccupy clinicians: the frequency of complications or recur-rence. The major advantage of metronidazole is its low price. The major advantage of orally administered vancomycin is its more favorable pharmacokinetics. Facilitating vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonization and/or infection is a potential drawback of both drugs. Pending the development of a prospectively validated scoring system, members of the Infectious Diseases Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America expert committee will define severe CDI as present in any patient with a leukocyte count 15, 000 cells/mm 3 or a creatinine level increased by 50 % from baseline. For patients with mild-to-moderate CDI (defined by a leukocyte count! 15000 cells/mm 3 and a creatinine level! 1. 5 times the baseline value), {{there is no evidence that}} treatment with vancomycin is superior to treatment with metronidazole (even for intermediate outcomes), and metronidazole therapy should be preferred. For patients with severe CDI who are not infecte...|$|E
