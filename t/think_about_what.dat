5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they're doing or why, {{and the story of}} Malik is content to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E
5|$|Schuyler and {{original}} Degrassi series head writer Yan Moore began {{developing a new}} television drama in 1999. As the months progressed, they began to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{had happened to the}} characters of Degrassi High to develop a school-reunion theme. However, they decided that a series would not work effectively if based around adults instead of children. Moore realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school, and development for the series took a new direction by focusing on Emma and her school experiences.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} the plot, the {{producers}} wanted to repeat the same style as the previous sixth series and include another story-arc in the seventh. The writers and producers got together to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{is to become a}} big political story that will affect the United Kingdom in twelve to eighteen months time. They decided on using the resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways, is threatening the security of the West. The new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the character should trust. The episode was written by Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards.|$|E
5000|$|... "Don't Think I Don't <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> It" [...] is a mid-tempo, backed {{mainly by}} guitars. Its narrator {{describes}} {{a man who}} has left his former lover. He tells her that he <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they could have been.|$|R

Later, Barney tells Robin {{that he is}} done with {{pursuing}} her and will concentrate instead on more women. As Barney leaves to pick up another woman, Robin <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he said and suddenly says, [...] "Huh." ...|$|R
5|$|Rhys treats Susan {{when she}} has an MS relapse and he tries {{to make sure she}} is {{prepared}} in case her condition becomes worse. He later looks after Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) when she is brought in with severe morning sickness. Vanessa learns Rhys has been talking about her with his friends and she tells him to stay out of her business. Rhys later helps Vanessa carry some boxes and he spends the day baking a cake with her. He buys her a new mixer and Vanessa invites him to dinner. Rhys gives the cake to Elaine and when he tells her about Vanessa, she warns him to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he is doing before letting it go any further. Rhys thinks about cancelling on Vanessa, but he later arrives with dessert. Rhys asks Vanessa to bid on him at a charity bachelor auction, so he can raise more money than Karl. Vanessa wins and she chooses a couples massage for them to enjoy together. Rhys learns Susan has befriended Elaine and he angrily tells her to stay away from his mother. Vanessa witnesses the scene and becomes cold towards him. Rhys apologises to Susan and opens up to Vanessa about why he did it.|$|E
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E

5000|$|Hammer's Torah {{scholarship}} is diametrically {{opposed to that}} of Haredi Judaism, which bases its understanding on classic Midrashim and Torah commentators. Unlike Maimonides, who stressed knowledge over faith, Hammer stresses faith over knowledge, stating, [...] "It is belief and not reason that will determine <b>what</b> one <b>thinks</b> (<b>about</b> <b>what</b> the Bible says and how to behave)".|$|R

They both admit that they cannot remember. Cha Seung-jo <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happens between him and Han Se-kyung, and he is very nervous about it. He decides he is going to ask Han Se-kyung out the {{following}} day.|$|R
500|$|Despite the album's {{critical}} and commercial success, lead singer Chris Martin said that Coldplay didn't like the album. He also commented {{that they look}} beyond Parachutes: [...] "We know that's terrible music and we always try to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we can do next." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Morrison told Ritchie Yorke, {{one of his}} biographers, {{he wrote}} both of the songs [...] "Madame George" [...] and [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] in stream of {{consciousness}}: [...] " [...] just came right out...The song is just a stream of consciousness thing, as is 'Cyprus Avenue'...I didn't even <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I was writing." ...|$|E

Therefore, {{people who do not}} stop to look at the poem itself or to study the images in the poem and <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the poem really says, are inclined to accept the poem because of the pious sentiment, the prettified little pictures (which in themselves appeal to stock responses), and the mechanical rhythm." ...|$|E

At first, {{she seemed to be}} a selfish Akikan who did not care for her owner but later it was discovered that she was a caring Akikan who always <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is best for her owner. She talks tomboyishly. Her cool drink spells are the vegetable-summoning [...] "Gevetarians" [...] and the knuckle bombing [...] "Mixed Vegetable".|$|R
5000|$|NEOS “is {{considered}} so matter-of-fact that no {{one really}} <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it is or where it came from. Even now people in the government are often genuinely surprised when they find that their entire government library services are being underpinned by the University of Alberta Library because all of those libraries are part of NEOS, and {{that most of the}} colleges north of Olds Alberta are also part of NEOS.” ...|$|R

500|$|... was a Japanese architect, and {{winner of}} the 1987 Pritzker Prize for architecture. He {{was one of the}} most {{significant}} architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designed major buildings on five continents. Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement. He said: [...] "It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I was later to call structuralism", (cited in Plan 2/1982, Amsterdam), a reference to the architectural movement known as Dutch Structuralism.|$|E
500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if {{the words came out}} like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E
500|$|Charlie's {{understanding}} of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about [...] "the two lovebirds next door", {{despite the fact that they}} are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: [...] "Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'." [...] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: [...] "Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try to help them out." ...|$|E
50|$|One day at work, Markus, a {{subordinate}} on her work-team (unseen until now) enters her office {{to discuss a}} case, and she, in a trance-like state, just walks {{up to him and}} passionately kisses him. He is pleasantly stunned, and later leaves work confident and happy, passing several beautiful women in the street as they (in his mind) ‘ogle’ him. That night, he <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happened and tries to imagine what Nathalie is doing.|$|R

And I want people in {{the audience to}} go to other shows and <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> really gone into making that chorus [...] [...] [...] It fades with them kicking. That's it. That's the end of the show. There are no bows. I don't believe in bows, just the fade out. That's what a dancer's life is.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title of}} the album, No Sound Without Silence, is both a {{shortening}} of philosophical idea put forward by the band and a critical comment on the music industry. No Sound Without Silence is a phrase derived from an idea put forward by the band, where meaningful statements cannot be made without thinking <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{you want to say}} first; the [...] "silence" [...] referring to the silence that persists while a person <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they want to say, and the [...] "sound" [...] referring to the sounds made by people when they speak. The phrase is also a comment {{on the state of the}} music industry, where, according to the band, most artists and labels do not <b>think</b> critically <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they want to say, therefore, do not say meaningful things. The Script lead vocalist Danny O'Donoghue commented on the album's title, stating [...] "The time we've been away, we've had time to contemplate <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we want to say to the industry. There is no sound without silence. You can't have anything good to say if you don't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it first".|$|R
500|$|In {{order to}} map a body's {{gravitational}} influence, {{it is useful}} to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> physicists call probe or test particles: particles that are influenced by gravity, but are so small and light that we can neglect their own gravitational effect. In the absence of gravity and other external forces, a test particle moves along a straight line at a constant speed. In the language of spacetime, this is equivalent to saying that such test particles move along straight world lines in spacetime. In the presence of gravity, spacetime is non-Euclidean, or curved, and in curved spacetime straight world lines may not exist. Instead, test particles move along lines called geodesics, which are [...] "as straight as possible", that is, they follow the shortest path between starting and ending points, taking the curvature into consideration.|$|E
500|$|New York Times {{reviewer}} George Stade {{said that}} Shikasta [...] "forces us to <b>think</b> <b>about...</b> <b>what</b> we are, {{how we got}} that way and where we are going", but complained that the book is filled with [...] "false hopes", and that the fate of humankind relies on [...] "theosophical emanations, cosmic influences, occult powers, spiritual visitations and stellar vibrations". When the SOWF is cut off and the Shikastans degenerate, Lessing [...] "both indicts and exculpates" [...] them, implying that humanity is bad, {{but it is not}} their fault. While Stade complemented Lessing on the book's satire, and her depictions of Zone 6, which he said [...] "have the eerie beauty of ancient Gnostic texts", he [...] "disapprove" [...] of the novel as a whole, but added, [...] "that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy reading it".|$|E
500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we want to do and write the best record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl {{evolves into}} a {{desensitized}} character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté {{to the world}} around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{it would be like to}} grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E
500|$|John [...] "DJ" [...] Desjardin {{served as}} the visual {{supervisor}} for Man of Steel, with Weta Digital, MPC, and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film. Zack Snyder wanted the film to [...] "appear very natural because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team {{had to make it}} as easy as possible for them to do so." [...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So {{for a lot of the}} previs we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel [...] developed for that miniseries, where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense. Unless the action is so over the top, like in the end where Superman is beating up Zod—we had to break it a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{year after}} the all-star {{recording}} of [...] "What More Can I Give", it was played {{for the first time}} on radio. WKTU-FM, a radio station based in New York, debuted the song without permission and played it in heavy rotation. WKTU-FM's Program Director Frankie Blue stated at the time, [...] "This song is a gift to the world. Michael and everyone donated their time for it, and it deserves to be heard. The song is called [...] "What More Can I Give", and I can give the world a song they can cling onto and hopefully make them <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they can give." [...] It is unknown how the station acquired a copy of the song; both Jackson and Schaffel were uninvolved with it. Prior to the airing, at least 200 promo copies of the song were sent to the musicians who participated in the recording process, as well as to their representatives. Schaffel stated that he would hate to see the song not being used to raise money for charity, the intended purpose. WKTU-FM received numerous telephone calls and emails from listeners following their unauthorized playing of the song, thanking the station and asking where they could buy a copy of [...] "What More Can I Give".|$|E

Chencho gets into an elevator, the woman stops it from closing and then hugs Chencho and the video ends with [...] "Fin".|$|R
