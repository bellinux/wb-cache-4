5|$|Before {{the series}} had premiered, some media critics {{stated that the}} series had {{potential}} to become a ratings hit and possibly raise NBC from being the fourth highest-rated network out of five. Greenblatt has also stated that he has high hopes for the series. In {{order to make it}} more likely the series will be a success, NBC picked the series up for 15 episodes and opted to hold the show for mid-season in order to pair it up with the hit reality show The Voice on Monday nights. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>other</b> media critics have said unless the series receives a rating above a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, it will be considered a failure, and only two other NBC series ranked above a 3.0 rating at the time; Fear Factor and The Office. The series has also been put on Monday nights against CBS, with Monday featuring Two and a Half Men, one of the highest-rated shows of the season. Also, musical shows have a known record for failures, like Cop Rock.|$|E
5|$|In 1297, Joan {{secretly}} married Ralph de Monthermer, {{a knight}} {{in the late}} earl's household. This enraged EdwardI, who had other marriage plans for Joan. The king imprisoned Monthermer, but later relented, and sanctioned the marriage. Because of the previous settlement, Joan was still titled countess, and her new husband became Earl of Gloucester and Hertford. This, however, only lasted {{for the life of}} Joan, who died in 1307. Only a few months later, Gilbert was granted his inheritance, and by March 1308 made Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, at the young age of sixteen. This grant was made by EdwardII, who succeeded his father EdwardI in July 1307. It was previously believed that EdwardII and Gilbert were brought up together, but this is based on a confusion with another person of the same name. <b>This</b> <b>other</b> Gilbert de Clare, who was closer to the king in age, was in fact the earl's cousin, the son of Thomas de Clare, Lord of Thomond.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hood ordered Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee's corps on a march {{around the}} Union left flank, had Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry march near Sherman's supply line, and had Maj. Gen. Benjamin Cheatham's corps attack the Union front. However, it took longer than {{expected}} for Hardee {{to get his}} men into position, and, during that time, McPherson had correctly deduced a possible threat to his left flank, and sent XVI Corps, his reserve, to help strengthen it. Hardee's men met <b>this</b> <b>other</b> force, and the battle began. Although the initial Confederate attack was repulsed, the Union left flank began to retreat. About this time, McPherson, who had ridden to the front to observe the battle, {{was shot and killed}} by Confederate infantry.|$|E

5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber snail is {{endemic to}} the Chittenango area of Madison County, New York, United States. There {{is only one}} {{population}} of this species at Chittenango Falls State Park in central New York, {{even though it was}} believed to have a broader range previously; based on fossil records, some authors argue that the distribution of this species may have been much wider in the past. In opposition to <b>this,</b> <b>other</b> authors argue {{that it is impossible to}} identify this species based on fossil records, because they only allow for examination of shell features. Shell features of species in this particular family of snails are usually not very distinctive.|$|E
5|$|Understanding the Massey Lectures {{were part}} of the Canadian culture, Gopnik, who was born in Philadelphia but lived in Montreal between the ages of 10 to 25, wanted a topic that would be {{relevant}} to Canadians but also have universal appeal: winter. Winter had appeared as a theme or setting in many of his previous writings, and he especially looked forward to talking about ice hockey. Gopnik spent the next year researching and writing the book, alongside another non-fiction book he was working on at the time: The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food. <b>This</b> <b>other</b> book was released shortly after Winter, and purposefully contained one identical sentence.|$|E
5|$|When the US Highway System {{was formed}} on November 11, 1926, US141 ran from Milwaukee to Green Bay, and one {{segment of the}} modern highway in Michigan was {{originally}} designated US102. <b>This</b> <b>other</b> designation was decommissioned in 1928 when US141 was extended north from Green Bay into Michigan. Michigan has rebuilt the highway in stages {{over the years to}} smooth out sharp curves in the routing. Since the 1960s, the section south of Green Bay has been converted into a freeway in segments. US141 has ended southeast of Green Bay in Bellevue since the 1980s—the southern freeway segment was redesignated as I-43. The section north of Abrams, Wisconsin, was converted to a freeway in the opening years of the 21st century, with an additional divided-highway section opening a few years later.|$|E
