5|$|On 30 June, {{government}} forces attempted <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air base and {{link up with}} troops at the university but failed after encountering heavy insurgent resistance in the al-Deum area. A military spokesman said that {{government forces}} were massing in Samarra and would soon make another push to capture Tikrit. Meanwhile, south of Tikrit, the army managed to recapture the town of Mukayshifah in fighting that an army spokesman claimed killed 40 ISIS fighters.|$|E
5|$|Residents began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centre {{into the}} {{suburban}} areas which {{were included in}} Odense Municipality after boundaries were redefined in 1970. As a result, the population declined slightly in the 1970s and 1980s, falling to 136,646 in 1981. It began climbing again in the late 1980s, and steadily grew to 144,518 in 1996 and 145,554 in 2004. In 2010 Odense had a population of 166,305 people. As of 2017 it had a population of 176,683.|$|E

5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid-18th century {{as part of the}} New Road, a bypass of Central London for coach traffic. It was named Pentonville Road after the new town of Pentonville, that encouraged manufacturing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and into suburbia. Numerous factories and commercial premises became established on the road in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly after the arrival of London railways in the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E
5|$|But by {{the time}} he {{captured}} the position, the rest of his company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the trench and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trench, he was hit by a bullet in his head. As he succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E

5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{possibility}} of aftershocks, police evacuated shopping malls and office buildings around the city. Essential organisations in the area were evacuated as a safety precaution, including the police headquarters and offices of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. At Christchurch International Airport, officials halted operations after the earthquake, but all flights resumed later that day. Months before the event, a severe magnitude 6.3 earthquake occurred in a similar area adjacent to Christchurch, causing widespread destruction and fatalities in the city. Concerns arose about the condition of previously damaged structures, and the 13 June earthquakes caused further distress among many victims. Dozens of dissatisfied residents were expected <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, and many others sought professional help for anxiety and depression-related issues.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} in London that Whistler met Joanna Heffernan, the model who would become his lover. By 1865, Whistler had already used her {{as a model for}} other paintings, among these Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2. Heffernan {{supposedly}} had a strong influence over Whistler; his brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden refused a dinner invitation in the winter of 186364 due to her dominant presence in the household. In January 1864, Whistler's mother Annalater depicted in the painting Arrangement in Grey and Blackarrived to stay with her son in London. As a result, Heffernan had <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apartment, and only visited as a model. Still, Heffernan's presence displeased Whistler's mother, and his relationship with both women became strained.|$|E

Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) offer him a spare room in their house, since their previous roommate moved out and left the house to them. Although the two have been living by themselves for only a week, the house is a complete mess with no everyday items like plates or utensils available. Ben decides to teach a reluctant Andy and April how to properly live like adults.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
5|$|When {{the third}} statehouse was {{condemned}} in 1876 the government abandoned the building. The General Assembly relocated {{to a large}} office building that had been built in 1865 and was already housing the Supreme Court. The Governor and the executive staff relocated to another office building. The office building {{was used as the}} statehouse during the interim period that the new statehouse was being built. In 1887, before the new statehouse had been completed, enough of the lower floors were usable for the government <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cramped office space and begin holding sessions in the new structure.|$|E

5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered {{from the fact that the}} harbour was too small and Roskilde Fjord too shallow for navigation. Industries began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbour area but were still the largest source of employment, thanks in part to the spirits factory (De Danske Spritfabrikker) and the slaughterhouse (Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri).|$|E
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold {{on the underside of the}} weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family home. He {{was concerned that}} Green, {{who had never been}} a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E

5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way. The crew is cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the last series, Rachel returns from London and tells Adam that she aborted the baby, and their {{relationship}} seems over for good. They both start seeing other people—he one of Pete's colleagues (Rosie Cavaliero) and she a man much younger than her (Hugh Dancy)—but reconcile after Adam is diagnosed and treated for testicular cancer in Episode 5. David is made redundant at work and decides to be a stay-at-home dad for Josh. After some interference from Karen, he takes a new job. Their relationship improves from the first series; they spend their wedding anniversary in Paris and Karen announces in Episode 6 that she is pregnant. Pete and Jenny's marriage deteriorates when she reveals she {{had a crush on}} Adam. Pete later sleeps with a co-worker— with whom Adam was also briefly involved—and Jenny tells him <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. They decide to give their marriage another chance when Adam's cancer puts things into perspective. In Episode 6, all three couples see in the new millennium on a trip to Lindisfarne, where Pete and Jenny's relationship worsens again as the others' improve.|$|E
5|$|The pair's {{pumpkins}} {{growth is}} slow, and Seth and Emma often clash during their collaboration. They grow closer while watching old films together and discussing their pasts. Seth {{talks about his}} degree in engineering from Stanford University and his decision <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city {{in favor of the}} country, and Emma reveals her childhood dream of hosting her own talk show. When they are interviewed by Emma as part of her show, the Pumpkin Widows share stories of their husbands' obsessions with growing pumpkins. Emma and Seth sneak onto the mayor's farm to find out his pumpkin growing secrets. Emma asks Seth on a date while they appear at a promotional photo shoot in Seattle. Their date is interrupted by Emma accepting an offer from a television executive to be an anchor on a New York City morning news program. The pair's pumpkin starts growing larger; Emma finds the real pumpkin growing journal and learns that the other book was actually Walt's poems to his wife. Emma and Seth win the contest, and beat the record. Rejecting the New York job offer, Emma starts her own talk show in Valleyville along with Seth. Emma pays off Walt's debt with the prize money, and Seth opens his own car repair shop. The film ends with the couple becoming engaged.|$|E
