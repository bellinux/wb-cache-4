Emigration was illegal and population was seen as <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>nations.</b> However, the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850, and as population growth outstripped economic development, it gave rise to fears of overpopulation based on the influential population theory of Thomas Malthus. In the 1830s, the laws against emigration were repealed.|$|E

5|$|Hume {{became a}} major figure in the sceptical {{philosophical}} and empiricist traditions of philosophy. He and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed {{what he called a}} 'science of man', which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar and William Robertson, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behave in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity. Indeed, modern sociology largely originated from this movement. Adam Smith developed and published <b>The</b> <b>Wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations,</b> the first work on modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British economic policy and still frames 21st century discussions on globalisation and tariffs. The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of William Cullen, physician and chemist, James Anderson, an agronomist, Joseph Black, physicist and chemist, and James Hutton, the first modern geologist. While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded {{toward the end of the}} 18th century, disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as James Hutton, James Watt, William Murdoch, James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and Sir Walter Scott.|$|E

5|$|Returning to education, Mao {{enrolled}} {{and dropped}} out of a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school and an economics school. His father only approved of the latter, but the lectures were in English, which Mao didn't understand, and so Mao abandoned it for the government-run Changsha Middle School; he soon {{dropped out of}} this too, finding it rooted in Confucianism. Undertaking his studies independently, he spent {{much time in the}} Changsha public library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith's <b>The</b> <b>Wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations</b> and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws, as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as Charles Darwin, J.S. Mill, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Herbert Spencer. Viewing himself as an intellectual, years later he admitted that at this time he thought himself better than working people. Inspired by the work of Friedrich Paulsen, the liberal emphasis on individualism led Mao to believe that strong individuals were not bound by moral codes but should strive for the greater good; that the end justifies the means. Seeing no use in his son's intellectual pursuits, Mao's father cut off his allowance, forcing Mao to move into a hostel for the destitute.|$|E

25|$|In IQ and Global Inequality Lynn and Vanhanen {{argue that}} intelligence, as {{measured}} by IQ tests, is {{a major contributor to}} national wealth as well as to various measures of social well-being. They base this argument on the finding that nations' average IQs have a strong correlation with several such factors, among them adult literacy (0.64), tertiary education (0.75), life expectancy (0.77), and democratization (0.57). The book is a follow-up to Lynn and Vanhanen's 2002 book IQ and <b>the</b> <b>Wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations,</b> and expands on many of the ideas presented in their earlier book.|$|E

But, even then, Eastern Europe was much poorer than Western Europe. The slavery of North Africa and the Middle East, over the centuries, took more slaves from sub-Saharan Africa than the Western Hemisphere did… But these remained largely poor countries until the discovery and extraction of their vast oil deposits.|$|E

Discussing both books, Earl Hunt writes that although Lynn and Vanhanen's methodology and conclusions are questionable, they deserve credit for raising important questions about international IQ comparisons. Hunt writes that Lynn and Vanhanen are correct that national IQs correlate strongly with measures of social well-being, but they are unjustified in their rejection {{of the idea that}} national IQs could change as a result of improved education.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} that the two anthropological forces of accumulation brought to the fore by Adam Smith in <b>the</b> <b>Wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nation</b> (<b>the</b> "desire <b>of</b> bettering our condition" and the "propensity to barter, truck and exchange") should not be considered as innate propensities of human nature but, on the contrary, as products of social interaction, more precisely of the action of sympathy.

The Dissolution of the Monasteries led to the transfer of many rights to tithe to secular landowners and the Crown – and tithes could be extinguished until 1577 under an Act of the 37th year of Henry VIII's reign.

25|$|An {{important}} econometric work, Measuring <b>the</b> <b>Wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations,</b> {{was published}} by Anwar Shaikh and Ertuğrul Ahmet Tonak in 1994. This work sought to reaggregate the components of official gross output measures rigorously, to approximate Marxian categories, using some new techniques, including input-output measures of direct and indirect labor, and capacity utilization adjustments. Shaikh and Tonak argued that the falling rate of profit is not a short-term trend of the business cycle, but a long-term historical trend. According to their calculations, the Marxian rate of profit on production capital fell {{throughout most of the}} long boom of 1947–1973, despite an enormous expansion of the volume (mass) of profit.|$|E
