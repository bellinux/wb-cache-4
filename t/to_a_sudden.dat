5|$|A further, albeit rare, {{complication}} of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression {{of the upper}} cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine. An extremely rare {{complication of}} SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where {{the ability to move}} one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve.|$|E
5|$|Horatio William Bottomley (23 March 1860– 26 May 1933) was an English financier, journalist, editor, {{newspaper}} proprietor, swindler, and Member of Parliament. He is {{best known}} for his editorship of the popular magazine John Bull, and for his patriotic oratory during the First World War. His career came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> end when, in 1922, he was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{heir to the}} thrones of Austria-Hungary, {{was assassinated}} by pan-Slavic nationalists, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> {{deterioration}} in relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. Austria-Hungary {{was supported by the}} German Empire, whilst Serbia had the backing of the Russian Empire. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, which, in turn, required the mobilisation of Russia, hence of Germany, thanks to its responsibilities under the Dual Alliance.|$|E

5|$|Damage in {{the state}} totaled to over $13billion (2004 USD). Charley {{initially}} was expected to hit further north in Tampa, and caught many Floridians off-guard due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> change in the storm's track as it approached the state. Throughout the United States, Charley caused 10deaths and $15.4billion in damage to insured residential property, making it the second costliest hurricane in United States history at the time (it has since dropped to ninth). Charley was a compact, fast-moving storm, which limited the scope and severity of the damage.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> sharp feeling. Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve {{within a few weeks}} from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Selangor FA invited Fandi to {{play for}} them against Argentine club Boca Juniors in a {{friendly}} game, in which Fandi scored the only goal for Selangor FA; the score was 2–1. Fandi received offers from several Malaysia Cup teams, Indonesian side Niac Mitra, Swiss club Young Boys and Dutch side Ajax. After a three-week trial, Ajax offered Fandi a three-year contract, but Fandi instead signed a one-year contract with Niac Mitra, where he spent one season, helped them successfully defend their Galatama League title and was the third-highest scorer with 13 goals. In a friendly match between Niac Mitra and Arsenal, Fandi scored a goal in a 2–0 victory; however, he left Niac Mitra due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> Galatama League ban on foreign players.|$|E

5|$|Taken together, {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring, to melt, shock and eject granite from many miles within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would have led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav coup d'état led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> {{change in}} the plan of attack and confronted the Twelfth Army {{with a number of}} {{difficult}} problems. According to the 28 March Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via Niš toward Belgrade. With only nine days left before their final deployment, every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to mobilise. By the evening of 5 April, the forces intended to enter southern Yugoslavia and Greece had been assembled.|$|E
5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching {{the surface of the}} Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of {{perceived}} provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which {{he was supposed to}} fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> end.|$|E
5|$|French {{fire was}} {{taking its toll}} on the British ship, and at 22:20, Amethysts {{mizzenmast}} was shot through and collapsed on the quarterdeck, smashing the wheel and impeding Seymour's command of his ship. Thétis began to pull ahead and Pinsum attempted to rake Amethyst in her disorganised state, turning sharply to starboard but coming <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> halt as her own mizzenmast collapsed. With their ability to manoeuvre severely hindered, Amethyst and Thétis gradually closed on one another, Pinsum ordering the soldiers on his frigate to board the British vessel and capture her, while Seymour prepared for the eventuality by loading his cannon with two roundshot and his carronades with double loads of grapeshot. At 23:00, Pinsum suddenly swung his frigate towards Amethyst, the bows colliding and rebounding and the French stern swinging towards the British. At his signal, the soldiers and sailors crowded onto the deck and railings, ready to leap onto the British ship and engage her crew in hand-to-hand combat. With seconds remaining, Seymour ordered his gunners to fire. The double-shotted broadside, fired at point-blank range, killed or wounded over 100 men, including most of the officers. Only four guns were still serviceable on Thétis, which was set alight in three places due to {{the proximity of the}} British muzzle flashes.|$|E
5|$|Few air units or {{anti-aircraft}} batteries {{were stationed}} in the home islands during {{the early months of}} the Pacific War. The General Defense Command (GDC) had been formed in July 1941 to oversee the defense of the home islands, but all combat units in this area were assigned to the four regional military districts (the Northern, Eastern, Central and Western districts) which reported directly to the Ministry of War. As a result, the GDC's functions were limited to coordinating communications between the Imperial General Headquarters—Japan's highest military decision-making body—and the military districts. In early 1942, forces allocated to the defense of Japan comprised 100 Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) and 200 Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) fighter aircraft, many of which were obsolete, as well as 500 Army-manned and 200 IJN anti-aircraft guns. Most of the IJAAF and IJN formations in the home islands were training units which had only a limited ability to counter Allied attacks. The Army also operated a network of military and civilian observation posts to provide warning of air attack and {{was in the process of}} building radar stations. Command and control of the air defenses was fragmented, and the IJAAF and IJN did not coordinate their activities or communicate with each other. As a result, the forces were unable to react <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> air attack.|$|E

5|$|Prescott {{first became}} {{interested}} in the history of Spain after his friend, the Harvard professor George Ticknor, sent him copies of his lectures on the subject. Prescott's studies initially remained broad, but he started preparing material on Ferdinand and Isabella in January 1826. His acquaintance Pascual de Gayangos y Arce helped him construct a sizable personal library of historical books and manuscripts concerning the subject. Alexander Hill Everett, an American diplomat in Spain, also provided him with material which was unavailable to Prescott in Boston. However, progress was stalled almost immediately, due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> deterioration in Prescott's eyesight. Unable to find a reader fluent in Spanish, Prescott was forced to work through Spanish texts with an assistant who did not understand the language. When Alexander Everett heard of this situation, he provided Prescott with the services of George Lunt, who had adequate knowledge of Spanish for the task. However, this could only be a temporary arrangement, and he was replaced by a man named Hamilton Parker, who held the position for a year. Eventually George Ticknor, who was by then in charge of the department of modern literature at Harvard University, found James L. English, who worked with Prescott until 1831. Among the books studied by Prescott in this period, Ticknor lists Juan Antonio Llorente's Historia crítica de la Inquisición de España, Andrés Bernadez's Historia de los Reyes Católicos don Fernando y doña Isabel, Voltaire's Charles XII and William Roscoe's Life of Lorenzo de Medici, which were to be the sources on which the History of Ferdinand and Isabella was to be based. In spring 1828, Prescott visited Washington, where he and Ticknor dined with John Quincy Adams at the White House, and saw Congress in session.|$|E
5|$|Walton's {{first major}} {{composition}} after Belshazzar's Feast was his First Symphony. It was not written to a commission, and Walton worked slowly on the score from late 1931 until he completed it in 1935. He had composed {{the first three}} of the four movements by the end of 1933 and promised the premiere to the conductor Hamilton Harty. Walton then found himself unable to complete the work. The end of his affair with Imma von Doernberg coincided with, and may have contributed <b>to,</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> and persistent writer's block. Harty persuaded Walton to let him perform the three existing movements, which he premiered in December 1934 with the London Symphony Orchestra. During 1934 Walton interrupted work on the symphony to compose his first film music, for Paul Czinner's Escape Me Never (1934), for which he was paid £300. After a break of eight months, Walton resumed work on the symphony and completed it in 1935. Harty and the BBC Symphony Orchestra gave the premiere of the completed piece in November of that year. The symphony aroused international interest. The leading continental conductors Wilhelm Furtwängler and Willem Mengelberg sent for copies of the score, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra premiered the work in the US under Harty, Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra gave the New York premiere, and the young George Szell conducted the symphony in Australia.|$|E
