5|$|A scientist, engineer, billionaire, {{founder and}} owner of Oscorp, who tests an {{unstable}} strength enhancer on himself and becomes the insane and powerful demon. Unaware of Spider-Man's true identity, he also {{sees himself as a}} father figure for Peter, ignoring his own son, Harry. Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.|$|E
5|$|One {{year after}} the death of the Joker during the events of , Batman is {{struggling}} {{to come to terms with}} the absence of his nemesis and <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> feeling that the pair shared a bond deeper than either could admit. Without the Joker's chaotic presence, Gotham's citizens have never felt safer, and crime in the city has dramatically declined. However, this gives Batman's enemies, including Penguin, Two-Face, and Harley Quinn, a chance to unite with the singular goal of killing Batman.|$|E
5|$|Xerxes's {{estimated}} time {{of arrival}} at Thermopylae coincided with both the Olympic Games and the festival of Carneia. For the Spartans, warfare during these periods was considered sacrilegious. Despite <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> timing, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men. The customary elite young men in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had children. Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Allied Peloponnesian cities, and other forces that the Allies picked up on the way to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.|$|E

The weight shift is accomplished by altering the geometry of the insole.|$|R

25|$|The study Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance (2009) {{identified}} the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the fMRI scanner, some of the study participants argued that <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; some participants, from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the fMRI scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who argued about <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> experimental environment.|$|E
25|$|The elliptical, ironic, {{and romantic}} style of Marcos' {{writings}} {{may be a}} way of keeping a distance from the painful circumstances that he reports on and protests. His literary output has a purpose, as suggested in a 2002 book titled, Our Word is Our Weapon, a compilation of his articles, poems, speeches, and letters. In 2005, he wrote the novel <b>The</b> <b>Uncomfortable</b> Dead with crime writer Paco Ignacio Taibo II.|$|E

During those days one or two Panividaiyalars use to draw waters from the well and use to throw into the crowd, by which the whole crowd gets a few drops poured on their heads.|$|E

25|$|For this reason, Bauman {{argues that}} modern {{societies}} have not fully taken {{on board the}} lessons of the Holocaust; it is generally viewed – to use Bauman's metaphor – like a picture hanging on a wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis, the Jews became 'strangers' par excellence in Europe; the Final Solution was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempts made by societies to excise <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> and indeterminate elements existing within them. Bauman, like the philosopher Giorgio Agamben, contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Admiral Morrison {{replaced}} Admiral Prins as District Commander and Lieutenant Mark O'Hare replaced Lieutenant Boyer as Admiral's Aide. The {{change of}} command was favorable toward Marlett's cartoons, {{except for one}} incident: Marlett created a storyboard that poked fun at a recent district inspection that the admiral planned and managed. Admiral Morrison called Marlett to his office and made it clear how offended {{he was with the}} cartoon. Marlett apologized to the admiral and the offending storyboard was replaced with another idea. After <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> situation with the admiral, Lieutenant O'Hare became more vigilant and required Marlett to have future storyboards meet his approval before turning the sketches into original artwork.|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> symptoms of vertigo, and those {{who may not have}} the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E

500|$|Brian Zoromski of IGN rated [...] "Diwali" [...] 9.3 out of 10, an {{indication}} of an [...] "amazing" [...] episode. He wrote that [...] "Michael completely stole the episode with a truly dizzying number of uncomfortable situations. Daily Show vet Steve Carell has become the king of <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> moment, throwing himself completely into situations viewers know won't end well." [...] Like West, Zoromski also appreciated the other characters' moments, such as Angela's [...] "xenophobic" [...] comments during the festivities. Television Without Pity gave the episode an A grade.|$|E

500|$|By the 1870s {{most of the}} ironclads {{from the}} Civil War were laid up in reserve, leaving the United States {{virtually}} without an ironclad fleet. When the Virginius Affair first broke out in 1873, a Spanish ironclad happened to be anchored in New York Harbor, leading to <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> realization {{on the part of}} the U.S. Navy that it had no ship capable of defeating such a vessel. The Navy hastily issued contracts for the construction of five new ironclads, and accelerated its existing repair program for several more. [...] and the four Amphitrite-class monitors were subsequently built as a result of the Virginius war scare. All five vessels would later take part in the Spanish–American War of 1898.|$|E

500|$|Shooting often ran for 12 {{hours at}} a time and led to {{frequent}} minor injuries among the cast and production staff, while some developed intense feelings of claustrophobia in the confined space. Gordon suggests that <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> working conditions made the performances of the cast more realistic, but concedes that although, [...] "I think all this paid off {{in terms of what we}} got on the screen for the budget, but the circumstances were very difficult." [...] In the absence of suitable facilities inside the caves, the personnel established administrative, dressing and make-up rooms in a car park some distance from the filming area. Co-writer Nick Maley reprised his role as a special effects technician to produce the infant twin props that appear in the climax of the film.|$|E
500|$|Ian Douglas Smith [...] (8 April 1919– 20 November 2007) was a politician, farmer, and {{fighter pilot}} {{who served as}} Prime Minister of Rhodesia (or Southern Rhodesia) from 1964 to 1979. The country's first premier not born abroad, he led the {{predominantly}} white government that unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, following prolonged dispute over the terms. He remained Prime Minister for {{almost all of the}} fourteen years of international isolation that followed, and oversaw Rhodesia's security forces during most of the Bush War, which pitted the unrecognised administration against communist-backed black nationalist guerrilla groups. Smith, who has been described as personifying white Rhodesia, remains a highly controversial figure—supporters venerate him as a man of integrity and vision [...] "who understood <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> truths of Africa", while critics describe an unrepentant racist whose policies and actions caused the deaths of thousands and contributed to Zimbabwe's later crises.|$|E
500|$|Complex {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, writing {{that it was}} overshadowed by [...] "Leave It to Beaver", {{but that it was}} also a good episode by itself as well. [...] " [...] all comes to a head in the penultimate episode, which puts Veronica on the emotional rollercoaster until she gets to <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> truth." [...] The magazine also praised the reappearances of guest stars: [...] "what really makes the episode special is the way it trots out every supporting player and case-of-the-week guest star." [...] IGN ranked the episode 4th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, saying that [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist'" [...] is a heavy episode that expertly shows how different people remember the same situation. The fact that Veronica has to threaten people who were at the party into telling her the truth is frakking painful. It's made even more sad when you realize that the version she believed to be the truth actually wasn't." ...|$|E

500|$|The ministers {{intended}} to protect their orthodox doctrine and to examine Hutchinson's theological errors. [...] Ruling elder Thomas Leverett was charged with managing the examination. He called Mrs. Hutchinson and read the numerous errors with which she had been charged. [...] A nine-hour interrogation followed, in which the ministers delved into some weighty points of theology. [...] At {{the end of the}} session, only four of the many errors were covered, and Cotton was put in <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> position of delivering the admonition to his admirer. [...] He spoke, [...] "I would speake it to Gods Glory [...] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us... he hath given you a sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God." [...] The ministers overwhelmingly concluded that Hutchinson's unsound beliefs outweighed all the good which she had done, and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Brannan {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} The Objective Standard, and noted that it provides a [...] "barrage of evidence in moral defense of the oil sands producers", while Peter Foster, a Financial Post columnist, suggested that Levant [...] "not only exposes the lies and hypocrisy of the media-coddled opponents of the vast resource, but raises <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> question of what alternatives to the oilsands these moralists prefer". On the other hand, David Suzuki, dismissing Levant as an [...] "apologist", argued that [...] "the logic is faulty. Just because a country or society is considered 'ethical' does not mean everything it produces or exports is ethical". In the Winnipeg Free Press, John Collins, a retired union negotiator, criticized some of Levant's sources, noting {{the presence of the}} Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers in the footnotes, while Patrick Brethour, an editor for The Globe and Mail writing in the Literary Review of Canada, contends that the title of Levant’s book [...] "is a considerable misstatement" [...] and that Levant [...] "fails {{to make the case for}} ethical oil".|$|E
500|$|A nightclub {{manager in}} Glendale, C. J. Graham, was interviewed {{for the role}} of Jason in Jason Lives, but was {{initially}} passed over because he had no experience as a stuntman. Dan Bradley was hired, but Paramount executives felt Bradley did not have the right physique to play the role, and Graham was hired to replace him. Although Bradley was replaced early during filming, he {{can be seen in the}} paintball sequence of the film. Graham opted to perform most of his own stunts, including the scene where Jason catches on fire while battling Tommy in the lake. The rest of the cast spoke highly of Graham, remarking that he never complained during all <b>the</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> situations he was placed in. Graham had no intention of being an actor or a stuntman, but the idea of playing the [...] "bad guy", and the opportunity to wear the prosthetics, intrigued him. Graham was not brought back to reprise the role, but has often been cited as speaking highly of his time in the part.|$|E
