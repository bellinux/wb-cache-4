5|$|The {{following}} day, Jamie presents Dylan {{with the}} contract to sign so she can land her commission for recruiting him. Not knowing {{anyone else in the}} city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the topic of sex and relationships. They {{come to the conclusion that}} sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization that this is not really what she wants and she would like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] was {{directed}} by Harvey & Carolyn. It opens with Harding pulling down her bike helmet, followed by the helmeted faces of all five band members being shown with a title screen. The girls' helmets fly off their heads as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> their motorcycles. At the front, the girls' names are on them. In subsequent scenes, the band members are shown racing on motorcycles along a desert road. Following {{the topic of the}} song, the members are seen applying fake tattoos, painting their nails, and blow-drying their hair, all still while riding on their motorcycles. At one point, the girls dismount from their bikes to dance, but eventually they return to the motorcycles and ride off into the distance.|$|E

500|$|Born in Weatherfield, Mavis {{was brought}} up in Grange-over-Sands where her parents, despite being teetotal, ran an off-licence. Mavis first appears in Coronation Street in 1971 at Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) and Ernest Bishop's (Stephen Hancock) {{engagement}} party, as a friend/colleague of Emily's from the mail order warehouse and is invited to be a bridesmaid at the wedding. She is initially employed as a receptionist at the local vet and then as an assistant in the corner shop, but takes a job offered by Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox) at The Kabin newsagents, 14Rosamund Street. [...] Mavis and Rita are complete opposites– Rita sexy and self-assured, Mavis mouse-like and dowdy– but <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> well and become friends. Rita often despairs at Mavis's choices in life, {{particularly when it comes to}} men. Rita's dominance over Mavis seems like bullying to outsiders, but she is only thinking of Mavis's best interests.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Williams {{waiting for his}} laundry {{to be done in}} a store, before getting out for a walk. Meanwhile, Barlow is {{standing}} {{on the other side of}} the street. As the song starts the two of them start walking towards their cars whilst looking at each other. When they get inside, the scenes are intercut with the two of them dancing with their female partners. Later in the video, they are shown sitting at the bar having a drink whilst singing the song's words. As the second chorus starts, Williams and Barlow are at a pond, fishing and laughing. Scenes of them looking each other secretly are also shown. In the middle of [...] "Shame"'s bridge they start taking their shirts off. Shortly, they are shown climbing up a cliffs. After <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the top they want to jump, however, they realize it's too high. Instead they hug each other and walk away as the video finishes.|$|E
500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Natasha discovers Andrew is {{cheating}} on her with Summer. Natasha is hurt and angry and she lies to Andrew about being pregnant. Of Natasha's rash decision, Novakovic explained [...] "She is hurt and the whole cheating thing has really crushed her. She feels like the fool, no one goes behind her back. And she feels they are pitying her because of her injury [...] and [...] really hates that." [...] Natasha wants Andrew and Summer to feel guilty about betraying her and she wants Andrew for herself. Andrew believes Natasha is pregnant and instead of being with Summer, he decides to stick by Natasha and their baby. Novakovic said that the new storyline is [...] "very exciting" [...] {{and she could not}} wait to discover the new developments. Novakovic insisted that Natasha is making the plan up as she goes along. She has not thought it out or how the whole situation might end. Her main goal is to keep Andrew and Summer apart because they betrayed and hurt her. Natasha and Andrew attend a pre-natal class together and <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> quite well. During an interview with Digital Spy, Novakovic explained that Natasha is reminded of why she fell for Andrew in the first place, especially when she sees his gentle side. Because Natasha is getting along well Andrew, there are times when she feels guilty for what she is doing. Natasha does not have any sort of plan to admit the truth as she knows Andrew will be angry.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, however, {{had a more}} {{positive}} response to the film and awarded it {{three out of four}} stars, writing, [...] "That the movie works is because of the considerable production qualities and the charisma of the actors, who bring more interest to the characters than they deserve. There is a kind of direct, unadorned conviction to the acting of Clive Owen and the others; raised on Shakespeare, trained for swordfights, with an idea of Arthurian legend in their heads since childhood, they don't seem out of time and place like the cast of Troy. <b>They</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1911, Kočić had {{relocated}} to Sarajevo, ready to represent his district. Shortly thereafter, {{he was appointed}} to the Administrative and Cultural Council. He wrote little, with the exception of Sudanija (Trials), a dialogue based on his prison experiences, and instead devoted himself to penning fiery speeches to be delivered in the Sabor. The main subjects of these speeches were the agrarian question and forestry rights, both of which disproportionately affected the Bosnian Serb peasantry, Kočić's primary constituents, who made up nearly half of Bosnia and Herzegovina's rural population at the time. During this period, {{he was one of the}} two primary proponents of agrarian reform in the province, alongside Lazar Dimitrijević. Kočić also went about agitating against the Muslim landowning class. The Muslim landlords became one of the primary targets of his speeches, second only to the Austro-Hungarians. [...] "Every kmets income is taxed," [...] Kočić complained, [...] "while people in towns do not pay any taxes on the interest <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> their money in the banks nor do the feudal lords pay taxes on the one third they obtain from the kmets." ...|$|E
2500|$|The West Indies toured England in 1976, {{and though}} Holding was {{unknown in the}} country the British press picked up on his {{performance}} in Australia {{and there was a}} sense of anticipation about his bowling. An early psychological blow was landed by the West Indies in a warm up match against the Marylebone Cricket Club when Holding struck Dennis Amiss on the head, leaving a wound that needed stitches. Amiss was a veteran player and likely to open for England in the forthcoming Tests and seeing him struggle against Holding's pace was a warning of things to come. In the lead up to the series England captain Tony Greig was confident of his team's chances, saying in an interview [...] "I like to think people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks. You must remember, that the West Indians, these guys, if <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> top they are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey [...] and a few others, to make them grovel." [...] The comments outraged the West Indians, and to the team the use of the term [...] "grovel" [...] in particular [...] "smacked of racism and apartheid".|$|E
