5|$|By {{allowing}} u to vary {{over all}} possible integers, an infinite family of solutions {{can be generated}} from a single solution (x1,y1). If <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> are required to be positive integers (x>0,y>0), only {{a finite number of}} solutions may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> can be any real number (see Underdetermined system).|$|E
5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius {{problem that is}} simpler to solve; <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> to the original problem are found from <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E
