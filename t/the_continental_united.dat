5|$|Hurricane Nora was {{the first}} Pacific {{hurricane}} to bring gale-force winds to <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> <b>United</b> States since Kathleen in 1976.

5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft {{would be needed to}} deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development. At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several tons, and the need to carry enough fuel to fly that payload from <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> <b>United</b> States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers. They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the critical blast-radius.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{there being}} 20 named systems, five above the average, only four storms {{directly}} affected land. Hurricane Eugene {{was the first}} Pacific hurricane to make landfall in Mexico in July since the 1954 season and caused all of the season's three deaths and $142.12 million damage. Tropical Storm Pilar and Hurricane Norma also came close to land, with the former producing record rain in Baja California Sur. The remnants of Hurricanes Ramon and Norma caused rain in <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> <b>United</b> States.
