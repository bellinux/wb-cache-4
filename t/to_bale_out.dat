25|$|Pawluk was {{in command}} of Vickers Wellington Mark II (squadron codes SM-M, serial number “W5567”) which took off from RAF Lindholme at 21:23 hours GMT on the night 28–29 March 1942 to attack the German town of Lübeck. His {{aircraft}} was shot down by anti-aircraft fire and the crew had <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out,</b> all six being taken prisoner. He went straight into the prison camp system as prison of war number 23.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier-General Arthur W. Vanaman, {{the highest-ranking}} USAAF officer {{captured}} in the European Theatre of Operations. Vanaman, an intelligence officer, succeeded Spivey as SAO in mid-1944. He had (like Spivey) been captured after flying as an observer on a bombing mission. The crew had advised Vanaman <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> after his aircraft {{had been hit by}} flak and filled with smoke. This, ironically, had been caused by the ignition of a harmless smoke marker and the bomber had returned to base safely.|$|E
25|$|In January 1941, he was {{appointed}} a flight commander of No. 41 Squadron RAF. With the squadron he flew fighter sweeps and bomber escort sorties over Nazi occupied France. On 14 August 1941, he was flying over France escorting bombers whose target was the St Omer railyards near Lille. One of the Blenheim bombers was attacked by two Messerschmitt 109 fighters. He went to its aid, shooting {{down one of the}} Messerschmitts. However, in the dogfight with the remaining Nazi fighter, his spitfire sustained damage and burst into flames. He was forced <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> at a low altitude from his out of control aircraft. He landed safely and a French farmer immediately ushered him to a cornfield where he hid until nightfall. The farmer' son, Felix Caron, then arrived to bring him to the safety of their farm in Saint-Folquin. On 25 August 1941, his commission was confirmed and he was promoted to war substantive flying officer with seniority in that rank from 15 August 1941. After two weeks in a French Resistance safe house, the French speaking Winskill was moved down the Pat Line. He travelled to the Pyrenees and then, via Andorra, Barcelona and Madrid, to British Gibraltar. He arrived back in England in December 1941; it had taken him three months to arrive back in England after being shot down.|$|E

500|$|Bär and his I. Gruppe of JG77 {{operated}} from Fatnassa, Tunisia, {{in early}} March 1943. On 1st or 2 March, Bär claimed a Spitfire shot down. Then {{in the evening}} met Galland, who was making a surprise visit to I./JG77. Galland was greeted by Major Joachim Müncheberg, who introduced Bär to Galland. Thus began a comradeship which outlasted World War II. [...] On 6 March 92 Squadron Spitfires provided cover for 1 SAAF Squadron. They were supported by 601. Bär spotted their approach and climbed then dived onto the British. Bär accounted for two Spitfires—Flight Sergeant Tilston, from 601, was forced <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> and Flying Officer Mahon from the South African unit was killed.|$|E
500|$|In August 1938, Edwards was {{piloting}} a Blenheim {{near the}} Scottish border when he flew into a storm at [...] When the ailerons froze, the aircraft was forced down to [...] and Edwards ordered the navigator and rear gunner <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> of the aircraft. Down to , {{he made an}} effort to jump clear, but his parachute became entangled with the bomber's radio mast pylon. In the ensuing crash, he sustained head injuries and a badly broken leg, which was only saved after extensive surgery, which left that leg shorter than the other. After the accident, he was declared unfit for flying duties until April 1940, when he was posted to No. 139 Squadron for active service due to the outbreak of war. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 21 May 1940.|$|E
500|$|The Luftwaffe {{launched}} a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March. Leggo, {{who had not}} slept for over 24hours, returned to the airfield {{in the early hours}} having spent the night with a girlfriend. As the German planes approached he was ordered to prepare to fly. Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going, but Leggo insisted on flying, and took off at 08:05 as {{part of a group of}} four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s. He was soon seen to be flying poorly. A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range, seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out.</b> Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its slipstream, causing him to fall to his death. When Plagis learned what had happened, he was inconsolable, holding himself responsible. In his journal, he vowed to [...] "shoot down ten for Doug—I will too, if it takes me a lifetime".|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{cause of}} Hood's demise remains unconfirmed, {{although}} {{one of the}} five combat claims made by JG 54 probably relate to this casualty. Hood was reported <b>to</b> have <b>baled</b> <b>out,</b> but his parachute became entangled with his aircraft with fatal consequences. Spitfire P9428 then crashed, engine-less and minus its port wing, near Nevendon. There is speculation that Hood was buried in a German war grave by mistake. [...] The archives state that Squadron Leader Hood was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, although the award was gazetted after Hood had deceased.|$|R
60|$|Little {{by little}} as the Seamew {{who was not}} quite certain as to her berth, rode at anchor, the town came to life again. Men of marine appearance, in baggy {{trousers}} and tight jerseys, came slowly on to the quay and stared meditatively at the water or shouted vehemently at other men, who had got into small boats <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> them <b>out</b> with rusty cans. From some of these loungers, after much shouting and contradictory information, the Seamew, discovered her destination and was soon fast alongside.|$|R
25|$|No. 5 {{boat was}} leaking badly and her crew were busy using their seaboots and empty cans <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> water <b>out</b> of her. At about 01:30 (local time) on 30 October they {{lost contact with}} the other lifeboats. Overnight the boat's crew rowed to keep the boat headed into the sea; at daybreak they raised her mast and hoisted a sail. At about 16:00 (local time) they {{deployed}} the boat's sea anchor overnight. At daybreak on 31 October they resumed sailing, and {{a few hours later}} sailed into sight of an Allied convoy.|$|R
2500|$|... 13 August 1951 – two {{aircraft}} from RAF Leeming collided over Hudswell, near to Richmond, North Yorkshire. A cadet in the No. 228 Operational Conversion Unit Wellington {{aircraft was}} given the only serviceable parachute by Flight lieutenant John Quinton, shown how to operate it and ordered <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out.</b> The other eight crew members of both aircraft died when their aircraft hit the ground.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 May 1940 Carey flew {{his last}} patrol in the campaign. While leading {{a section of}} Hurricanes over the front, Carey spotted a lone Westland Lysander and flew down to it to show the pilot they were {{friendly}} fighters. As he did so he noted a Do 17 some 3,000ft above. Carey climbed, attacked and hit the Dornier which half-rolled, dived and then crashed. As Carey pursued it down the German gunner hit his Hurricane with several bursts and the fighter caught fire. One round {{hit him in the}} knee and another had passed between his legs and hit the parachute pack. Regardless, Carey quickly decided <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out.</b> The parachute snagged on the cockpit [...] "hood" [...] and because of the slipstream and he had difficulty in moving his good leg out of the cockpit. The delay enabled Carey to stay with the aircraft long enough to notice the dive had put out the fire and Carey opted for a crash-landing instead. Carey abandoned the Hurricane in a field, but took maps and identification documents with him fearing he might be in enemy territory. He elected not to destroy the Hurricane. Carey landed near Hamme, Belgium, and was picked up by a Belgian Army patrol. The German aircraft had also crashed nearby and its occupants were taken prisoner. From 14–20 May, in Carey's absence, 3 Squadron lost four killed, one captured and one badly wounded. Aside from the six losses, four Hurricanes force-landed and another two were damaged.|$|E

60|$|Gaff {{was right}} in his {{expectation}} of more wind. About two hours after sunset it came on to blow so stiffly that he was obliged to awaken Billy and set him <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> the sprays that kept constantly washing over the gunwale.

60|$|It {{was of no}} use {{attempting}} to recover them. All the energies of the crew were required <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> the water and keep the boat afloat, and during the whole storm {{some of them were}} constantly employed in baling. For three days it blew a perfect hurricane, and during all that time the men had nothing whatever to eat; but they did not suffer so much as might be supposed. The gnawing pangs of hunger do not usually last beyond a few days when men are starving. After that they merely feel ever-increasing weakness. During the fall of the rain they had taken care to fill their jars, so that they had now a good supply of water.|$|E
5000|$|He then {{served with}} the Merchant Ship Fighter Unit on {{catapult}} ships flying Hawker Hurricanes. These missions required the pilot <b>to</b> ditch or <b>bale</b> <b>out,</b> in the expectation of being recovered by a passing ship. During the Malta Convoys in 1942, he flew Fairey Fulmars with 807 Squadron, from the carrier HMS Argus. For his service, {{he was awarded the}} Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) in June 1942. Later in the year, the squadron converted to Supermarine Seafires flying from [...] for the Operation Torch landings in North Africa. During the Allied landings in Algeria and Morocco, he added a bar to his DSC, gazetted in March 1943. By this time, he had shot down one Italian aircraft (a Fiat CR.42 on 14 May 1942) and damaged another.|$|R
60|$|As it happened, {{the craft}} they sought was battling with the breeze some {{distance}} offshore, and Andrew Allinson, kneeling astern, glanced anxiously to leeward when he dared {{take his eyes}} off the threatening seas ahead. They rolled down on the canoe, ridged with foam, and it needed quick work with the paddle to help her over them. To make things worse, she was half full of water, and nobody could spare a hand <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> it <b>out.</b> Andrew was not an expert at canoeing, but he had once made a journey up the Canadian waterways and had been a yachtsman at home; and when the breeze freshened and the waves got steeper it had become evident that neither of his companions was capable of managing the craft in broken water. He had accordingly taken the helmsman's post and after running before the sea for the greater part of the day without a meal, had discovered at dusk a long ridge of rocks and pines looming up not far ahead.|$|R

He then has the pleasure of returning <b>Bale</b> <b>to</b> prison, the burden of the six agents' deaths presumably gone, even mocking him while he was being placed in a cell by using Bale's own words ("An emotional release") in a sentence; he states that he finds it an emotional release in putting away criminals like Bale.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} Vincent rode {{over to his}} friend's plantation, sending Dan off an hour {{beforehand}} <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> the boat and get the masts and sails into her from the boathouse. The greater part {{of the next two}} days was spent on the water, sometimes sailing, sometimes fishing. The evening of the second of these days was that upon which Vincent had arranged to meet Tony again, and an hour after dark he went down through the garden to the stable; for that was the time the fugitive was to meet him, for he could not leave his place of concealment until night fell. After looking at the horses, and giving some instructions to the negroes in charge, he returned to the shrubbery, and, sending Dan up to summon Dinah, he went to the bushes where he had before met Tony. The negro came out as he approached.|$|E
6000|$|The {{furniture}} is simple as the building. Three stones and a hole form the fireplace, near which sleep the children, kids, and lambs: there being no chimney, {{the interior is}} black with soot. The cow-skin couches are suspended during the day, like arms and other articles which suffer from rats and white ants, by loops of cord to the sides. The principal ornaments are basket-work bottles, gaily adorned with beads, cowris, and stained leather. Pottery being here unknown, the Bedouins twist the fibres of a root into various shapes, and make them water-tight with the powdered bark of another tree. [22] The Han is a large wicker-work bucket, mounted in a framework of sticks, and used to contain water on journeys. The Guraf (a word derived from the Arabic [...] "Ghurfah") is a conical-shaped vessel, used <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> {{the contents of a}} well.

His fear was that the cockleshell of a boat should fill and founder; he tried <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> the water with his hat, and to make her assist, but she seemed incapable, and he could only devise laying her down {{in the bottom of the}} boat with his coat over her, hiding her face in terror. Her hat had long ago been blown away, and her hair was flapping about. Ejaculations were in his heart, if not on his lips, and once or twice she cried out something like, [...] "Save me!"

5000|$|After an {{exhausting}} voyage, Seydi Ali Reis {{and his men}} reached Gujarat in India - {{which part}} of it, however, they did not know. When the pilot suddenly exclaimed: [...] "On your guard! a whirlpool in front!" [...] the anchors were quickly lowered, but the ship was dragged down with great force and nearly submerged. The rowers had left their seats, the panic-stricken crew threw off their clothes, and, clinging some to casks and some to jacks, had taken leave of one another. Seydi Ali Reis also stripped entirely, gave his slaves their liberty, and vowed to give 100 florins to the poor of Mecca in case of survival. By that time two more anchors broke off and were lost, the ship gave a terrible jerk, and in another instant they were clear of the breakers. The pilot declared that, had they been wrecked off Fisht-Kidsur, a place between Diu and Daman, nothing could have saved them. Once more the sails were set, and Seydi Ali Reis decided to head towards India - duly taking note of the tides and currents, and having made a careful study of the charts, {{he had come to}} the conclusion that they could not be very far off from the Indian mainland. He examined the hold of the ship and found that the storeroom was submerged, in some places up to the walls, in some places higher still. They had shipped much water, and all hands set to work at once <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> it <b>out.</b> In one or two places the bottom had to be ripped up to find the outlet so as to reduce the water.|$|R
60|$|The wind {{increased}} to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around {{us like a}} white fire upon the prairie, in which unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these jaws of death!

Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night; {{no sign of the}} ship could be seen. The rising sea forbade all attempts <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> the boat. The oars were useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers. So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.|$|E

I suppose you like a small bullock better than the loot of many houses." [...] "I would advise you to hold your tongue, or somebody here may fling you overboard into this damned fog," [...] said Brown. The boat seemed to be standing still; nothing could be seen, not even the river alongside, only the water-dust flew and trickled, condensed, down their beards and faces. It was weird, Brown told me. Every individual man of them {{felt as though he}} were adrift alone in a boat, haunted by an almost imperceptible suspicion of sighing, muttering ghosts. [...] "Throw me out, would you? But I would know where I was," [...] mumbled Cornelius surlily. [...] "I've lived many years here."

Long enough for that," [...] snarled Cornelius. [...] "That's very useful," [...] commented Brown. [...] "Am I to believe you could find that backway you spoke of blindfold, like this?" [...] Cornelius grunted. [...] "Are you too tired to row?" [...] he asked after a silence. [...] "No, by God!" [...] shouted Brown suddenly. [...] "Out with your oars there." [...] There was a great knocking in the fog, which after a while settled into a regular grind of invisible sweeps against invisible thole-pins. Otherwise nothing was changed, and but for the slight splash of a dipped blade it was like rowing a balloon car in a cloud, said Brown. Thereafter Cornelius did not open his lips except to ask querulously for somebody <b>to</b> <b>bale</b> <b>out</b> his canoe, which was towing behind the long-boat. Gradually the fog whitened and became luminous ahead. To the left Brown saw a darkness as though he had been looking {{at the back of the}} departing night.

The work commenced upon the higher parts of the foundation as the water left them, but it was now pretty generally reduced to a level. About twenty men could be conveniently employed at each pump, and it is quite astonishing in how short a time so great a body of water could be drawn off. The water in the foundation-pit at this time measured about two feet in depth, on an area of forty-two feet in diameter, and yet it was drawn off in the course of about half an hour. After this the artificers commenced with their picks and continued at work for two hours and a half, some of the sailors being at the same time busily employed in clearing the foundation of chips and in conveying the irons to and from the smiths on the beacon, where they were sharped. At eight o'clock the sea broke in upon us and overflowed the foundation-pit, when the boats returned to the tender.|$|R
