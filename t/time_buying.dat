At a small press, it is possible to survive by relying entirely on commissioned material. But as activity increases, the need for works may outstrip the publisher's established circle of writers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scale of}} the project was massive, with trucks {{carrying}} [...] "16,000 partition tiles, 5,000 bags of cement, [...] of sand and 300 bags of lime" [...] arriving at the construction site every day. There were also cafes and concession stands on five of the incomplete floors so workers did not have to descend to the ground level to eat lunch. Temporary water taps were also built so that workers did not waste <b>time</b> <b>buying</b> water bottles from the ground level. Additionally, small railway systems carried materials from the basement storage spaces to elevators that brought the carts to the desired floors, where the carts then delivered the materials across that level directly by using another set of tracks on that floor. The [...] of steel ordered for the project was the largest-ever single order of steel at the time, comprising more steel than was ordered for the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street combined. According to historian John Tauranac, the materials for the building came from far and wide, with [...] "limestone from Indiana, steel girders from Pittsburgh, cement and mortar from upper New York State, marble from Italy, France, and England, wood from northern and Pacific Coast forests, [...] hardware from New England." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis project was to study how {{different}} companies are working with LastTime Buy and through that study propose improved ways of working with this for Scania CVAB. The project aimed at studying the work processes from three different perspectives:decision models, quality aspects and liability aspects between companies. To study this, qualitative interviews with one or several representatives from differentcompanies that are affected by or involved in Last <b>Time</b> <b>Buy</b> were used. Representatives wereselected partly from Original Equipment Manufacturers, suppliers, component manufacturersand companies offering third part solutions for Last <b>Time</b> <b>Buy.</b> The companies also reflecteddifferent industries. The interviews aimed to create an understanding for the methods used atthe different companies but also the ways of thinking and the knowledge behind the choice ofthese working methods. The analysis shows that the Original Equipment Manufacturers used very similar decisionmodels for Last <b>Time</b> <b>Buy,</b> but that external factors or the company strategy made them reachdifferent results. Also some factors were identified that could possibly affect decision quality. Scania is recommended to make sure to collect correct information for a decision, tostandardize the process for passing of information about Last <b>Time</b> <b>Buy</b> in the value chain,and also create decision support for Last <b>Time</b> <b>Buy</b> to ensure high quality decisions everytime. The analysis also showed that companies use similar processes for component storage,processes that Scania is recommended to ensure at their suppliers. The analysis showed alsothat many companies are able to store components for at least 10 years in this manner, as longas the most quality sensitive components are avoided at Last <b>Time</b> <b>Buy.</b> For longer storagethan this, Scania is recommended to store on wafer at the component manufacturer, store at aspecialist, or take costs for possible repair of components into account. In addition, the analysis showed {{a connection between the}} electronics constructor,responsibility for Last <b>Time</b> <b>Buy</b> solutions and who is the owner of the components. Thisindicated that Scania should continue letting the suppliers hold responsibility for Last TimeBuy, naturally while maintaining the good dialogue of today. Scania is also recommended tocontinue letting the supplier be responsible for component quality during storage whenpossible. Otherwise Last <b>Time</b> <b>Buy</b> is still a solution, since the risk for quality problems is notperceived as a great risk by other companies. In conclusion, Last <b>Time</b> <b>Buy</b> is a solution for the problem with life cycle mismatch, and asolution that Scania can keep utilizing...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturers {{supplying}} products under warranty need {{a strategy}} to deal with failures during the warranty period: repair the product or replace it by a new one, depending on e. g. age and/or usage of the failed product. An (implicit) assumption in virtually all models is that new products to replace the failed ones are immediately available at given replacement costs. Because of the short life cycles of many products, manufacturing may be discontinued {{before the end of}} the warranty period. At that point in time, the supplier has to decide how many products to put on the shelf to replace failed products under warranty that will be returned from the field (the last <b>time</b> <b>buy</b> decision). This is a trade-off between product availability for replacement and costs of product obsolescence. In this paper, we consider the joint optimization of repair-replacement decisions and the last <b>time</b> <b>buy</b> quantity for products sold under warranty. We develop approximations to estimate the total relevant costs and service levels for this problem, and show that we can easily find near-optimal last <b>time</b> <b>buy</b> quantities using a numerical search. Comparison to discrete event simulation results shows an excellent performance of our method...|$|R
