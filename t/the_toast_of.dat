5|$|From early 1929 Anderson {{lived with}} Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy Park Avenue {{spinster}} happy to host someone {{she supposed to}} be a daughter of the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was <b>the</b> <b>toast</b> <b>of</b> New York City society. Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet, and on one occasion running around naked on the roof. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her to a mental hospital. Before she could be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and the door was broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she remained for slightly over a year. In August 1932, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner Deutschland. Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at Ilten near Hanover. On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane, but as the room was prepaid, and she had nowhere else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.|$|E

She congratulated the winner, Bernd Rosemeyer, who seemed smitten with her. They danced together that night and were married on 13 July 1936. A true celebrity couple – an adventurous aviator and the fearless racing driver – they were <b>the</b> <b>toast</b> <b>of</b> Nazi Germany. Heinrich Himmler ordered a reluctant Bernd to become a member of the SS.|$|E
25|$|Richmond {{dominated}} the 1967 season, running out winners {{in a classic}} Grand Final against Geelong. In his first two years, the team lost only seven games and Hafey had gone from an unknown coach in the bush to <b>the</b> <b>toast</b> <b>of</b> the football world. In hindsight, the 1967 premiership marked {{a turning point for}} the game. The Tigers were fitter than any team that had gone before and were the highest scoring team since 1950. Australian football, after two decades of defensive-based play, was about to enter an era of high scoring, aided by rule changes, new tactics and betters standards of fitness.|$|E
25|$|In {{his final}} term at Oxford Fry {{suffered}} his first (but not last) bout of mental illness, suffering a mental breakdown. There {{were a number}} of contributing factors to this. During his time at Oxford Fry had accumulated disturbingly large debts. In an attempt to alleviate his financial difficulties, Fry capitalised on his reputation to make some much-needed money. As well as writing articles (including one for Wisden), he did some private tutoring but although such activities reduced his debts they did not clear them and, further increased the intense pressure on his time. Fry's continuing indebtedness provides the most obvious explanation for his acceptance of an offer to do some nude modelling. These financial problems combined with his mother being seriously ill, placed an unbearable strain on him. Although he was able to sit his final exams, he was hardly in any fit state to do so, having hardly read a line for weeks. The result was Fry scraping a Fourth, bringing one of Oxford's most spectacular and successful careers to an inglorious end. So in the summer of 1895, only months after being <b>the</b> <b>toast</b> <b>of</b> Oxford, Fry found himself saddled with mounting debts and no way with which to repay them. In the short term, cricket came to his rescue. He was offered, and accepted, the chance to tour South Africa as a member of Lord Hawke's 1895–96 England touring party.|$|E

500|$|In the 1897 season, Peel was {{suspended}} by Yorkshire for drunkenness. Alcohol was popular with many professional cricketers, and {{the careers of}} several Yorkshire players in this period, including Peate, had been ended for this reason. Peel was always {{known to be a}} heavy drinker, but his behaviour had been tolerated. His fame, brought about by his performances, made the problem worse. Derek Hodgson, in the official Yorkshire club history, writes: [...] "A cheerful, gregarious man, [...] took to hospitality and entertaining with alacrity and moved in such society, particularly in London, that when one of the foremost journalists of the day asked to see him he was fobbed off by a man who announced himself as 'Peel's secretary', adding: 'He does not like interviews and has little to say. He sent me to take his place.'" [...] Hodgson observes: [...] "It is not impossible, of course, that Bobby was either shy, or 'indisposed' at that particular moment", and suggests that Peel's downfall, like Peate's before him, was because he [...] "was too often <b>the</b> <b>toast</b> <b>of</b> the town".|$|E
500|$|In 1937, Grant {{began the}} first film under his {{contract}} with Columbia Pictures, When You're in Love, portraying a wealthy American artist who eventually woos a famous opera singer (Grace Moore). His performance received positive feedback from critics, with Mae Tinee of The Chicago Daily Tribune describing it as the [...] "best thing he's done in a long time". After a commercial failure in his first RKO venture <b>The</b> <b>Toast</b> <b>of</b> New York, Grant was loaned to Hal Roach's studio for Topper, a screwball comedy film distributed by MGM, which became his first major comedy success. Grant played one half of a wealthy, freewheeling married couple with Constance Bennett, who wreak havoc on the world as ghosts after dying in a car accident. Topper {{became one of the}} most popular movies of the year, with a critic from Variety noting that both Grant and Bennett [...] "do their assignments with great skill". Vermilye described the film's success as [...] "a logical springboard" [...] for Grant to star in The Awful Truth that year, his first film made with Irene Dunne and Ralph Bellamy. Though McCarey reportedly disliked Grant, who had mocked the director by enacting his mannerisms in the film, he recognized Grant's comic talents and encouraged him to improvize his lines and draw upon his skills developed in vaudeville. The film was a critical and commercial success and made Grant a top Hollywood star, establishing a screen persona for him as a sophisticated light comedy leading man in screwball comedies.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, the Jets {{made the}} playoffs, accruing an 11–5 record, and hosted their first playoff game in four years. They were {{defeated}} {{in the first round}} by the eventual AFC champion New England Patriots after turning the ball over four times. Looking to improve on their 1985 performance, the Jets started the 1986 season 10–1, including nine straight wins. In week three against Miami, the Jets won 51–45 in overtime as Ken O'Brien and Dan Marino combined to pass for 884 yards, then an NFL record. Wracked by injuries, the Jets lost their final five regular season games, but still made the playoffs. In the wild card playoff game against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Jets replaced O'Brien with Pat Ryan, and won 35–15. This victory sent the Jets to the divisional round in an away game against the Cleveland Browns. The Jets built a 20–10 lead and appeared to have stopped a late Cleveland drive — until Mark Gastineau was called for a roughing the passer penalty, a late hit on Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar that gave the Browns another opportunity. Cleveland went on to tie the game, and in the second overtime, defeated the Jets, 23–20. [...] The Browns went on to lose to the Denver Broncos (beaten by the Jets earlier in the season) in the AFC Championship Game; the Broncos in turn lost to the Giants in Super Bowl XXI. [...] Many Jets were convinced that given the opportunity to play the Giants, the Jets would have won. According to Eskenazi, the Giants [...] "were <b>the</b> <b>toast</b> <b>of</b> New York, back in a championship game {{for the first time since}} the 1960s, while the Jets contemplated the late hit and what might have been".|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{aimed to}} study the {{development}} of the Maillard reaction during the drying-toasting step of different flours usually employed for the formulation of cereal-based products. The results state the idea that a great part of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural found in cereal-based products are supplied {{by the rest of the}} ingredients composing these foods and not from <b>the</b> <b>toasting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flours employed. Moreover, a high furfural generation was associated to the fibre-enrichment of whole wheat flour. Glucosylisomaltol (GIM) measurement could be established as a useful indicator for controlling the manufacture conditions of cereal-based products, if significant amounts of maltose are present. Furosine determination is suitable for flours with either low or high reactivity due to its inherent sensibility to thermal treatment but, in extremely reactive flours like soybean, HMF shows better application. Finally, the ΔE parameter resulted in a reliable measurement of the visible colour production for <b>the</b> <b>toasting</b> step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flours studied. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
