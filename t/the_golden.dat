5|$|Like other white-eyes, <b>the</b> <b>golden</b> white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, <b>the</b> <b>golden</b> white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. <b>The</b> <b>golden</b> white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. <b>The</b> <b>golden</b> white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out <b>the</b> <b>golden</b> white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. <b>The</b> <b>golden</b> white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E
