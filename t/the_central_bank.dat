5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Asymmetries in <b>the</b> Vietnamese lending <b>central</b> <b>bank’s</b> policy-related rate spread were documented.

Additionally, the empirical findings indicate that Vietnamese commercial banks exhibit competitive rate setting behavior which may be attributable to graft maximization by bank’s management. The results also show bidirectional Granger causality between the Vietnamese lending rate and <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank’s</b> policy-related rate, indicating that the lending rate and <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank’s</b> policy-related rate affect each other’s movements. These results suggest that monetary authority can use its countercyclical monetary policy instruments to achieve its macroeconomics objectives.

40|$|Não informadoThis thesis {{inquires}} <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>the</b> {{relations of}} them wi th {{government and private}} banks when the independence question comes into view. In this context, the thesis presents an intitutional analisys about <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> {{as well as it}} shows the logic of historical evolution of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>the</b> importance of them for regulating the financial and monetary instabilities in the capitalist economy. The thesis is divided in five chapters: first of all, there is an introdution; in chapters two, tree and four it presents the historical origins of <b>central</b> <b>banks,</b> <b>the</b> evolution of their functions and the relations of them with government and private banks; the last one presents the principal conclusions. The historical analisys of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> concludes that they are important institutions to the economic system. Why? Because they result from a process that shows the relation between the evolution of payments system and the public action. Due to this, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> are singular institutions: at the same time, they are part of State structure and of the private credit system. How do the relations between <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>the</b> private banks apear? The answer comes into view when an important function of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> is analysed, that is to say, the "lender of last resort" function. The performance of this function creates a basic trade-off to <b>the</b> <b>central</b> banks: <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> condition of "lender of last resort" conducts the private banks to a situation which they can have more risk positions. The classics denominated this trade-off as "moral azard". By the way the "moral azard" defines the characteristic private banks of <b>the</b> relations between <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and On <b>the</b> other hand, the ambivalence of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>the</b> relations of them with the private banks determine a specific connection between <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and government: <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> can not be totally independent as well as they can not be completly dependent from government. Finally, the idea of interdependence defines <b>the</b> characteristics of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> as well as it shows the relations of them with government and private banks. Why? Because the concept of interdependence brings the contradiction and the ambivalence that are part of these relations. On the other hand, the notion of interdependence explains the variability and <b>the</b> evolution of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> norms as well as it shows the permanent conflict between the lagal rule of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and their specific action...|$|R
