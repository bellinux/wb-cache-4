5|$|Experimental research: <b>The</b> <b>researcher</b> {{isolates}} {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what <b>the</b> <b>{{researcher}}</b> intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E
5|$|There {{is no one}} way to do Archaeoastronomy. The {{divisions}} between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists.

The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.|$|E

25|$|In psychology, {{qualitative}} research {{has come to}} be defined as research whose findings are not arrived at by statistical or other quantitative procedures. Qualitative research is often said to be naturalistic. That is, its goal is to understand behaviour in a natural setting. Two other goals attributed to {{qualitative research}} are understanding a phenomenon {{from the perspective of the}} research participant and understanding the meanings people give to their experience. It attempts to do this by using so-called naturalistic methods—interviewing, observation, ethnography, participant observation and focus groups. Each of these methods seeks to understand the perspective of the research participant within the context of their everyday life. This means that <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> is concerned with asking broad questions that allow the respondent to answer in their own words. These methods allow <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> to try to qualify their understanding during the research process through further probing questions. In addition, a method such as observation allows <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> to observe people within natural settings—particularly those in public places. This has resulted in greater understanding of people's behaviours in, for example, lifts, public transport, and queues.|$|E
