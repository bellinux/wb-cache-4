5|$|The church complex {{consists}} of, {{among other}} things, the church building, a presbytery, and a convent. St. Joseph's itself is highly decorated, including nineteen {{stained glass windows}} (including three dedicated to church's patron saint, Joseph), carvings showing the fourteen Stations of the Cross, and an altar imported from Germany. The single tower is home to <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> produced by Petit & Fritsen.|$|E
5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval face. As well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour dial, it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of the clock, jousting knights appear above the clock face.|$|E
5|$|The Real Monasterio de Santa Ana is a Christian monastery in Badajoz, {{declared}} a Bien de Interés Cultural site in 1988. It is {{the headquarters of}} the Order of St. Clare in the city and lies {{in the heart of the}} old city. It was founded in 1518 by Ms. Leonor de Vega i Figueroa, under the blessing of Pope Leo X, and belonged to the jurisdiction of the Franciscan province of San Miguel. According to the tombstone in the grounds, Figueroa was abbess of the monastery for forty years until her death on April 17, 1558. She was buried in the grounds, until moved to the Cripta Real del Monasterio de El Escorial. The monastery underwent a major transformation in the 18th century although the original structure partly remains. Outwardly, part of the building has buttresses and a tower with <b>two</b> <b>bells.</b> On the vault of the chancel stands a lookout tower with a lattice brick convent, topped with pinnacles. The church of the monastery has a single nave which was rebuilt in the late 17th century, and the presbytery is covered by a late Gothic rib vault dated to the first half of the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|There are 76memorials in the church. These {{include the}} 14th-century tomb of Ralph Davenport with the {{recumbent}} {{figure of a}} knight wearing plate armour with a gorget (collar) of mail (armour consisting of linked metal rings) and a conical helmet, a tomb chest of 1654, and a recumbent effigy (statue) of LadyEgerton, who died in 1599. The church also contains two sanctuary chairs and six old chests, {{one of which is}} iron-bound and dates from the 13thcentury. There is a ring of eight bells, six of which were recast in 1925 by Taylor's of Loughborough from the metal of the previous four 17th-century bells. The other <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> were added in 1998 and were also supplied by Taylors. The organ was made by J.J.Binns for King's Hall, Stoke-on-Trent in 1912. It was presented to the church by Stoke City Council in 1962 and was rebuilt and installed by Reeves and Merner. The parish registers begin in 1572 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1711, but the latter are incomplete.|$|E
25|$|Normal ringing {{technique}} only {{allows a}} ringer to ring <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> at a time, {{one in each}} hand.

25|$|Shelley ringing is similar, {{except that}} the clappers are each orientated in the same direction, so that the <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> {{normally}} ring simultaneously with one movement.

25|$|While the {{structure}} {{was found to}} contain some stones from the 1100 era, the building itself however dates from three distinct building phases - the chancel on the east end dates from around 1450, while the nave, which was built at the same time, was modernised in 1822 in the Churchwarden style, adding a vestry. The bell tower dates from the late 1600s - one of the <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> is a rare dated Tudor example. Gargoyles, originally hidden in the walls and {{believed to have been}} pranks by the original builders, have been made visible in the reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to play six bells at a time (i.e., to ring three bells in each hand). One way is to pick <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> up as if one were Shelley ringing, then pick the third up between one's little and ring fingers (a 'triple Shelley'). All three bells ring {{together}} when ringing in a knocking motion. A second way is to pick up the third bell sideways so the clapper swings outward. Ringers with good control can then ring the first bell without ringing the third, allowing him or her to play three notes in one hand.|$|E
25|$|A {{wall was}} soon erected around Ommen, {{including}} three gates: the Vechtpoort or Voorbruggenpoort (on {{the bank of}} the Vecht), the Varsenerpoort (on the western wall for traffic with Varsen) and the Arriërpoort (on the northern wall for traffic with Arriën). Even to this day, the <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> in the church's belltower, named Maria and Salvator and cast in 1517 by Hendrick de Tremonia of Dordrecht, are rung every evening at nine o'clock. These so-called Ave-Maria peals form a custom which traces its origin to the tradition of ringing the bell at the closing of the gates. Ommen never received a moat, even though it was permitted one.|$|E

40|$|The {{bunching}} of two single photons on a beam-splitter is {{a fundamental}} quantum effect, first observed by Hong, Ou and Mandel. It is a unique interference effect that relies only on the photons' indistinguishability and not on their relative phase. We generalize this effect by demonstrating the bunching of <b>two</b> <b>Bell</b> states, created in two passes of a nonlinear crystal, each composed of two photons. When the <b>two</b> <b>Bell</b> states are indistinguishable, phase insensitive destructive interference prevents the outcome of four-fold coincidence between the four spatial-polarization modes. For certain combinations of the <b>two</b> <b>Bell</b> states, we demonstrate the opposite effect of anti-bunching.

25|$|Weaving is the {{technique}} of playing a succession of bells by changing which bell is in each hand as required. This is used by bass and solo or small-ensemble ringers. The large size and weight of bass bells makes four-in-hand ringing impractical and impossible, and often a solo or small-ensemble ringer will need to {{move up and down}} a range of bells, possibly sharing them with others. This technique means more than <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> can be rung in short succession, using the table to damp and free the hand to pick up the next bell. If the ringing sequence requires bells to be rung in tonal order, this technique often results in a weaving pattern as the ringer must often reach across his or her body for the next bell.|$|E
25|$|The madbaha, {{arranged}} in the topmost platform {{at the eastern}} side of the building, represents Heaven. The primary altar is attached to the eastern wall. To the north of the madbaha is the diaqonikon (sacristry); to the south is the baptistery. The madbaha is protected with rails and is veiled by a red curtain most of the time; this is opened during the Holy Qurbana (Eucharist). An oil lamp within the sanctuary is kept glowing at all times to represent the presence of God. The madbaha is connected to the qestroma and haykla by a low-walled path called the sqaqona. The qestroma contains seats for the choir and lower clergy. The haykla contains an elevated platform or bema, which includes an altar, two lecterns for reading, and chairs for higher clergy. Worshipers stand before the altar, with separate seating for men and women. The main entrance is on the western side of the building; a vestibule, pillars, pilasters, and other architectural ornaments adorn the front end, and a flag mast stands in the front yard. One or <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> are installed in the back yard to signal the timing of ritual services, the death of a church member, or to inform the public of calamities.|$|E
25|$|Designs by Duarte D'Armas (1509-1510) show {{a castle}} with {{circular}} barbican and rounded western entrance with machillitons. The southern battlements were decorated with parralleleptical merlons, {{while in the}} north (which {{was in a state of}} semi-ruin) was a false gate. To the south of the entrance was a cylindrical corbel with two orders of cruciform battlements, without merlons and with intermittent vaults. The castle, also circular, was circuited by various towers and corbels of varying sizes and forms. In the extreme east, alongside the false gate is a rectangular tower of two registers, with ceiling tile, two small windows in the north and another in the south, a balcony with machillotians, with another two crowning the walls linking to the tower keep. The rectangular keep tower with facade crack, is marked by merlons with three balconies with machilliations; Duarte D'Armas indicated in the legend that the tower was four registers, with a last floor topped with vaulted ceiling. Following this is a smaller pentagonal tower, crowned with machialliations. On the right of the principal gate is a hexagonal corbel with balcony and machicolations and surmounted by two bell towers with two iron crosses, one with <b>two</b> <b>bells</b> and another referred to as d'El-Rei. On the left is a taller octagonal tower with comparable damage, crowned by machicolations with merlons. In the north is a hexagonal corbel, followed by a semi-circular corbel, rectangular ledge and a new hexagonal corbel with balcony and machicolations. In the castle courtyard are two cisterns. On the outside of the castle, to the west, are town homes, the parochial church in the east (with a Manueline doorway), the Church of Santa Maria de Vilar in the west and farther to the north, the Chapel of São Brás. In the east are cultivatable lands, extending to the Douro River and the Castilian castle of Vilibestre.|$|E
