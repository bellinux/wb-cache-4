40|$|First {{published}} online 07 Jul 2016 Herein, {{we present}} a rationally designed advanced nanofabrication approach aiming at producing {{a new type of}} optical bandpass filters based on nanoporous anodic alumina photonic crystals. The photonic stop band of nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) is engineered in depth by means of a pseudo-stepwise pulse anodisation (PSPA) approach consisting of pseudo-stepwise asymmetric current density pulses. This nanofabrication method makes it possible to tune the <b>transmission</b> <b>bands</b> of NAA at specific wavelengths and bandwidths, which can be broadly modified across the UV-visible-NIR spectrum through the anodisation period (i. e. time between consecutive pulses). First, we establish the effect of the anodisation period as a means of tuning the position and width of the <b>transmission</b> <b>bands</b> of NAA across the UV-visible-NIR spectrum. To this end, a set of nanoporous anodic alumina bandpass filters (NAA-BPFs) are produced with different anodisation periods, ranging from 500 to 1200 s, and their optical properties (i. e. characteristic <b>transmission</b> <b>bands</b> and interferometric colours) are systematically assessed. Then, we demonstrate that the rational combination of stacked NAA-BPFs consisting of layers of NAA produced with different PSPA periods can be readily used to create a set of unique and highly selective optical bandpass filters with characteristic <b>transmission</b> <b>bands,</b> the position, width and number of which can be precisely engineered by this rational anodisation approach. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that the superposition of stacked NAA-BPFs produced with slight modifications of the anodisation period enables the fabrication of NAA-BPFs with unprecedented broad <b>transmission</b> <b>bands</b> across the UV-visible-NIR spectrum. The results obtained from our study constitute the first comprehensive rationale towards advanced NAA-BPFs with fully controllable photonic properties. These photonic crystal structures could become a promising alternative to traditional optical bandpass filters based on glass and plastic.
