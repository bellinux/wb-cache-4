An e-mail message is extracted from e-mail client and stored in the database in e-mails table. Attachments are stored as files with reference links. Then a link to <b>this</b> <b>e-mail</b> (or e-mail with attachments) is created under history of two contacts: a sender and a recipient. This way the e-mail becomes a public note for all users to see. This reduces e-mail traffic - instead of forwarding coworkers an e-mail with attachment resulting in wasted space a single instance of <b>this</b> <b>e-mail</b> is sufficient. Additionally, reference links can be created in as many modules as needed (for example, a meeting or a task can have reference links to <b>this</b> <b>e-mail).</b>|$|E

This classifier system {{is based on the}} serial application of three filters: a Bayesian filter that classifies the textual content of e-mails, a rule- based filter that classifies the non grammatical content of e-mails and, finally, a filter based on an emulator of fictitious accesses which classifies the responses from websites referenced by links contained in <b>e-mails.</b> <b>This</b> system is based on an approach that is hybrid, because it uses different classification methods, and also integrated, because it takes into account all kind of data and information contained in <b>e-mails.</b> <b>This</b> approach aims to provide an effective and efficient classification. The system first applies fast and reliable classification methods, and only when the resulting classification decision is imprecise does the system apply more complex analysis and classification methods...|$|R
