50|$|Wheel rate {{is usually}} {{equal to or}} {{considerably}} less than <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate.</b> Commonly, springs are mounted on control arms, swing arms or some other pivoting suspension member. Consider the example above where <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> was calculated to be600 lbs/inch (87.5 N/mm), {{if you were to}} move the wheel 1 in (without moving the car), the spring more than likely compresses a smaller amount. Let's assume the spring moved 0.75 in, the lever arm ratio would be 0.75:1. The wheel rate is calculated by taking the square of the ratio (0.5625) times <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate,</b> thus obtaining 281.25 lbs/inch (49.25 N/mm). Squaring the ratio is because the ratio has two effects on the wheel rate. The ratio applies to both the force and distance traveled.|$|E
50|$|Wheel rate is the {{effective}} spring rate when {{measured at the}} wheel. This is as opposed to simply measuring <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> alone.|$|E
50|$|As the strut compresses, <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> {{increases}} dramatically, {{because the}} air is being compressed, while the viscosity of the oil dampens the rebound movement.|$|E
50|$|During 1971 <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and damper {{settings}} were altered {{along with}} the front suspension bushes which reduced the bounciness of the ride and low speed ride harshness which had generated press criticism {{at the time of}} the Cortina Mark III's launch.|$|R
5000|$|... The {{suspension}} {{has been}} lowered by 10mm. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> are <b>the</b> same, but <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> themselves are shorter, {{to compensate for}} the shorter stance. The suspension's shock damping was also adjusted by the M division. This was in order {{to compensate for the}} lower ride height, primarily for rebounding damping rates as opposed to actual compression.|$|R
50|$|Even with an {{electronic}} controller, actuator springs that are too soft can cause the wastegate to open before desired. Exhaust gas backpressure is still pushing against the wastegate valve itself. This backpressure can overcome <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> pressure without <b>the</b> aid of the actuator at all. Electronic control may still enable control of boost to over double gauge pressure of <b>the</b> <b>spring's</b> <b>rated</b> pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Longitudinal semi-elliptical springs used to {{be common}} and still are used in {{heavy-duty}} trucks and aircraft. They have the advantage that <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> can easily be made progressive (non-linear).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> (or {{suspension}} rate) is {{a component}} {{in setting the}} vehicle's ride height or its location in the suspension stroke. When a spring is compressed or stretched, the force it exerts is proportional to its change in length. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> or spring constant of a spring is {{the change in the}} force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring. Vehicles which carry heavy loads will often have heavier springs to compensate for the additional weight that would otherwise collapse a vehicle to the bottom of its travel (stroke). Heavier springs are also used in performance applications where the loading conditions experienced are more extreme.|$|E
50|$|These gauges use the {{attraction}} of two magnets to translate differential pressure into motion of a dial pointer. As differential pressure increases, a magnet attached to either a piston or rubber diaphragm moves. A rotary magnet that {{is attached to a}} pointer then moves in unison. To create different pressure ranges, <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> can be increased or decreased.|$|E

Three-dimensional finite element analysis has been employed to study the transverse shearing effects.

5000|$|In 2012, Gordon {{ended his}} NASCAR career, believing the top teams {{had a large}} {{advantage}} over the smaller teams due {{to the amount of}} money spent. As a result, Gordon wanted the Stadium Super Trucks to be a [...] "drivers' series"; with this philosophy, all trucks are identical to each other, though drivers are allowed to change some aspects of their trucks, such as <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rates,</b> ride heights and camber.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} uses Macpherson struts with a new, more rigid control-arm design, {{while the}} rear uses a torsion beam arrangement. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> on Corolla are relaxed, but the S model equipped with 17-inch wheels includes unique coil, damper, and bushing tuning to offering stiffer handling. The rear torsion beam's attachments points are now {{fastened to the}} body at a slanted, diagonal angle for its bushings, {{a departure from the}} traditional straight attachment orientation; the new layout contributes improves grip, and stability.|$|R
50|$|Roll {{couple is}} {{resisted}} by the suspension roll stiffness, {{which is a}} function of <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> of the vehicle's springs and of the anti-roll bars, if any. The use of anti-roll bars allows designers to reduce roll without making the suspension's springs stiffer in the vertical plane, which allows improved body control with less compromise of ride quality.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} example is in a vehicle's suspension, {{where it is}} used to {{describe}} the displacement and forces in the springs and shock absorbers. The force in the spring is (roughly) the vertical force at the contact patch divided by the motion ratio, and <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> is the wheel rate multiplied by the motion ratio squared and angle correction factor.|$|E
5000|$|Brake dive with {{telescopic}} forks can {{be reduced}} by either increasing <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> of the fork springs, orincreasing the compression damping of the forks. However, all of these changes make the motorcycle less pleasant to ride on rough roads, since the front end will feel stiffer, in the 1980s various manufacturers attempted to get round this by methods of anti-dive such as: ...|$|E
50|$|In a vehicle, shock {{absorbers}} reduce {{the effect of}} traveling over rough ground, leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling. While {{shock absorbers}} serve the purpose of limiting excessive suspension movement, their intended sole purpose is to damp spring oscillations. Shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> <b>Spring</b> <b>rates</b> are chosen by the manufacturer based on {{the weight of the}} vehicle, loaded and unloaded. Some people use shocks to modify <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> {{but this is not the}} correct use. Along with hysteresis in the tire itself, they damp the energy stored in the motion of the unsprung weight up and down. Effective wheel bounce damping may require tuning shocks to an optimal resistance.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>spring</b> flow <b>rate</b> {{is usually}} {{in the range of}} 0.5 to 2.0 litres per second (8th {{magnitude}} spring), however some large boggomosses have a flow rate of up to 10.0 litres per second (7th magnitude spring).|$|R
50|$|Schwefelsee (sulfur lake): {{known since}} the Roman era, its water was then piped to Strasbourg. The lake {{is a small}} natural water retain at the outlet of <b>the</b> Souffel's <b>spring.</b> <b>The</b> <b>spring's</b> <b>rate</b> of flow reaches 17 litres per second, its {{temperature}} is constant (about 12-13 °C) and therefore the lake never freezes. The sulfur content of the water allowed it to be used since the Roman era until the 1950s in thermae : its curative properties were mostly used to cure skin diseases. The lake {{also served as a}} horse bath (als: Rosschwemm) : a mild slope allows them to quietly go into water.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> of a {{coil spring}} may be {{calculated}} by a simple algebraic equation {{or it may be}} measured in a spring testing machine. The spring constant k can be calculated as follows:where d is the wire diameter, G is the spring's shear modulus (e.g., about 12,000,000 lbf/in² or 80 GPa for steel), N is the number of wraps and D is the diameter of the coil.|$|E
50|$|If {{friction}} and bottoming-out effects are ignored, <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> of {{a stack of}} identical Belleville washers can be quickly approximated. Counting {{from one end of}} the stack, group by the number of adjacent washers in parallel. For example, in the stack of washers to the right, the grouping is 2-3-1-2, because there is a group of 2 washers in parallel, then a group of 3, then a single washer, then another group of 2.|$|E
50|$|The first V-Series {{model of}} the Cadillac family was the CTS, which was built on GM Sigma Platform like the core model. Since a V8 engine was used, it {{required}} a unique engine cradle distinct from the base CTS V6. Larger anti-roll bars and larger shocks were also added. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> was significantly increased.Right at front above the ground, GM LS engine V8 from the C5-generation Corvette Z06 was fitted and coupled—also from the C5 Z06—with a six-speed Tremec manual transmission.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{characteristics}} {{of a set of}} direct-operated relief valves used in a throat-bypass stability-bleed system designed for the YF- 12 aircraft inlet are described. A comparison of data taken before and after the windtunnel tests (at room temperature) showed that both <b>the</b> effective <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>the</b> piston friction had decreased during the wind tunnel tests. In neither <b>the</b> effective <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> nor <b>the</b> piston friction was the magnitude of change great enough to cause significant impairment of overall system effectiveness. No major valve mechanical problems were encountered in any of the tests. During high temperature bench tests, piston frictional drag increased. The friction returned to its initial room temperature value when the stability-bleed valve was disassembled and reassembled. The problem might be solved by using a different material for the piston sleeve bearing and the piston rings...|$|R

50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in the unfurling fronds and the hatched larvae feed on the trichomes in the groove of the rachis, causing the frond to curl inwards.

50|$|As {{with all}} shock {{absorbers}} it usually {{consists of two}} parts: a spring, and a damper. The spring may be implemented with a steel or titanium coil, compressed air, or even an elastomer. Different spring materials have different spring rates which have a fundamental effect {{on the characteristics of}} the fork as a whole. Coil-sprung forks keep an approximately constant ("linear") spring rate throughout their travel. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> of air-sprung forks however increases with travel, making them progressive. Titanium coils are much lighter but much more expensive. Air-sprung forks are generally lighter still.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} {{engine size}} was originally 948 cc {{as used in}} the Morris Minor and Austin A35. However, Leonard Lord, chairman of BMC thought that the 90 mi/h km/h top speed was excessive and thus reduced the engine size to 848 cc to gain a more manageable speed (for the time) of 72 mi/h km/h. Issigonis' suspension featured the use of rubber cones as springs: <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> of rubber changes with compression, allowing the suspension to adapt to passenger load variations (a full passenger load could actually double the tiny vehicle's gross weight). A conventional suspension would have required an increase in height to the design. This unique design was adapted from Issigonis's home-built racer and built for the Mini by Alex Moulton.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} CTS-V {{is based on}} the same rear-wheel-drive GM Sigma platform as is the base model CTS. The use of a V8 engine required a unique engine cradle distinct from the base CTS V6. Larger anti-roll bars and larger shocks were also added. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> was significantly increased. The 2006-2007 update also included a stronger rear differential and half shaft design. Unique front and rear treatments also included mesh grilles over the front openings, a track-ready suspension, and 18×8.5 inch wheels inside of P245/45R18 Z-rated Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar run-flat tires. Brakes were 13.97 in rotors in the front, with 14.37 in rotors in the rear - each with four-piston Brembo calipers on the front and rear wheels. In addition, GM badges were added on 2006 models. For performance enthusiasts, a high performance suspension package (RPO FG2) was available as a dealer installed option.|$|E
2500|$|The 2004 model S2000 {{underwent}} several significant changes. Production {{moved to}} Suzuka. The new model introduced [...] wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tires {{along with a}} retuned suspension to reduce oversteer. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and shock absorber damping were altered and the suspension geometry modified to improve stability by reducing toe-in changes under cornering loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve a high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass synchronizers were replaced with carbon fiber. In addition, cosmetic changes {{were made to the}} exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new LED tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhausts. Although all the cosmetic, suspension and most drivetrain upgrades were included on the Japanese, Australian and European S2000s, they retained the 2.0l F20C engines and remained designated as AP1s.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of three-year (2000 - 2003) experiments to determine the effect of the date of sulfur application (fall + spring or <b>spring</b> only) and <b>the</b> fertilizer rate (0, 30, 60, 90 kg⋅ha- 1) on the usability of winter rape seeds. The pre-sowing and <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> of sulfur as well as the rate applied entirely in <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> did not lead to significant variations in crude fat concentrations, but a clear tendency towards an increase in the total protein content was observed in rape seeds. A one-way increase was reported to the level of 60 kg S⋅ha- 1. An increase in the sulfur rate (regardless of the date of application) to 90 kg⋅ha- 1 raised the concentrations of alkene glucosinolates, mainly gluconapin and progoitrin, and – to a les-ser degree – of indole glucosinolates, mainly 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, in rape seed cv. Lisek. The splitting of the total sulfur rate into two <b>rates</b> (fall + <b>spring)</b> caused a higher increase in the concentrations of gluconapin, progoitrin and 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin than a single <b>rate</b> application in <b>the</b> <b>spring...</b>|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from March 14, 2017 - March 14, 2019 Baja SAE is an international design competition in which students build an off-road style racecar to compete with other universities around the country. The vehicle faces many adverse challenges during the competition such as series of repeated bumps (whoops), jumps, and obstacles such as rocks and logs. To combat these environmental disturbances, shock absorbers are fitted to each corner of the vehicle to dampen and absorb these inputs as well as maintain traction. This study utilized a half-car dynamic model {{in order to create}} a ride simulation of the Baja vehicle that could be used to optimize the suspension for the desired response. The main objective was to minimize the pitch response of the vehicle during cyclic input by varying <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> of <b>the</b> vehicle. The study concluded that by reducing <b>the</b> rear main <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> from 225 lb/in to 175 lb/in, the pitching response of the vehicle would be reduced during cyclic input. This was quantified by testing the vehicle with the standard and optimum spring set up on a cyclic test track with a 96 inch wavelength and a 6 inch peak-to-trough amplitude. It was determined that the optimum 175 lb/in rear main spring reduced pitching of the vehicle by 3. 81...|$|R
5000|$|The air {{suspension}} designs from Land Rover, SsangYong, Chrysler, Subaru, Audi, Volkswagen, Tesla, Porsche, and Lexus models feature height adjustable suspension {{controlled by the}} driver, suitable for {{making it easier to}} enter the vehicle, clear bumps, or clear rough terrain. The Lincoln Continental and Mark VIII also featured an {{air suspension}} system in which the driver could choose how sporty or comfortable they wanted the suspension to feel. Porsche has taken this to the next level on the Panamera with a system that changes <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> and damping settings, among other changes, for their sport/track modes. The Mark VIII suspension settings were also linked to the memory seat system, meaning that the car would automatically adjust the suspension to individual drivers. The control system in the Mark VIII lowered the suspension by about 25 mm (1 inch) at speeds exceeding about 100 km/h (60 mph) for improved aerodynamic performance. One way automakers strive to improve gas mileage is by utilizing active suspension technology. Tesla Motors offers an optional [...] "Active Air Suspension" [...] on the Model S to lower the vehicle for aerodynamics and increased range.|$|E
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} (air shock with adjustable damping control) and frame (square-section steel tube type) were direct carryovers from the [...] "F" [...] model, but the front suspension featured Honda's anti-dive system named [...] "TRAC" [...] which stood for [...] "Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control". This system utilized the left brake hangar being {{pinned to the}} fork on the bottom mount and allowed to pivot in an anti-clockwise direction, thereby closing a valve in the left fork leg, forcing the damping fluid through a smaller passageway, and increasing the damping rate under hard braking. The left fork leg had a screw-type adjuster with four positions of adjustment which would change the amount of influence this system had under braking. The fork also featured a Schrader-type air valve which allowed air assistance from 0-6 psi to increase <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> in the fork. The right fork leg featured a 3 position hand adjustable dial which would increase damping rates. The fork also featured quick-release, swing-away axle clamps for faster tire changes in endurance racing. Many of these features were seen as very exotic for the time, and modern adjustable sportbike suspension can trace design roots to these features.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{types of}} springs {{are commonly used}} for automobile suspension, variable rate springs and linear rate springs. When a load is applied to a linear rate spring the spring compresses an amount directly proportional to the load applied. This type of spring is commonly used in road racing applications when ride quality is not a concern. A linear spring will behave the same at all times. This provides predictable handling characteristics during high speed cornering, acceleration and braking. Variable springs have low initial springs rates. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> gradually increases as it is compressed. In simple terms the spring becomes stiffer as it is compressed. The ends of the spring are wound tighter to produce a lower spring rate. When driving this cushions small road imperfections improving ride quality. However once the spring is compressed {{to a certain point}} the spring is not wound as tight providing a higher (stiffer) spring rate. This prevents excessive suspension compression and prevents dangerous body roll, which could lead to a roll over. Variable rate springs are used in cars designed for comfort as well as off road racing vehicles. In off road racing they allow a vehicle to absorb the violent shock from a jump effectively as well as absorb small bumps along the off road terrain effectively.|$|E
