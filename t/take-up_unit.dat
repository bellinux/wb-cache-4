40|$|A Rutherford cabling {{machine is}} {{operated}} in the superconducting laboratory in building 163. The machine {{was used for}} the production of the Nb-Ti cables in the LHC magnets. Today, it is operated for the assembly of the high-performance cables, made from state-of-the-art Nb 3 Sn conductor, for the LHC High Luminosity Upgrade. Key elements of the machine are of a precision Turkshead equipped with a variable power drive, a caterpillar, a dimensional control bench, a data acquisition system, and a <b>take-up</b> <b>unit.</b> The video shows the production of a long length Rutherford cable, made from 40 Nb 3 Sn strands, that will be use in a 11 T LHC High Luminosity dipole magnet. The wiring machine is the only one left in Europe able to do such a job...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cusp catastrophe {{model for the}} Hong Kong housing market, to explain discontinuous change in housing prices. The paper begins by describing the significance of applying the catastrophe model {{to the analysis of}} discontinuous changes in housing prices. The study focuses on the housing price systems effects of equilibrium price level, interaction between housing supply and demand, and vacant units. Lagged supply makes housing price fall due to decreasing in demand for housing. The validity of applying a catastrophe model to housing price analysis is examined by testing yearly data from Hong Kong. The analysis result shows that the ratio of vacant and the equilibrium <b>take-up</b> <b>units</b> can be used for examining discontinuous change in housing prices...|$|R
