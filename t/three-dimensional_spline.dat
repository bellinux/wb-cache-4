The <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>spline</b> approximation of the magnetic field is proposed. This allows one to use high-accuracy numerical methods to evaluate the trajectory of the moving charged particle in inhomogeneous magnetic field. On the base of multidimensional approximation the fast algorithms for the description of equations of motion solution and its derivatives with respect to initial data are proposed. The application of the considered methods for ALICE experiment are demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{frictional}} contact behaviour of spline couplings {{is a complex}} topic due to the multiaxial, three-dimensional nature of the shaft and tooth loadings, which typically include torque, axial loads and bending moments, {{as well as local}} tooth interaction, such as tooth sliding and bending. Three-dimensional finite element modelling is the most readily available solution. However, this is time-consuming, with respect to both model development and run-times, for spline designers, who require the ability to explore the parametric design space rapidly. This paper presents parametric two-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses of spline couplings of the aeroengine type to investigate the effects of changes in spline geometry on key fretting-related and fatigue variables, such as contact pressure, slip and sub-surface stresses. Two-dimensional finite element models were used to assess the effects of the number of teeth, tooth thickness, shaft diameter and coefficient of friction. The <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>spline</b> analyses were employed to verify the trends predicted by the two-dimensional models...|$|E
40|$|NoIn this paper, a new <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>spline</b> finite strip method (spline FSM) is introduced. This {{is done by}} {{combining}} the classical spline finite strip method [1] and the state space approach. According to the traditional spline FSM, a laminated plate is divided into strips. Within each strip, the spline FSM calls {{for the use of}} simple polynomials and a continuously differentiable spline function, respectively, in the transverse and in-plane directions. In the through-thickness direction, the state space method is used to compute the distribution of displacements and stresses. The combination of the in-plane spline FSM and the out-of-plane state space formulations results in a global state space equation that is solved numerically by the precise time step integration method [2, 3]. Apart from obtaining a three-dimensional solution, the new method has a unique feature that the final algebra equation system is independent of the number of material layers of a laminate. The main aim of this work is to establish the new solution procedure and validate the method. To this end, the work reported in the paper focus on laminated plates with arbitrary boundary conditions. Thus, the spline FSM is more flexible than the FSM in imposing boundary conditions. Future development is expected to extend the solution to more practical applications. From the numerical validation included, it can be seen clearly that the newly developed method can provide accurate three dimensional solutions for laminated composites, particularly, with continuous transverse stress distributions across material interfaces. This is normally difficult to obtain if a traditional three dimensional finite element is used, where only continuity of displacements across material boundaries are guaranteed. Apart from the above new feature, the new three-dimensional formulation always ends up with a global matrix whose dimension depends only on the number of strips and knots that a plate has been divided into, and is completely independent of the number of material layers of the plate...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the formulation of}} a three-dimensional highway alignment optimization model. The coordinates of the highway is parametrized by using a <b>three-dimensional</b> cubic <b>spline</b> polynomial interpolation. The solution is obtained by locating the optimal horizontal and vertical alignments simultaneously while subject {{to a wide range}} of possible constraints. These constraints may be bounds on the slope or curvature, as well as avoidance of inaccessible region. It is an extension from a previous research work where optimal vertical highway alignment was determined for a preselected horizontal alignment. Two numerical examples based upon the actual ground conditions in Singapore are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. Some computational details such as scaling and selection of initial variables which affect the rate of convergence are also briefly discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{begin by}} {{examining}} the maximum extent of posterior leaflet opening relative to the mitral annulus. To view this, in each sample frame we performed a translation to place Marker # 22 at the origin, perform 2 rotations to place Marker # 18 on the x-axis, then performed a final rotation to place anterior commissure Marker # 16 into the x-y plane. This placed the mitral annulus into the x-y plane (to very close approximation) at each sample time. We then view the resulting mitral valve geometry along the z-axis, looking from the left atrium toward the left ventricle. Appendix E provides frame-by-frame animations showing the geometry of the mitral valve as described by <b>three-dimensional</b> cubic <b>splines</b> passing through connected marker locations during a representative beat (from maximum LVP in one beat to maximum LVP in the following beat) for the hearts studied in this fashion...|$|R
40|$|An exact quantum Monte Carlo (EQMC) {{method was}} used to {{calculate}} the potential energy surface (PES) for the ground electronic state of H 3 over a grid of about 76000 nuclear geometries. The absolute abinitio statistical or sampling error of the calculation was ± 0. 01 kcal mol^- 1 for energies (V) smaller than 3 eV. This PES was fitted by a <b>three-dimensional</b> cubic <b>spline</b> method and the fitting accuracy was determined from a set of 3684 randomly selected nuclear geometries not used in the fitting. For the range V 3 eV the rms fitting error was ± 0. 010 kcal mol^- 1, and the absolute value of the corresponding maximum error was 0. 018 kcal mol^- 1. This fitted EQMC PES is an order of magnitude more accurate than the best PES previously obtained for this system.

While the OSC method is an efficient approach for solving Poisson, Helmholtz, and other separable PDE problems, it poses serious challenges for parallel architectures {{because of its}} high communication to computation ratio: O(N 3) data movement to O(N 3 log N) computation. Furthermore, the communication pattern {{is one of the}} most expensive: personalized allto -all.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of an initial in-situ stress field determined by inversion, we describe a modi fied initial in-situ stress inversion method that uses partial least-squares regression based on FLAC 3 D. First, each stress component is regressed to improve the fitting accuracy of locally abnormal stress regions, and then the relationship between element stress and unbalanced node force is analyzed according to the computational principles of FLAC 3 D. The initial in-situ stresses obtained from these regression calculations are added to a numerical model, and the unbalanced node forces are recalculated. An external force equal to the recalculated unbalanced node force is then exerted on the node in the direction opposing the original unbalanced node force to satisfy the equilibrium condition. For the in-situ stresses of elements that do not satisfy the strength conditions, they are modi fied by assuming the average stress is constant and reducing the partial stress to satisfy the equilibrium and strength conditions, which also resolves the unreasonable distribution of the boundary nodal forces and results in good regression estimates. A <b>three-dimensional</b> hypersurface <b>spline</b> interpolation method is developed to calculate the in-situ stress tensor at arbitrary coordinates. Finally, we apply this method to an underground engineering project, {{and the results are}} shown to agree well with those obtained from field monitoring. Therefore, it is concluded that this modified in-situ stress inversion method could effectively improve the fitting accuracy of locally abnormal stress regions...|$|R
40|$|We {{deal with}} the problem of {{efficiently}} estimating a three-dimensional curve and its derivatives, starting from a discrete and noisy observation of the curve. This problem is now arising in many applicative contexts, thanks to the advent of devices that provide three-dimensional images and measures, such as three-dimensional scanners in medical diagnostics. Our research, in particular, stems from the need for accurate estimation of the curvature of an artery, from image reconstructions of three-dimensional angiographies. This need has emerged within the AneuRisk project, a scientific endeavour which aims to investigate the role of vessel morphology, blood fluid dynamics and biomechanical properties of the vascular wall, on the pathogenesis of cerebral aneurysms. We develop a regression technique that exploits free-knot splines in a novel setting, to estimate three-dimensional curves and their derivatives. We thoroughly compare this technique with a classical regression method, local polynomial smoothing, showing that <b>three-dimensional</b> free-knot regression <b>splines</b> yield more accurate and efficient estimates.

40|$|Adding {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) -derived information to standard transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images for guiding prostate biopsy is of substantial clinical interest. A tumor visible on MR {{images can be}} projected on ultrasound (US) by using MR-US registration. A common approach is to use surface-based registration. The authors hypothesize that biomechanical modeling will better control deformation inside the prostate than a regular nonrigid surface-based registration method. The authors developed a novel method by extending a nonrigid surface-based registration algorithm with biomechanical finite element (FE) modeling to better predict internal deformations of the prostate. Data were collected from ten patients and the MR and TRUS images were rigidly registered to anatomically align prostate orientations. The prostate was manually segmented in both images and corresponding surface meshes were generated. Next, a tetrahedral volume mesh was generated from the MR image. Prostate deformations due to the TRUS probe were simulated using the surface displacements as the boundary condition. A <b>three-dimensional</b> thin-plate <b>spline</b> deformation field was calculated by registering the mesh vertices. The target registration errors (TREs) of 35 reference landmarks determined by surface and volume mesh registrations were compared. The median TRE of a surface-based registration with biomechanical regularization was 2. 76 (0. 81 - 7. 96) mm. This was significantly different than the median TRE of 3. 47 (1. 05 - 7. 80) mm for regular surface-based registration without biomechanical regularization. Biomechanical FE modeling {{has the potential to}} improve the accuracy of multimodal prostate registration when comparing it to a regular nonrigid surface-based registration algorithm and can help to improve the effectiveness of MR guided TRUS biopsy procedures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the construction and}} use of conforming discretizations based on B-splines that allow electromagnetic scattering simulations to be performed using the electric field integral equation [1]. Using this approach, models generated by computer-aided design software can be used directly for performing electromagnetic scattering simulations {{paving the way for}} future integrated design and analysis software for electromagnetic scattering. The conforming B-spline discretisation can be considered an extension of Raviart-Thomas elements [2] that are known to satisfy the De-Rham sequence [3] and ensure correct convergence in the setting of electromagnetics. We illustrate how conforming B-splines are constructed on a <b>three-dimensional</b> surface through <b>splines</b> of mixed degree and transformations based on surface quantities. The ability of the approach to enforce either normal or tangential continuity between elements is demonstrated. To verify the approach, surface conforming B-splines are used {{in the context of the}} electric field integral equation through a Galerkin formulation (method of moments) in which no geometrical error is incurred.

40|$|We {{present an}} ab initio {{potential}} energy surface for the ground electronic state of ozone. It is global, i. e., it covers the three identical C 2 v (open) minima, the D 3 h (ring) minimum, {{as well as}} the O(3 P) +O 2 (3 Σ g -) dissociation threshold. The electronic structure calculations are performed at the multireference configuration interaction level with complete active space self-consistent-field reference functions and correlation consistent polarized quadruple zeta atomic basis functions. Two of the O-O bond distances, R 1 and R 2, and the O-O-O bending angle are varied on a regular grid (ca. 5000 points with R 1 ≥ R 2). An analytical representation is obtained by a <b>three-dimensional</b> cubic <b>spline.</b> The calculated potential energy surface has a tiny dissociation barrier and a shallow van der Waals minimum in the exit channel. The ring minimum is separated from the three open minima by a high potential barrier and therefore presumably does not influence the low-temperature kinetics. The dissociation energy is reproduced up to 90 % of the experimental value. All bound states of nonrotating ozone up to more than 99 % of the dissociation energy are calculated using the filter diagonalization technique and employing Jacobi coordinates. The three lowest transition energies for 16 O 3 are 1101. 9 cm - 1 (1103. 14 cm - 1), 698. 5 cm - 1 (700. 93 cm - 1), and 1043. 9 cm - 1 (1042. 14 cm - 1) for the symmetric stretch, the bending, and the antisymmetric stretch modes, respectively; the numbers in parentheses are the experimental values. The root-mean-square error for all measured transition energies for 16 O 3 is only 5 cm - 1. The comparison is equally favorable for all other isotopomers, for which experimental frequencies are available. The assignment is made in terms of normal modes, despite the observation that with increasing energy an increasing number of states acquires local-mode character. At energies close to the threshold a large fraction of states is still unambiguously assignable, particularly those of the overtone progressions. This is in accord with the existence of stable classical periodic orbits up to very high energies. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|The {{descriptive}} {{vector graphics}} language Asymptote {{provides for the}} typesetting of mathematical figures a capability anal-ogous to what TEX provides for typesetting equations. Labels are typeset with TEX, for professional quality and overall document consistency, and the simplex linear programming method is used to solve overall size constraint issues between fixed-sized and scalable objects. Asymptote’s three-dimensional generalization of the spline interpolation algorithms of Hobby (Discrete and Computational Geometry 1, 1986) is shape invariant under three-dimensional affine transformations and reduces in the planar case to Hobby’s prescription. By using recursive refinement to add additional Bézier control points, one can then efficiently approximate a perspective-invariant nonuniform rational B-spline. Copyright line will be provided by the publisher The descriptive graphics language Asymptote 1 generates native Postscript and PDF output, the portable standard format used for professional printing. Asymptote was inspired by Hobby’s MetaPost (a modified version of MetaFont, the program that Knuth wrote to produce the TEX fonts), but features a more elegant C++-like syntax, high-order functions, and robust floating-point numerics. Asymptote also generalizes to three dimensions Hobby’s two-dimensional algorithms for drawing an aesthetically pleasing, numerically efficient interpolating spline, given a set of nodes and optional tangent directions [1]. Unfortunately, Postscript and PDF support only Bézier splines, which are invariant under orthographic (affine) but not perspective projection. Since non-uniform rational B-splines, which are invariant under perspective projection, cannot be reduced to Bézier splines without loss, the error introduced by using <b>three-dimensional</b> cubic Bézier <b>splines</b> for perspective drawings must be examined. In any dimension, applying an affine transformation x′i = Aijxj + Ci to a cubic Bézier curve x(t) = ∑ 3 k= 0 Bk(t) Pk for t ∈ [0, 1], where Bk(t) is the kth cubic Bernstein polynomial yields the Bézier curve x′i(t) ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} oneself {{with the}} rendering of huge three-dimensional data sets. The target thereby {{is the development}} of fast algorithms by also applying recent and accurate volume reconstruction models to obtain at most artifact-free data visualizations. In part I a comprehensive overview {{on the state of the}} art in volume rendering is given. Part II is devoted to the recently developed trivariate (linear,) quadratic and cubic spline models defined on symmetric tetrahedral partitions directly obtained by slicing volumetric partitions of a <b>three-dimensional</b> domain. This <b>spline</b> models define piecewise polynomials of total degree (one,) two and three with respect to a tetrahedron, i. e. the local splines have the lowest possible total degree and are adequate for efficient and accurate volume visualization. The following part III depicts in a step by step manner a fast software-based rendering algorithm, called shear-warp. This algorithm is prominent for its ability to generate projections of volume data at real time. It attains the high rendering speed by using elaborate data structures and extensive pre-computation, but at the expense of data redundancy and visual quality of the finally obtained rendering results. However, to circumvent these disadvantages a further development is specified, where new techniques and sophisticated data structures allow combining the fast shear-warp with the accurate ray-casting approach. This strategy and the new data structures not only grant a unification of the benefits of both methods, they even easily admit for adjustments to trade-off between rendering speed and precision. With this further development also the 3 -fold data redundancy known from the original shear-warp approach is removed, allowing the rendering of even larger three-dimensional data sets more quickly. Additionally, real trivariate data reconstruction models, as discussed in part II, are applied together with the new ideas to onward the precision of the new volume rendering method, which also lead to a one order of magnitude faster algorithm compared to traditional approaches using similar reconstruction models. In part IV, a hierarchy-based rendering method is developed which utilizes a wavelet decomposition of the volume data, an octree structure to represent the sparse data set, the splines from part II and a new shear-warp visualization algorithm similar to that presented in part III. This thesis is concluded by the results centralized in part V...|$|R
