40|$|From the Sun's {{location}} in the Galactic disk, one can use different <b>arm</b> <b>tracers</b> (CO, H I, thermal or ionized or relativistic electrons, masers, cold and hot dust, etc.) to locate a tangent to each spiral arm in the disk of the Milky Way. We present a master catalog of the astronomically observed tangents to the Galaxy's spiral arms, using different <b>arm</b> <b>tracers</b> from the literature. Some <b>arm</b> <b>tracers</b> can have slightly divergent results from several papers, so a mean value is taken - see the Appendix for CO, H II, and masers. The catalog of means currently consists of 63 mean tracer entries, spread over many arms (Carina, Crux-Centaurus, Norma, Perseus origin, near 3 kpc, Scutum, Sagittarius), stemming from 107 original <b>arm</b> <b>tracer</b> entries. Additionally, we updated and revised a previous statistical analysis of the angular offset and linear separation from the mid-arm for each different mean <b>arm</b> <b>tracer.</b> Given enough <b>arm</b> <b>tracers,</b> and summing and averaging over all four spiral arms, one could determine if <b>arm</b> <b>tracers</b> have separate and parallel lanes in the Milky Way. This statistical analysis allows a cross-cut of a Galactic spiral arm to be made, confirming a recent discovery of a linear separation between <b>arm</b> <b>tracers.</b> Here, from the mid-arm's CO to the inner edge's hot dust, the arm halfwidth is about 340 pc; doubling would yield a full arm width of 680 pc. We briefly compare these observations with the predictions of many spiral arm theories, notably the density wave theory. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|From the Sun's {{location}} in the Galactic disk, different <b>arm</b> <b>tracers</b> (CO, H I, hot dust, etc.) have been employed to locate a tangent to each spiral arm. Using all various and different observed spiral <b>arm</b> <b>tracers</b> (as published elsewhere), we embark on a new goal, namely the statistical analysis of these published data (data mining) to statistically compute the mean location of each spiral <b>arm</b> <b>tracer.</b> We show for a typical arm cross-cut, a separation of 400 pc between the mid-arm and the dust lane (at the inner edge of the arm, toward the Galactic center). Are some arms major and others minor? Separating arms into two sets, as suggested by some, we find the same arm widths between the two sets. Our interpretation is {{that we live in}} a multiple (four-arm) spiral (logarithmic) pattern (around a pitch angle of 120) for the stars and gas in the Milky Way, with a sizable interarm separation (around 3 kpc) at the Sun's location and the same arm width for each arm (near 400 pc from mid-arm to dust lane). 9 2014.

40|$|Here, we fitted a four-arm {{spiral model}} to the more {{accurate}} data on global arm pitch angle and arm longitude tangents to get {{the start of each}} spiral arm near the galactic nucleus. We find that the tangent to the "start of the Sagittarius" spiral arm (arm middle) is at l = 2 ̆ 212170 1 00. 5, while the tangent to the "start of the Norma" spiral arm (arm middle) is at l = + 200 1 00. 5. Earlier, we published a compilation of observations and analysis of the tangent to each spiral <b>arm</b> <b>tracer</b> from longitudes + 230 to + 3400; in this paper we cover the <b>arm</b> <b>tracers</b> in the remaining longitudes + 340 (= 2 ̆ 212200) to + 230. Our model arm tangents are confirmed through the recent observed masers data (at the arm's inner edge). Observed <b>arm</b> <b>tracers</b> in the inner Galaxy show an offset from the mid arm; this was also found elsewhere in the Milky Way disk. In addition, we collated the observed tangents to the so-called 3 kpc arm features; statistically they are found to be near l = 2 ̆ 212180 1 20 and near l = + 210 1 20, after excluding misidentified spiral arms. We find that the model-computed arm tangents in the inner Galaxy are spatially coincident with the mean longitude of the observed tangents to the 3 kpc arm features (same galactic longitudes, within the errors). These spatial similarities may be suggestive of a contiguous space. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

Recent statistical results point to Rsun = 8. 0 +- 0. 2 kpc, Vlsr= 230 +- 3 km/s, and angular rotation at the Sun (ω) near 29 +- 1 km/s/kpc for the gas and stars at the Local Standard of Rest, and near 23 +- 2 km/s/kpc for the spiral pattern itself.

40|$|The Local {{arm of the}} Milky Way, a short spiral feature {{near the}} Sun whose {{existence}} is known for decades, was recently observed in detail with different tracers. Many efforts have been dedicated to elaborate plausible hypotheses concerning {{the origin of the}} main spiral arms of the Galaxy; however, up to now, no specific mechanism for the origin of the Local arm was proposed. Here we explain, for the first time, the Local arm as an outcome of the spiral corotation resonance, which traps <b>arm</b> <b>tracers</b> and the Sun inside it. We show that the majority of maser sources belonging to the Local arm, together with the Sun, evolve inside the corotation resonance, never crossing the main spiral arms but instead oscillating in the region between them. This peculiar behavior of the Sun could have numerous consequences {{to our understanding of the}} local kinematics of stars, the Galactic Habitable Zone, and the Solar System evolution.

40|$|Background: a non-randomised phase II study {{suggested}} a therapeutic effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on arm lymphoedema following adjuvant radiotherapy for early breast cancer, justifying further investigation in a randomised trial. Methods: fifty-eight patients with ? 15 % increase in arm volume after supraclavicular ± axillary radiotherapy (axillary surgery in 52 / 58 patients) were randomised in a 2 : 1 ratio to HBO (n = 38) or to best standard care (n = 20). The HBO group breathed 100 % oxygen at 2. 4 atmospheres absolute for 100 min on 30 occasions over 6 weeks. Primary endpoint was ipsilateral limb volume {{expressed as a}} percentage of contralateral limb volume. Secondary endpoints included fractional removal rate of radioisotopic <b>tracer</b> from the <b>arm,</b> extracellular water content, patient self-assessments and UK SF- 36 Health Survey Questionnaire. Findings: of 53 / 58 (91. 4 %) patients with baseline assessments, 46 had 12 -month assessments (86. 8 %). Median volume of ipsilateral limb (relative to contralateral) at baseline was 133. 5 % (IQR 126. 0 – 152. 3 %) in the control group, and 135. 5 % (IQR 126. 5 – 146. 0 %) in the treatment group. Twelve months after baseline the median (IQR) volume of the ipsilateral limb was 131. 2 % (IQR 122. 7 – 151. 5 %) in the control group and 133. 5 % (IQR 122. 3 – 144. 9 %) in the treatment group.

40|$|The spiral {{structure}} of the Milky Way is nowadays receiving renewed attention thanks to the combined efforts of observational campaigns in different wavelength regimes, from the optical to the radio. We start in the paper the exploration {{of a number of}} key sectors in the inner Milky Way, where the spiral structure is still poorly known. We search for density enhancements of young stars that might plausibly be associated with spiral structure. To this aim we collect sufficiently wide-field UBVI photometry.

40|$|Spiral {{arms are}} the {{hallmark}} of spiral galaxies. Spiral density waves gather gas, dust, and stars in the disks of spiral galaxies, forming the arms. Observations show that these large-scale features are often composed of smaller scale substructures, {{commonly referred to as}} feathers and spurs, which give the arm a patchy and segmented appearance. Within these select galaxies, the substructure appears associated with much of the star formation in the arm. In this thesis, we study the frequency and characteristics of spiral arm substructure in a sample of 233 spiral galaxies; using newly acquired high-resolution (&sim 4 ”) CARMA CO(1 - 0) velocity-integrated intensity maps of five target spiral galaxies, we compare the distribution of star formation <b>tracers</b> along spiral <b>arms</b> and test formation theories for spiral arm substructure. We use a multi-wavelength data set to study the frequency and characteristics of spiral arm feathers and test the predictions for their formation. Using broadband HST images, we study how common feathers are in our sample of 233 spiral galaxies. With high-resolution CARMA CO(1 - 0) observations of five target galaxies previously known to have feathers, we study the distribution of the molecular gas relative to the location of neutral gas and star formation tracers. We measure the spacing between the feathers and use the CO(1 - 0) observations to estimate the molecular gaseous surface density along the spiral arms. We find that feathering substructure is not limited to late type, grand design spiral galaxies and is detected in a range of galaxy types, from early to late type, and spiral arm environments, including barred, ringed, and flocculent. In our target sample, we find that feathers are more than mere extinction features and are associated with a significant amount of the star-forming gas. We further find a relationship between the spacing of feathers and the gaseous surface density along spiral arms, which suggests these features form via a gravitational instability...|$|R
40|$|We study star {{formation}} {{processes in the}} disc of the weakly barred grand design spiral galaxy M 100 (NGC 4321) {{from a variety of}} images tracing recent massive {{star formation}}, old and young stars, dust, and neutral hydrogen. Differences between arm and interarm regions are specifically studied by decomposing the images into arm and non-arm zones. We find from a comparison of the morphology in H, Hi and dust that while the first two are coincident over most of the disc, they are offset from the dust lanes especially along the inner parts of the spiral arms: a picture which is indicative of a density wave shock moving through the arms. Hi is formed near the young massive stars as a result of photo-dissociation. From radial profiles we find that in the region of the star-forming spiral arms the exponential scale lengths for H, blue and near-infrared light, and 21 cm radio continuum are equal within the fitting errors. The scale lengths for the interarm region are also equal for all these <b>tracers,</b> but the <b>arm</b> scale lengths are significantly longer. This points to a common origin of the profiles in star formation, with little or no influence from radial population gradients or dust in the disc of this galaxy. The longer arm scale lengths are equivalent to an outwardly increasing arm-interarm contrast. We argue that the radial profiles of radio continuum and Hi, as well as CO, are also directly regulated by star formation, and discuss the possible implications of this result for the interpretation of observed CO intensities in and outside spiral arms. We discuss the radial atomic hydrogen profile in some detail. Its almost perfectly flat shape in the region of the star-forming spiral arms may be explained by photodissociation and recombination processes {{in the presence of a}} limited quantity of interstellar dust, controlling the equilibrium between the molecular and atomic form of hydrogen. Over most of the inner part of the disc, Hi seems to be a product of the star formation processes, rather than the cause of enhanced star formation...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 74 - 76). A numerical, three-dimensional coastal ocean model was ics. used to study the circulation and subsequent mixing of Cobscook Bay by the lunar semi-diurnal tide. The results showed strong ebbing and flooding currents along a main channel connected to the open boundary and a pair of counter rotating eddies that form {{as a result of the}} complex topography and coastal morphology. The eddy pair begins to form with the flooding tide and is persistent in the residual velocity Geld. Hourly simulations that tracked particle position, calculated by interpolating the velocities of the surrounding grid cells to the point where a particle was located, were used to estimate residence times in the bay. Residence times for individual particles varied with initial position and time of release. Few particles released from the arms of the bay escaped from the bay, regardless of release time, during the eight lunar day simulation. Regions close to the open boundary had a large fraction of particles escape and consequentially short residence times. It was not unusual for neighboring particles to follow divergent pathways that effectively become unpredictable. A tidal-residual residence time map was constructed as an average over 12 consecutive hourly maps. The tidal-averaged residence time for neutral surface particles A tidal-residual residence time map was constructed as an average over 12 consecutive hourly maps. The tidal-averaged residence time for neutral surface particles varied from less than one day in the main channel of the outer bay to more than eight days in the inner extremities of the arms of the bay. A conservative tracer was used that followed the some three-dimensional advection-diffusion equation as salinity. Continuous source points and sources that were active for only one lunar day were used to study the flushing of the bay. Mixing was strongest in regions with the highest residual velocities and was localized in regions with small residual velocities. Concentrations in the arms increased as each tidal cycle introduced more of the <b>tracer</b> into the <b>arms</b> of the bay without removing a significant portion of the existing water. The flooding tide, combined with the eddy pair, causes material to primarily accumulate in a southern arm of the bay...|$|R
40|$|Context. The spiral {{structure}} of the Milky Way is nowadays receiving renewed attention thanks to the combined efforts of observational campaigns in different wavelength regimes from the optical to the radio. Aims: We start in the paper exploration of several key sectors (line of sights) in the inner Milky Way, where the spiral structure is still poorly known. Methods: We searched for density enhancements of young stars that might plausibly be associated with spiral structure. To this aim we collected sufficiently wide-field UBVI photometry {{to allow us to}} probe in a statistical sense the distribution in reddening and distance of young stars in the field. Although heavily demanding in terms of observational efforts, the intensive usage of U-band photometry ensures robust determination of reddening, hence distance for stars with earlier than A 0 spectral type, which are well-known spiral <b>arm</b> <b>tracers,</b> even though no spectroscopic information are available. The fields we use are large enough to include in most cases well-studied Galactic clusters, which we use as benchmarks to assess the quality and standardization of the data and to validate our method. Results: We focus on the line of sight to the Galactic longitude l = 314 °, where previous surveys have already detected Hα emitters at different standard-of-rest velocities, hence distances. The difficulty, however, to translate velocity into distance make predictions on the spiral structure quite vague. First of all, we made exhaustive tests to show that our dataset is in the standard system, and calibrated our method using the two open clusters NGC 5617 and Pismis 19, which happen to be in the field and for which we found estimates of the basic parameters in full agreement with the literature.

These distances are compatible with the location of the nowadays commonly accepted description of the Carina-Sagittarius and Scutum-Crux arms, at heliocentric distance of 2 an 5 kpc, respectively. As a consequence, we consider these groups to be good candidates for tracing the location of these two inner arms.
