25|$|According to Alastair Macaulay (formerly chief dance {{critic of}} The Times Literary Supplement and chief theatre {{critic of the}} Financial <b>Times,</b> <b>now</b> chief dance critic for The New York Times), the Ondine myth {{is said to be}} an image of psycho-sexual distress: the nymph is a forlorn image of {{repressed}} virginity, anxious that she will never achieve womanly fulfillment, while her feminine nemesis that leads her husband astray represents the confident seductive power that threatens her hopes. The story is double-edged: the human protagonist, in loving the nymph, transgresses against his own kind and may be punished. If, having betrayed her once, he returns to her, her kiss will bring him death; in fact, it may be this love-in-death that the man desires most.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{economic}} {{reforms in the}} 1990s, satellite television channels from around the world—BBC, CNN, CNBC, and other private television channels gained {{a foothold in the}} country. There are no regulations to control the ownership of satellite dish antennas and also for operating cable television systems in India, which in turn has helped for an impressive growth in the viewership. The {{growth in the number of}} satellite channels was triggered by corporate business houses such as Star TV group and Zee TV. Initially restricted to music and entertainment channels, viewership grew, giving rise to several channels in regional languages, especially Hindi. The main news channels available were CNN and BBC World. In the late 1990s, many current affairs and news channels sprouted, becoming immensely popular because of the alternative viewpoint they offered compared to Doordarshan. Some of the notable ones are Aaj Tak (run by the India Today group) and STAR News, CNN-IBN, <b>Times</b> <b>Now,</b> initially run by the NDTV group and their lead anchor, Prannoy Roy (NDTV now has its own channels, NDTV 24x7, NDTV Profit and NDTV India). Over the years, Doordarshan services also have grown from a single national channel to six national and eleven regional channels. Nonetheless, it has lost the leadership in market, though it underwent many phases of modernisation in order to contain tough competition from private channels.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton on his newer tyres {{was rapidly}} gaining on Alonso and Vettel {{at the front}} at over a second a lap. As the race entered the latter stages, the tyres of Alonso and Vettel began to totally wear out, and their lap <b>times</b> <b>now</b> dropped by 3 seconds a lap. Hamilton passed Vettel on lap 62, and Alonso two laps later to take the lead, but the tyres of the latter two were so worn that they were {{vulnerable}} {{to the rest of}} the field. Vettel decided to stop for new tyres on lap 64 and rejoined fifth behind Grosjean and Pérez, who had broken away from the battle between Rosberg, Webber and Räikkönen. Alonso decided to stay out on his totally worn tyres and was passed by Grosjean on lap 66, Pérez one lap later, and a charging Vettel on the penultmate lap. Lewis Hamilton had no trouble reeling off the last 6 laps once he had taken the lead and became the 7th different winner in 7 races. Grosjean and Sergio Pérez achieved their 2nd career podium finishes as they finished second and third respectively. Vettel recovered to 4th, only 2 seconds behind Pérez at the flag. A frustrated Alonso dropped to 5th ahead of Rosberg who had an up and down race finishing 6th, fending off Webber and Räikkönen. Kamui Kobayashi finished a respectable 9th place in the other Sauber with Massa getting the final point in 10th.|$|E

500|$|The three best-known small theropods of the Morrison Formation [...] Coelurus, Ornitholestes, and Tanycolagreus [...] were {{generalized}} coelurosaurs, {{and they}} have been mistaken for each other at various <b>times.</b> <b>Now</b> that Coelurus and Ornitholestes have been more fully described, it is possible to distinguish them by various characteristics of their anatomy. For example, they had visibly different proportions: Coelurus had a longer back and neck than Ornitholestes, and longer, more slender legs and feet. Coelurus and Tanycolagreus are more similar, but differ in a variety of details. Such details include the shape of the upper arm, forearm, and thigh bones; the location of muscle attachments on the thigh bone, proportionally longer back vertebrae; and, again, the very long metatarsus of Coelurus.|$|E

These articles were published {{during a period of}} intense lobbying in Pennsylvania to organize an independent Lackawanna County and designate the city of Scranton as its county seat. (The new county was chartered by October 1878.) Stanton had been sitting judge in 1877 and was arrested for libel in the Scranton case after being implicated by witnesses; he was alleged to have written an [...] "incendiary" [...] piece in the Advocate, [...] "calculated to incite the killing of Mr. Scranton".|$|E
500|$|Below the kasbah was an area {{later called}} the Villa Vieja (...) by the Spanish, {{accessed}} via the Bab el-Granada (...) , and below {{that was a}} port area called La Barcina by the Spanish, which may have taken {{its name from the}} Galley House (...) built there by the Moors. It had three separate access gates: the Land Gate (now the Landport Gate), the Sea Gate (now the Grand Casemates Gates) and a southern gate, the Barcina Gate. The core of the city was surrounded by substantial defensive walls with tall towers topped by merlons. Other than the Tower of Homage, two such towers still survive; one square based which was fitted with a clock in Victorian <b>times</b> (<b>now</b> the Stanley Clock Tower) and another constructed en bec (beaked, a design intended to resist mining). The walls were at first built using tapia, a lime-based mortar made with the local sand and faced with decorative brickwork to simulate masonry. The builders later changed their construction methods to utilise stone interlaced with brick, a rather stronger structure. The southern flank of the walls has survived relatively intact, and vestiges of the other walls are most likely still to be found underlying the modern defensive walls constructed by the British. To the south of the fortified city was an urban area known as the Turba al Hamra, literally the [...] "red sands", named after the predominant colouration of the soil in that area. Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1353–54 and wrote: ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} provinces in Sri Lanka since the 19th century, {{but they had}} no legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the 1978 {{constitution}} established provincial councils after several decades of increasing demand for a decentralisation of the Government of Sri Lanka. Each provincial council is an autonomous body not under the authority of any Ministry. Some of its functions had been undertaken by central government ministries, departments, corporations, and statutory authorities, but authority over land and police is not as a rule given to provincial councils. Between 1989 and 2006, the Northern and Eastern provinces were temporarily merged to form the North-East Province. Prior to 1987, all administrative tasks for the provinces were handled by a district-based civil service which had been in place since colonial <b>times.</b> <b>Now</b> each province is administered by a directly elected provincial council: ...|$|E
