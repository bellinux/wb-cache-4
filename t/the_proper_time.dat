5|$|Synchronous {{spawning}} is very typical on {{the coral}} reef, and often, even when multiple species are present, all corals spawn {{on the same}} night. This synchrony is essential so male and female gametes can meet. Corals rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>time</b> to release gametes into the water. The cues involve temperature change, lunar cycle, day length, and possibly chemical signalling. Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation. The immediate cue is most often sunset, which cues the release. The spawning event can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually clear water with gametes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Manne began to compose his own film scores, {{such as that}} for <b>The</b> <b>Proper</b> <b>Time</b> (1959), with the music also played by his own group, Shelly Manne and His Men, and issued on a Contemporary LP. In later years, Manne divided his time playing the drums on, adding special percussive effects to, and {{sometimes}} writing complete scores for both film and television. He even provided a musical setting for a recording of the Dr. Seuss children's classic Green Eggs and Ham (1960) and later performed in and sometimes wrote music for the backgrounds of numerous animated cartoons. For example, he joined other notable jazz musicians (including Ray Brown and Jimmy Rowles) in playing Doug Goodwin's music for the cartoon series The Ant and the Aardvark (19691971). Notable examples of later scores that Manne wrote himself and also performed in are, for the movies, Young Billy Young (1969) and Trader Horn (1973), and, for television, Daktari, 19661969. With these and other contributions to cartoons, children's stories, movies, television programs (and even commercials), Manne's drumming became woven into the popular culture of several decades.|$|E

25|$|Deeper {{analysis}} is needed {{before we can}} understand why these distinctions should result in {{a difference in the}} twins' ages. Consider the spacetime diagram of Fig.2‑11. This presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. <b>The</b> <b>proper</b> <b>time</b> measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>time</b> measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B.

Cars must be maintained, as they consume fuel, which York must purchase, and accumulate damage that eventually renders them useless unless York pays for their repair. York often has a specific time frame for investigating sites and interviewing non-player characters; however, if he misses the timeslot, the player may simply try again during the next day without a penalty. Places of business and entertainment venues in Greenvale have specific hours of operation and must be visited at <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>time</b> {{to make use of}} their services. Non-player characters also have their own specific routines and travel around town as they go about their business. It also features a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle which affects the responses of the non-player characters. If York engages one at the right place and time of day, he or she may offer him a side-quest to perform for additional rewards. In addition to side-quests, trading cards are scattered throughout the town, which the player can collect while exploring. York can also participate in mini-games, such as darts, racing through checkpoints, and fishing, and may accelerate the passing of time by smoking cigarettes.|$|E
