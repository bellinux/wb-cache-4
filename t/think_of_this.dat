25|$|While {{referred}} to as social group work (Papell & Rothman,1966), Schwartz p{{referred to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> model as social work with groups (Schwartz, 1976). Schwartz (1976) regarded this approach as resonant {{with the demands of}} a variety of group types including, natural and formed; therapeutic and task; open and closed; and voluntary and mandatory. Schwartz (1961, 1964) initially thought of this approach as an organic systems model (as he viewed the group as an organic whole) later to refer to it as the mediating model and then the interactionist model (Schwartz, 1977). The model initially proposed by Schwartz has been further developed most notably by Lawrence Shulman and Alex Gitterman, who have since referred to this model as the Mutual Aid Model (Gitterman, 2004, 2005; Shulman, 1979, 1992, 1999, 2005b).|$|E

500|$|In December 1987, as news {{began to}} {{circulate}} about the commissioned work, local Assyrians accused Parhad of misrepresenting Ashurbanipal. Criticisms included {{the depiction of}} the king holding both a book and a lion, which they argued he [...] "wouldn't do", and for dressing him in a skirt, which they claimed {{he would never have}} worn. The critics thought the statue made a better portrayal of the Sumerian king Gilgamesh. One critic said: It's very simple. The statue represents Gilgamesh.... No Assyrian has a right to imagine things about our king. It's exactly like making a copy of the Statue of Liberty and saying it is George Washington.... Assyrian kings didn't wear miniskirts. They wouldn't have been holding a lion or a book. It's an insult to the Assyrians. Narsai David responded: They are entitled to their opinion.... We have never said this is a museum-quality reproduction.... We have always said this is a characterization of Ashurbanipal as done by a 20th-century artist. If they choose to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> as Gilgamesh, they are free to do so.|$|E
500|$|As he was {{developing}} the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching {{experience at the}} Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges.

They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays." [...] It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, [...] "something that was fantastic but believable." [...] He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> <b>This</b> led him to the sponge: [...] "I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one." [...] In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone, including Bob the Sponge.|$|E

500|$|Martin Olson, one of {{the writers}} for Rocko's Modern Life, read The Intertidal Zone and {{encouraged}} Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he ever did, {{this would be the}} best approach. He began to further develop some of the characters from The Intertidal Zone, including the comic's [...] "announcer", Bob the Sponge. He wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time, which he felt were exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show. As a result, Hillenburg decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> <b>This</b> led him to the sponge. The Intertidal Zones Bob the Sponge resembles an actual sea sponge, and at first Hillenburg continued to utilize this design. In determining the new character's personality, Hillenburg drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, and Pee-wee Herman. He then considered modeling the character after a kitchen sponge and realized that this idea would perfectly match the character's square personality.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Warren Truitt of About.com described the album as Cyrus' attempt to gradually capture a more mature audience by sharing the album with artists like the Rascal Flatts and Swift. Truitt also made musical comparisons to Shania Twain in [...] "Dream", Kelly Clarkson in [...] "Don't Walk Away", Avril Lavigne in [...] "The Good Life", and Gwen Stefani in [...] "Spotlight" [...] and [...] "Let's Get Crazy". Heather Phares of Allmusic noted {{the presence of}} many drastically different genres makes the album [...] "a little weird". She stated that Cyrus' songs which were performed as herself were [...] "the best songs", and also compared Cyrus to Twain. Phares also noted that Swift's [...] "Crazier" [...] was [...] "the best song on Hannah Montana: The Movie". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "the distance between tween and twang isn't actually all that far; <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> [...] {{as a sort of}} country-lite starter kit for her legion of young Disney-fed fans". In the end, she said Hannah Montana: The Movie was [...] "the Miley show — whether it broadcasts from Nashville or Hollywood", despite appearances by other artists.|$|E
500|$|In October 1839, Ralph Waldo Emerson {{was seeking}} an editor for his transcendentalist journal The Dial. After several {{declined}} the position, he {{offered it to}} Fuller, referring to her as [...] "my vivacious friend." [...] Emerson had met Fuller in Cambridge in 1835; of that meeting, he admitted [...] "she made me laugh more than I liked." [...] The next summer, Fuller spent two weeks at Emerson's home in Concord. Fuller accepted Emerson's offer to edit The Dial on October 20, 1839, and began work {{in the first week}} of 1840. She edited the journal for its first two years from 1840 to 1842, though her promised annual salary of $200 was never paid. Because of her role, she was soon recognized as one of the most important figures of the transcendental movement and was invited to George Ripley's Brook Farm, a communal experiment. Fuller never officially joined the community but was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year's Eve there. In the summer of 1843, she traveled to Chicago, Milwaukee, Niagara Falls, and Buffalo, New York; while there, she interacted with several Native Americans, including members of the Ottawa and the Chippewa tribes. She reported her experiences in a book called Summer on the Lakes, which she completed writing on her 34th birthday in 1844. The critic Evert Augustus Duyckinck called it [...] "the only genuine book, I can <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>this</b> season." [...] Fuller used the library at Harvard College to do research on the Great Lakes region, and became the first woman allowed to use Harvard's library.|$|E

500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E
