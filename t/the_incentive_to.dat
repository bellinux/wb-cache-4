5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines <b>the</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> invest {{irrespective}} {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high. He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E

He has also criticized the American legal system, opining {{that it provides}} lawyers and vexatious litigators <b>the</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are {{necessary in order to}} provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} affects <b>the</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> ratify international environmental agreements (IEAs). In particular, we study the effects of two aspects on <b>the</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> join a coalition. First, we analyze cross-country differences in adaptation costs. Second, we investigate the role of carbon leakage. We find that <b>the</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> join IEAs remain unchanged with cross-country differences in adaptation when there is no carbon leakage, while these cross-country differences may strengthen <b>the</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> join IEAs with leakages. Our results emphasize that policies directed at reducing cost differences and carbon leakage may also affect the success and failure of IEAs. PublishedN/...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> use 100% {{renewable}} energy for electricity, transport, or even {{total primary energy}} supply globally, has been motivated by global warming and other ecological {{as well as economic}} concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of {{renewable energy}} technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply.|$|E

The team finished with a 3–13 record, winning once against the University of Florida and twice against Centre College. When Harry Gamage was named the new head coach of the university's football squad, he had Hayden replaced with John Mauer. The team would not have another losing season until 1988–89 under Eddie Sutton.|$|E
5|$|Although the Offaly revolt was {{followed}} by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir Antony St Leger, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, who would remain into the post past Henry's death. Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere fiefdom to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the Kingdom of Ireland free from the Papal overlordship. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. <b>The</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's. The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.|$|E

40|$|A formal {{economic}} {{analysis of the}} discarding problem is presented, {{focusing on the individual}} fisherman and the effect of different regulations on <b>the</b> fisherman's <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> discard. It is shown that in a nonregulated fishery, either multispecies or single species/multisize, where the only constraints are the hold capacity and the length of the season, the fisherman may have rational <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> discard/highgrade, if <b>the</b> marginal trip profit of an extra fishing day is greater than the average trip profit.

The analysis suggests that regulation of fishing days could be a promising alternative to usual suggested measures like tax/subsidies and landings obligations.
