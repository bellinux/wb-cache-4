The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} Moon race there were years of near quietude but {{starting}} in the 1990s, many more countries have become involved in direct exploration of the Moon. In 1990, Japan became the third country to place a spacecraft into lunar orbit with its Hiten spacecraft. The spacecraft released a smaller probe, Hagoromo, in lunar orbit, but the transmitter failed, preventing further scientific use of the mission. In 1994, the U.S. sent the joint Defense Department/NASA spacecraft Clementine to lunar orbit. This mission obtained the first near-global topographic map of the Moon, and the first global multispectral images of <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> surface. This was followed in 1998 by <b>the</b> <b>Lunar</b> Prospector mission, whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> poles, {{which is likely to}} have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters.|$|E

As Apollo 16 was the penultimate mission in the Apollo program and there was no new hardware or procedures to test on <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> surface, the last two missions (the other being Apollo 17) presented opportunities for astronauts to clear up some uncertainties in understanding the Moon's properties. Although previous Apollo expeditions, including Apollo 14 and Apollo 15, obtained samples of pre-mare lunar material, before lava began to upwell from the Moon's interior and flood the low areas and basins, none had actually visited <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> highlands.|$|E

5|$|Faget's {{preliminary}} Apollo design {{employed a}} cone-shaped command module, supported {{by one of}} several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions.

The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, <b>the</b> <b>Lunar</b> Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> surface and return them to the CSM.|$|E

5|$|The CSM {{for this}} flight, number 012 built by North American Aviation (NAA), was a Block I version {{designed}} before <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> orbit rendezvous landing strategy was chosen; therefore it lacked capability of docking with <b>the</b> <b>Lunar</b> Module.

Block II would be test-flown with the LM when the latter was ready, and would be used on the Moon landing flights.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the Moon {{in the sky}} varies with <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> phase and the season of the year. The full moon is highest during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the ascending node of <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> orbit is in the vernal equinox, <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> declination can {{go as far as}} 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site: close to the equator, an observer can see a smile-shaped crescent moon.|$|E
