5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Glover, Lord and Paice, {{who wanted}} {{him in the}} fold for the band's 25th anniversary tour, Gillan rejoined Deep Purple in 1992 to record the album The Battle Rages On. Gillan was unhappy with working on the album, as {{it had already been}} {{partially}} completed with Joe Lynn Turner, and he was only required to write replacement lyrics and vocal melodies, which, unsurprisingly, drew criticism from Blackmore.|$|E
5|$|Roman Polanski's 1971 {{film version}} of Macbeth {{contained}} many parallels to his personal life in its graphic and violent depictions. His wife Sharon Tate had been murdered two years earlier by Charles Manson and three women. Many critics saw this as a clear parallel to Macbeth's murders at <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> the Three Witches within the film.|$|E

6000|$|... "Take {{what you}} call love, for example. In the real way of love, the {{positive}} aim {{is to make the}} other person--or persons--happy. It devotes itself to the other or to others. But change the mode. Let <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> be <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>of</b> power. Then <b>the</b> great desire is not happiness, neither of the beloved nor of oneself. Happiness {{is only one of many}} states, and it is horrible to think of fixing us down to one state. <b>The</b> <b>urge</b> <b>of</b> power does not seek for happiness any more than for any other state. It urges from within, darkly, for the displacing of the old leaves, the inception of the new. It is powerful and self-central, not seeking its centre outside, in some God or some beloved, but acting indomitably from within itself.|$|R
5|$|Thatcher {{had been}} firmly opposed to British {{membership}} of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a precursor to European monetary union, believing that it would constrain the British economy, despite <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> both her Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, but she was persuaded by John Major to join in October 1990, at what proved to be too high a rate.|$|E

At <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> her daughter, Turner underwent radiation therapy to treat the cancer, and in February 1993, announced {{that she was in}} remission. Despite treatment, the cancer returned in July 1994. In September 1994, she made her final public appearance at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in Spain to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award, and was bound to a wheelchair for much of the event. Turner died nine months later at the age of 74 on June 29, 1995, of complications from the cancer at her home in Century City, Los Angeles, California. Her remains were cremated and scattered in Oahu, Hawaii.|$|E

50|$|Mestizo shamans {{adhere to}} a similar {{restrictive}} diet {{in preparation for the}} consumption of ayahuasca before shamanic rituals.

In 1998 Light House {{was sold to}} Riverhead Books, an imprint of Penguin Putnam, and Warner Bros. immediately optioned the film rights while the novel was still in manuscript. Penguin Putnam wanted to delay publishing the novel in order to release it concurrent with the anticipated film release. Warner Bros. hired Monahan to write the screenplay adaptation of Light House.|$|E
5|$|All {{efforts to}} extend the church beyond Kent {{encountered}} difficulties due to the attitude of King Rædwald of East Anglia, who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht's death. Rædwald was converted before the death of Æthelberht, perhaps at <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Æthelberht, but his kingdom was not, and Rædwald seems to have converted {{only to the extent}} of placing a Christian altar in his pagan temple. It proved impossible for Mellitus to return to London as bishop, although Justus did resume his duties at Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Although Philip {{considered}} Attalus' {{escape a}} bitter defeat, {{it proved to}} be the turning point of the war. Attalus was forced to return to Pergamon, when he learned at Opus that, perhaps at <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Philip, Prusias I, king of Bithynia and related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Sulpicius returned to Aegina. Free from the pressure of the combined Roman and Pergamene fleets, Philip was able to resume the offensive against the Aetolians.

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Cicero, the Senate {{inducted}} Octavian {{as senator}} on 1 January 43BC, yet {{he also was}} given the power to vote alongside the former consuls. In addition, Octavian was granted propraetor imperium (commanding power) which legalized his command of troops, sending him to relieve the siege along with Hirtius and Pansa (the consuls for 43BC). In April 43BC, Antony's forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, forcing Antony to retreat to Transalpine Gaul. Both consuls were killed, however, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.|$|E

Washington running back Elmer Tesreau was given the game's Ironman Award, though he had little effect on the game. Against <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> his coaches, Tesreau had played with boils completely covering one knee.
