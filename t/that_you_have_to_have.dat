"Web Weirdos" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story {{developed}} by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Dick Grunert. According to Ward, the original outline for the episode was [...] "super-sitcomy" [...] and [...] "standard". Castuera and Moynihan, however, {{were able to}} transform it into something different. In the DVD commentory for the episode, Castuera noted that she enjoys physical comedy, whereas Moynihan likes focusing on emotion. She contended that this episode is therefore epitomic of their differing storyboarding sensibilities. For instance, {{the first half of}} the episode (storyboarded by Castuera) begins with Finn and Jake partaking in parkour, whereas the second part of the episode (storyboarded by Moynihan) focuses more on Barb and Ed's relationship. According to Moynihan, much of his storyboard material was inspired by experiences he had had at couples therapy with a former girlfriend. He noted that for him, the episode was based on the idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> empathy for your partner.|$|E
500|$|The team {{colors are}} red, black and white, {{and they can}} be seen on both the home and road jerseys. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until the NHL swapped home and road colors in 2003, is dominantly red in color.

The road jersey (the team's former home jersey) is white in color with a similar design, except that the three stripes are black and red. The {{shoulders}} are draped with black on both uniforms. Before the 1992–93 season, the uniforms were green and red with slightly different striping, leading some fans to affectionately refer to them as [...] "Christmas colors."

5000|$|I {{really do}} not believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen Phantom of the Opera to {{understand}} Love Never Dies. I really don’t. But I hope if you see them together, {{if you wanted to}} see them back-to-back, that what you would get from them - from both of them - is the extension of where the story goes. Andrew Lloyd Webber Andrew Lloyd Webber first began plans for a sequel to his 1986 hit musical, The Phantom of the Opera, in 1990. Following a conversation with Maria Björnson, the designer of The Phantom of the Opera, Lloyd Webber decided that, were a sequel to come about, it would be set in New York City {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. One of his ideas was to have the Phantom live above ground in Manhattan's first penthouse, but he rejected this when he saw a TV documentary about the Coney Island fairground. Lloyd Webber began collaborating with author Frederick Forsyth on the project, but it soon fell apart as Lloyd Webber felt the ideas they were developing would be difficult to adapt for a stage musical. Forsyth went on to publish some of the ideas he had worked on with Lloyd Webber in 1999 as a novel entitled The Phantom of Manhattan.|$|E

5000|$|Performed {{towards the}} end of Act Two, the song springs from Elphaba's rage over her {{continuously}} thwarted efforts to do good and her inner turmoil about her intention for doing so. It explores the ideas of goodness and wickedness, which are central to the musical's theme. In the song she lists what she perceives as her failures at goodness, including anger with herself over Fiyero—her lover who is being concurrently tortured by the Wizard's guards over her whereabouts—the death of her sister, and the capture and dehumanisation of her favorite teacher, Dr. Dillamond. It occurs while Elphaba believes that Galinda has used her sister's death to lure her into being captured by the Wizard's Guard. She is distraught at being vilified by the Wizard's propaganda and the hatred of the citizens of Oz, and decides she will no longer attempt to do good. The song begins with Elphaba screaming [...] "Fiyero" [...] but instead of being an unhitched scream, she actually sings a high note that is a minor second above the tonal centre of the song. This creates the effect of a scream, as the note is very high and dissonant, but it is much more controlled and musical than an actual scream. It then moves into a chant of magical words making it the most chilling and foreboding of all the musical's numbers. Schwartz is quoted as likening No Good Deed to an opera aria. He says, [...] "It’s just written for a different voice type, and it’s not written to be sung amplified. So those are the two big differences. I mean, “No Good Deed” is written for a belter—I suppose a mezzo-soprano could sing it. But the orchestra is so busy and obstreperous throughout <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an amplified voice to carry over it, if you want to hear the words at all. But for instance there’s a moment in “No Good Deed” where she belts a big note and then there’s a place where it suddenly gets pianissimo — she has to hit the note very loud and hold it, and then get very soft — and that’s absolutely like something one would write in classical singing or an opera aria. Or the moment where she does “Nessa, Dr. Dillamond,” and then sort of shouts out “Fiyero” while the orchestra is sawing away at one of the motifs. I think it’s structured very much like an aria but it’s built to get a great big hand at the end with a big belted last note. So it’s still very much musical theatre." ...|$|E
40|$|I can {{confidently}} {{say that}} the biggest lesson I’ve learned in Grad school has been finding my voice, figuratively and literally; figuring out what I want to say as an Artist, a Woman and a Latina, and most importantly developing the technique to properly harness that power. Working on Beatrice in “The Venetian Twins” allowed me {{to put it all}} into play: The movement work. In heels and a tight dress, I managed to make big physical choices, movements that seemed wild but where specific to forwarding the story; running, jumping, climbing, fighting… and I kept it safe and fearless. The voice work. It was my first time working at the Weiss, to fill a 500 Seat Theater was a challenge, finding the right pitch and power for my voice to cut through was imperative. I’ve learned that the need to be heard is most important, it’s about going after what you want so intensely <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> clarity of utterance. This woman is desperately fighting to get what she wants: her man, her freedom, and her power. I learned to be truthful in extreme physicality.
