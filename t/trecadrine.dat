40|$|Objective: Leptin, {{a hormone}} {{produced}} in adipocytes, {{is a key}} signal in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. beta-Adrenergic agonists {{have been shown to}} inhibit leptin gene expression and leptin secretion. The mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of beta-adrenergic agonists have not been established. In this study, we examined the effects of TrecadrineÒ, a novel beta 3 -adrenergic agonist, on basal and insulin-stimulated leptin secretion in isolated rat adipocytes. Because insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism is an important regulator of leptin expression and secretion by the adipocytes, the effects of <b>Trecadrine</b> on indices of adipocyte metabolism were also examined. Measurements: Isolated adipocytes were incubated with <b>Trecadrine</b> (10 - 8 - 10 - 4 M) in the absence or presence of insulin (1. 6 nM). Leptin secretion, glucose utilization, lactate production, glucose incorporation into CO 2 and triglyceride, as well as lipolysis (glycerol release) were determined. Results: <b>Trecadrine</b> induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of basal leptin secretion. <b>Trecadrine</b> also decreased insulin-stimulated leptin secretion; however, the effect was not as pronounced as in the absence of insulin. Treatment of adipocytes with <b>Trecadrine</b> increased basal glucose utilization and produced a further increase in insulin-stimulated glucose utilization. Basal lactate production was also increased by Trecadrine; however, the proportion (percentage) of glucose carbon released as lactate was unaffected. In the presence of insulin, absolute lactate production was unaffected by <b>Trecadrine</b> at 96 h. However, the percentage of glucose carbon released as lactate was significantly decreased by insulin treatment, and was further decreased by the co-treatment with <b>Trecadrine.</b> <b>Trecadrine</b> induced a dose-dependent increase of the absolute amount of glucose incorporated into triglyceride. However, the percentage of glucose utilized that was incorporated into triglyceride was unaffected by <b>Trecadrine.</b> <b>Trecadrine</b> did not modify the proportion of glucose utilized that was oxidized to CO 2. <b>Trecadrine</b> increased glycerol release after 96 h of treatment. Glycerol release was negatively correlated with leptin secretion. Conclusions: These results suggest that alterations of glucose metabolism are not directly involved in the effects of beta 3 -adrenergic agonists to inhibit leptin expression and secretion. The inverse relationship between leptin secretion and the increase of glycerol levels, which is an index of the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases, suggests that activation of the cAMP signaling pathway mediates the inhibitory effects of <b>Trecadrine</b> on leptin gene expression and secretion...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} {{trial was}} devised {{to assess whether}} selective β 3 -adrenergic receptor (AR) stimulation and simultaneous blockade of α 2 -AR would affect thermoregulation. With this purpose, the individual and combined administration of a β 3 -AR agonist, <b>trecadrine,</b> and an α 2 -AR antagonist, yohimbine, were evaluated. Yohimbine produced a marked decrease (p < 0. 001) in body temperature one hour after administration (5 mg kg− 1, i. p.) and blocked the thermogenic effect of <b>trecadrine</b> (1 mg kg− 1, i. p.) when simultaneously administered. Uncoupling protein- 2 expression in skeletal muscle was downregulated (p < 0. 05) by <b>trecadrine,</b> while yohimbine had no effect. White adipose tissue UCP 2 and muscle UCP 3 were not modified by either <b>trecadrine</b> or yohimbine administration. Liver UCP 2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased by yohimbine (p < 0. 05). However, this downregulation {{does not seem to}} explain the reduction in temperature produced by yohimbine given the fact that <b>trecadrine</b> produced a similar downregulation of hepatic UCP 2 (p < 0. 05). The present work indicates that α 2 -AR antagonism blocks the thermogenic effects mediated by β 3 -AR stimulation, contrary to our expectations, suggesting a possible interplay between both mechanisms. Moreover, these effects are not apparently explained by changes in UCP 2 and UCP 3...|$|E
40|$|Beta-adrenergic {{agonists}} {{have been}} shown to elicit powerful hypoglycemic effects when administered to different animal models of diabetes. However, the intimate mechanism involved in this process remains unclear. In this context, treatment of alloxan-induced diabetic rats with the beta 3 -adrenergic agonist <b>Trecadrine</b> (1 mg x kg(- 1) x day(- 1), s. c.) for four days, normalized glycemia with no changes in plasma insulin levels. Liver glucokinase, a key enzyme in the regulation of glucose storage in hepatocytes, whose gene expression is significantly decreased in alloxan-diabetic rodents, showed a recovery in its mRNA levels after <b>Trecadrine</b> administration. These data suggest that beta 3 -adrenergic agonists enhance glucose storage in liver, probably through a non-insulin dependent mechanism of action...|$|E
40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator- 1 (PGC- 1) {{is highly}} {{expressed}} in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and {{plays an important}} role in adaptive thermogenesis. The aim of this study was to assess the acute effect of a β 3 -adrenergic agonist (<b>Trecadrine)</b> and leptin on the expression of PGC- 1 and PPARγ 2 mRNA in BAT. <b>Trecadrine</b> produced a marked increase (4. 5 -fold) in PGC- 1 mRNA compared to controls (P< 0. 001) without changes in PPARγ 2 mRNA, whereas leptin administration did not alter either PGC- 1 or PPARγ 2 expression. These results show that selective stimulation of the β 3 -adrenoceptor rapidly upregulates the expression of PGC- 1 in brown adipocytes without a concomitant increase in PPARγ 2. Moreover, our results show that PGC- 1 and PPARγ 2 expression in BAT seems not to be acutely regulated by leptin...|$|E
