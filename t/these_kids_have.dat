[...] However, she did not argue the results publicly. Her former coach, Bela Károlyi, noted, [...] "This kid had the honesty and decency to shut up. She didn’t want to say 'I’m better' because she knows Shushunova is the Olympic champion, but she couldn’t praise a rival.

He has dealt with many problems in his life, from Terry's criminal behavior, to Martin's own depression, to his four year coma, to his mother poisoning him while she went mad from fear of her terminal cancer. Martin clearly remembers telling his brother that the two criminal kids, whom Terry would later join, are cheating. <b>These</b> <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> been beating Martin up, {{and he knows that}} telling Terry this lie would make him go after them. Terry does go after the bullies, and they stab him in the leg. This injury cripples Terry for life and renders him incapable of playing sports.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{people were}} sceptical about mass citizen {{training}} in CPR; indeed, many felt {{the potential for}} harm was too great to allow such a procedure {{in the hands of}} laypersons. The skeptics also had the support of national medical organizations. The alarmist voices were stilled by some fortunate saves. Cobb recalled one resuscitation soon after the citizen training program began. [...] "In March 1973 there were <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> playing golf at Jackson Park. They came across a victim {{a quarter of a mile}} from the clubhouse." [...] The man was unconscious and not breathing; later it was confirmed that he was in ventricular fibrillation.

Shortly they came with the aid car and Medic 1 screaming over the fairways." [...] Cobb concluded, [...] "They got him started up again. He survived; he's alive today [...] That was a very convincing story. I didn't mind it being written up in the Reader's Digest." ...|$|R

Nivek Ogre, the group's vocalist and songwriter, said of the suicides: [...] It seemed very scary to me that all <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> such a bleak prospect on their future. I was on the tail-end of the generation that grew up with Walt Disney and Fantasia and Bambi and all those things that were so beautiful and important to grow up with.

"I {{actually}} {{sympathize with}} a lot of the soldiers, and the military in general, that are trained to go out and protect for us, and what they have to go through, it's really kind of shitty in a sense that <b>these</b> young <b>kids</b> <b>have</b> to go over there and die, sometimes, for something that isn't our problem.

2500|$|In 1998, the Chicago police accused {{a seven-year-old}} boy, {{along with his}} eight-year-old friend, of the murder and sexual assault of an 11-year-old girl, Ryan Harris. The boys were exonerated after DNA {{evidence}} established that neither boy could have committed the crimes. In 2005, Taylor and his law colleagues Jan Susler and Stainthorp obtained a multi-million-dollar settlement for the seven-year-old defendant.

5000|$|Cyndi Gibson - One of Tiffany's best friends. Rather {{than having}} a best friend, all <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> seem to <b>have</b> groups of best friends.

50|$|Another future {{art world}} fixture that Brown met {{as a young}} man was Walter Hopps who would go on to become the curator at the Pasadena Museum of Art and then the Menil Collection in Houston as well as many other positions. The two met at UCLA when Hopps was on the GI Bill. “I thought <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> who <b>had</b> been in the Army, I thought they knew everything. I was 17-18 years old, they were in their 20s. I thought they really knew what the hell was going on,” Brown said. Via a {{psychiatric}} clinic associated with UCLA, Brown, Moses and Hopps all became male attendants to a schizophrenic young woman who Hopps recalled liked to be taken to Disneyland in Anaheim. Brown continued working in the mental health area for the next few years.|$|R
50|$|Marvel {{editor-in-chief}} Axel Alonso {{also suggested}} a possible future crossover between Ultimate Comics: Ultimates, and whatever form the Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man series takes after Death of Spider-Man. Spencer also told Newsarama that it's a liberating feeling {{to be writing}} an X-Men comic {{in a world where}} Cyclops, Wolverine, Professor Charles Xavier, and Magneto are all dead. I think it's what makes it more exciting. These kids are living in a world where the legends are dead. This is more than just 'the dream is dead,' this is, 'both sides of the argument are dead.' That is just so much more fascinating. To me, what was really intriguing to me about where they were now is just in that. <b>These</b> <b>kids</b> <b>have</b> heard both sides, and seen both sides fail miserably. A lot of X-books have been built around that idea, that we're just one step away from everything going to Hell, and in the Ultimate Universe, that's happened. We're there. It's too late to put the genie back in the bottle. This relationship between humans and mutants is not going to repair itself.|$|E
5000|$|Joe Barton of The Skinny {{was less}} {{favourable}} however, only awarding two stars out of five. He lamented, [...] "any {{of the dozen}} tracks of Hold Me Down, despite being flawlessly executed, {{could just as easily}} have been knocked out by teen-adored Hoobastank or Taking Back Sunday. That being said, this kind of music has a rabid audience. If they’d only been a few years older, though, they would have the Arctic Monkeys to idolise... you can’t help feeling <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>have</b> been short-changed". More unfavorable reviews also followed from British newspapers; Simon Price of The Independent bemoaned, [...] "From the action-packed band name to the obligatory long song titles, from the witless blare of the vocals to the compressed blandness of the guitar sound, this is bog-standard emo ordinaire". Kitty Empire of The Observer criticized the album's lack of originality; [...] "Polished, punchy Hold Me Down is their second album, replete with bouncy dramas about loyalty, betrayal and other perils of young love. Its sole insight is contained in the song title 'There's No Such Thing As Accidental Infidelity'; not even the most fine-meshed musical sieve could unearth any originality here".|$|E
50|$|The {{pace of the}} Durham {{movement}} surprised even Moore himself. In 1960, four African-American students {{held their}} own sit-in at the Woolworth’s Department Store in neighboring Greensboro, North Carolina. At the time, Moore and McKissick had been organizing a nationwide sit-in that would begin in Durham. Originally, they felt that the Greensboro students had acted too soon. When McKissick heard about the sit-in, he exclaimed, “Oh my God, <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> <b>have</b> jumped the gun!” Nevertheless, Moore and his allies soon realized that {{the time had come}} to take action, realizing that the student activists in Durham wanted to emulate their Greensboro counterparts. Exactly one week after the Greensboro sit-in, Moore and McKissick led one of their own. They led dozens of college students into the heart of Durham, where they sat down at the lunch counters of Woolworth’s. When the manager closed the counter, the students moved on the counters at S.H. Kress and Walgreens, which were also shut down. However, the message had been sent, and by the end of the week, students in Charlotte, Raleigh, Winston-Salem, and Fayetteville had joined in the sit-in movement, frightening white store owners by dressing well and staying dignified. The Durham movement had finally begun to spread beyond the city limits.|$|E

This series was most feared by the adults as the gunge was at its thickest and adults were covered in really thick gunge, making the dunking even more memorable for the kids and viewers, some gunk dunks were much bigger and overfilled on certain occasions meaning the gunge would go everywhere when the adult was thrown in.|$|R
