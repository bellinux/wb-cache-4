Strakka Racing's entry struck the Porsche's <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> which became lodged in its right-front wheelarch but continued. Webber slowed with a punctured front-left tyre, causing him to return to the pit lane where he pushed back into his garage for ten-minute bodywork repairs. Then his front-axle energy retrieval system was changed, forcing Webber to remain in his garage for more than one hour. The second round of green flag pit stops began after 90 minutes. The No. 7 Audi and the No. 5 Toyota had cosmetic alterations to their rear-ends and the former vehicle was taken over by Fässler. The first Toyota, driven by Davidson, kept the lead after the pit stops. The first full course caution was shown when Nicki Thiim's No. 95 Aston Martin was hit by Dolan in the No. 38 G-Drive vehicle and went backwards into the Stavelot tyre barrier at a high rate of speed. His car flipped over but he was unhurt. Marshals were required to repair the damaged barrier, and removed debris from the track.|$|E

The repairs to Van der Garde's vehicle meant he was stationary in his pit stall for four minutes which allowed Merhi to inherit fifth position in the LMP2 class. Tréluyer reported to Audi that his car had no front downforce, while Buemi went off the track at Raidillon during his efforts to push hard to increase his lead over Bernhard. Buemi was held up {{by one of the}} SMP entrants and an Aston Martin at Fagnes which caused his advantage to be reduced to 1.015 seconds. The Toyota driver missed his braking point at the Bus Stop chicane and went wide at La Source shortly afterwards, causing him to lose the first position to Bernhard. Buemi reclaimed the position at Eau Rouge but temporarily fell to second again after Bernhard overtook him on the Kemmel straight and retook the place before the entry to Les Combes. At Blanchimont corner, Bernhard avoided colliding heavily with the rear-end of Buemi's car after the latter slid while lapping Gulf Racing's Porsche entry.At the start of his 37th lap Bernhard reported a front-left puncture to his pit crew after driving over debris.

40|$|Loading soil via {{pneumatic}} tyres {{is a major}} cause of compaction of agricultural soils, which causes damage to the soil-water-air-plant system. The loads applied to the soil and the resulting pressure influences the degree of soil compaction. This study was conducted to determine an effective method to measure the pressure distribution under a selection of pneumatic agricultural tyres. This was conducted initially on a non-deformable surface; a later study will consider pressures within the subsoil. From this the <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> stiffness was determined and methods to predict carcass stiffness were evaluated. <b>Tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> stiffness is defined as an equivalent pressure resulting from the stiffness of the <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass.</b> In order to estimate the carcass stiffness of tyres a number of approaches were considered including: (i) footprint area, (ii) tyre load – deflection, (iii) pressure mapping and (iv) tyre manufacturer's specification methods. Carcass stiffness values obtained from the footprint area method gave results significantly lower (30 – 40 %) than those obtained using the pressure mapping system. The method based on the tyre load – deflection characteristics was found to give a better estimation of the <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> stiffness of the smooth rather than the treaded tyre. The technique of using the tyre manufacturer's specification data, where the estimation of the <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> stiffness was calculated using the theoretical load that the tyre could support at zero inflation pressure, produced estimates that were within ± 20 % of the mean carcass stiffness determined using the pressure mapping system...|$|E
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The {{aim of the research}} described in this thesis is to assess the technical feasibility of pneumatic tyres for passenger cars which have no directional reinforcement in their <b>carcasses.</b> Conventional <b>tyres</b> are constructed from composites of twisted textile or steel cords in a rubber matrix, a process which is both labour intensive and costly. If it were possible to injection mould or cast <b>tyre</b> <b>carcasses</b> in a single operation, and if the performance of the resulting tyres matched that of modern radial ply tyres, then the implications for the tyre industry would be of major proportions. After reviewing the history of pneumatic tyres and summarising their principal attributes, the design of unreinforced or fabricless tyres is investigated and methods developed for defining their meridional profiles. Materials suitable for their carcasses and treads are then considered, prior to describing the manufacture of two series of tyres designed to have section height to width ratios, or aspect ratios, of 0. 9 and 0. 7 respectively. To facilitate experimental work, two sizes of tyres were employed: half scale models for which testing procQdures had been developed previously; and a size suitable for small saloon cars. The results obtained on a range of tyre properties are presented and analysed to give a number of empirical relationships between the properties and the design variables: carcass material Young's modulus, carcass wall thickness and the inflation pressure. For the important property of radial stiffness which affects other tyre characteristics, an improved method of analysis is developed to allow the structural and pneumatic components to be quantified. Using the relationships established experimentally, consideration is given to optimising the design of a fabricless tyre. It is concluded that to approach the performance of a conventional tyre, a design with a low aspect ratio is preferred but, to restrict growth with inflation'pressure, limited directional reinforcement must be included as a circumferential-belt beneath the tread. Nevertheless, the discussion concludes that there are fundamental reasons why even the optimised tyre would be unacceptable for use on modern passenger cars, although less demanding applications may be identified...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement {{of rubber}} by cords {{is crucial for}} many {{applications}} such as high-pressure hoses and conveyor belts. However, the largest application of cord-rubber composites is the <b>tyre.</b> The <b>carcass</b> of the <b>tyre</b> contains a network of cords that gives the tyre its strength. Not only the type of cord material that is used determines the performance, but also the way the cords are positioned in the carcass, as described in Chapter 1. Since the cords absorb most of the forces where the tyre is subjected to, a good adhesion between cord and rubber is an absolute requirement. The coating which the cords need to obtain sufficient adhesion to rubber compounds is called the Resorcinol Formaldehyde Latex (RFL) treatment. Despite the importance of good adhesion {{and the fact that}} this RFL-treatment has been widely applied since the Second World War, and no better alternative has been found till today, the mechanism by which the adhesion is obtained has remained unclear. The relatively few publications on this technique are described in Chapter 2. Most of the research described was rather empirical: the many factors involved when dipping the cords in a RFL-dip and curing it to rubber were varied and their influence on the adhesion was described. However, most of the publications lack a mechanistic approach to obtain more fundamental knowledge about this technique. With new fibre materials introduced in recent years, in particular aramid fibres, there is a renewed interest in the mechanism of adhesion of RFL-treated cords to rubber in order to utilise the properties of these high-performance fibres to their full extent in rubber compounds. In this thesis, an attempt is made to elucidate the adhesion between RFL-treated cords and rubber using a more systematic approach to obtain a mechanistic view on the chemical and physical processes involved...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} a number of factors. One of the most important factors is soil response to pressures imposed by wheels and soil engaging tools. This research investigated the effect of tyre load and inflation pressure on soil compaction-related factors. These factors include rut width, rut depth, cone index and horizontal force in different layers of soil profile. In this research a stiff <b>carcass</b> <b>tyre</b> has been used and a soil compaction profile sensor in controlled soil bin laboratory conditions. This sensor consisted of eight flaps, each equipped with strain gauges, installed on a subsoiler leg face with working depth of 45 cm. Studies were conducted using a factorial experiment at two levels of axle load of 6. 3 kN and 23. 9 kN and three levels of inflation pressure of 324 kPa, 524 kPa and 724 kPa with three replications in a randomized complete design. Duncan test and F test were applied to compare the means of pressure and axle load, respectively. The soil compaction profile sensor measured soil compaction at different layers from soil surface to 45 cm depth at 5 cm interval. The results of experiments indicated that vertical load significantly affected the horizontal force at different tyre inflation pressures on the soil profile. The tyre inflation pressure exhibited greater effects on shallow depths than those of higher depths. The amount of rut width, rut depth and cone index increased with an increase in vertical load. Increasing of the inflation pressure decreased rut width and increased rut depth and cone index...|$|R

The tyre forces of two tyres are estimated from optically measured <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> deflections and transmitted wirelessly to the vehicle body. The two remaining tyres are so-called virtual tyre sensors, the forces of which are calculated from the real tyre sensor estimates. The Kalman filter estimator for lateral vehicle state based on measured tyre forces is presented, together with a simple method to define adaptive measurement error covariance depending on the driving condition of the vehicle.

The mechanisms of heat transfer within the <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> are introduced as well as the basic tyre structure and effects of overheating on tyre operation. The tyre cooling patents are separated into five functional groups and reviews are made based on practicality and potential for significant heat transfer. This analysis has made it evident that potential cooling effectiveness is often compromised by practicality of an invention. The patents deemed to have the most potential for cooling are those which incorporate a working fluid which undergoes a phase change to transfer heat between different regions of the wheel assembly. Finally, these inventions are also related to current research projects which aim to develop a new cooling technique and extend the working life of earthmoving tyres...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the addition of}} camber to a previously published semi-empirical tyre model by the same authors. The model combines empirical models for pure braking, cornering and cambering with a model for simultaneous braking, cornering and cambering. It is based on brush-model tyre mechanics and aims to offer an easy-to-use accurate model for vehicle-handling simulations. The proposed model is a method to extract and rescale the adhesion and sliding forces from empirical pure-slip tyre models {{to account for the}} combined-slip condition. The combined-slip self-aligning torque is described likewise. Cambering affects the natural path of the <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> on the road surface and deforms the threads to produce an additional force in the lateral direction. Thereby, the proportions of the sliding and adhesive forces changes. The model is computationally sound and efficient and does not rely on any additional parameters that depend on combined-slip data for calibration. It can be used in combination with virtually any empirical pure-slip model...|$|E

The objectives of the research was to study the application of CNSL resin as substitute material for styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) in the carcass compound. CNSL was reacted with formaldehyde resulting a rubbery CNSL-formaldehyde resin. CNSL –formaldehyde resin was prepared by reaction of 100 parts of CNSL, 5 parts of a 37 % aqeaus solution of formaldehyde and 2 parts of ammonium hydroxide for 60 minutes at 1500 C.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between tyres and terrain {{is one of}} the most studied areas in the vehicle dynamics and terramechanics research communities because it is the only region where excitation forces act on the vehicle if aerodynamics is not considered. The tyre area which deforms against the ground is called the contact patch. Measuring the contact patch has been accomplished statically in the past; however, measurement while a wheel rotates has proven difficult. A number of attempts to measure carcass deformation from inside the tyre have succeeded in measuring small areas or single points but full field measurement has never been attempted. This study describes the design and testing of a system which uses stereo cameras and image correspondence to measure the deformation of the inside of the <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> in the contact region completely. The system includes a stabilisation mechanism which prevents the cameras from rotating, ensuring that the cameras view the inside of the contact region at all times. Software to capture and process the images captured is developed and tested to ensure measurement accuracy. The 3 D results produced by the software are compared to one another where possible and any trends or problems are discussed. Results indicate that the full 3 D displacement field in the contact region can be measured accurately. The information produced is expected to be extremely valuable for development and validation of tyre and vehicle dynamics models.

40|$|When {{studying}} terramechanics for wheeled vehicles it {{is important}} to understand the tyre-terrain interaction. However the tyre road interface is hidden from view by the terrain and tyre itself. This makes determining the interaction externally very difficult. Some progress has been made by embedding sensors in the terrain or the <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> however these techniques only capture a very small number of points. The problem of measuring dynamic tyre deformation at the tyre road interface from inside the tyre has been tackled in previous papers, however in this paper we seek to extend these measurements to identify the impact that rolling tyres have on the terrain. This is accomplished by measuring the undeformed soil profile in front of a tyre, the carcass deformation inside the tyre and the deformed soil profile behind the tyre. Test data was captured with the so-called Tyre–Terrain Camera System (T 2 CAM) on the Terramechanics rig at Virginia Tech using prepared sandy loam as the deformed soil material. T 2 CAM consists of three calibrated stereo camera rigs, a six-component load cell, wheel angle sensor and wheel speed sensor. Computer vision techniques are used with the images to generate full three dimensional profiles of the two soil areas and the inside surface of the tyre as captured by the cameras. The testing aims to compare undeformed soil profile with the deformed soil profile with the added information about the contact patch area and wheel forces to quantify both the plastic and elastic soil deformation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} vibrations in a single passenger car wheel to identify road fiction. The peak in the transfer function of wheel speed to brake torque variations at the lowest resonance frequency (~ 32 Hz) is strongly influenced by the 'constraint' provided by the road surface. A model of the wheel with its rotational inertia {{in contact with the}} road via the tyre is developed. The inflated <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> provides the stiffness in all directions, here mainly the rotational motion of the wheel, combined with the forward motion of the vehicle is considered. The tyre to road interaction includes the effect of saturation in the force versus brake slip characteristic. After linearization it can be proven that the local derivative of the slip characteristic has a consistent influence on the dynamic behaviour of the tyre. Where the local derivative tends to zero, the maximum achievable brake force is reached. Therefore, assessing the local derivative of the brake force versus slip curve is vital for optimal braking. The phenomenon is also studied in a laboratory environment, with a single braked wheel, running on an electrically driven steel drum of 2. 5 m diameter. Special attention is needed for the instrumentation of the wheel rotational speed. To reach the required sample rate and resolution in wheel speed information, the data-acquisition counts the duration of an encoder period. Since this wheel speed signal becomes available at encoder flanges, it needs to be resampled to create data that is synchronous with the input brake pressure and -torque and -force data, typically sampled at 512 Hz. For some conditions and road surfaces (bare steel and 'safety walk paper') both the relation between local derivative and resonance gain and the application of this relation as a friction identification methodology will be assessed...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{performance}} characteristics of wheeled vehicles highly {{rely on the}} forces/moments arising from interactions between the pneumatic tyres and the terrains. Reliable models are thus needed to estimate these forces/moments {{to be used in}} vehicle simulations for design and developments. The empirical and semi-empirical tyre models developed for vehicle dynamics simulations invariably require extensive experimental data, and may not be applicable under many practical conditions. The structural tyre models, on the other hand, are not suited for vehicle dynamics simulations due to excessive computational demands. Moreover, the tyre modeling on deformable terrains has been addressed in relatively fewer studies due to challenges associated with complex behaviors of soils under moving vehicular loads. Although the Finite Element (FE) tyre models provide accurate estimations of forces/moments on rigid surfaces, the mesh-based nature of FE models of the soils yield poor performance in modeling the soil flow beneath a rolling tyre. Alternatively, mesh-less methods such as the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) have been proposed to account for large deformations and fragmentations of the soil. This dissertation research aims at development of a virtual testing environment for analyses of rolling tyre interactions on rigid and soft terrains using the FE and SPH analysis methods. The virtual platform is used for parametrization and evaluation of the terramechanics-based models as an alternative to actual experiments. A 3 -D finite element model of a rolling truck tyre is developed using LS-DYNA to predict its dynamic responses at speeds up to 100 km/h. The model takes into account the complex multi-layered structures of the <b>tyre</b> <b>carcass</b> and belts. A customized pre-processing algorithm is developed to facilitate model reformulations for efficient parametric analyses. The validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing the predicted responses with the experimental data. The verified tyre model is subsequently employed to study the influences of various operating parameters on the tyre vertical and cornering properties. The modal properties of the rolling tyre are also analyzed under varying inflation pressure and vertical load, using the large-deformation finite element theory. The eigenvalues are extracted during an explicit dynamic simulation at instants when the tyre stresses reach steady state under a given loading condition. It is shown that some of the eigen-frequencies of a free tyre diverge into two distinct frequencies in the presence of ground contact of the rolling tyre. A computationally efficient model of the truck tyre is further formulated using the Part-Composite approach in LS-DYNA, where the layers of the rubber matrix and reinforcements are simplified by a single layer of shell elements with layered configuration. The validity of the simplified model is demonstrated through comparisons with the comprehensive tyre model {{as well as with the}} experimental data. It is shown that the proposed simplification substantially reduces the total number of elements and thereby enhances the computational efficiency. A computational soil model is developed using the FE and SPH methods in conjunction with a contact pressure-dependent material model based on the available test data. The soil model is initially validated in terms of volumetric deformation behavior using the experimental data. The relative merits and limitations of the FE and SPH analysis methods are illustrated to justify the use of the SPH soil model for parametrization of the terramechanics formulations characterizing the normal and shear behavior of soil. The effectiveness of parameters identification method is demonstrated via comparisons with reported data obtained from classical bevameter and triaxial force measurement devices. The soil model is subsequently integrated to the simplified pneumatic tyre and rigid wheel models for analyses of tyre forces developed while traversing different deformable terrains. The simulation results obtained for the rolling and steered tyre showed good agreements with the analytically estimated contact force/moment responses...|$|E
