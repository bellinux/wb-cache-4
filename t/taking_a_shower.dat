5|$|The next {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{as she tries}} to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science. After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower,</b> he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E

Angela gets a {{headache}} and, while <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower,</b> thinks that she sees images of a yellow substance running down the walls. Angela and Wallace head off to bed in one another's arms but as the camera pans out the scene shifts to their skeletal remains {{in the same position}} {{in the middle of a}} field. FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate and after closer examination of the bones, the two find a strange yellow substance covering the underside of the skeletons which was missed in the original examination. Mulder, believing that bodies are a result of the famous Brown Mountain Lights, heads out to the scene of the discovery while Scully stays behind with the coroner (Jim Beaver) to perform more tests.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} {{makes her}} debut and only appearance in 2010's Heavy Rain, developed by French studio Quantic Dream. She is introduced in her apartment, {{being unable to}} sleep. After <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> and trying to sleep once more, she notices the apartment has been broken into. The two invaders then attack, though ultimately are revealed to be a nightmare caused by Madison's poor sleeping. Madison then goes to a motel {{to try to help}} her sleep, where she meets other protagonist Ethan Mars, who has been injured after attempting the Origami Killer's first trial in order to find his son (who has been abducted by the killer). Though she doesn't know the cause, she helps him to his room and treats his wounds. Later in the game, she tends to Ethan's wounds again after he tries to complete another trial. After this, Madison helps Ethan to avoid the police who now believe him to be the Origami Killer, though whether she is successful depends on the player's actions. After they return to the motel, or after Ethan arrives having escaped the police station after being freed by another of the protagonists, FBI agent Norman Jayden, she learns why Ethan is now on the run, and that he is completing trials to find letters of the address where his son is being held.|$|E

The messages suggest, amid their rounds of laughter, that the crew has been exposed to a sudden hull breach. After the Enterprise secures the Tsiolkovsky via tractor beam, an away team beams over and finds the crew frozen to death in various stages of undress—including one who was <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> fully clothed. A woman's body, frozen, falls into Lt. La Forge's (LeVar Burton) hands. Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) orders full medical examinations of the away team on their return, and finds La Forge sweating profusely and complaining about the temperature. She orders him to stay in sickbay but he manages to escape, making his way to the quarters of Crusher's son, Wesley (Wil Wheaton). Unaware of La Forge's condition, Wesley shows him a portable tractor beam device and La Forge places an encouraging hand on his shoulder. Meanwhile, acting on a hunch by Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), who had read a book on past starships named [...] "Enterprise" [...] and found a previous mention of someone <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> fully clothed in its pages, Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) locates a historical record identifying the ailment as similar to one encountered by Captain Kirk's USS Enterprise. La Forge returns to sickbay, where Dr. Crusher quickly becomes concerned when she realizes that the infection is spread by physical contact. Much of the ship's crew comes {{under the influence of the}} ailment, including Data, who engages in a sexual encounter with Security Chief Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby). Dr. Crusher, struggling against the effects of the ailment, finds the original antidote documented by Kirk's Enterprise to be ineffective, and begins devising a new version of it.|$|E

500|$|... "Mr. Pitiful" [...] was {{recorded}} in December 1964 at the Stax studios. The song was written by both guitarist Steve Cropper and Redding, and was their first collaboration. It was inspired by and written {{as a response to}} a statement made by radio disc jockey Moohah Williams, who had nicknamed Redding [...] "Mr. Pitiful" [...] for sounding pitiful when singing ballads. Cropper heard about this and, while <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower,</b> got the idea it would make a good song. In the car {{on the way to the}} studio, Cropper proposed the idea with a melody already in mind, humming it to Redding. By the time they reached the studio, the song was written and they recorded it in two or three takes. It was released as a single with the B-side [...] "That's How Strong My Love Is". The song became a hit and the album's most successful track, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard R and at number 41 on Billboard Hot 100 chart.|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, Thompson sent {{a letter}} to several {{politicians}} urging them to investigate The Sims 2, alleging that the game contained nudity accessible by entering special codes. Thompson called the nudity inappropriate for a game rated [...] "T" [...] for Teen, a rating which indicates suitability for anyone 13 and older. Manufacturer Electronic Arts dismissed the allegations, with vice president Jeff Brown explaining that game characters have [...] "no anatomical detail" [...] under their clothes, effectively resembling Barbie dolls. Although the game does display blurred-out patches over body regions when characters are naked, such as when <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower,</b> Brown said that was for [...] "humorous effect" [...] and denied there was anything improper about the game. Nevertheless, a command that could be entered into the in-game console in order to disable the blur effect was removed from the game in an expansion. No official reason was given for the change.|$|E

30|$|Interviews {{with more}} than 100 households, policy-actors and manufacturers, plus {{historical}} studies of bathing, laundering, heating and cooling indicate that practices like those of <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> daily <b>shower</b> or of maintaining 22  °C indoors, whatever the weather, cannot be {{explained in terms of}} personal preference or individual choice. Rather, successful energy-consumption reduction is a matter of understanding how patterns of daily life evolve along with ordinary technologies and infrastructures like bathrooms, kitchens, and washing machines. Put simply, people do not use energy; they use the services it makes possible. The researchers found that the issue is one of convention and infrastructure, not of individual choice [14].|$|R
500|$|Before the 1966–67 season, Celtics coach Red Auerbach retired. Initially, he {{had wanted}} his old player Frank Ramsey as coach, but Ramsey was too {{occupied}} running his three lucrative nursing homes. His second choice Bob Cousy declined, stating {{he did not want}} to coach his former teammates, and the third choice Tom Heinsohn also said no, because he did not think he could handle the often surly Russell. However, Heinsohn proposed Russell himself as a player-coach, and when Auerbach asked his center, he said yes. On April 16, 1966 Bill Russell agreed to become head coach of the Boston Celtics followed by a public announcement two days later. Russell thus became the first African American head coach in NBA history, and commented to journalists: [...] "I wasn't offered the job because I am a Negro, I was offered it because Red figured I could do it." [...] The Celtics' championship streak ended in his first full season as head coach at eight, however, as Wilt Chamberlain's Philadelphia 76ers won a record-breaking 68 regular season games and overcame the Celtics 4–1 in the 1967 Eastern Finals. The Sixers simply outpaced the Celtics, shredding the famous Boston defense by scoring 140 points in the clinching Game 5 win. Russell acknowledged his first real loss in his career (he had been injured in 1958 when the Celtics lost the NBA Finals) by visiting Chamberlain in the locker room, shaking his hand and saying, [...] "Great". However, the game still ended on a high note for Russell. After the loss, he led his grandfather through the Celtics locker rooms, and the two saw white Celtics player John Havlicek <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> next to his black teammate Sam Jones and discussing the game. Suddenly, Jake Russell broke down crying. Asked by his grandson what was wrong, his grandfather replied how proud he was of him, being coach of an organization in which blacks and whites coexisted in harmony.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the peak}} of her career, Aunor was the top product {{endorser}} for television, print, and radio advertisements. Everybody wanted to buy everything that she endorsed. The sales of Dial bath soap, for instance, shot up after Aunor endorsed it. Originally imported from the US, Dial soap first catered the AB bracket. When it was eventually manufactured locally, it courted the CD market by making Aunor its product endorser. Aunor appeared in a television commercial of Dial soap <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> and singing, [...] "Aren’t you glad you used Dial?".

2500|$|Welch starred as {{a freedom}} fighter leader in 100 Rifles, a 1969 western {{directed}} by Tom Gries and filmed in Almeria, Spain. It also starred Jim Brown, Burt Reynolds and Fernando Lamas. The movie provoked publicity and controversy {{at the time}} because it included a love scene between Welch and Brown that breached the Hollywood taboo of on-screen miscegenation. The film is remembered for the famous and spectacular [...] "Shower Scene" [...] in which Welch distracts the soldiers on the train by <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> at a water tower along the tracks. The director, Gries, tried hard to convince Welch to do the scene naked, but she refused.

In 1969, Welch also starred in the thriller Flareup for MGM.|$|E
40|$|As {{time is a}} {{fundamental}} dimension of our existence, perceiving the flow of time is an ubiquitous experience of our everyday life. This so-called sense of time is utilized in our everyday activities, for example, when we expect some events to happen, but it also prevents us from <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> morning <b>shower</b> for too long. This ability to perceive time intervals of several seconds has been commonly explained by a pacemaker-accumulator theory positing that some brain areas create the sense of time by accumulating some sort of neural quantity produced by other brain regions that play a role of pacemaker. We investigated this theory by recording electro-magnetic signals {{of the human brain}} to answer if indeed brain tells time using accumulation of its own activity. Several neuroimaging studies presented in my thesis suggest that the process of accumulation cannot be seen as the brain’s clock. I found that accumulation-like traces observed in the brain activity reflect excitation of neuronal populations needed to prepare for an upcoming event, whereas timing ability is preserved even beyond the time when accumulation ends. As accumulation is not responsible for subjective experience of time, this thesis proposes that temporal information has to be provided by another brain process possibly, involving the cortico-striatal mechanisms relying on detection of oscillatory patterns in the cortex or on the dynamics of neural population codes in cortical and subcortical areas. Therefore, although water flows while we are <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> morning <b>shower,</b> tracking time is more like observing the changing pattern of the nightly sky than just measuring the flow of water...|$|R
