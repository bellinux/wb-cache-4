5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} {{was on the}} table to protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder <b>the</b> <b>cans.</b> Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} difficulty was encountered {{with the}} uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow {{had to be}} coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a hot dipping process without success. Meanwhile, Alcoa tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure {{rate of more than}} 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of General Electric, which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.|$|E
25|$|Strong magnets {{are used}} to {{separate}} out ferrous metals, such as iron, steel, and tin cans. Non-ferrous metals are ejected by magnetic eddy currents in which a rotating magnetic field induces an electric current around the aluminum cans, which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside <b>the</b> <b>cans.</b> This magnetic eddy current is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> are ejected {{from the rest of}} the recyclate stream.|$|E
50|$|The liquid, when {{released}} from <b>the</b> <b>can,</b> boils {{at a very}} low temperature, rapidly cooling any surface it touches. This can cause mild to moderate frostbite on contact with skin, especially if <b>the</b> <b>can</b> is held upside down. Also, <b>the</b> <b>can</b> gets very cold during extended use; holding <b>the</b> <b>can</b> itself can result in cold burns.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> River <b>Can</b> is a {{river in}} Essex, England.

25|$|The factory used {{a system}} of metal cans filled with water that were lowered into a tank filled with a calcium {{chloride}} brine solution. The brine solution was cooled by coils within the tanks, which were filled with a liquid ammonia refrigerant. After ice formed in <b>the</b> <b>cans,</b> they were placed in a thawing tank, after which the ice would separate from <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> and float to the top. The ice was then crushed and delivered to trawlers at Grimsby's seaport.|$|E
25|$|In postwar Aberdeen (1964) a {{large-scale}} (>400 cases) outbreak of typhoid occurred, caused by contaminated corned beef {{which had been}} imported from Argentina. The corned beef was placed in cans and because the cooling plant had failed, cold river water from the Plate estuary was used to cool <b>the</b> <b>cans.</b> One of <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> had a defect and the meat inside was contaminated. This meat was then sliced using a meat slicer in a shop in Aberdeen, {{and a lack of}} cleaning the machinery led to spreading the contamination to other meats cut in the slicer. These meats were then eaten by the people of Aberdeen who then became ill.|$|E

25|$|In November 1955, Mills Industries, Inc. {{announced}} a coin-operated vending machine, developed jointly with H. J. Heinz Company, that would dispense a tin can of hot food (one of {{a selection of}} six soups or dinners), a can opener, and a spoon. <b>The</b> <b>cans</b> were maintained a constant temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65°C). The machine was intended for use in factories or large offices, and the company claimed {{that it was a}} first of a kind in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The use of tin {{dates back}} many centuries {{and is the}} {{original}} lining for copper cookware. Although the patent for canning in sheet tin was secured in 1810 in England, legendary French chef Auguste Escoffier experimented with a solution for provisioning the French army while in the field by adapting the tin lining techniques used for his cookware to more robust steel containers (then only lately introduced for canning) which protected <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> from corrosion and soldiers from lead solder and botulism poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Other {{materials}} were also scavenged, such as Klim cans; tin cans that had originally held powdered milk {{supplied by the}} Red Cross for the prisoners. The metal in <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> could be fashioned into various tools and items, for example scoops and lamps, fueled by fat skimmed off soup served at the camp and collected in tiny tin vessels, with wicks made from old and worn clothing. The main use of the Klim tins, however, was for the extensive ventilation ducting in all three tunnels.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in late June 2007, 8 people {{contracted}} botulism poisoning {{by eating}} canned food products produced by Castleberry's Food Company in its Augusta, Georgia plant. It was later identified that the Castleberry's plant had serious production problems {{on a specific}} line of retorts that had under-processed <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> of food. These issues included broken cooking alarms, leaking water valves and inaccurate temperature devices, all the result of poor management of the company. All {{of the victims were}} hospitalized and placed on mechanical ventilation. The Castleberry's Food Company outbreak was the first instance of botulism in commercial canned foods in the United States in over 30 years.|$|E

25|$|PAR {{lights are}} often used in {{theatrical}} or live music shows. Commonly {{they are used to}} generate colours by fitting them with colored sheets called gels. <b>The</b> <b>cans</b> are arranged into rows of different colours and identical rows placed on different sides of the stage. Due to their affordability, they are ideal for colour washes in several different colours. However, {{because of the lack of}} control over the beam diameter, shape and sharpness, PARs are rarely used as front of house lights other than for front washes but can be used for special effect lighting such as lighting from directly above or from extreme angles as well as general wash lights overhead/above stage. If used cleverly, par cans can provide low budget productions with good effects.|$|E
5000|$|The {{double seam}} is made using a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or seaming stations. The double seam is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of <b>the</b> <b>can</b> end and two layers of <b>the</b> <b>can</b> body. Each seaming head typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a chuck. Some seaming machines have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the seaming operation, <b>the</b> <b>can</b> end is lowered on to <b>the</b> filled <b>can</b> body and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages <b>the</b> <b>can</b> end against <b>the</b> <b>can</b> body thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some seaming machines, this is done as <b>the</b> <b>can</b> is turning at high speed. In other seaming machines, <b>the</b> <b>can</b> is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from <b>the</b> <b>can</b> and <b>the</b> second operation roll then engages <b>the</b> <b>can.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of the second operation is to iron out the double seam into its final shape and remove the voids between <b>the</b> layers of <b>can</b> and end material. In practice, ironing out all of <b>the</b> <b>can</b> and end material in a double seam without leaving some voids is impossible {{without the use of}} a sealing compound.|$|R

500|$|The pile {{was built}} in September 1941 from [...] {{graphite}} blocks and tinplate iron cans of uranium oxide. <b>The</b> <b>cans</b> were [...] cubes. When filled with uranium oxide, each weighed about [...] There were 288 cans in all, and each was surrounded by graphite blocks so the whole would form a cubic lattice structure. A radium-beryllium neutron source was positioned near the bottom. The uranium oxide was heated to remove moisture, and packed into <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> while still hot on a shaking table. <b>The</b> <b>cans</b> were then soldered shut. For a workforce, Pegram secured the services of Columbia's football team. It was the custom at the time for football players to perform odd jobs around the university. They were able to manipulate the heavy cans with ease. The final result was a disappointing k of 0.87.|$|E
500|$|In February 2016, a {{commercial}} for Coca-Cola mini cans aired during Super Bowl 50. A Mini Marvel was created by Wieden+Kennedy for Coca-Cola through a partnership with Marvel, and was directed by the Russo brothers. In the ad, Ant-Man (voiced by Paul Rudd, reprising his role) and the Hulk first fight, and then bond, over a Coke mini can. Luma Pictures provided visual effects for the spot, having worked previously with the two characters in MCU films. For the Hulk, Luma redefined its previous muscular system and simulation process to create and render the character, while Ant-Man received new motion capture. The Super Bowl campaign extended to [...] "limited-edition Coke mini cans [...] that are emblazoned with images of Marvel characters, including Hulk, Ant-Man, Black Widow, [...] and Captain America." [...] Consumers {{had the opportunity to}} purchase <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> by finding hidden clues in the commercial, though [...] "if the program goes well, Coke will consider making <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> available in stores."

500|$|Some [...] of {{graphite}} blocks {{were purchased}} from National Carbon. The construction crews began stacking them in September 1943. Cast uranium billets came from Metal Hydrides, Mallinckrodt and other suppliers. These were extruded into cylindrical slugs, and then canned. The fuel slugs were canned {{to protect the}} uranium metal from corrosion that would occur if it {{came into contact with}} water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive fission products that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen as it transmitted heat but did not absorb too many neutrons. Alcoa started canning on June 14, 1943. General Electric and the Metallurgical Laboratory developed a new welding technique to seal <b>the</b> <b>cans</b> airtight, and the equipment for this was installed in the production line at Alcoa in October 1943.|$|E
500|$|Scott and Charlene had {{problems}} {{during their first}} 12 months together and they broke up several times.
