40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} detect an object depends on the {{contrast}} between the object and its background. Despite this, many models of visual search rely solely on the properties of <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractors, and do not take the background into account. Yet, both <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractors have their individual contrasts with the background. These contrasts generally differ, because the <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractors are different in at least one feature. Therefore, background is likely {{to play an important role}} in visual search. In three experiments we manipulated the properties of the background (luminance, orientation and spatial frequency, respectively) while keeping the <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractors constant. In the first experiment, in which <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractors had a different luminance, changing the background luminance had an extensive effect on search times. When background luminance was in between that of the <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractors, search times were always short. Interestingly, when the background was darker than both the <b>target</b> <b>and</b> the distractors, search times were much longer than when the background was lighter. Manipulating orientation and spatial frequency of the background, on the other hand, resulted in search times that were longest for small target–background differences. Thus, background plays an important role in search. This role depends on the individual contrast of both <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractors with the background and the type of feature contrast (luminance, orientation or spatial frequency) ...|$|R

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed.

5|$|Among other points, the NATO group cited {{superior}} effectiveness (27 percent greater) for the 5.7×28mm against unprotected <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> equal effectiveness against protected targets.

In 2014, the U.S. Army was adapting its Apaches for increased maritime performance as part of the Pentagon's rebalance to the Pacific.

40|$|We report four {{experiments}} that tested whether object-based attentional spreading can be modulated by the perceptual structure of objects occupied by <b>target</b> <b>and</b> flankers in a flanker task. The <b>target</b> <b>and</b> flankers were presented {{on a single}} object or three separate objects (of same or different shape), displayed at fixed, known locations. The flanker compatibility effect was larger when the <b>target</b> <b>and</b> flankers {{were on the same}} object or on three objects of the same shape than when they were on three objects of different shapes, indicating that perceptual grouping of background objects occupied by <b>target</b> <b>and</b> flankers can affect the target-flanker interference. These results imply that attention likely spreads across different objects occupied by <b>target</b> <b>and</b> flankers when these objects are separated by small gaps or have identical shapes, and attentional spreading is impeded when these objects have different shapes, suggesting that object-based attentional spreading can be modulated by the perceptual structure of objects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{a recent}} study, we {{observed}} that saccadic distraction (i. e., the remote distractor effect, RDE) was reduced when <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractor were displayed at unequal contrast [Born, S., & Kerzel, D. (2008). Influence of <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractor contrast {{on the remote}} distractor effect. Vision Research, 48 (28), 2805 – 2816]. We hypothesized that arrival times explain the RDE modulation: With equal contrast, <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractor signals arrive simultaneously in the oculomotor system so that mutual inhibition (and therefore saccadic distraction) is largest. With unequal contrast, high-contrast signals arrive earlier than low-contrast signals, resulting in less mutual inhibition and little saccadic distraction. In the current contribution, we presented <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractor at different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) to re-align arrival times with unequal contrast. Results confirmed that unequal contrast of <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractor reduced saccadic distraction with simultaneous presentation and that strong distraction could be reestablished by introducing a SOA. However, maximal saccadic distraction also varied strongly with the specific combination of <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractor contrast. Thus, contrast may not only modulate arrival times of <b>target</b> <b>and</b> distractor signals, but also their strength in the mutual inhibition process. Finally, we found more saccadic distraction when the distractor was presented slightly after the target. A second experiment suggests that alerting effects superimposed on the distraction contribute to this effect, but may not fully explain it. We suggest that distraction may be strongest when the rise-to-threshold of the target-related signal has already advanced...|$|R

5|$|In January 1943, Tirpitz {{emerged from}} the lengthy overhaul, after which she was {{transferred}} to Altafjord.

On 22–23 September, six British midget submarines attacked Tirpitz while at anchor.
