500|$|The {{soldiers}} then crucify Jesus {{and cast}} lots for his clothes. Above Jesus' {{head on the}} cross is Pilate's inscription, [...] "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." [...] Soldiers and passersby mock him about it. Two convicted thieves are crucified along with Jesus. In Matthew and Mark, both thieves mock Jesus. In Luke, one of them rebukes Jesus, while the other defends him. Jesus tells the latter: [...] "today you will be with me in Paradise" [...] (Luke 23:43). In John, Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the beloved disciple were at the crucifixion. Jesus tells the beloved disciple <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>of</b> his mother (John 19:26–27).|$|E
500|$|In preparation, Johnson wrote a Plan for the Dictionary. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, was {{the patron}} of the Plan, to Johnson's displeasure. Seven years after first meeting Johnson {{to go over the}} work, Chesterfield wrote two {{anonymous}} essays in The World recommending the Dictionary. He complained that the English language lacked structure and argued in support of the dictionary. Johnson did not like the tone of the essays, and he felt that Chesterfield had not fulfilled his obligations as the work's patron. In a letter to Chesterfield, Johnson expressed this view and harshly criticised Chesterfield, saying [...] "Is not a patron, my lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been pleased <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>of</b> my labours, had it been early, had been kind: but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary and cannot impart it; till I am known and do not want it." [...] Chesterfield, impressed by the language, kept the letter displayed on a table for anyone to read.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the turmoil, {{the kidnappers}} {{tried to keep}} the victims calm. They told the family that they had {{inadvertently}} mistaken their identities and {{that they were going to}} be released. [...] "We're from the Gulf Cartel", one of them told them. [...] "We're the good guys" [...] (in the kidnappers's perspective, the [...] "bad guys" [...] were the members of Los Zetas). The women claimed that although they were scared of a few of their captors, for the most part, the kidnappers treated them well. The Cázares recall that the younger members of the kidnapping ring were the friendlier ones and fed the adults milk and bread, and gave the kids juice to drink. Some of them allowed the victims <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>of</b> their blindfolds while the boss of the ring was gone. The women and children were kept in a safe house with gunmen for another three days. On July 11, the kidnappers released the women and children around midnight at a Walmart parking lot. Five Cázares men, however, remained in captivity (Rodolfo Garza Solís, 82, was later released by his captors sixteen days after the kidnapping).|$|E
2500|$|Following Jen's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Tanks For the Memories" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were asked {{questions}} about statements made by the first five evicted HouseGuests from this season; if a HouseGuest answered incorrectly, they were dumped into a tank of water. Jessica was the winner. On Day 56, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Shop 'til You Drop" [...] luxury competition. For this competition, the HouseGuests competed as men against women, and found letters in the outfits given to them, and were required <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>of</b> their clothing and form three words that pertain to the game with these letters. The women were {{the winners of the}} competition. For winning the competition, the women won a two-minute shopping spree inside of the house. Later that day, Jessica chose to nominate Amber and Zach for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Daniele, Eric, and Jameka were selected to compete; Dick was selected to host. On Day 57, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Catscratch Veto" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given riddles and had to search the backyard to find the rubber rat with the correct answer on it; the last person to find the correct answer each round is eliminated. Eric was the winner of the Power of Veto. Eric, as America's Player, was informed that he was not permitted to use the Power of Veto, and that nominations were required to stay the same as the viewers did not have time to vote for a decision. On Day 59, Eric officially chose to leave nominations the same. On Day 62, Amber became the eighth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of three to one. She became the third member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
