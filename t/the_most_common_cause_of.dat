5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, paracetamol is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> drug overdoses.

5|$|Worldwide, {{too little}} iodine {{in the diet}} is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism. In {{countries}} with enough iodine in the diet, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.|$|E
5|$|Biological, clinical, and {{demographic}} {{factors contribute to}} the likelihood that an injury will be fatal. In addition, outcome depends heavily on the cause of head injury. In the US, patients with fall-related TBIs have an 89% survival rate, while only 9% of patients with firearm-related TBIs survive. In the US, firearms are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> fatal TBI, followed by vehicle accidents and then falls. Of deaths from firearms, 75% {{are considered to be}} suicides.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} cause is viruses.

Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected.

5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually {{does not affect the}} production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In {{areas of}} the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{was first}} {{described in the}} 1960s. Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world. In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.

Rotavirus is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> gastroenteritis in children, and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world. Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity.

5|$|Worldwide in 2012, {{lung cancer}} {{occurred}} in 1.8 {{million people and}} resulted in 1.6 million deaths.

Overall, 17.4% {{of people in the}} United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most}} common cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E

5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{infection}} is Escherichia coli, though other bacteria or fungi may rarely be the cause. Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual intercourse, diabetes, obesity, and family history. Although sexual intercourse {{is a risk}} factor, UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Kidney infection, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a blood-borne infection. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection. In complicated cases or if treatment fails, a urine culture may be useful.|$|E

5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, {{the most common cause}} being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism is a state of insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, the most common cause is iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease. In addition, the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> COPD, with {{factors such as}} air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, {{one of the common}} sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much {{with the use of a}} bronchodilator.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
