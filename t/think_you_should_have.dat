[...] He {{added that he}} does not [...] "believe in abortion", and that it is [...] "like killing a baby"; when asked about the case of abortion with regard to rape, however, he said, [...] "I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that." [...] His view on sexual orientation is quoted as [...] "everyone's own decision", and he has contributed to the It Gets Better Project, a non-profit group aiming to prevent suicide among LGBT youth.|$|E

6000|$|... "Most mysterious!" [...] Sedgwick remarked. [...] "But it's {{unpleasant}} to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{to suffer}} from the foibles of the creature's owner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} was nobody's doing. But I am very sorry that it occurred. I <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{controlled}} yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{for your}} {{energies}} {{that is a}} good deal. Only <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been doing anything for two hours before you begin to feed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Charles,' said he, 'I cannot abide to <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{lost this}} {{money in my}} house. You will find it here upon your table.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "I didn't; but," [...] he added, gravely and deliberately, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{asked me}} such a question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God knows I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the men-at-arms, {{and that}} {{somewhat}} would come of it. What {{is it that}} you would do? What is your hope and purpose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "so far as I am concerned, {{you must}} never feel {{anything}} of the kind again. But I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> known it was quite unnecessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Amiable gentleman, Mr. Jacob Meyer, now as always," [...] said Robert flushing. [...] "To <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been in {{the power}} of a scoundrel like that! Well, I hope to come square with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] the Abbot answered, with a smile--a {{somewhat}} sickly smile--"then I <b>think,</b> mistress, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> double pay, {{to console}} {{you for your}} sorrow and for any doubts that might be thrown upon your skill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, God bless you?' he moaned, 'God bless you! If {{only you}} knew what I have gone through; and to <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> come to help me, and {{at the risk of}} your own life! Well, you were always a true friend--yes, yes, a true friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|LORD GORING. Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn’t so, life wouldn’t {{be worth}} living. [...] . Well, I am bound {{to say that}} I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> told her years ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maggie," [...] said Philip, after {{a minute}} or two, still leaning on his elbow and looking at her, [...] "if you had had a brother like me, do you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> loved him as well as Tom?" ...|$|E
60|$|LYDIA Well, I cannot {{blame you}} for {{defending}} him. But tell me candidly, Julia, had he never saved your life, do you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been attached to him as you are?--Believe me, the rude blast that overset your boat was a prosperous gale of love to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] he said. [...] "To <b>think</b> that <b>you,</b> Allan, <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{remembered to}} take that {{precaution}} when I, an orchidist, forgot all about it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> come to <b>you</b> for information?" [...] asked Anthea, who was {{mistress}} of herself again.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just the}} trouble. <b>You</b> didn't <b>think</b> and <b>you</b> <b>SHOULD</b> <b>have</b> thought. That's what our Club is for--to {{bring us up}} and MAKE us think. We promised we'd always stop and think before doing things. You didn't and you've got to be punished, Faith--and real hard, too. You'll wear those striped {{stockings}} to school for a week for punishment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but I shall indeed. And, Kitty, I {{should think}} nothing of going with you, if you would wish it. Indeed I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a female friend {{alongside}} of you in such a trouble. You have only to say the word and I'll go in a minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have.</b> Where can {{the poor}} people be so well off on Sundays as in church? The bishop intends to express a very strong opinion on this subject in his next charge; and then I am sure you will attend to his wishes." [...] To this Mark made no answer, but devoted himself to his egg.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I don't go so far. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{stopped the}} game, but Fuller accuses {{a man called}} Black of playing the wrong card. In fact, I admit that you don't mean to harm him, by taking {{it for granted that}} you'll let me have the check, because if you kept it, you'd have some hold on him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How can {{you talk}} such nonsense, Anne?' said Rupert; 'do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> written it, if I had not known it would please her?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{been kept}} in ignorance of it, if my {{gamekeeper}} {{had been a}} drunkard? His fellow servants would have warned me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Hugh. Surely you can't misjudge me so!" [...] she {{answered}} reproachfully. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> sent for <b>you</b> if I had meant--that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must admit}} that I knew the portage {{would be a little}} {{difficult}} when you were by yourself, but I didn't think it would give you quite as much trouble as it has," [...] she said. [...] "Still, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> told me. After all"--and she seemed to have some difficulty in finding the right words--"we have never asked you to do anything unreasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, really," [...] {{said the}} Water-rat, {{in a very}} angry manner, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> told me that before you began. If you had done so, I {{certainly}} would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said 'Pooh,' like the critic. However, I can say it now"; so he shouted out [...] "Pooh" [...] {{at the top of}} his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole.|$|E
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Sir Palamydes bespeaks the Lady Belle Isoult] Now {{upon the}} evening of the second day of that tournament, Sir Palamydes came to where the Lady Belle Isoult was, and he said: [...] "Lady, all these things I have done for your sake. For {{had it not been for}} my love for you, I would not have been able to do a third part of that which I did. Now I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> pity and regard for one who loves you so {{strongly}} as that; wherefore I beseech you to bestow some part of your good-will upon me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, if {{your own}} people are content with you,” Bessie laughed, “it’s {{not for me to}} complain. But I shall always <b>think</b> that {{properly}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a great mind—a great character.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> got up, {{when you}} beckoned to me," [...] Emily rejoins, [...] "if I {{had not wanted}} to get away from Mr. Mirabel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't see how {{you expect}} me to raise any more. If I could, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{borrowed}} it? <b>You</b> might chuck rotting for a change.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I daresay, if we {{knew more}} of her history, we should find out that she’d often been ill before eating the lobster. Aren’t you concealing the fact that she’d had measles and {{influenza}} and nervous headache and hysteria, {{and other things that}} aunts do have, long before she ate the lobster? Aunts that have never known a day’s illness are very rare; in fact, I don’t personally know of any. Of course if she ate it as a child of two weeks old it might have been her first illness—and her last. But {{if that was the case}} I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> said so.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Then John {{told the}} story of Mr. Crawley,--a {{considerable}} portion of the story; and in his telling of it, I think it probable that he put more weight upon the necessity of his mission to Italy than it could have fairly been made to bear. In the course of the narration Sir Raffle did once contrive to suggest that a lawyer by going to Florence might do the business at any rate as well as John Eames. But Johnny denied this. [...] "No, Sir Raffle, it is impossible; quite impossible," [...] he said. [...] "If you saw the lawyer who is acting in the matter, Mr. Toogood, who is also my uncle, he would tell you the same." [...] Sir Raffle had already heard something of the story of Mr. Crawley, and was now willing to accept the sad tragedy of that case as an excuse for his private secretary's somewhat insubordinate conduct. [...] "Under the circumstances, Eames, I suppose you must go; but I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> told me all about it before." ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR SIR,--I take my {{earliest}} opportunity {{to answer your}} favor of Feb. B---- was premature in calling me a [...] "shrewd man." [...] I wasn't one at that time, but am one now--that is, I am at least too shrewd to ever again invest in anything put on the market by B----. I know nothing whatever about the Bank Note Co., and never did know anything about it. B---- sold me about $4,000 or $5,000 worth of the stock at $110, and I own it yet. He sold me $10,000 worth of another rose-tinted stock about the same time. I have got that yet, also. I judge that a peculiarity of B----'s stocks {{is that they are}} of the staying kind. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> asked somebody else whether I was a shrewd man or not for two reasons: the stock was advertised in a religious paper, a circumstance which was very suspicious; and the compliment came to you from a man who was interested to make a purchaser of you. I am afraid you deserve your loss. A financial scheme advertised in any religious paper is a thing which any living person ought to know enough to avoid; and when the factor is added that M. runs that religious paper, a dead person ought to know enough to avoid it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think,</b> Faith, that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done that," [...] said Una, {{a little}} reproachfully, after Lida had gone. [...] "You'll {{have to wear}} your good boots every day now and they'll soon scuff out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{your own}} people are content with you," [...] said Bessie Alden, laughing, [...] "it is {{not for me to}} complain. But I shall always <b>think</b> that, properly, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been a great mind--a great character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Uncle,' said Mrs Kenwigs, 'to <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> turned {{your back}} upon {{me and my}} dear children, and upon Kenwigs which {{is the author of}} their being--you who was once so kind and affectionate, and who, if anybody had told us such a thing of, we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{withered}} with scorn like lightning--you that little Lillyvick, our first and earliest boy, was named after at the very altar! Oh gracious!' ...|$|R
