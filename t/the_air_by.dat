5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> flights from an open perch. The stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure {{is applied to the}} insect, thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E

5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{continue}} to give Lisa {{a hard time}} at home, particularly since Homer is ready to host a barbecue, complete with roast pig. On {{the day of the}} barbecue, Lisa makes gazpacho for all the guests as an alternative to meat, but the partygoers laugh in her face. Enraged and deeply hurt, she climbs aboard a riding mower and drives away with the roast pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase her, but she pushes the pig off a slope and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> a dam spillway's suction.|$|E
5|$|In Cairo, a {{standoff}} {{took place in}} front of the Egyptian Museum {{in the early morning hours}} with rocks and petrol bombs reportedly flying. Large-caliber shots were reportedly fired in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> the army to keep opposing factions at bay. There was a heavy police presence at the museum following the standoff. Anti-government protesters banged on metal railings while rocks were thrown at them.|$|E

5|$|No. 111 Squadron {{managed to}} get into {{position}} above Kenley at 3,000 feet. With luck they could intercept 9 Staffel. Biggin Hill soon took the same precaution of ordering all fighters into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> order of Group Captain Richard Grice. At 13:10 the German bombers were within 40 miles of the BBC high-power transmitter at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. In accordance with policy, it was shut down to deny the Germans the opportunity {{to use it as}} direction-finding beacon and the BBC Home Service was kicked off air in the process. Using the railway lines, Roth, in the lead Do 17, homed in on Kenley from the south. They were now just six miles away.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the ball, Clemson's 44 pass {{attempts}} and 21 pass completions were the most allowed by Virginia Tech in any bowl game to that point. The Tigers outgained Virginia Tech through <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> almost 40 yards, and Clemson's two quarterbacks performed consistently throughout the game. Dantzler completed 15 of 32 passes for one touchdown and 180 yards, while Simmons completed six of 12 passes for 63 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. On the ground, Dantzler led all rushers with 18 carries for 81 yards. Clemson's No. 2 rusher was Zachery, who had five carries for 15 yards.|$|E

5|$|Bianchi {{collided}} with {{the rear of the}} tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its roll bar was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database—which sources information from racing accidents worldwide—indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123km/h (76mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather; Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15km (9.3mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.|$|E
5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>By</b> March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing outside the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Goebel {{was again}} {{selected}} as an All-Pro {{player with the}} Tigers, playing in ten games, making two touchdown receptions, and returning a fumble for a touchdown. In all, he was credited with three touchdowns and 18 points in 1924. While playing end for the Columbus Tigers in 1924, Goebel was involved {{in one of the}} oddest plays in NFL history. Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass, but the ball popped out of his arms and was snatched out of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> Oscar Knop of the Chicago Bears. Knop began running for the goal line with the ball, but he was running the wrong way toward a safety. After running 30 yards, Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate Ed Healey on the four-yard line.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, Vakhmistrov devised Zveno-SPB (SPB: Sostavnoi Pikiruyuschiy Bombardirovschik, Combined Dive Bomber) which {{consisted}} of a Tupolev TB-3-4AM-34FRN mothership and two Polikarpov I-16 Type 5 fighters. Each of the fighters was armed {{with a pair of}} 250kg (550lb) FAB-250 high-explosive bombs. Although an I-16 Type 5 could get airborne on its own with no more than 100kg (220lb) of bombs, once hoisted in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> the TB-3 it could reach 410km/h (220 knots, 255mph) at 2500 m (8,200ft), had a service ceiling of 6800 m (22,310ft), and could dive at up to 650km/h (350 knots, 405mph). Once the bombs were dropped, the SPB-launched I-16s performed like conventional Type 5s. The three-aircraft Zveno-SPB had a total takeoff weight of 22000kg (48,500lb), a top speed of 268km/h (145 knots, 165mph), and a range of 2500km (1,350 NM, 1,550mi). The use of a mothership increased the range of the I-16s by 80%.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the IMA has begun to focus on {{developing}} its contemporary art collection, which includes works such as Two White Dots in <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>by</b> Alexander Calder and Light and Space III, a permanent installation by Robert Irwin located in the Pulliam Great Hall. Since 2007 the museum has featured site-specific contemporary installations in the Efroymson Pavilion, rotating the temporary works every six months. The Efroymson Pavilion has featured works by artists such as William Lamson, Ball-Nogues Studio, Orly Genger, and Heather Rowe to name a few. Contemporary art is also featured in 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, which is unique in its inclusion of commissioned works by emerging mid-career artists. Since 2007, the IMA has committed to building a modern design collection that illustrates the artistic merits of utilitarian objects. The focus on international contemporary design, combined {{with the opening of}} the Miller House in 2011, is expected to reposition the museum as an authority on design.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and the 4th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry held Cassel {{for three}} days {{as part of the}} {{defensive}} screen around Dunkirk during the Battle of Dunkirk and evacuation (27 May 1940 – 30 May 1940). The British forces had prepared a defence on the hilltop, emplacing anti-tank guns and barricading the narrow streets of the town. After scoring initial successes against the tanks of Panzer Regiment 11, which had made the mistake of advancing without infantry support, the British garrison was heavily attacked from the ground and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> German forces. Much of the town was reduced to ruins by bombing. Most of the garrison's members were killed or captured by the Germans during the fighting or the subsequent attempted breakout towards Dunkirk, but the defence they had put up {{played an important role in}} holding up the Germans while the Dunkirk evacuation was taking place.|$|E

5|$|Keith Park, with {{endorsement}} from Dowding, {{opted for}} the opposite strategy. Park maintained that it was unimportant to inflict large losses on the Germans in comparison to safeguarding his own forces. Park believed the Germans would give up if they could not achieve their aim of air superiority. This, simply put, meant avoiding the destruction and or depletion of Fighter Command was the primary factor in air defence. This would be achieved by sending small numbers of fighters to intercept, minimising losses in <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>By</b> remaining to offer undiminished and constant air opposition, the RAF ensured the Luftwaffe could not win. As long {{as some sort of}} cost was imposed before the enemy dropped his bombs and impaired the defence system, the RAF could remain intact to meet the threat again the next day. To this end, Park favoured the 10 bomber kills before the attack, rather than the 50 shot down after it. The strategy suggested an enemy would give up if he felt he was getting nowhere. For even while his losses remained moderate, it would be senseless to suffer those casualties for no return. Park and Dowding's strategy, under the circumstances, was the wiser choice.|$|E
5|$|Mirs Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) {{provided}} or controlled atmospheric pressure, fire detection, oxygen levels, {{waste management}} and water supply. The highest {{priority for the}} ECLSS was the station's atmosphere, but the system also collected, processed, and stored waste and water produced and used by the crew—a process that recycles fluid from the sink, toilet, and condensation from the air. The Elektron system generated oxygen. Bottled oxygen and Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) canisters, a system known as Vika, provided backup. Carbon dioxide was removed from <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> the Vozdukh system. Other byproducts of human metabolism, such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat, were removed by activated charcoal filters. Similar systems are presently used on the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|On lap 43 of the race, Bianchi {{lost control}} {{of his car and}} veered right towards the run-off area {{on the outside of the}} Dunlop Curve (turn seven) of the Suzuka Circuit. He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had spun out of control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the roll bar destroyed as it slid under the tractor crane. The impact was such that the tractor crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was suspended in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>by</b> the crane, to fall back to the ground. The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
