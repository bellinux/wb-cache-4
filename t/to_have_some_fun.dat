Henry feels that the spice has gone out of their marriage, while Ellen is more content with their lot in life. When the couple comes into a {{financial}} windfall, Henry suggests that they take separate vacations. Reluctantly, Ellen agrees, and Henry departs to test the waters of New York City's nightlife.

500|$|To escape their {{reputation}} for being overly serious and self-righteous, U2 decided to alter their image by being more facetious. Bono said, [...] "All through the Eighties we tried to be ourselves and failed when the lights were on. Which is what set us up for Zoo TV. We decided <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> being other people, or at least other versions of ourselves." [...] The Edge said, [...] "We were quite thrilled {{at the prospect of}} smashing U2 and starting all over again." [...] The group viewed humour as the appropriate response to their negative perception and that although their message would not change, they needed to change how they delivered it to their audience.|$|E
500|$|Johnson was sportsmanlike; on one {{occasion}} in South Africa, when Eastern Province batsman Ray Connell was bowled after the ball deflected from his head, Johnson replaced the bails, allowing him to continue batting. [...] During the Adelaide Test in 195051 he [...] "walked", ensuring that the unlucky John Warr took at least one wicket for the series. [...] Johnson was not above some gamesmanship, resorting to time-wasting tactics to avoid defeat in the final Test of the 1956 series against England. [...] He was willing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> on occasion; when in the West Indies he convinced a local pilot {{to allow him to}} fly the plane carrying the Australian team between Trinidad and nearby Tobago, to the later displeasure of the Australian Board of Control.|$|E
500|$|Following script rewrites, Cherry {{pitched the}} series to ABC, who {{picked up the}} pilot. ABC {{executives}} were, however, concerned about {{the title of the}} series, which Cherry had selected before even writing the script. They suggested renaming the series Wisteria Lane or The Secret Lives of Housewives, but Cherry insisted on keeping the original title. He later commented, [...] "I put 'desperate' [...] to try to indicate, however subtly... I'm going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> with the imagery, to take it to some interesting places. Most critics got the joke. Some people see the word 'housewives' and it pushes a button in them and they seem to lose all reason." [...] The project was officially announced on October 23, 2003 as a cross between American Beauty and Knots Landing. While Desperate Housewives, along with fellow new series Grey's Anatomy and Lost, would later help reverse ABC's flagging fortune, network executives Lloyd Braun and Susan Lyne were fired shortly after greenlighting these risky and expensive pilots.|$|E

5000|$|Reviewing a 1999 {{exhibition}} of Nerdrum's self-portraits in New York City, Ken Johnson of The New York Times {{wrote that the}} paintings overall only succeeded to [...] "envelop the artist in a stale aura of quasi-Rembrandtian soulfulness". One exception was [...] "Self-Portrait as the Prophet of Painting, in which the artist appears life-size in a floor-length, pearl-studded golden robe, brush and palette in his hands, against a romantically barren rocky shore and a twilit sky.

In the intermediate verses, Madonna utters [...] "forgive me", which is a Catholic term used as a sexual reference. The lyrics, once placed {{in the context of}} Madonna's career [...] "attains a new meaning" [...] according to Josh Haigh from Attitude magazine. Explaining it, he said that the meaning behind the lyrics was how Madonna, being a Catholic girl herself, decided that she would not be tied down by anyone else's rules, and consequently {{became one of the most}} recognizable musical artists.|$|E
500|$|The North American {{release was}} {{scheduled}} for July 11, 2008, but was delayed until August 15, before being brought forward to August 13. As {{a result of the}} move from July, 20th Century Fox moved its family comedy Meet Dave in the open slot. The August 13 release date was also the opening weekends for the animated family film [...] and the horror film Mirrors. Studios consider the third week of August to be a weaker performing period than earlier in the summer because of students returning to school. Previous R-rated comedies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Superbad were released in mid-August and performed well at the box office. Reacting to Tropic Thunders release date, Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, stated: [...] "For a young person at the end of summer, you want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> and forget about going back to school. What better than a crazy comedy?" ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the season}} reinventing the series again, {{composer}} Bear McCreary expanded {{the sound of}} the score [...] "in a big way". In addition to introducing new themes for the characters of Lash and Rosalind Price, McCreary made some changes to the orchestra: [...] "To represent Lash, I brought in larger percussion: merciless pounding taikos that I digitally compressed and distorted. This new, mangled percussion sound is horrific, and will become increasingly important as the season progresses." [...] McCreary also brought in trombones [...] "to get the scariest sound possible," [...] which resulted in the recording space being reconfigured when they were recorded. For Price, her scenes with Coulson [...] "give the series the feeling of a dense political thriller...I really leaned into that, musically. I introduce light acoustic percussion, mostly egg shakers, to give the pulsing synths a softer edge. And I used an acoustic piano to play the [...] "Rosalind Theme" [...] at key moments in her scenes...her music is meant to add intrigue and suspicion, and simultaneously allow us <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun</b> with their witty banter." [...] For [...] "Maveth", McCreary used a 90-piece orchestra rather than the series' typical 50 or 70 players.|$|E

We have this surreal kind of dance sequence, and it features synchronized swimmers and showgirls. We just throw a little extra twist on it. We wanted to mix a current, modern feel with an old-school, classic Hollywood feel because the song has kind of a big-band quality to it as well as a more modern dance-song quality. We wanted to mix the two different parts." ...|$|R
500|$|Roger advises Lane {{about how}} to ensnare a client at dinner. Roger informs Lane to find the man's source of regret, and make it {{relatable}} to himself, forming a [...] "conspiracy" [...] of feeling between the pair. Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, and to let Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down softly and taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, but he wants <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>fun.</b> The executives quickly learn what kind of fun Edwin has in mind and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete {{on the way home}} in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete was miserable. Pete replies sarcastically that he has everything, and Don warns him not to throw it away.|$|E

2500|$|The mid-series premiere, [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", was {{intended}} to be the opposite of the [...] "grim and dark" [...] tone of the series premiere.

[...] "The Girl Who Waited" [...] is a [...] "Doctor-lite" [...] episode which allowed Tom MacRae to explore Amy and Rory's characters and relationship.

This question raises the opportunity for readers of this journal <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> visual <b>fun.</b> Each year a different nonlinear inspired artist is featured on the front cover of the journal. This year, Scott Draves’s fractal art works continues this tradition. In May 2007, we selected twenty of Draves’s artworks and invited readers to vote for their favorites from this selection.

[...] Phillips added, [...] "At its occasional best, the thrills in the film recall the delirious fun of the Fast & Furious franchise." [...] Betsy Sharkey of Los Angeles Times felt similarly, writing [...] "In trying for the vicarious varoom of the street-racing video game that inspired it, and no doubt dreaming of Fast success, Speed clocks in at a long two-plus hours and falls painfully short." [...] Jason Torchinsky of the automotive blog Jalopnik decried the movie for insulting gearheads with its far-reaching suspension of disbelief on many plot points and tropes and stated the film {{was nothing more than a}} glorified car commercial for the 2015 Ford Mustang.|$|R
