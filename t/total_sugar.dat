500|$|On May 20, 2016 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{announced}} {{changes to}} the Nutrition Facts panel displayed on all foods, to be effective by July 2018. New to the panel is a requirement to list [...] "Added sugars" [...] by weight and {{as a percent of}} Daily Value (DV). For vitamins and minerals the intent of DVs is to indicate how much should be consumed. For added sugars, the guidance is that 100% DV should not be exceeded. 100% DV is defined as 50 grams. For a person consuming 2000 calories a day, 50 grams, the amount to not exceed, is the same as 200 calories, and thus 10% of total calories - same guidance as the World Health Organization. To put this into context, most 12 ounce (335 mL) cans of soda contain 39 grams of sugar. In the United States, a recently published government survey on food consumption reported that for men and women ages 20 and older the average <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> intakes - naturally occurring in foods and added - were, respectively, 125 and 99 g/day.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{profitable}} Slave Trade and {{the high}} quality of Nevisian sugar cane, the island soon became a dominant source of wealth for Great Britain and the slave-owning British plantocracy. When the Leeward Islands were separated from Barbados in 1671, Nevis became {{the seat of the}} Leeward Islands colony and was given the nickname [...] "Queen of the Caribees". It remained colonial capital for the Leeward Islands until the seat was transferred to Antigua for military reasons in 1698. During this period, Nevis was the richest of the British Leeward Islands. The island outranked larger islands like Jamaica in sugar production in the late 17th century. The wealth of the planters on the island is evident in the tax records preserved at the Calendar State Papers in the British Colonial Office Public Records, where the amount of tax collected on the Leeward Islands was recorded. The sums recorded for 1676 as [...] "head tax on slaves", a tax payable in sugar, amounted to 384,600 pounds in Nevis, as opposed to 67,000 each in Antigua and Saint Kitts, 62,500 in Montserrat, and 5,500 total in the other five islands. [...] The profits on sugar cultivation in Nevis was enhanced {{by the fact that the}} cane juice from Nevis yielded an unusually high amount of sugar. A gallon (3.79 litres) of cane juice from Nevis yielded 24 ounces (0.71 litres) of sugar, whereas a gallon from Saint Kitts yielded 16 ounces (0.47 litres). Twenty percent of the British Empire's <b>total</b> <b>sugar</b> production in 1700 was derived from Nevisian plantations. Exports from West Indian colonies like Nevis were worth more than all the exports from all the mainland Thirteen Colonies of North America combined at the time of the American Revolution.|$|E
50|$|Boza is {{produced}} in the Balkans {{and most of the}} Turkic regions, but not always using millet. The flavour varies according to the cereal which is used.

40|$|When a raw {{sweet potato}} root is analysed, only sucrose, glucose and {{fructose}} are present but during cooking, starch is hydrolysed into maltose giving the sweet flavour to cooked roots. This study aimed at developing an HPTLC protocol for the rapid quantitative determination of maltose and <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> in four commercial varieties and to {{compare them to}} 243 hybrids grouped by flesh colour (white, orange, purple). In commercial varieties, mean maltose content varied from 10. 26 to 15. 60 % and <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> from 17. 83 to 27. 77 % on fresh weight basis. Hybrids showed significant variation in maltose content within each group, with means ranging from 7. 65 % for white-fleshed, to 8. 53 % in orange- and 11. 98 % in purple-fleshed. <b>Total</b> mean <b>sugars</b> content was 20. 24, 22. 11 and 26. 84 % respectively for white, orange and purple flesh hybrids. No significant correlations were detected between individual sugars but maltose and <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> content were highly correlated. Compared to the best commercial variety (Baby), 25 hybrids (10. 3 %) presented a higher maltose content and 40 (16. 5 %) showed a higher <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> content. HPTLC was observed as an attractive, cost efficient, high-throughput technique for quantitating maltose and <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> in sweet potatoes. Perspectives for improving sweet potato quality for consumers' requirements are also discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Production of {{lactic acid}} from palmyra sap by {{fermentation}} {{has been studied}} using Lactobacillus casei TISTR 1500 as the producer organism. The effects of the {{physical and chemical properties}} of palmyra sap were determined. The pH, water content, total soluble solids, <b>total</b> <b>sugars,</b> and <b>total</b> nitrogen were 4. 3, 86. 2 %, 14. 8 °Brix, 134. 0 g L- 1, and 0. 03 g L- 1, respectively. The fermentation took place in a flask under static conditions. The variation of 10. 0 - 134. 0 g L- 1 <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> in the palmyra sap was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h in a basal medium.

40|$|Sargassum muticum is an {{important}} source of bioactive polysaccharides; hence, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) was used to improve their extraction efficiency. Response surface methodology and a Box-Behnken full factorial design were employed to assess and optimize the effects of extraction conditions on the yield, <b>total</b> <b>sugars,</b> <b>total</b> sulfated <b>sugars</b> and antioxidant activity of S. muticum extracts. The extraction yield ranged between 32 and 40. 4 % independently of the extraction conditions or seaweed solid/liquid ratio resulting in average increases of 3. 6 to 4. 8 -fold for <b>total</b> <b>sugars</b> and sulfated sugars, as compared to conventional extraction.

Using 50  mM jasmonic acid, Double Decker calli recorded maximum values of caffeic acid derivatives and <b>total</b> hydrolysable <b>sugars</b> after 15  days. In Rubinstern calli, caffeic acid derivatives and <b>total</b> hydrolysable <b>sugar</b> recorded maximum values after 30  days at 200  mM jasmonic acid and after 15  days at 50  mM jasmonic acid, respectively. In Double Decker variety, caffeic acid derivatives and <b>total</b> hydrolysable <b>sugars</b> recorded maximum values at 100  mg/l phenylalanine. Rubinstern calli recorded maximum value of caffeic acid derivatives at 100  mg/l phenylalanine and <b>total</b> hydrolysable <b>sugars</b> at 50  mg/l phenylalanine.
