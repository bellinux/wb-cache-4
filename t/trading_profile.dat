40|$|We empirically {{study the}} trading {{activity}} in the electronic on-book segment and in the dealership off-book segment of the London Stock Exchange, investigating separately the trading of active market members and of other market participants which are non-members. We find that (i) the volume distribution of off-book transactions has a significantly fatter tail than the one of on-book transactions, (ii) groups of members and non-members can be classified in categories according to their <b>trading</b> <b>profile</b> (iii) {{there is a strong}} anticorrelation between the daily inventory variation of a market member due to the on-book market transactions and inventory variation due to the off-book market transactions with non-members, and (iv) the autocorrelation of the sign of the orders of non-members in the off-book market is slowly decaying. We also analyze the on-book price impact function over time, both for positive and negative lags, of the electronic trades and of the off-book trades. The unconditional impact curves are very different for the electronic trades and the off-book trades. Moreover there is a small dependence of impact on the volume for the on-book electronic trades, while the shape and magnitude of impact function of off-book transactions strongly depend on volume. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper conducts an empirically {{study on}} the trade package {{composed}} of a sequence of consecutive purchases or sales of 23 stocks in Chinese stock market. We investigate the probability distributions of the execution time, the number of trades and the total trading volume of trade packages, and analyze the possible scaling relations between them. Quantitative differences are observed between the institutional and individual investors. The <b>trading</b> <b>profile</b> of trade packages is investigated to reveal the preference of large trades on trading volumes and transaction time of the day, and the different profiles of two types of investors imply that institutions may be more informed than individuals. We further analyze the price impacts of both the entire trade packages and the individual transactions inside trade packages. We find the price impact of trade packages is nonnegligible over {{the period of the}} execution time and it may have a power-law relation with the total trading volume. The price impact of the transactions inside trade packages displays a U-shaped profile with respect to the time $t$ of the day, and also shows a power-law dependence on their trading volumes. The trading volumes of the transactions inside trade packages made by institutions have a stronger impact on current returns, but the following price reversals persist over a relatively shorter horizon in comparison with those by individuals. ...|$|E
40|$|The hegemonic view in Canadian {{political}} economy is that Canada’s <b>trade</b> <b>profile</b> is weighted towards {{the export of}} unprocessed products, and away from manufactured products. With the soaring value of Canadian energy exports, combined with an import history weighted towards the import of finished manufactured goods, left nationalist {{political economy}} {{seems to be on}} strong footing painting a picture of an economy with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector. This article will empirically re-examine Canada’s <b>trade</b> <b>profile,</b> question some common assumptions about what constitutes ‘manufactured’ exports, and argue that Canada’s <b>trade</b> <b>profile</b> is perfectly compatible with that of an advanced capitalist economy. Left nationalism has mistakenly relied on categories appropriate to dependent economies, categories inappropriate for Canada.

40|$|The {{concept of}} product space has {{encountered}} broad interest within the development community, as an analytical tool against which to assess countries’ potential to diversify their production and export structures. It has received {{far less attention}} in the economics literature, and its assumptions and building blocks have not been put under scrutiny. This paper assesses whether exclusive reliance on export data in product space analysis may limit its value as a tool assessing country capabilities. Reliance on net trade flows—to account for horizontal intra-industry trade—and on unit values—to capture within-product differentiation—changes {{the features of the}} product space. Based on a highly detailed data set of both trade value and volume and spanning over 144 countries, the amended product space put forth in this paper shows that China has indeed expanded its <b>trade</b> <b>profile</b> to now occupy also product areas that are typically associated with higher-income countries. However, China's remarkable success in expanding horizontally within the product space is strongly qualified by the introduction of the vertical dimension, which shows the country to be occupying mostly the low-unit value segment of product categories, more akin to the typical <b>trade</b> <b>profile</b> of a developing country...|$|R

The importance of developing countries improving their investment climate is also urged. Concrete proposals put forward for action in the communication and highlighted in the Commission's press release include: intensification of dialogue with partner countries involving a stronger emphasis on trade issues in the dialogue around PRSPs (Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers) and ensuring that funding for the priority of trade-related assistance is adjusted in the Country and Regional Strategy papers; enhancing the effectiveness of EU support through: reinforcing the trade component in programmable aid; focussing on the needs of least-developed and low-income countries; developing horizontal trade-related assistance programmes; increasing the EU's ability to design and deliver training programmes for trade negotiators; providing technical assistance for sustainability-impact assessments; reinforcing developing countries capacity in the SPS field; contributing to international effectiveness through: ensuring coherence in the provision of trade-related assistance; improving co-ordination and sharing best practices; promoting the integrated framework for least-developed countries; support to the DDA Global Trust Fund. Comment: The <b>trade</b> <b>profile</b> of developing countries outlined in the opening sections of the report is considerably at variance with the <b>trade</b> <b>profile</b> of the ACP. Finished product exports account for only 19 % of the ACP's total exports to the EU, which remain concentrated in agricultural and mineral products. The profile of a developing country set out in the Trade and Development report has over two-thirds of exports being accounted for by manufactured goods (the developing country group includes countries such as Slovenia and Malta).

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} convergence tendencies in the SADC region and {{to determine whether the}} EPA/EBAI policies between SADC and EU_ 27 member states will promote such convergence tendencies. The analyses of the EPA/ABAI policies make further conclusion on SADC member states’ potential winners and losers from changes in <b>trade</b> <b>profile</b> brought about by these policies since individual SADC member states are heterogeneous in their <b>trade</b> <b>profile.</b> Therefore these policies outcome will likely have negative or positive effects on economic growth and convergence tendencies of individual member states of the SADC region.

Further analysis {{of the effects of the}} EPA/EBAI policies reveal that SADC LDC are likely to be winners except Madagascar and Tanzania while the SADC ACP countries are possible winners on condition they set up enabling environments that promote development of industries where they are likely to benefit more given their export profile which is an indicator of their comparative advantage. It is further concluded that overall the EPA/EBAI will likely promote convergence tendencies and be beneficial to the region as a whole. ...|$|R

For this reason an effective treatment is necessary to minimize the impact of allergic rhinitis in general population. Objective: The aim of this review is to inquire intranasal corticosteroids.

We analyzed the safety profile, the adverse effects described by the authors, the relation between cost/effectiveness. We have made a search for <b>trade</b> <b>profile,</b> dosage and chemical characteristics by on-line handbook. Discussion: Several studies demonstrate that intranasal corticosteroids are more effectiveness in nasal symptoms control than other medications for Allergic Rhinitis. Intranasal corticosteroids are relatively safe, only few studies demonstrated systemic adverse effects.

40|$|After {{years of}} reforms and unending debate, the {{question}} remains unanswered: why is Latin America not growing more? The present article approaches the subject from an unconventional perspective, presenting the persistence of informality as a structural barrier to growth.

The model presents the links between the growth pattern of the formal sector and {{the dynamics of the}} informal sector, and between these and the pattern of growth in the overall economy. Adverse specialization patterns and an unfavourable international <b>trade</b> <b>profile</b> are perpetuating informality. Thus, export-led growth most resembles an enclave model which does not even guarantee high growth, since the dynamic of the informal sector, which accounts for about half the urban workforce, adversely affects the performance of the whole econom...|$|R

All the sectoral differences and changes are consistent with the <b>trade</b> <b>profiles</b> of the two countries, and the long-run results are more pronounced than those of the short-run. In comparison with other ASEAN countries, the CGE analysis suggests that Vietnam's agriculture exports to Korea would especially rise in the long run.

Thus, an earlier conclusion of a comprehensive FTA with Korea {{is expected to be a}} good strategy for Vietnam, so as to avoid the direct competition with ASEAN members in the future...|$|R

It contributes around 7. 5 % to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 26 % to agricultural GDP (AgGDP) (GOI, 2003). The livestock sector {{in the last two decades}} has recorded a growth rate of around 5. 2 % per annum, which is almost twice that of agricultural sector (Singh, 2002). Poultry occupies a unique position in the livestock economy of India. India ranks 4 th in the world in egg production and 8 th in poultry meat production. Production and exports of poultry meat have experienced the highest growth rate in the last two decades among meat of all other food animal species. Small stocks of poultry can act as supplementary enterprise for the rural poor, since they cost less to purchase, are of a more convenient size for home consumption or for sale in times of distress and reproduce and grow faster.

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} effects of the European economic integration on two member countries, namely Greece and Germany. Based on their differences in relative factor endowments, the bilateral trade pattern, the industrial structure and the product prices are analyzed in a neo classical Heckscher-Ohlin framework. The process of continuous economic integration puts pressure on the member countries for industrial restructuring in order for efficiency gains to be realized. Hence, the industrial structure of Greece, Germany and other EU member countries is also examined and reveals that member nations bear differences in their endowments and have also increased their specialization level in industries that have a comparative advantage over their EU counterparts. <b>Trade</b> <b>profiles</b> verify the bilateral trade pattern predicted by the Heckscher-Ohlin although the existence of intra-industry trade requires the adoption of New Trade Theory terminology.

Overall {{objective of this}} {{research is}} to investigate the role of international trade on Libya’s economy through reviewing various phases of economic growth in Libya starting from 1963. During this period, Libyan economy has undergone various structural changes. Not only has oil been one of its main exporting commodities, but also earnings from this sector of the Libyan economy have been credited with high growth rates experienced in the country. The research comprise of five specific objectives of which four require empirical justification. The non-empirical objective of the research is to obtain a <b>trade</b> <b>profile</b> of Libya. The empirical objectives include the analysis of relationship between trade and economic growth of Libya with and without incorporating the role of trade partners and the development of import demand in Libya with and without incorporating expenditure component. Results of the research showed that Libya is significantly dependent on international trade with countries of European Union; however, feedback effect from these countries is low. Mostly, Libya depends on the trade partners to cover the import demand. Import demand of the country is determined via price level instead of the income of the country. The only expenditure in Libya out of household consumption, government consumption, and investment, investment has sing incant effect on the price level. Therefore, for Libya to receive tread led growth, the country should employ such policies that favour total investment. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to conduct a {{comparative}} study on the transatlantic similarities and dissimilarities in the USA's and the EU's poultry trade disputes with China, as a case study of murky protectionism amid the current global financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach – The case history is explored chronologically, supported with relevant legal documents. For comparative purposes, the poultry <b>trade</b> <b>profiles</b> concerning these <b>trade</b> partners are overviewed before the case study. Findings – The paper concludes from the case study that there is a great deal of synchronicity between the murky protectionism and the current global crisis within the current WTO framework, due to both pressures faced by some governments from inside and the inherent limitations of the WTO agreements and dispute settlement mechanism. Comparatively, the EU's approach to poultry dispute with China is more scientific, while the USA's is more political. Research limitations/implications – As the Sino-US poultry dispute is still outstanding, pending for the panel's report, the findings are interim, and the implications only tentative. In short, the lessons learnt from this comparative case study is that unilateral capacity building might be the only concrete thing Chinese exporters and authorities can do at present stage under the current WTO legal framework, amid the tidal wave of the current global crisis. Originality/value – The paper examines trade disputes over the same commodity China involved with two pivotal trade partners, in order to explore underlying differences; and lessons drawn for China.
