The crashes that night were caused by Simón trying to get out. He fell and broke his neck.|$|E

This short, compelling novel is at once a realist text investigating a murder which took place <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> near Istanbul, and a fictional inquiry into the literary foundations of civilizations, comparing two fundamental myths of the West and the East respectively: Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex (a story of patricide) and Ferdowsi’s tale of Rostam and Sohrab (a story of filicide).|$|E

25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges to mankind always has been eradicating the presence of debilitating disease. Until just <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> poliomyelitis occurred in the United States and throughout the world in epidemic proportions, striking tens of thousands and killing thousands in our own country each year. Dr. Jonas E. Salk changed all that. This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty appreciating the magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped {{from the face of the}} Earth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> {{there was}} neither real {{predictability}} nor qualitative {{understanding of the}} dominant mechanisms in emulsion polymerisation. Mechanisms had been ‘proved’ by comparing model predictions with experimental data. The data field was limited and the models had many adjustable parameters, or else fitting parameters had values that were subject to wide uncertainty: {{it was possible to}} choose values that could suit any model. It was not uncommon to find two papers claiming that quite different mechanisms were dominant in the same system, a result {{of not being able to}} isolate the individual steps. As a result of Gilbert’s work, all individual processes in emulsion polymerisation, one of the commonest ways of making everyday products, are now qualitatively and quantitatively understood. It is now possible to polymerise simple systems and to predict the molecular architecture that will be formed under chosen conditions, while for more complex conditions, trends can be semiquantitatively predicted and understood. The international scientific and technical community in this field now uses the mechanistic knowledge that he obtained as the key to understanding current processes and creating new processes and products. His work has put this industrially important field on a rigorous scientific footing.|$|E

500|$|<b>Thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when I first {{attempted}} {{to describe the}} characteristic features of tenth-century Anglo-Latin literature, I was rather naively bedazzled by the display of vocabulary which one encounters there. Because much of the vocabulary appeared to derive either from Aldhelm or from glossaries of the type called [...] "hermeneumata", I followed scholarly tradition and described the style as [...] "hermeneutic", {{on the assumption that}} the principal impulse behind the verbal display was that of dazzling the reader with arcane vocabulary exhumed from Greek-Latin glossaries and authors such as Aldhelm. I now suspect that the perception needs modification: that the authors' principal aim was not obfuscation, but was their (misguided, perhaps) attempt to reach in their prose a high stylistic register.|$|E
500|$|Ketèlbey's concert {{music was}} {{less well known}} in England than in {{continental}} Europe, where he conducted many programmes of his own works for the Concertgebouw Orchestra and others. The composer's more avowedly serious music was less widely esteemed by his compatriots. In a 1928 profile the magazine The British Musician commented, [...] "There {{is no need to}} explain here why his serious music, whether written <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> or as recently as 1927... has not won the popularity of, say, Edward German's dances: it is pleasant music, delightfully scored; but it is not so fascinating as that from which it derives—the music of the Viennese writers of dance music, of Délibes and Gounod and the like."

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the prevalent effect of organochlorines insecticide residues on randomized population sample from El-Hosh Town community, South Gezira. 36 human urine samples such as 12 from male, 12 from female and 12 from children were collected from randomized population samples.

DDE concentrations in females (5. 17 ppm) were higher than those in male urines (4. 18 ppm). The results indicated that the DDE residues level were not associated with age or weight.
