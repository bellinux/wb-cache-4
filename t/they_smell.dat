5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites. <b>They</b> <b>smell</b> foods on the fur, whiskers and especially the breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E
25|$|Snakes use smell {{to track}} their prey. <b>They</b> <b>smell</b> by using their forked tongues to collect {{airborne}} particles, then passing {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ or Jacobson's organ in the mouth for examination. The fork in the tongue gives snakes a sort of directional sense of smell and taste simultaneously. They keep their tongues constantly in motion, sampling particles from the air, ground, and water, analyzing the chemicals found, and determining the presence of prey or predators in the local environment. In water-dwelling snakes, such as the anaconda, the tongue functions efficiently underwater.|$|E

To find out, he asks Lostface if she {{remember}}s what happens, but she can only remember the words [...] "Pack, pack, kill, kill". Whitestorm reports to Fireheart that <b>they</b> <b>smell</b> dog near Snakerocks, so they head there.|$|E

2500|$|A PWD will {{commonly}} jump as a greeting. Owners {{may choose}} to limit this behavior. Some PWDs may walk, hop, or [...] "dance" [...] on their hind legs when greeting or otherwise enthusiastic. Some PWDs will stand upright at kitchen counters and tables, especially if <b>they</b> <b>smell</b> food above them. This habit is known as [...] "counter surfing" [...] and is characteristic of the breed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the term}} [...] "aromatic" [...] was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. [...] Hofmann used the term for a class [...] of benzene compounds, many of which have odors (aromas), unlike pure saturated hydrocarbons. Aromaticity as a chemical property bears no general relationship with the olfactory properties of such compounds (how <b>they</b> <b>smell),</b> although in 1855, before the structure of benzene or organic compounds was understood, chemists like Hofmann were beginning to understand that odiferous molecules from plants, such as terpenes, had chemical properties that we recognize today are similar to unsaturated petroleum hydrocarbons like benzene.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his next}} single, [...] "The Fightin' Side of Me," [...] {{released}} by his record company in 1970 over Haggard's objections, Haggard's lyrics {{stated that he}} did not mind the counterculture [...] "switchin' sides and standin' up for what they believe in," [...] but resolutely declared, [...] "If you don't love it, leave it!" [...] In May 1970, Haggard explained to John Grissom of Rolling Stone, [...] "I don't like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y'know. They don't give a shit what they look like or what <b>they</b> <b>smell</b> like.... What do they have to offer humanity?" [...] In a 2003 interview with No Depression magazine, Haggard said, [...] "I had different views in the '70s. As a human being, I've learned [...] I have more culture now. I was dumb as a rock when I wrote 'Okie From Muskogee.' That's being honest with you at the moment, and {{a lot of things that}} I said [...] I sing with a different intention now. My views on marijuana have totally changed. I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesn't know that needs to get up and read and look around, get their own information. It's a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawed." ...|$|E
60|$|The Jaguar crept {{closer to}} the stump and sniffed the {{fragrance}} of the scrambled eggs. <b>They</b> <b>smelled</b> so good that he tasted them, and they tasted so good that he ate the strange meal in a hurry, proving he had been really hungry.|$|R
5000|$|An unknown victim. When Booth and SWAT {{stormed the}} Gormogon's home, {{he was seen}} eating a piece of meat, which was most likely human.

50|$|The {{camp was}} the {{headquarters}} for U.S. Camel Corps, which experimented with using dromedaries as pack {{animals in the}} southwestern United States. The Army imported camels in 1856 and 1857, using them with some success in extended surveys in the Southwest. The camels did not get along with the Army's horses and mules, which would bolt out of fear when <b>they</b> <b>smelled</b> a camel. The soldiers found the camels difficult to handle and <b>they</b> detested the <b>smell</b> of the animals.|$|R

50|$|Surprisingly {{the next}} morning {{there was very little}} damage to be seen. Actually all the houses around were intact, except for one house — the house of the parson. His house was in ruins, and it was still burning. Some neighbors even thought <b>they</b> <b>smelled</b> burning brimstone. Presumably the devil himself had made the parson pay for desecrating the kistvaens.|$|R

50|$|The first {{explosion}} {{occurred on}} 21:00 local time near a toilet.
