25|$|Both Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were {{knocked out}} before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the match at New Road was fairly academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from {{amassing}} {{one of the highest}} scores in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 - Ben Smith only taking 45 balls to smack 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, as he lifted his career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan never quite got <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> Shoaib Akhtar - who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up only losing five wickets, but 224 was always too much to ask, and they finished with a total 186 for 5.|$|E

These may be legitimate dramatic subjects but the script gives them an illegitimate viewpoint and leaves muddled moral issues dangling." ...|$|E

500|$|After the Sequel has {{received}} positive coverage for its revitalization of retro Sonic gameplay. Tony Ponce of Destructoid summarized it as [...] "quite the fun little gem {{that keeps the}} Genesis-era Sonic spirit alive". He contrasted the retro, fan-made After the Sequel with Sega's efforts to create high-quality 3D titles, lamenting that, fifteen years {{after the release of}} Sonic Adventure, Sega was [...] "only now starting to get <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> the third dimension." [...] John Polson from IndieGames.com called the game [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "stunning", while Kotaku's András Neltz stated that [...] "it looks amazing" [...] and advised readers not to let the game's status as a fan work turn them away from it. Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran also called the game [...] "impressive". The UK gaming staff for Red Bull's website stated that, despite Sega's continual releases of Sonic games, [...] "few have quite recaptured the thrill of blazing through a 2D labyrinth at lightspeed in the way that fan made Sonic After The Sequel has." [...] A second Red Bull article, by author Ben Sillis, exclaimed that [...] "you have to play" [...] it.|$|E
500|$|When Kyril Bonfiglioli {{took over}} in 1964, he complained in his first {{editorial}} that he had [...] "just read through {{a quarter of a}} million words of ms [...] and half of it was so bad it made me blush". He asked Brian Aldiss to help; the only unsold stories Aldiss had were from his early days, [...] "written before I got <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> things", but Bonfiglioli told Aldiss, [...] "They can't possibly be worse than the rubbish that's being submitted". Aldiss provided four stories for the first two issues, under his own name and two pseudonyms, [...] "Jael Cracken" [...] and [...] "John Runciman". Bonfiglioli's third issue included Keith Roberts' first two stories: [...] "Escapism", a time travel tale, and [...] "Anita", the first in a series about a witch; Roberts became a frequent contributor both under his own name and as [...] "Alistair Bevan", and also provided the artwork for several covers. The Day of the Minotaur, another historical fantasy by Thomas Burnett Swann, began serialisation in the same issue under the title The Blue Monkeys. Swann's novel The Weirwoods was also serialised in the magazine, with no change of title. Other new writers that began to appear under Bonfiglioli's editorship included Josephine Saxton and Brian Stableford. Bonfiglioli's focus on stories that he liked personally, rather than on a specific editorial policy, led author Christopher Priest to describe Science Fantasy under Bonfiglioli's editorship as [...] "a literate and charmingly eccentric magazine, with an atmosphere all its own".|$|E
2500|$|The PC {{version of}} the game {{received}} praise for its faithful reproduction of gameplay from the console versions.

[...] However Marko Djordjevic of GameFocus disagreed and stated, [...] "once you get <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> it [...] it feels exactly as you’d expect." [...] Djordjevic further appreciated that the cooperative gameplay was ported over from the console versions.|$|E

2500|$|A vent is a slit in {{the bottom}} rear (the [...] "tail") of the jacket. Originally, vents were a {{sporting}} option, designed to make riding easier, so are traditional on hacking jackets, formal coats such as a morning coat, and, for practicality, overcoats. Today there are three styles of venting: the single-vented style (with one vent at the centre); the ventless style; and the double-vented style (one vent on each side). Vents are convenient, particularly when using a pocket or sitting down, to improve <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> the jacket, so are now used on most jackets. Ventless jackets are associated with Italian tailoring, while the double-vented style is typically British. (This {{is not the case}} with all types of jackets. For instance, dinner jackets traditionally take no vents.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Haneke {{dealt with}} the matter since 1992. The work on the script was {{interrupted}} by a writer's block. Haneke normally wrote out the script exactly before the writing process. This time {{the end of the story}} was not clear to him. He began writing in the hope that this would occur to him at work, but this did not happen. [...] "I have tormented myself terribly with the script and I was left with the impression that I have not succeeded in getting <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> this topic", he said. At the same time the director realized that the Swiss-Canadian Léa Pool with La dernière fugue (2010) had created a similar story, about an old man who is taken care of by his wife. Therefore, he let the project in favor of another. He worked only sporadically on it, until his writer's block loosened and he could finish the script quickly. Haneke wrote it specifically for Trintignant, having already written the scripts for The Piano Teacher (2001) and Caché (2005) specifically for actors (Isabelle Huppert and Daniel Auteuil). Haneke prefers this way of working, because in this way one [...] "writes specifically something that fits to the advantages of each actor and helps to particularly work them out".|$|E

2500|$|Each of {{the regulars}} brought their {{individual}} style to playing the game. Clement Freud liked to make lists and to challenge {{with only a}} few seconds to go. He was among the show's more competitive players, regularly referring to the rules and deprecating any deviation from them. Derek Nimmo often improvised descriptions of his experiences abroad, many derived from his extensive theatrical tours. He too was highly competitive, and was known for berating the chairman frequently. Peter Jones once said that in all his years playing the game, he never quite got <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> it; nonetheless, his self-deprecating, laconic style suited the essential silliness of the show. Kenneth Williams was often the star of the show: his flamboyant tantrums, arch put-downs, and mock sycophancy made him the audience's favourite. Williams often stretched out his speeches by extending every syllable to breaking point (some words lasting for up to three seconds), and his outbursts of mock-anger regularly included his catchphrase [...] "I've come all the way from Great Portland Street", as though he had journeyed for miles, when in fact his home was just {{around the corner from the}} BBC studios where most recordings took place. Merton frequently launches into surreal flights of fancy and fantasy, such as claiming to have had unusual occupations or to have experienced significant historical events. He also often wins points by challenging just before the whistle or for humorous challenges, another technique being to say the same word in the singular and the plural, for inexperienced panelists to falsely challenge.|$|E
2500|$|The bowling began poorly, {{but after}} 20 minutes Fred Trueman (3/76) got <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> the pitch {{and made the}} ball swing away from Bill Lawry, finding a thin edge to Alan Smith for his first catch in Test cricket. Norm O'Neill was a {{notoriously}} poor starter and would have rin himself out if Ted Dexter had gathered the ball cleanly. As it was he edged Trueman to David Sheppard at second clip, who missed the catch and Peter Parfitt dropped the rebound for {{what would have been}} superlative diving catch had his held on. After cutting the ball for a scorching boundaries, edging another pass fine-leg and glancing another O'Neill was out to a Trueman bouncer which lifted sharply and was caught by Brian Statham at short square-leg for 19. Bobby Simpson made 50, but mis-hooked a rank long hop from Dexter (1/46) into the hands of Trueman at mid-on and Australia went into lunch on 97/3. Back on the field Trueman started bowling short on the leg-stump, dubbed [...] "bodyline" [...] by some journalists, and Peter Burge popped a ball to Dexter at short-leg to give the Yorkshire his third wicket despite his bad back. Australia were now surprisingly 101/4, but Brian Booth (112) rebuilt the innings, adding 39 with Neil Harvey (39), 54 with Alan Davidson (23) and 103 the ever solid Ken Mackay. A rather lifeless Statham (1/75) bowled Harvey with a good ball, but it was the support bowlers Barry Knight, Fred Titmus and Ken Barrington who suffered in the afternoon as the fast bowlers were given a rest. Smith missed a stumping when Booth was 21 and tried to drive Titmus and also hit the spinner to the boundary over the head of a fielder. Davidson heaved Titmus to the fence, but tried the same to Barrington's leg-spin and was caught by Trueman, who had now taken three wickets and held two catches out of six dismissals. The game struggled in the final session, with Dexter setting defensive fields to Titmus and Knight and Mackay hogging the strike without making runs and too slow to take quick singles which would have upset the field-placings. Booth reached his [...] "wristily stylish" [...] maiden Test century in 173 minutes and with 14 fours, an aristocratic innings by the man who had nearly been left carrying the drinks. He was caught by Dexter off Titmus (1/91) at 20 minutes to six trying to push the score {{in the face of all}} opposition. His departure at 296/7 brought in captain Richie Benaud, who must have wondered if his team would make 300 earlier in the day, but saw Australia to 321/7 by stumps, with Mackay reaching 51 not out. Trueman was fit to bowl in the morning, but Benaud hooked him for four and with Mackay took 11 runs off an over by Statham. When five overs had gone for 34 runs so Titmus and Knight were brought back on to defensive fields. Benaud made 51 runs before he edged the ball to Smith off Knight at 388/8. Knight (3/65) made two dives across the wicket to take return catches off Mackay, which he dropped and McKenzie, which he held on to. Jarman was caught off the Essex all rounder by Barrington to wrap up the Australian innings for 404 in time for an early lunch, with Mackay left high and dry on 86 not out. It was his own fault as the dour Queenslander had occupied his home ground for a tedious 247 minutes, had refused singles and had allowed Dexter to contain him. Mackay never made a Test century and this was the closest he got to one against England.|$|E
