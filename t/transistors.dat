5|$|Problems {{with the}} {{reliability}} of early batches of <b>transistors</b> meant that the machine's {{mean time between failures}} was about 90 minutes, which improved once the more reliable junction <b>transistors</b> became available. The Transistor Computer's design was adopted by the local engineering firm of Metropolitan-Vickers in their Metrovick 950, in which all the circuitry was modified to make use of junction <b>transistors.</b> Six Metrovick 950s were built, the first completed in 1956. They were successfully deployed within various departments of the company and were in use for about five years.|$|E

5|$|While Kilburn led one {{design team}} working on Meg, he led another with Dick Grimsdale and Douglas Webb, on a {{research}} project examining what he believed {{would be the next}} step forward in computer design: the use of <b>transistors.</b> The 48-bit machine they completed in November 1953 was the world's first transistor computer, with 550 diodes and 92 <b>transistors,</b> and was manufactured by STC. An improved version completed in April 1955 had 1,300 diodes and 200 <b>transistors,</b> and was sold by Metropolitan-Vickers as the Metrovick 950.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some indium compounds, such as indium {{antimonide}} and indium phosphide, are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as the semiconductor dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature <b>transistors</b> and InP for high-temperature <b>transistors.</b> The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. Indium is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation thin-film solar cell. Indium is used in PNP bipolar junction <b>transistors</b> with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E
5|$|Moore's {{law is the}} {{empirical}} observation {{that the number of}} <b>transistors</b> in a microprocessor doubles every 18 to 24months.

5|$|The {{development}} of the germanium transistor in 1948 {{opened the door to}} countless applications of solid state electronics. From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high-purity silicon began replacing germanium in <b>transistors,</b> diodes, and rectifiers. For example, the company that became Fairchild Semiconductor was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon <b>transistors.</b> Silicon has superior electrical properties, but it requires much greater purity that could not be commercially achieved {{in the early years of}} semiconductor electronics.|$|E
5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} transistor in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include <b>transistors,</b> microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, <b>transistors,</b> integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E
5|$|Work on {{building}} a smaller and cheaper computer began in 1952, {{in parallel with}} Meg's ongoing development. Two of Kilburn's team, Richard Grimsdale and D. C.

5|$|Despite {{some early}} adopters, the 808 was a {{commercial}} failure {{and fewer than}} 12,000 units were sold. Roland ended production in 1983 after semiconductor improvements made the faulty <b>transistors</b> that were essential to its design impossible to restock.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{several years}} after its {{acquisition}} by Amperex, the manufacturing operations of Advanced Micro Electronics were transferred to Slatersville. The products transferred from Advanced Micro Electronics included small signal silicon planar <b>transistors</b> for military and industrial applications, Leadless Inverted Devices (LIDs) and hybrid circuits using both thin and thick film technology. Manufacturing of these three products and the sales office for Philips Semiconductors were housed in Slatersville until 1992 when this business unit was sold.|$|E
5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power <b>transistors.</b> Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar <b>transistors</b> and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar <b>transistors.</b> Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{could be}} exploited industrially and commercially, and research {{that could lead}} to such applications is under way. A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like <b>transistors,</b> enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium 2 {{processor}} {{was released}} in 2002, and was marketed for enterprise servers rather than for the whole gamut of high-end computing. The first Itanium2, code-named McKinley, was jointly developed by HP and Intel. It relieved many of the performance problems of the original Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by an inefficient memory subsystem. McKinley contains 221 million <b>transistors</b> (of which 25 million are for logic), measured 19.5mm by 21.6mm (421mm2) and was fabricated in a 180nm, bulk CMOS process with six layers of aluminium metallization.|$|E
