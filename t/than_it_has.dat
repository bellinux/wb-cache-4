5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> in the past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This {{has been the case}} as early 1893. The upper reaches of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system.|$|E
5|$|The Pavane (1887) was {{conceived}} and originally written as an orchestral piece. Fauré published the version for piano in 1889. In {{the form of}} an ancient dance, the piece was written to be played more briskly <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than crochet=100. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the Pavane was not a piece of German romanticism.|$|E
5|$|The {{company made}} its first {{acquisition}} on March 2, 1988, with its purchase of Network Innovations. In its two divestments, {{both of which were}} during the 1990s, parts of the company were sold to other companies. In 2013, Apple acquired thirteen companies—more <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> in any other year so far. Apple's largest acquisition was that of Beats Electronics in August 2014 for US$3 billion. Of the companies Apple has acquired, 49 were based in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

25|$|In {{any given}} time period, the {{government}}’s budget can be either in deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. MMT states that {{as a matter of}} accounting, it follows that government budget deficits add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited more money into private bank accounts <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money from private bank accounts via taxes <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> put back in via spending.|$|E

By the end of 1929 the Socialist Party had gained more members <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> in all the years since 1923. Through the United Socialist Drive <b>it</b> <b>had</b> raised more funds <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> in years, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> revived the flow of Socialist pamphlets which had all but dried up since the war, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> boosted the circulation of Socialist newspapers....|$|R
25|$|D was a {{difficult}} money-making venture for some time. It traversed {{some of the most}} rural and mountainous areas of New York and Pennsylvania. Only about a dozen industrial customers between Sunbury and Rouses Point remain. The railroad's current prognosis is arguably better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been in a long time. Along with the New York connection, haulage agreements with other railroads greatly increased traffic.

Nor does the country have many endemic species, these being limited to the Egyptian weasel, pallid gerbil, Mackilligin's gerbil (this may possibly extend into the Sudan), Flower's shrew, Nile Delta toad, and two butterflies, the Sinai baton blue and Satyrium jebelia.|$|E
25|$|Although an April 2010 {{survey of}} members of the National Association for Business Economics (NABA) showed an {{increase}} in job creation (over a similar January survey) {{for the first time in}} two years, 73% of the 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> anytime since the end of World War II. The OECD credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus in the United States, in contrast to the austerity measures taken in the European Union.|$|E

25|$|The vagina {{has been}} studied in humans more <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been in other animals. Its {{location}} and structure varies among species, and may vary in size within the same species. Female mammals usually have {{the opening of the}} urethra of the urinary system separate to the vaginal opening of the genital tract. This is different to male mammals, who usually have a single opening, the external urethral opening for both urination and reproduction. The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans. In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary and reproductive tracts.|$|E
25|$|The D {{has been}} a {{difficult}} money-making venture for some time. Originally constructed as a coal hauling route and when that business declined it proved difficult to turn a profit. It operates {{in some of the}} most rural areas of New York State, and very few industrial customers between Binghamton and Rouses Point remain. The railroad's current prognosis is arguably better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been in a long time. Along with the NYC connection, haulage agreements with other railroads are greatly increasing traffic. CP has been steadily using their high power AC traction locomotives on their road trains that run on the line, instead of their aging SD40-2 models. This is an indication of the increasing importance of reliable service. There are also major signal and track projects underway to modernize the former D lines.|$|E
25|$|Wascana Lake {{had been}} created in 1883 by damming Wascana Creek, but between Angus and Rae Streets, 1½ blocks west of the 1908 Albert Street dam and bridge, itself {{replaced}} by the present bridge in the same location when Wascana Lake was drained in 1931 for deepening of the bed.
