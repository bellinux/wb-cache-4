40|$|For food {{industry}} processes packaging machines with high throughput are required {{and one way}} to improve the overall machine efficiency is to increase its working speed. However, testing of prototypes is time and cost expensive. Therefore, simulation is {{used to evaluate the}} process and adapt it. Optimization can help to find better machine designs by using simulations to evaluate one solution. This work uses the Discrete Element Method to model a vertical <b>tubular</b> <b>bag</b> machine for packaging basmati rice. The Covariance Matrix Adaption Evolution Strategy optimizes the simulation model and results in a significant machine speedup. This work is a guidance to adapt this method for similar problems...|$|E
40|$|The optimum {{package in}} each case has to be both economical, machine- and consumer-oriented and also {{guarantee}} the required minimum shelf-life. Knowledge of the mechanisms of quality loss in the package-product system {{is just as important}} as the correct evaluation of the properties of packaging materials made of plastics. In this connection, the permeability of flavours represents one of the critical quantities. How the choice of material for a new development can be made is described by the example of a <b>tubular</b> <b>bag</b> for long-life milk. Further examples of developments of recent years, such as pots made of coated papers, cover films for beaker packs for yoghurt and fruit quark or transparent barrier films for the packaging of processed cheese are described...|$|E
50|$|In mechanical-shaker baghouses, <b>tubular</b> filter <b>bags</b> are {{fastened}} onto a {{cell plate}} {{at the bottom}} of the baghouse and suspended from horizontal beams at the top. Dirty gas enters the bottom of the baghouse and passes through the filter, and the dust collects on the inside surface of the bags.|$|R

40|$|Using ten {{sealing jaws}} with {{differently}} shaped surfaces, side-sealed <b>bags</b> and <b>tubular</b> <b>bags</b> with overlapped resp. fin seal seams were produced out of fourteen commercial packaging materials. The {{effect of the}} different jaw profiles on the heat sealed seams was determined by evaluating their strength and tightness. Laboratory tests were made as well as tests under practical production conditions on a vertical form-fill-seal-machine of the Transwrap 125 H type. The result was {{that the effect of}} such jaws in practical operation decisively depends on the type of the packaging material used, especially on the thickness of its heat-sealable layer and the heat conductivity of its components. In addition to this the pouch type also plays a decisive role as well as the question of priority of seam tightness or seam strength or if both properties are of equal importance for the evaluation of the seam quality in each individual case...|$|R
40|$|AbstractQingcaosha Reservoir, {{based on}} coastal sand of Changxing Island at the Yangtze Estuary, {{is the largest}} plain and coastal {{reservoir}} storing fresh water at home and abroad, with {{the full length of}} 48 km. The dam foundation is mainly filled with arenaceous soil and powdery sand, which owns large permeability and poor seepage stability; the body of dam is built by the new way for filling the sand, blowing the sand and casting the sand bags, which also owns poor seepage stability. Focusing on the three body forms of filling the sand, laying the <b>tubular</b> <b>bags</b> with sand and casting the sand-bags and two typical forms of section, the article has completed the indoor large-scale hydraulic model experiment of sand tank. By the experiment, the researchers have found the characters of contacting seepage between soil and bag, between bags and bags and between sand and bags, also determined the permeability coefficient and integrated permeability coefficient of different embankment materials, and the quantity of the single-wide flow, then acquired the index of seeping characters among dam body's materials, and finally discussed the seepage stability of the dam body and the rationality of controlling seepage...|$|R
500|$|Naem is a red-colored, {{semi-dry}} lactic-fermented pork sausage in Thai cuisine prepared using minced raw {{pork and}} pork skin, {{significant amounts of}} cooked sticky rice, chili peppers, garlic, sugar, salt and potassium nitrate. [...] Minced beef is sometimes used in its preparation. After the mix is prepared, it is encased in banana leaves, synthetic sausage casings or <b>tubular</b> plastic <b>bags</b> and left to ferment for three to five days. Naem has a sour quality to it due to the fermentation, in which lactic acid bacteria and yeasts grow within the sausage. The lactic acid bacteria and yeasts expand by feeding upon the rice and sugar, {{and the use of}} salt prevents the meat from rotting.|$|R
50|$|For 1998 {{optional}} {{rear side}} airbags became available, and both models also gained BMW's exclusive new Head Protection System, {{which consists of}} two <b>tubular</b> <b>bags</b> that inflate upon a side impact and pop out just above each front door. A new Sport Package for the 528i and 540i, {{as well as an}} automatic transmission 540i were added options. The Sport Package included black body trim (standard models had chrome around the top of the windows), a sport-tuned suspension, and 17-inch wheels and tires. In September 1998, the 540i's M62B44 was updated to the M62TUB44, adding 15 ft·lb (20 Nm) of torque. DSC first became available on 540i with automatic transmission as of 9/97The high-performance M5 sedan (saloon) returned to the BMW fold. Built in limited numbers, the M5 used a 400 hp (300 kW) V8 S62, and came with a firmer suspension, 18-inch wheels, a 6-speed manual transmission, and exclusive interior trim.13 Lower-body rear side airbags were standard on the M5, remaining optional for other models. 1999 saw the introduction of the Touring wagon (estate) body style and joined sedans (saloons) in both I6 and V8 versions. New options for 1999 included brighter xenon headlights, Park Distance Control that warns of obstacles when backing up, and self-leveling rear suspension for wagons (estates). Standard on V8 models and newly optional for 528i versions was BMW's Dynamic Stability Control, designed to aid control in fast turns. The M52 2.8 liter I6 engines were now all aluminium block and head with the introduction of double VANOS, as opposed to the previous single VANOS iron block/aluminium head M52.|$|R
50|$|The {{conclusion}} {{made by the}} report's authors {{was that}} only by changing the way we use water within agriculture would {{we be able to}} meet the acute water, environment and poverty challenges facing us over the next 50 years. They suggested that with wise policies and investments in irrigation, upgrading rainfed agriculture, and trade {{it would be possible to}} limit future growth in water withdrawals to 13% and the expansion of cultivated land to 9%. However, the effects of climate change and the increased use of biofuels would complicate matters, making actions necessary to address these. The Assessment found the greatest potential lay in rainfed areas of the world housing the highest number of poor people. Upgrading these rainfed lands through better water management held the greatest potential to increase productivity and decrease poverty. The technology would not necessarily need to be complex; simple measures such as catching water in huge <b>tubular</b> plastic <b>bags</b> and storing roof and road run-off could double or even triple food production in sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia, effectively increasing productivity from each raindrop by that amount.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{possible}} to design bioreactors for large-scale H 2 production using microorganisms. Bioreactors can be distinguished based {{on the nature of}} H 2 production: bioreactors with H 2 production in the darkness by bacteria via water-gas shift reaction or fermentation and photobioreactors with H 2 production from H 2 O using solar light by cyanobacteria or green algae. Hydrogen produced in a “water-gas shift reaction” or from glycerol is clean for injection into fuel cells. Fermenters or bioreactors with immobilized cells are used for H 2 production in the darkness. Research efforts are concentrated on designing <b>tubular</b> or plastic <b>bag</b> photobioreactors incorporating green algae and cyanobacteria...|$|R
50|$|The {{quantity}} of inflation air may be varied {{in accordance with}} the particular properties and requirements of the package contents. Dunnage bags are commercially available in various sizes and designs, ranging from spheres, standard cushions to corner and edge cushioning and <b>tubular</b> cushioning. Dunnage <b>bags</b> can be used to stabilize, secure, and protect cargo during all sorts of transportation. Dunnage bags are placed in the void between the cargo. Dunnage bags can be used in all modes of transportation. Besides being usable in all modes of transportation, almost every type of cargo can be secured with the use of dunnage bags, including break bulk and palletized cargo, coils, barrels, cases, and crates.|$|R
