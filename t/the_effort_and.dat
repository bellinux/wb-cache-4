5|$|In April 1864, Brazil sent Minister Plenipotentiary José Antônio Saraiva to {{negotiate}} with Atanasio Aguirre, who had succeeded Berro in Uruguay. Saraiva made an initial attempt {{to settle the dispute}} between Blancos and Colorados. Faced with Aguirre's intransigence regarding Flores' demands, the Brazilian diplomat abandoned <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> sided with the Colorados. On 10 August 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, Saraiva declared that Brazil's military would begin exacting reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and for most of its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, Howling Bells {{recorded}} Heartstrings at Assault & Battery Studios, in London. The {{album was}} primarily produced by Marks, but Moulder supported <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> was given credit as co-producer. Marks {{set the tone}} of the environment in the recording studio and the band felt extremely open and comfortable in her presence. Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band, more so than any of her record producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously. The band moved on from former label Cooking Vinyl and established a partnership with Birthday Records, a small, independent record label founded by former Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Nick Hodgson.|$|E

I am curious to know about <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>and</b> also <b>the</b> effects of those main character?s efforts in reaching wealth. I use American dream concept to analyze Joe?s efforts; those are included doing dirty business, lying, and sacrificing others. In doing this research, I use literary approach.

I relate American dream concept with <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> effects in my analysis. Through this analysis, I found that <b>the</b> main character?s <b>efforts</b> <b>and</b> their effects are basically related with American dream concept. <b>The</b> <b>efforts</b> may occur in everyone?s life. The wealth will mean nothing although it is already achieved if we also lose something important in our life. When someone cannot choose good ways on reaching wealth, they get it wrong in understanding the American dream...|$|R

5|$|In August 1798, the French Mediterranean Fleet {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} by a British fleet at the Battle of the Nile during the French invasion of Egypt. With the Royal Navy dominant in the Mediterranean Sea and their army trapped in Egypt, the French sought in 1801 to augment their depleted forces in the region by sending reinforcements from the Atlantic Fleet and by purchasing ships from the Spanish Navy, based in Cadiz. A squadron sailed from Brest on the Atlantic in January and made three failed attempts to reach Egypt, which was facing a large British invasion, before abandoning <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> retiring to Toulon on the French Mediterranean coast. Three ships of the line, Formidable, Indomptable and Desaix, had been detached from the squadron in May however and were subsequently placed {{under the command of}} Contre-Admiral Charles Linois under orders to sail for Cadiz. At Cadiz, the Spanish fleet had agreed to sell six ships of the line to the French Navy, and on 13 June two French frigates, Libre and Indienne, arrived at the port to oversee the transfer under the command of Contre-Admiral Dumanoir le Pelley.|$|E
5|$|In March 1916 Mexican forces {{loyal to}} Pancho Villa crossed into New Mexico and raided the border town of Columbus. The {{violence}} in Columbus killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico. Chagrined {{to discover that}} his unit would not participate, Patton appealed to expedition commander John J. Pershing, and was named his personal aide for the expedition. This meant that Patton would have some role in organizing <b>the</b> <b>effort,</b> <b>and</b> his eagerness and dedication to the task impressed Pershing. Patton modeled much of his leadership style after Pershing, who favored strong, decisive actions and commanding from the front. As an aide, Patton oversaw the logistics of Pershing's transportation and acted as his personal courier.|$|E

5|$|One {{attempt at}} relief was thwarted {{early in the}} siege when a force of New York militia under Nicholas Herkimer was stopped in the August 6 Battle of Oriskany by a {{detachment}} of St. Leger's forces. While that battle did not involve the fort's garrison, some of its occupants sortied and raided the nearly empty Indian and Loyalist camps, which was {{a blow to the}} morale of St. Leger's Indian support. They killed some Seneca. The siege was finally broken when American reinforcements under the command of Benedict Arnold neared, and Arnold used a ruse, with the assistance of Herkimer's relative Hon Yost Schuyler, to convince the besiegers that a much larger force was arriving. This misinformation, combined with the departure of Indian fighters not interested in siege warfare and upset over their losses from the raids, led St. Leger to abandon <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> retreat.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} {{successfully}} bred in captivity, both for falconry and for release back into the wild. Until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the US were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the US Endangered Species Act was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances. Peregrine falcons {{were removed from the}} United States' endangered species list in 1999. The successful recovery program was aided by <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> knowledge of falconers – in collaboration with The Peregrine Fund and state and federal agencies – through a technique called hacking. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the dyke suggests that it was built to create an effective barrier and to command views into Wales. This implies that the Mercians who built it were free to choose the best location for the dyke. There are settlements {{to the west of}} the dyke that have names that imply they were English by the 8th century, so it may be that in choosing the location of the barrier the Mercians were consciously surrendering some territory to the native Britons. Alternatively it may be that these settlements had already been retaken by the Welsh, implying a defensive role for the barrier. <b>The</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> expense that must have gone into building the dyke are impressive, and suggest that the king who had it built (whether Offa or someone else) had considerable resources at his disposal. Other substantial construction projects of a similar date do exist, however, such as Wat's Dyke and Danevirke, in what is now Germany as well as such sites as Stonehenge from millennia earlier. The dyke can be regarded in the light of these counterparts as the largest and most recent great {{construction of}} the preliterate inhabitants of Britain.|$|E

5|$|The first hemisphere-wide {{effort to}} {{eradicate}} smallpox {{was made in}} 1950 by the Pan American Health Organization. The campaign was successful in eliminating smallpox from all American countries except Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. In 1958 Professor Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox. The proposal (Resolution WHA11.54) was accepted in 1959. At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year. Overall, however, the progress towards eradication was disappointing, especially in Africa and in the Indian subcontinent. In 1966 an international team, the Smallpox Eradication Unit, was formed {{under the leadership of}} an American, Donald Henderson. In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2.4 million annually to <b>the</b> <b>effort,</b> <b>and</b> adopted the new disease surveillance method promoted by Czech epidemiologist Karel Raška.|$|E
5|$|The mutineers {{issued a}} lengthy list of demands, {{that ranged from}} longer periods of leave to and end to the war, based on the United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The {{following}} day, many of the mutinous ships abandoned <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> rejoined loyalist forces in the inner harbor; first the light cruisers {{and most of the}} torpedo boats escaped from the guns of the mutineers, followed by several of the other larger vessels. By late in the day, only the men aboard Sankt Georg and a handful of destroyers and torpedo boats remained in rebellion. Only on the morning of 3 February, after the arrival of the s of the III Division, were the last of the mutineers convinced to surrender. Trials on the ringleaders commenced quickly, and four men were executed, including the sailor who had shot Sankt Georgs commander.|$|E
5|$|There are {{records of}} two tutors {{for the young}} duke during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of William's {{literary}} education is unclear.

Orderic Vitalis records that William tried to learn to read Old English late in life, but he was unable to devote sufficient time to <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> quickly gave up. William's main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to have been quite affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her– unusual in a medieval monarch.

5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E
