5|$|Assisting {{him on this}} Far Eastern Party {{would be}} Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz. They {{were in charge of}} the expedition's sledge dogs—Greenland Huskies—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick {{in order to have a}} chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E
5|$|DB Cargo is {{a global}} freight {{operator}} with a large interest in freight over rail in Europe. While High Speed 1 was constructed with freight loops, no freight traffic had run upon the line since opening in 2003. On 16 April 2009 DB Schenker {{signed an agreement with}} HS1 Ltd, the owner of High Speed 1, for a partnership to develop TVM modifications for class 92 freight locomotives to run on the line. On 25 March 2011 {{for the first time a}} modified class 92 locomotive travelled from Dollands Moor to Singlewell using the TVM430 signalling system. A loaded container train ran for the first time on 27 May 2011, to Novara in Italy. Following further trials with loaded wagons DB is to upgrade five Class 92 locomotives to allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> on High Speed 1. From 11 November 2011 a weekly service using European-sized swap body containers has run between London and Poland using High Speed 1.|$|E

50|$|Huskies that {{fulfill the}} {{demanding}} performance standards of world-class dogsled racing are extremely valuable. A top-level racing lead dog can be worth $3,000-$10,000. Alaskans {{that fail to}} meet the performance standards of the musher who bred them often go on {{to be sold to}} less competitive mushers, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>run.</b>|$|R
5|$|On {{the same}} night the New York Mets were coming from behind to defeat the Boston Red Sox in Game 7 of the 1986 World Series, the Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 27–20 in week eight to improve to 6–2 and move into a tie with the Redskins for the division lead. With the teams tied 20–20, Joe Morris scored the game-winning touchdown on a 13-yard run with 98 seconds remaining. The Giants offense featured a two tight end formation {{throughout much of the}} game which allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the ball more effectively. The Giants used Mark Bavaro and Zeke Mowatt throughout much of the game, sometimes even lining them up on the same side. Morris finished the game with 181yards. Redskins quarterback Jay Schroeder threw for 420yards in the loss.|$|E
5|$|The 1894 Championship {{began with}} a loss for the {{defending}} champions against England, during {{a game in which}} Welsh in-fighting affected the result. Before the game, Gould instructed his forwards to heel the ball from the scrums swiftly, so it would get to the backs quickly and allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> at the English. Frank Hill decided that this was the wrong option and put all his might into wheeling the scrums instead, which worked against the efforts of Jim Hannan, who was trying to follow his captain's wishes. In the next match Gould was partnered by Dai Fitzgerald in a win over Scotland, but was unavailable for the encounter with Ireland and was replaced by Jack Elliott from Cardiff RFC.|$|E
5|$|After Orlović's {{battalion}} {{entered the}} undefended village of Zamlača, the Serb rebels {{moved from one}} house to the next, ransacking homes and forcing any civilians they found {{to move to the}} main road. Approximately 50 civilians were captured in the village, they were then forced to walk in front of an armed vehicle towards Struga, forming a human shield. By 13:00, all the units earmarked for the advance between Dvor and Kozibrod had achieved their initial objectives, except for the platoon commanded by Sundać. By 14:30, Struga was under attack. The defending force in Struga was first engaged by the outflanking force and had no knowledge of what had happened in Zamlača. As the human shield and the SAO Krajina force reached Struga, the defending troops were reluctant to fire against them. As a consequence, three Croatian policemen deployed in one house were surrounded and subsequently surrendered. Their captors stripped them, ordered <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> and then killed them. Unsure {{how to deal with the}} situation, the Croatian forces withdrew from the southern part of the village. The unit protected by the human shield moved very slowly and took six hours to move from Zamlača to the centre of Struga.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Virgin Trains {{introduced}} a new high-speed service on the West Coast Main Line with a fleet of 53 custom-designed Pendolino trains. The nine-car trains were constructed by Alstom and are equipped with a tilting mechanism developed by Fiat to enable <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> at high speeds on existing rail infrastructure, thus fulfilling {{the aims of the}} APT project some 30 years later.|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} in the same law that former presidents Kenan Evren, Süleyman Demirel, Ahmet Necdet Sezer and {{incumbent}} Abdullah Gül could not be nominated for a second term, but this was ruled unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Turkey, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for a second term. Also, the Prime Minister of Turkey could be nominated for the presidency without having to resign from his post.|$|E

25|$|Tensions along caste {{lines between}} the Kunbi and the Dalit {{communities}} {{were seen in}} the Khairlanji killings, and the media have reported sporadic instances of violence against Dalits. Other inter-caste issues include the forgery of caste certificates by politicians, mostly in the grey Kunbi-Maratha caste area, to allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for elections from wards reserved for OBC candidates. In April 2005, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Marathas are not a sub-caste of Kunbis.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, it was {{reported}} that Jund al-Aqsa was receiving continuous funding from wealthy private Gulf donors for their refusal to attack ISIL, part of which was the reason for their rift with al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham. They reformed after previously fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, who hurt the group and also caused <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> into some debt. These Gulf donors, who financed them for this reason, refused to finance groups involved in intra-rebel fighting.|$|E
25|$|Android {{smartphones}} {{have the}} ability to report the location of Wi-Fi access points, encountered as phone users move around, to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points. These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> apps like Foursquare, Google Latitude, Facebook Places, and to deliver location-based ads. Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid, an academic research-funded project, can, in some cases, detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 31 May 1857, Hayes and Carey {{departed}} to a nearby town to confer with the local magistrate. After their departure, the Indian troops rebelled and decapitated Fayrer. Barbour was also killed, {{as he tried to}} escape. When Hayes and Carey came back the next morning, an older Indian officer galloped towards them and advised <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away. However, as the Indian officer explained the situation to them, the rebel Indian sowars (cavalry troopers) raced towards them. Hayes was killed as he tried to ride away, while Carey escaped to safety.|$|E
25|$|The current {{version of}} Windows, Windows 10, reintroduced the Start menu, while {{retaining}} the Universal Platform apps, but instead allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> in a window instead of always in full screen. Windows 10 was very well received, with many reviewers stating that Windows 10 is what Windows 8 should have been. Windows 10 also marks the last version of Windows to be traditionally released. For the future, Microsoft will no longer release new versions of Windows and instead introduce major updates to the operating system that add new features, so far 3 {{of which have been}} released (see Windows 10 section below).|$|E
25|$|This data {{structure}} allows decrease priority operations {{to be performed}} more quickly than binary heaps, {{at the expense of}} slower delete minimum operations. This tradeoff leads to better running times for algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm in which decrease priority operations are more common than delete min operations. Additionally, -ary heaps have better memory cache behavior than binary heaps, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> more quickly in practice despite having a theoretically larger worst-case running time. Like binary heaps, -ary heaps are an in-place {{data structure}} that uses no additional storage beyond that needed to store the array of items in the heap.|$|E

25|$|Microsoft avoids {{outright}} announcements of new motherboard {{production runs}} and their subsequent {{appearance in the}} market {{in part due to}} uneven distribution causing buyer's remorse and to prevent purchaser delay. However, several major (and many minor) motherboard revisions are introduced in an attempt to build systems more cheaply (and thus increase profits), and as a happy side effect, to allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> cooler while consuming less power. Note that there is no clear divide between the appearance of motherboard revisions in retail. Due to individual stock production, distribution and rotation, it may become difficult to find specific versions.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} units were {{delivered}} in June 1986, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> trials on the Bergen Line starting 19–20 June. Production continued {{for a further}} twelve months, when the twentieth unit was completed. Revenue service commenced on the Bergen Line on 1 September. Later in 1986 the cars were taken into use on the Dovre Line and the Sørlandet Line. The following year they entered service on the Røros Line and the Nordland Line. The only significant operating fault with the carriages was the freezing of the water system during cold spells. This particularly affected the forward toilet, but the issues were soon solved through modifications to the design.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} factors have led to {{increased}} pressure on the economic viability of the current fleet of nuclear power plants. The age of the existing 104 nuclear power plants means that the licenses of most need to be extended. Most of the nation's first wave of nuclear power plants came on-line between 1956 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. Typically, they received forty-year licenses, which means most plants' licences were set to expire between approximately 1996–2014. However, many of these plants were extended by twenty years and often received power up-grades, which allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> at 120% their originally intended capacity.|$|E
