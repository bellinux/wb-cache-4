500|$|In May 1865, {{while still}} serving on Grant's staff, Comstock {{was called to}} serve {{as one of the}} nine {{military}} commissioners to oversee the trial of the conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. [...] At first, Comstock was eager to see the prosecution of the conspirators, writing that, for them, [...] "death is too good." [...] However, as the trial proceeded, Comstock became disturbed by the secrecy of the military proceedings. [...] Concerned about the violation of the defendants' rights, he began to openly argue for the case to be transferred to a civilian court. [...] President Andrew Johnson removed Comstock from the commission due to Comstock's protests. [...] The rationale for the removal, as explained to Comstock by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, was that Grant had also been a potential target of the conspirators and the commissioners felt that Comstock, due to his closeness to Grant, could not be counted on <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>impartially.</b>|$|E
500|$|Richard {{controlled}} {{the north of}} England until Edward IV's death. There, {{and especially in the}} city of York, he was highly regarded; although it has been questioned whether this view was reciprocated by Richard. Edward IV set up the Council of the North as an administrative body in 1472 to improve government control and economic prosperity and benefit the whole of Northern England. Kendall and later historians have suggested that this was with the intention of making Richard the Lord of the North; Peter Booth, however, has argued that [...] "instead of allowing his brother the Duke of Gloucester carte blanche, [...] restricted his influence by using his own agent, Sir William Parr." [...] Richard served as its first Lord President from 1472 until his accession to the throne. On his accession, he made his nephew John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, president and formally institutionalised it as an offshoot of the royal Council; all its letters and judgements were issued on behalf of the king and in his name. The council had a budget of 2000 marks per annum (approximately £1320) and had issued [...] "Regulations" [...] by July of that year: councillors <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>impartially</b> and declare vested interests, and to meet at least every three months. Its main focus of operations was Yorkshire and the north-east, and its primary responsibilities were land disputes, keeping of the king's peace, and punishing lawbreakers.|$|E

40|$|This study {{consists}} of a critical comparative analysis of the administrative justice systems in eighteen Latin-American signatory countries of the American Convention on Human Rights (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela). According to this article, the excessive litigation in Latin-American courts that has seriously hampered {{the effectiveness of the}} administrative justice systems may be explained as follows: as former Iberian colonies, the aforementioned countries have a Continental European legal culture originating in civil law but nevertheless have improperly integrated certain aspects of the unified judicial system (generalized courts) typical of administrative law in common-law countries. This situation, according to the author, could be rectified through strengthening the public administrative authorities with respect to their dispute-resolution and purely executive functions by endowing them with prerogatives <b>to</b> <b>act</b> independently and <b>impartially,</b> oriented by the principle of legality understood in the sense of supremacy of fundamental rights, in light of the doctrine of diffuse conventionality control adopted by the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights...|$|R
60|$|The {{conversation}} which Caesar {{held with}} Cleopatra deepened the impression which her first appearance had made upon him. Her intelligence and animation, the originality of her ideas, {{and the point}} and pertinency of her mode of expressing them, made her, independently of her personal charms, an exceedingly entertaining and agreeable companion. She, in fact, completely won the great conqueror's heart; and, through the strong attachment to her which he immediately formed, he became wholly disqualified <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>impartially</b> {{between her and her}} brother in regard to their respective rights to the crown. We call Ptolemy Cleopatra's brother; for, though he was also, in fact, her husband, still, as he was only ten or twelve years of age at the time of Cleopatra's expulsion from Alexandria, the marriage had been probably regarded, thus far, only as a mere matter of form. Caesar was now about fifty-two. He had a wife, named Calpurnia, to whom he had been married about ten years. She was living, at this time in an unostentatious and quiet manner at Rome. She was a lady of an amiable and gentle character, devotedly attached to her husband, patient and forbearing in respect to his faults, and often anxious and unhappy at the thought of the difficulties and dangers in which his ardent and unbounded ambition so often involved him.|$|E

My contention is that the author’s fail to accomplish their goal. To show this, I argue that the authors are inconsistent, that Singer has previously provided an account of impartiality that makes it just as unreliable on the same grounds as self-interested tendencies. By showing that the authors fail to address the actual target of Street’s dilemma, their argument and conclusion are overstated and that Sidgwick’s duality remains unresolved...|$|R

50|$|Notaries are {{independent}} and disinterested. Unlike attorneys or legal advisors, a notary {{does not represent}} or act {{in the interest of}} any one party. Instead, under the Dutch legal system, notaries are required <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>impartially</b> on behalf of all parties to a contract or transaction. For example, when real property is conveyed, notaries act for both the seller and buyer. They are subject to legal professional privilege and are therefore duty-bound not to betray client confidentiality, thereby giving them the right to withhold information in court as would an attorney or doctor. In cases where a notary acts as legal advisor to a particular interested party, the advising notary must counsel all parties including third party beneficiaries.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{consider}} the problem of Antimonopoly Policies of Japan in the year 2002 mainly from a local point of view. 　According to some critics, it is improper that the Japan Fair Trade Commission tries to expose a local bid rigging in spite of poor resources. However the disclosure of violation byJFTC tends to change legal minds of local entrepreneurs and so it is significant. 　I would like JFTC to help local concerned parties for improving the enforceability of them. It is significant that JFTC provides plaintiff on damages case with materials collected and discloses the record of a case. Any person may request to the JFTC to peruse or copy the record of a final and conclusive case under the Freedom of Information Act. The problem of protection of trade secrets is settled under the scheme of the Freedom of Information Act. Although it is desirable that Section 69 of the Antimonopoly Act should be revised like the provision of section 91 and 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure in view of the protection of trade secrets. 　It is desirable to increase the enforceability of JFTC in order <b>to</b> disclose prohibited <b>acts</b> <b>impartially.</b> JFTC should be given the same power of investigation as the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission. Original jurisdiction of the Tokyo High Court on a suit concerning offenses as provided for in Sections 89 to 91 inclusive should be repealed. After that measure JFTC should appoint district public prosecutors to be the personnel of the staff office and order them to investigate a local bid rigging before accusation. 　It is deserved to consider that JFTC should be attached to Ministry of Justice. With regard to the regulatory reform and consumer-oriented policy a council of JFTC should be estab-lished on the base of section 8 of National Government Organization Law and the council should suggest polices...|$|R

As time passed, the Doctor was overpowered by guilt, believing that his friendship with Harry somehow influenced his choice.

They were {{originally}} created to act as cybernetic rulers of their star empire, who {{were expected to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>impartially.</b> But too much time out of the body led to the leadership losing their humanity.

A J'rill ship used a single brain to control all functions instead of a normal starship crew. Each [...] "fleet" [...] would be centered around a single ship that contained that fleet's director. Other ships within the fleet would be operated by brains that had been conditioned for the tasks needed (so that, for instance, a brain on one of the small J'rill suicide ships wouldn't refuse to obey an order to ram an enemy ship and blow up).

40|$|In a {{perspective}} of indirect {{regulation of the}} labour market, this paper analyses the Italian legal procedure known as ‘certification of employment contracts’ (hereinafter ‘certification’). This procedure consists of {{an examination of the}} lawfulness of employment and supply chain contracts. Contracts are submitted to a panel of experts in labour law (civil servants, professionals, academics) who undertake a review of the documentation, perform advisory functions and decide whether to award certification or not. The panel takes into account the key principles underlying certification: fairness, {{the true nature of the}} agreement between the parties, and compliance of the contract with objective organizational and productive requirements. Certification seeks to enforce labour standards through the proper use of contractual models, in order to manifest the true intention of the parties and to represent their interests. In this paper the issue is addressed from a regulatory perspective. First, it is noted that all employment and supply chain contracts are eligible for certification. Although apparently different, these contracts share a common matrix: the global process of ‘vertical disintegration’ of the firm. Second, certification is seen as a form of labour market regulation, which is neither a compulsory process, nor a matter of pure self-regulation. Rather, it may be seen as a form of enforced self-regulation, or ‘co-regulation’ undertaken on a voluntary basis by the parties, relying on the competence and expertise of the members of the certification panel, who <b>act</b> <b>impartially.</b> Employers are under no obligation to refer their contracts to a certification panel, but if they do so and receive a positive ruling, the certification gives the contract a legal presumption of fairness, certifying its conformity with legal principles for the purpose of preventing disputes at a later stage...|$|R
