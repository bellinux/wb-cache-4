The findings reveal VC’s are eager to participate in <b>transition</b> <b>financing.</b> This participation is usually in the form of debt or preferred stock combined with sweeteners (warrants or conversion rights).

However, from this {{it should not be}} concluded that public debt is an adequate instrument to finance public investment. Within a microeconomic based growth model it is shown that tax financed public investments causes an intergenerative redistribution towards future generations. This, however, does not suffice to justify a financing by credits. The opportunity costs of tax financed and credit financed public investments are compared within the steady state as well as within the <b>transition.</b> <b>Financing</b> public investment by credits is only justified if a considerable under-supply of public capital exist initially.

A sufficient condition for strict stationarity and ergodicity of the model is established and the existence of the second- and fourth-order moments is discussed. It is shown that the model may have explosive regimes and still be strictly stationary and ergodic. Furthermore, estimation of the parameters is carefully addressed and the asymptotic properties of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator is derived. A modeling cycle based on a sequence of simple and easily implemented Lagrange multiplier tests is discussed {{in order to avoid the}} estimation of unidentified models. A Monte-Carlo experiment is designed to evaluate the methodology. Empirical examples are used to illustrate the use of the model in practical situations.

The methodology of the research combined quantitative and qualitative surveys among mortgage lenders and housing-savings banks in the Czech Republic with an analysis of secondary data. The purpose of the research was to get an idea about how efficient the market-based housing finance in the Czech Republic is and to point out its potential weaknesses and shortcomings.

40|$|A funded social {{security}} retirement program would imply a larger capital stock {{and a higher}} level of real income than an unfunded program that provides the same level of benefits. The transition from an unfunded program to a funded program that does not reduce the benefits of existing retirees or the present value of the benefit entitlements of existing employees would, however, require substituting explicit government debt for the equally large implicit debt of the unfunded program. This paper shows that such a debt <b>financed</b> <b>transition</b> from an unfunded program to a funded program is not just a change of form without economic effects. Such a debt <b>financed</b> <b>transition</b> would raise economic welfare if three conditions are met: (1) the marginal product of capital exceeds the rate of economic growth; (2) the capital intensity of the economy is below the welfare maximizing level (i. e., the marginal product of capital exceeds the appropriate consumption discount rate); and (3) the rate of economic growth is positive. Illustrative calculations based on U. S. experience since 1960 suggest that the present value of the gain from a debt <b>financed</b> <b>transition</b> to a funded program would substantially exceed the current level of GDP. More explicitly, even with a relatively high real consumption discount rate of 4. 4 percent, the present value gain would be about 1. 5 dollars per dollar of current net {{social security}} wealth or about $ 17 trillion. ...|$|R

We consider two initial situations, one for a private for-proﬁt sector where both hospitals and physicians are paid on a fee-for-service basis and the other for a public sector under prospective budget and salaried physicians. For the private sector, our model focuses on the type of interaction (simultaneous, sequential or joint decision-making games) that should emerge between agents after the introduction of the activity-based ﬁnancing system. In the public sector, the elasticity of the demand to the level of inputs seems to play a more crucial role in the <b>transition.</b> hospital's <b>ﬁnancing</b> system, strategic interaction, activity-based pay- ment system. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to enrich}} {{the debate on the}} overvaluation/undervaluation of the Czech koruna and the {{currencies}} of other selected transition economies by applying the concept of the debt-adjusted real exchange rate (DARER), thereby offering monetary policy makers another indicator for more responsive management of this important economic variable. The motivation for constructing DARER is the fact that many <b>transition</b> economies <b>finance</b> their long-term current account deficits with capital flows, which often leads to real overvaluation of their currencies. DARER can signal to the authorities that the real exchange rate is becoming unsustainable in the medium term and that if this signal is ignored, a currency crisis may ensue. The paper is in seven parts. The first three parts contain the theoretical underpinning of the concept. Part four defines newly proposed indicators of exchange rate overvaluation. Part five contains empirical DARER results for the Czech Republic. Part six and annex 1 to this work contain empirical DARER results for selected transition countries, including a brief description of those countries' exchange rate histories.
