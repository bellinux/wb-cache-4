2500|$|The Foreign Office had {{reservations}} {{over the}} nature and extent of the supposed protectorate and it never sanctioned the Lochner Concession, because it did not grant BSAC any administrative rights and it involved monopolies, prohibited in the BSAC Charter. However, in negotiations with the Portuguese government, Barotseland was claimed to fall within the British sphere of influence and the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 allocated the Barotse Kingdom's territory to the British sphere, although the boundary with Angola was not fixed until 1905. Lewanika protested that the terms of the treaty had been misrepresented to him. No BSAC Administrator was sent to Barotseland until 1895, and the first Administrator, Forbes who remained until 1897, did little to establish an administration. As the Foreign Office was not convinced that the Lochner Concession had established a British protectorate over Barotseland or given BSAC any rights to administer the territory, it considered that a new concession was necessary. It agreed in 1896 that a BSAC official would be appointed as Resident Commissioner to secure this concession. The first appointee died before taking up his post, but in October 1897, Robert Coryndon reached Barotseland as Resident Commissioner. Coryndon, a former secretary of Cecil Rhodes and member of the Pioneer Column, had been proposed by the BSAC, and his appointment was approved by the High Commissioner for South Africa as representing the British government. In his capacity as Resident, Coryndon declared Barotseland to be a British protectorate, resolving its previously anomalous position. Coryndon also confirmed that the 1890 mineral concession gave the BSAC no right to make land grants. In 1897 Lewanika signed a new concession (the Coryndon Concession) that gave the BSAC the rights to make land grants and <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in parallel to the king's courts. Next, in 1900, Lewanika signed a further agreement, (the Barotse Concession), which resolved some details that were in dispute following the earlier concessions and was drafted in terms compatible with the Barotseland-North Western Rhodesia Order in Council, 1899[...]|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{personal}} jurisdiction is fundamental in e-commerce disputes. The underlying principle <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> personal <b>jurisdiction</b> is physical {{presence of a}} party within the court’s territory. This principle is challenged in e-commerce {{on account of the}} nature of the internet which allows parties to trade in a virtual environment. Hence, physical presence within a defined territory is difficult to determine in such cases. States have framed laws or the courts have formulated various tests to determine physical presence in e-commerce. This thesis analyses these laws and tests in the European Union (EU), United States (US), and Australia <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> if they are clear and help the courts in <b>establishing</b> personal <b>jurisdiction</b> in e-commerce disputes to deliver consistent decisions. This thesis analyses the personal jurisdictional rules in the EU to highlight their success, identify drawbacks and recommend solutions. It is argued that the EU rules on personal jurisdiction are predictable and certain on account of the clear provisions of the Brussels Regulation (Regulation) and the on-going changes undertaken by the European Commission (EC) to reform personal jurisdictional principles applicable to domestic e-commerce disputes. The underlying concept <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> personal <b>jurisdiction</b> is the domicile of the defendant except in consumer contracts. The EU courts are guided by the letter of the law to deliver certain and consistent decisions in exercising personal jurisdiction. Further, consumers are provided special protection under the Regulation which helps to promote e-commerce. However, the Regulation is limited in its scope to e-commerce disputes within the EU. In international e-commerce disputes, the member state courts have to apply their national rules of jurisdiction. This limitation of the Regulation submits third State defendants to the personal jurisdiction of each member state amounting to the expansive exercise of personal jurisdiction. Although the EC has proposed to extend the Regulation to third State defendants covering international e-commerce disputes, it is argued that it will not resolve the problem because it will create deadlocks. Hence, it is submitted that a new solution is required <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> personal <b>jurisdiction</b> in international e-commerce disputes. Personal jurisdiction in the US is a product of case laws developed over a century by the US Supreme Court. The underlying concept <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> personal <b>jurisdiction</b> is the service of process on the non-resident defendant within the limits of the US Constitution. This thesis comprehensively analyses the US case laws beginning from 1878, tracing the development of personal jurisdiction before the evolution of the internet and e-commerce. This development is called the traditional framework of the Supreme Court. Apart from this traditional framework, there is no other guidance such as a specific legislation <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> personal <b>jurisdiction.</b> In such circumstances, with the evolution of the internet and e-commerce, the lower courts have extended the traditional framework or formulated internet-specific tests <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> personal <b>jurisdiction</b> in e-commerce disputes. It is argued that these different approaches are followed in resolving similar disputes, resulting in inconsistent decisions. This inconsistency is most visible in disputes between users of eBay. Moreover, the same personal jurisdiction inquiry is followed in both domestic and international e-commerce disputes, accentuating the problem. Hence, it is submitted that the lower courts follow various tests and principles which result in inconsistent decisions in both domestic and international e-commerce disputes, and the US therefore requires a new solution. Australia is an emerging e-commerce market. Similar to the EU, the Australian courts are also guided by legislation and court rules in personal jurisdictional inquiry in both domestic and international e-commerce disputes. The underlying concept <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> personal <b>jurisdiction</b> is the service of process on the non-resident defendant. It is argued that the Australian position, like that of the EU, is clear and predictable in domestic e-commerce disputes on account of the application of relevant legislation and court rules on personal jurisdiction. However, with the emerging e-commerce market in Australia, consumers need to be provided more protection with regard to personal jurisdiction. It is submitted that legislation similar to the Regulation in the EU should be enacted <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> personal <b>jurisdiction</b> in domestic e-commerce disputes. Although cases related to e-commerce are few, the High Court decision in Dow Jones v Gutnick has set the foundation for the development of personal jurisdiction in international e-commerce disputes. However, the High Court decision shows that Australian courts exercise expansive personal jurisdiction to protect Australian residents. It is submitted that this approach to personal jurisdiction in international e-commerce disputes is a disadvantage and needs to be addressed. Further, the thesis argues that the approaches followed by courts in the EU, the US and Australia will lead to deadlocks in international e-commerce disputes. This is a current and pressing issue in e-commerce which needs immediate resolution. Hence, the thesis examines the global efforts undertaken to bring about uniformity and predictability to personal jurisdiction in international e-commerce disputes. The application of model laws, international conventions and initiatives of OECD, UNCITRAL and The Hague will be analysed to argue that these efforts fail to address the issue. It is submitted that these efforts either do not address the issue of personal jurisdiction or there is lack of consensus among the States over a particular set of rules to govern personal jurisdiction in international e-commerce disputes. In identifying the problems in personal jurisdictional inquiry in the EU, the US and Australia, the thesis submits that the issue is two-pronged. First, in domestic e-commerce disputes there is uncertainty and inconsistency along with certain identified disadvantages in the laws <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> personal <b>jurisdiction.</b> Second, in international e-commerce disputes the varying approaches <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> personal <b>jurisdiction</b> are conflicting and create a deadlock. Hence, the thesis recommends separate solutions. It recommends that the States should regulate personal jurisdiction in domestic e-commerce disputes through codified laws or regulations, whereas personal jurisdiction in international e-commerce disputes should be regulated through on-line arbitration. In domestic e-commerce disputes, the thesis proposes a legislative approach for the US and lays down certain guidelines. The EU and Australia have been successfully exercising personal jurisdiction through codified laws and need to only address the drawbacks identified in the country-specific chapters of this thesis. In international e-commerce disputes, the thesis recommends on-line arbitration and provides draft rules which will help to resolve the personal jurisdictional problems identified in such disputes. These draft rules will be tested for their effectiveness under the current legal landscape, especially under the New York Convention, to argue for the use of on-line arbitration to resolve personal jurisdiction problems in international e-commerce disputes...|$|R
40|$|In {{paragraphs}} 53 and 54 of Mexico – Soft Drinks, the Appellate Body (AB) {{stated that}} a panel {{does not have}} a margin of discretion to decline <b>to</b> exercise validly <b>established</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> yet continued by implying that legal impediments precluding a panel from exercising its jurisdiction may nonetheless exist. This paper argues that the AB’s statements are both internally coherent and coherent in light of the whole of its jurisprudence by way of two arguments. First, a panel indeed has no margin of discretion to decline <b>to</b> exercise validly <b>established</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> However, jurisdiction is not automatically validly established. Second, legal impediments precluding validly <b>established</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> exist. These are, it is argued, Articles 3. 7 and 3. 10 DSU.

Under {{the terms of the}} bonds, the bond-holders were given the option of having the bonds paid in London, Frankfurt, Zurich, or New York. Because the case {{concerned a}} default in Argentina on bonds issued in Argentina (i.e., an act performed outside the United States in connection with activity outside the United States), in order <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> the plaintiff's could only rely on the third basis to sue Argentina under the commercial activity exception. Argentina made two primary arguments as to why the FSIA commercial activity exception should not apply: (1) the issuance of sovereign debt to investors was not a [...] "commercial" [...] activity and (2) the alleged default could not be considered to have had a [...] "direct effect" [...] in the United States. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court held that Argentina was not entitled to sovereign immunity. Reasoning that [...] "when a foreign government acts, not as regulator of a market, but {{in the manner of a}} private player within it, the foreign sovereign's actions are 'commercial'", the Court concluded that Argentina's issuance of the bonds was of a commercial character. As for the [...] "direct effect" [...] in the United States, the Court rejected the suggestion that under the FSIA the effect in the United States necessarily needed to be [...] "substantial" [...] or [...] "foreseeable" [...] and instead concluded that in order to be [...] "direct", the effect need only [...] "follow as an immediate consequence" [...] of the defendant's activity. Because New York was the place where payment was supposed to be made, the Court concluded that the effect was direct, notwithstanding the fact that none of the plaintiffs were situated in New York. Weltover's victorious position was argued by New York-based attorney Richard Cutler, while Argentina's case was argued by attorney Richard Davis.|$|E
