5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} {{led to the development of}} the prime number theorem.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s Baxter gained 34 caps as {{a member}} of strong Scottish teams, which {{included}} Billy McNeill, Pat Crerand, John White, Dave Mackay, Denis Law and John Greig. In his international appearances he scored three goals, and Scotland won 21, drew 3 and lost 10 of these matches. He made his international debut in November 1961, when Scotland beat Northern Ireland. Earlier in 1961 Scotland lost 9–3 to England at Wembley, and April 1962 Baxter and Crerand played brilliantly, helping Scotland <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> revenge with a 2–0 win.|$|E

5|$|Presently Alcibiades {{sailed to}} Tissaphernes with a {{detachment}} of ships. According to Plutarch, the supposed {{purpose of this}} mission was to stop the Persian fleet from coming {{to the aid of}} the Peloponnesians. Thucydides is in agreement with Plutarch that the Persian fleet was at Aspendus and that Alcibiades told the troops he would bring the fleet to their side or prevent it from coming at all, but Thucydides further speculates that the real reason was to flaunt his new position to Tissaphernes and try <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> real influence over him. According to the historian, Alcibiades had long known that Tissaphernes never meant to bring the fleet at all.|$|E
5|$|Previous Ramones records {{featured}} celebrity record {{producers in}} an attempt <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> sort of popularity. Since this method did not yield the results which they were expecting, Sire Records contacted the producers of 1978's Road to Ruin: Ed Stasium and ex-band member Tommy Ramone. Too Tough to Die has less production value than previous recordings by the Ramones. Because critics often disapproved of the sound quality on End of the Century and Pleasant Dreams, the band leaned towards a harsher sound.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the ACT's federal electorates {{have been}} mainly held by Labor, the Liberal Party {{has been able}} <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> footing in the ACT Assembly, and were in {{government}} for just over eight of the Assembly's 21-year history. Most of this was {{during a period of}} six and half years from 1995 and 2001, which ended when Labor gained a 14.1% swing at the polls. In contrast to the state elections, Labor has polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberals at every federal election since 1990, and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points.|$|E

5|$|As Erica moved {{towards the}} south and {{subsequently}} to the north, the cyclone strengthened, becoming equivalent to a tropical storm according to the JTWC by 1500UTC on 5 March. Erica later attained maximum sustained winds of 105km/h (65mph 1-minute sustained). However the system began to move against {{the direction of the}} wind shear environment, and it lost much of its organization. On 7 March at 2230UTC, Erica lost cyclone status and degenerated into a tropical low. The remnant circulation moved slowly to the northeast, and the wind shear conditions abated. As a result, Erica began <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> signs of organization. At this time the remnants moved towards the southeast {{as a result of an}} upper-level trough developing over Australia.|$|E
5|$|At King Edward's death, {{only the}} royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand. Medieval writers {{condemned}} {{him for his}} greed and for his pluralism. Hugh the Chanter, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the confiscated wealth of Stigand helped keep King William on the throne. A recent study of his wealth {{and how it was}} earned shows that while he did engage in some exploitative methods <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> of his wealth, other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour. The same study shows little evidence that he despoiled his episcopal estates, although the record towards monastic houses is more suspect. There is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life, and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} of atomic bombs lay outside the realm of the Ministry of Defence. One reason for this was that it was only created in October 1946, by which time Portal had already been appointed as CPAE. Tizard became the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence in November 1946, and in January 1947 he also became the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), which was established to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy. Tizard attempted <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> control over nuclear weapons policy. Anderson's advisory committee was abolished at the end of 1947, and two new committees were established in its place, the Atomic Energy (Defence Research) Committee AE(DR), which came under the DRPC, and was chaired by Tizard; and the Atomic Energy (Review of Production) Committee, which was answerable to Portal. But Tizard failed to gain control of atomic energy policy.|$|E

5|$|The Chief Minister {{is elected}} by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers {{alongside}} him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet. Whereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor, the Liberals have been able <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly, and were in government for just over eight of the Assembly's 25-year history, mostly {{during a period of}} six and half years from 1995 and 2001, when Labor won power. At the 2004 election the Australian Labor Party, headed by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, won nine of the 17 seats and formed the ACT's first majority government, but after the 2008 election was forced into minority government {{with the support of the}} Greens. Since the 2012 elections, the ACT has been governed by a coalition of Labor and the Greens.|$|E
5|$|After William's {{death in}} 1164, Hugh passed into royal service, while also serving as seneschal {{to the new}} Earl of Surrey, Hamelin, the illegitimate {{half-brother}} of King Henry II. On the Cartae Baronum in 1166 he held one knight's fee in the barony of Giffard. In 1167 Hugh paid a fine that is recorded in the pipe rolls for the custody of his nephew's lands at Tickhill. In 1170, he {{was present at the}} coronation of Henry the Young King in June at Westminster Abbey, when Henry II had his heir crowned as a king during the elder Henry's lifetime. During the Revolt of 1173–74 by King Henry's sons, Hugh was a partisan of the king. The revolt was brought about by the desire of Henry's three oldest sons <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> power during Henry's reign, and by mid 1174 the revolt had been defeated by the king. During the Revolt, Hugh fought at the Battle of Fornham near Fornham St Martin in Suffolk, a victory for royalist forces, but otherwise took little part in the revolt's suppression.|$|E

Oklahoma quarterback Gene Calame rushed twice <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> {{breathing}} room before the Sooners punted it away. Maryland took over on the Oklahoma 37-yard line. Quarterback Charlie Boxold completed a nine-yard pass to Dick Nolan. Halfback Chet Hanulak then connected with Nolan again. That {{was followed by a}} first down by fullback Ralph Felton on the Oklahoma four-yard line. Hanulak rushed to pick up twoyards. Nolan then ran to the left but was stopped by Oklahoma back Larry Grigg for no gain. Hanulak rushed again to pick up one more yard. Felton rushed from the one-yard line, but was stopped sixinches shy of the end zone, and Maryland turned over on downs. Maryland again drove inside the Oklahoma 10-yard line. Wilkinson sent in the alternate line-up and Oklahoma again stopped Maryland short. The Sooners fumbled at their own 20-yard line, but the Terrapins again failed to capitalize.|$|E

5|$|Later in the 1960s {{and into}} the 1970s, locally {{prominent}} bands gradually changed from primarily cover bands to more well rounded groups, while the city's musical opportunities grew with the foundation of venues and institutions. This period {{has been called the}} Normaltown River of Music, and included long-time local performers like Mad Dog Melton as well as Brian Burke, Davis Causey and Randall Bramblett, many of whom later worked with Gregg Allman and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The most influential local bands to emerge from this period included the Normaltown Flyers, and Dixie Grease. The oldest bar featuring live music in Athens is Allen's Hamburgers where the Normaltown Flyers were the house band for many years. Allen's opened in 1955 on Prince Avenue, closed for a brief time, and has since reopened on Hawthorne Ave. as part of a restoration project. Bars like The Last Resort (currently the Last Resort Grille restaurant) opened in the 1960s, beginning the local club scene just as some bands were beginning <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> regional fame for Athens.|$|E
5|$|The first World Cup was {{the only}} one without qualification. Every country {{affiliated}} with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players, very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances, and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>some</b> European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to The Football Association, even though the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929. Two months {{before the start of the}} tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.|$|E
