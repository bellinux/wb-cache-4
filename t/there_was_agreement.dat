While <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreement</b> {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E
5|$|The matter {{ended in}} court, {{with a case}} to {{determine}} whether Autolink {{should be allowed to}} take control of four train radios that were located in locomotives owned by Autolink, but operated by Ofotbanen. In a shareholder agreement between Autolink and Rail Management, the ownership of the train radios had been transferred to Autolink, but the agreement has clauses that specified that Autolink could not start a competing railway company. Stating that Autolink had been disloyal in regard to the contract, Ofoten District Court ruled on 17 July 2008 against Autolink's demand for an interim order to transfer the ownership of the radios to Autolink. The court ruled that an interim decision could not be made due to the complexity of the contracts, and that a normal lawsuit would have to be carried out to determine the matter. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreement</b> that Autolink, on 13February 2008, had bought five shunters from Ofotbanen for NOK12 million, of which NOK9.5 million was paid by Autolink deleting debt.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s saw high {{inflation}} and large public deficits. Several public committees were created solely to cut costs. One such proposal {{was to build}} a road to Flåm, with the proposal being led by Hans Kristian Seip, who was director of Bergen Public Road Administration. In 1925, following the appointment of Mowinckel's First Cabinet, it was proposed that the railway be built as a road, and the tracks laid later. One of NSB's board members proposed instead building a suspended railway. The plans to cancel the railway were stopped because of parliamentarian support for the railway. Part of the political support was because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreement</b> on a national railway plan, and removing parts of it would disrupt the geographical compromise. However, Parliament did vote {{to reduce the number}} of intermediate stations to one, which would allow trains to meet at Berekvam. The cost saving for a road was estimated at 30 percent. The issue of a road was taken up in a new vote in Parliament in 1927, but was again rejected.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreement</b> that a base {{should be}} established, there {{was far from}} local {{consensus}} regarding its location. Vest-Agder County Municipality argued that the base should be situated at Vest-Agder Central Hospital in Kristiansand, while Aust-Agder County Municipality wanted it at Aust-Agder Central Hospital in Arendal. The issue was decided by the Ministry of Social Affairs. The main argument was the Arendal was about of equal distance between Stavanger and Lørenskog and that a helicopter there could cover both Vest-Agder and Telemark, unlike one based in Kristiansand.|$|E
500|$|Though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreement</b> that {{separate}} para-church [...] "missionary societies" [...] {{could not be}} established (on the belief that such work could only be performed through local congregations), a doctrinal conflict ensued about how this work was to be done.

500|$|In 1963, Rangers {{governor}} William Jennings {{introduced to}} his peers {{the idea of}} expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season. His argument was based around concerns the Western Hockey League intended {{to operate in the}} near future as a major league. [...] Jennings also hoped inclusion of teams on the west coast would make the league truly national, and thereby, improve the chances of returning to television in the United States as the NHL had lost its deal with CBS. [...] While the governors did not agree to the proposal, the topic of expansion surfaced every time the owners met subsequently. [...] In 1965, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreement</b> to expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL.

2500|$|Because North Korea had not {{conducted}} a successful {{test of a}} nuclear device, the extent of {{its nuclear weapons program}} remained ambiguous through 2005 and much of 2006. Though North Korea conducted numerous missile tests (some of which were branded failures by international experts), the question of whether they had actually mastered all aspects of nuclear weapons technology – ranging from material production to complex nuclear weapon design needed to produce the final detonation – remained unanswered. [...] <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreement</b> in the U.S. intelligence community that North Korea could build a [...] "modest" [...] bomb with a yield of between 6 and 10 kilotons, but disagreement between Defense Intelligence Agency, CIA and the United States State Department over whether it could deploy a miniaturized warhead on a missile.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, {{this area}} was visited by chiefs and tribes of {{numerous}} indigenous peoples.

Members of many Native American tribes had been gathering in the valley for over 8,000 years to enjoy the healing properties of the thermal springs. [...] Around the 18th century the Caddo settled in the area, followed by the Choctaw, Cherokee, and other tribes from the Southeast across the Mississippi River. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreement</b> among the tribes that they would put aside their weapons and partake of the healing waters in peace while in the valley.

2500|$|The {{day after}} the race in 1927, the {{superstructure}} collapsed, caused by rot in combination with a heavy snowfall. This caused the introduction of public control with scaffolding and bleachers in Norway. By then, Holmenkollbakken was lagging behind internationally, and the world record at the time had exceeded 60meters. It was therefore decided that a new superstructure would be [...] tall and moved [...] further back. Besserudkjernet was partially drained in 1928, but the hotels, which received their water from the lake, would not allow draining the following years. In 1931, the lake was fully drained, which allowed the out-run to be longer. In the 1930s, talk of an 80-meter hill started, which would potentially be built in Rødkleiva, further out in Nordmarka. The Association for the Promotion of Skiing made a formal investigation into the matter in 1937. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreement</b> that the venue was becoming too small for international competitions.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-1939, Aerotransport, DNL and DDL met in Oslo to {{negotiate}} possible transatlantic routes.

A committee was established with representation from all four Nordic airlines. With the break-out of World War II, Pan Am terminated its Foynes route, instead moving it to the Azores to avoid the war zone. DNL started negotiations with Pan Am again, and proposed a pooling, where DNL chartered Pan Am aircraft and crew for the west-bound flights, while Pan Am flew the east-bound flights. With the Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, Aero's interest in the cooperation was reduced, as the Finnish authorities concentrated on their war effort.

Seating 32 in a heated saloon accessed by centre and end swing doors, these were the first tube cars without end gates. However, work on the line was stopped by the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and the 22 vehicles that had been received in 1915 were stored until 1917 when they were lent to the Bakerloo line. These ran on the extension to [...] Watford Junction with Piccadilly line trailers until 1920/21 when they returned to the Central London. Trailer cars were modified with new control cables compatible with the new motor cars and heaters, as the line to Ealing was not in tunnel, and two groups of stock formed, known as Tunnel (or Local) Stock and Ealing Stock. As traffic to Ealing increased, in 1925/26 eight of the original motor cars were modified to augment the Ealing Stock.|$|E
