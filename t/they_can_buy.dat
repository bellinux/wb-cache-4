5|$|Frog Fractions {{begins with}} a frog sitting on a lily pad. The player {{controls}} the frog, and must use its tongue to attack insects, while collecting and protecting fruit. The game later introduces upgrades that the player may purchase, including lock-on targeting, a cybernetic brain, and a flying dragon. When the player collects enough fruit, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> a warp drive, which lets them ride their dragon through an asteroid field to Bug Mars, where the player then battles an alien robot squid. The player is then sent to Bug Court, where they sign their work visa. The player then travels under the water below Bug Mars, while listening to a narrated history {{of the creation of}} boxing. At the end of the maze, the player activates a spaceship, and must complete a text adventure game to return to Bug Mars, where the game appears to end (actually fake credits). Upon returning, the player runs for president in a music simulator game. Regardless of how well they perform, they succeed in being elected president, and must complete a business simulator manufacturing bug pornography to unlock further upgrades. Once all required upgrades are collected the game concludes. The game takes about one hour to complete.|$|E

50|$|Broadcasting {{stations}} in Nagoya {{and other areas}} are older than those in Tokyo. However, {{in order to meet}} the large costs of making programs key stations were established in Tokyo to sell programs nationwide.

25|$|The rivers {{provide the}} most obvious means of {{transporting}} goods and people. A 700-kilometre boat journey from Basankusu to the capital, Kinshasa, can take several weeks. Major barge operators are Transports Fluvial et Commerce de l'Equateur (TFCE) and Office National des Transports (ONATRA). Passengers often travel in cramped conditions, in some cases travelling atop the logs being pushed along the river by the barges. They are victim to high prices for food and other essentials along the way. The frequent breakdown of these river boats puts passengers in a precarious position regarding daily sustenance; a delay of several days can oblige passengers to sell all their belongings so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> a meal. The poor communication within the country, generally, means that passengers cannot be helped by friends or family.|$|E

In November 2000, after the group had left the label, Sony issued The Best of Volume 1 without the band's involvement. Johns disavowed the compilation, [...] "We thought about putting out ads in the street press to make people aware that we weren't endorsing it, {{but that would have}} blown the whole thing out of proportion ... If people want to buy it, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> it but I wouldn't buy it if I was a silverchair fan." ...|$|E

In each domain, Kuros must find a golden artifact that belongs to the domain's [...] "Animal King" [...] {{and return it to}} him. Upon doing so, the path to {{the second part of the}} domain will appear. In the second part, Kuros must find the magic spell necessary to defeat the boss – the domain's Elemental.

Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed, Kuros obtains a piece of the IronSword, which is needed for the final battle on Icefire Mountain.

2500|$|One of Butler's {{reasons for}} his hunger strike was [...] "graduate {{students}} being robbed of their health insurance". In August 2015, the university had issued a statement to graduate students that said, [...] "The Affordable Care Act prevents employers from giving employees money specifically so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> health insurance on the individual market. Graduate teaching and research assistants are classified as employees by the IRS, so they fall under this ruling." [...] The university had known about the Affordable Care Act concerns since July 21, but put off communicating with graduate students until announcing on August 14 that subsidies would be cut, the day before graduate health insurance plans were set to expire. Conservatives criticized the protesters for blaming the loss of insurance on the university instead of on Obamacare.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} met with {{controversy}} upon its release when retail chain Walmart refused to carry the album unless an edited version was made.

At the end of the day, it's these kids who are getting fucked." [...] The edited version of the album removes the skull and crossbones, pentagram, and [...] "x" [...] from the album artwork; multiple pages are removed from the booklet, as are the album's lyrics.

[...] Jackson performed with the group on several dates, including joining them for a live a cappella rendition of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Overjoyed." [...] A biography stated it was a [...] "highlight" [...] moment for Timberlake which [...] "gave Justin {{a chance to show}} his family and friends how far he had come." [...] The tour was the largest audience the group performed for at the time; JC Chasez commenting [...] "That was great because we got to see how a real professional tours. And not only that she is really sweet. We really enjoyed it." [...] Chris Kirkpatrick added, [...] "She is very good at entertaining. We learned a lot — that if people want to hear just the music, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> the CD. But it's the whole live aspect of changing the songs every night or the whole theatrical performance that she puts on. She's definitely one of our mentors when it comes to touring and the stage show. Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see." [...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't just stand there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is not even the most influential member of the Jackson clan. That accolade firmly belongs to Janet Jackson", who was [...] "one of the most successful artists of the last twenty years." [...] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became [...] "good friends", ultimately leading to Timberlake performing alongside Jackson during a segment of Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher described opening for Jackson as [...] "the biggest event" [...] of his career and an [...] "honor", saying [...] "She's a definite entertainer, works hard and sweats every night. I learned a lot about how to make an artist look like a star." [...] Nick Lachey and group 98 Degrees opened for several dates and experienced increased commercial success following the tour.

We hypothesize that many investors consider purchasing only stocks that have first caught their attention.
