3000|$|The sample used in {{the dynamic}} light {{scattering}} (DLS) studies was prepared in duplicate and contained 4.3  mg/mL PS-b-PEO. Prior to the measurements, the sample was diluted 10, 50, and 200 times using HEPES buffer and each diluted sample was measured three times following protocols described previously [15]. The DLS apparatus consisted of a JDS Uniphase 633  nm 35  mW laser, an ALV sp 125  s/w 93 goniometer, a fiber detector, and a PerkinElmer photon counter. An ALV- 5000 /epp correlator and software completed the set-up. The DLS sample cell {{was placed in a}} <b>temperature-regulated</b> <b>bath</b> containing toluene as the index-matching fluid.

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} system for {{measuring}} planar lipid bilayer properties. The system is composed of a control unit, an output stage, an LCR meter, pumps for filling reservoirs, a bath with temperature regulation and a measurement chamber with four electrodes. The planar lipid bilayer is automatically formed using a folding method on apertures of different sizes. The automatization is assured by two syringes, which are clamped in actuators. Actuators are driven and controlled by a control unit via RS- 232 communication. The temperature of the planar lipid bilayer can be regulated between 15 and 55 °C. The regulation is assured by insertion of the measurement chamber into the <b>temperature-regulated</b> <b>bath.</b> Different shapes of voltage- or current-clamp signals {{can be applied to}} the planar lipid bilayer. By measuring the response of the planar lipid bilayer to the applied signal, the capacitance and breakdown voltage of the planar lipid bilayer can be determined. The cutoff frequencies of the system output stage for voltage- and current-clamp methods are 11 and 17 kHz, respectively...|$|E
