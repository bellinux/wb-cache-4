5|$|In 1932 {{women were}} allowed to join <b>the</b> <b>choir.</b> In {{deference}} to traditionalists, however, <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> {{was moved to the}} organ loft, so that the women would be less visible.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a common}} {{practice}} in convents and collegiate churches {{it is believed that}} there were usually choir stalls in the west end of the chancel (often called <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> or quire). Several Seddon pews remain here, although <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> today occupies the crossing.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1945, <b>the</b> <b>Choir</b> of King's College London, one of {{the most}} {{acclaimed}} university choirs in England, consists of around 30 choral scholars. <b>The</b> <b>choir</b> regularly broadcasts on BBC Radio 3 and Radio 4 and has made recordings mainly focus on 16th-century English and Spanish repertoire.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>choir</b> has broad arches {{with two}} wave {{mouldings}} carried down the piers which support the ribs of the vaulting. These {{may have been}} designed by Thomas Witney or William Joy as they {{are similar to the}} work at Wells Cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe. <b>The</b> <b>choir</b> is separated from the eastern Lady Chapel by a 14th-century reredos which was damaged in The reformation and repaired in 1839 when the 17th-century altarpiece was removed. The Lady Chapel was brightly painted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries following existing fragments of colour. To the south east of <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> and Lady Chapel is the Berkeley Chapel and an adjoining antechapel or sacristy, which may have been added in the 14th century, possibly replacing an earlier structure.|$|E

Parts of <b>the</b> <b>choirs</b> also form <b>the</b> cathedral chamber <b>choir</b> and a choir for Gregorian chant. <b>The</b> cathedral <b>choir</b> and <b>the</b> Capella Ludgeriana have been led by cathedral choir master Alexander Lauer since August 2015.

5|$|With these exceptions, {{most of the}} {{decoration}} and the fittings of <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> date from the 19thcentury and are {{in keeping with the}} Gothic Revival promoted by the Oxford Movement and Augustus Welby Pugin.

5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An {{example of this}} is his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of the}} voices of <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups of <b>the</b> <b>choir,</b> recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year's Eve.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length of <b>the</b> <b>choir,</b> past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle of <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.|$|E
5|$|An annual choral {{concert with}} soloists and {{orchestra}} has been {{performed by the}} combined choirs.

5|$|In September 2008, {{after his}} {{appearance}} on Britain's Got Talent {{but before the}} release of his first album, Johnston embarked {{on a tour of}} Norway with <b>the</b> <b>choir,</b> performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with <b>the</b> <b>choir.</b> Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> of York.|$|E

5|$|Major {{restoration}} {{work was}} carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation of fan vaulting in the nave, which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design. Oliver King had arranged for the vaulting of <b>the</b> <b>choir,</b> to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to continue into the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, probably for reasons of cost. In addition a stone screen between <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> and nave was removed. Scott's work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front.|$|E
50|$|The Orchestra also {{regularly}} {{appears in}} <b>the</b> Tabernacle <b>Choir's</b> weekly radio and TV broadcasts of Music and the Spoken Word, <b>the</b> <b>Choir's</b> acclaimed Christmas specials on PBS, and in <b>the</b> <b>Choir's</b> recording projects, including several on the Telarc label.
