5|$|Sirius can be {{observed}} in daylight with the naked eye under <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>conditions.</b> Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low down on the horizon. These observing conditions are more easily met in the southern hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius.|$|E

5|$|Many thrips {{species are}} pests of commercially {{important}} crops. A few species serve as vectors for over 20 viruses that cause plant disease, especially the Tospoviruses. Some species of thrips are beneficial as pollinators or as predators of other insects or mites. In <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{such as in}} greenhouses, many species can exponentially increase in population size and form large swarms {{because of a lack}} of natural predators coupled with their ability to reproduce asexually, making them an irritation to humans. Their identification to species by standard morphological characters is often challenging.|$|E

5|$|Matter falling onto {{a compact}} object {{is one of}} the most {{efficient}} mechanisms for releasing energy in the form of radiation, and matter falling onto black holes is thought to be responsible for some of the brightest astronomical phenomena imaginable. Notable examples of great interest to astronomers are quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei.

5|$|One of {{the first}} studies of {{condensed}} states of matter was by English chemist Humphry Davy, in {{the first decades of}} the nineteenth century. Davy observed that of the forty chemical elements known at the time, twenty-six had metallic properties such as lustre, ductility and high electrical and thermal conductivity. This indicated that the atoms in John Dalton's atomic theory were not indivisible as Dalton claimed, but had inner structure. Davy further claimed that elements that were then believed to be gases, such as nitrogen and hydrogen could be liquefied under <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>conditions</b> and would then behave as metals.|$|E
5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>conditions</b> or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E

25|$|A seventh {{catalytic}} type of proteolytic enzymes, asparagine peptide lyase, {{was described}} in 2011.

Invasins, such as pneumolysin, an anti-phagocytic capsule, various adhesins, and immunogenic cell wall components are all major virulence factors. After S. pneumoniae colonizes the air sacs of the lungs, the body responds by stimulating the inflammatory response causing plasma, blood, and white blood cells to fill the alveoli. This condition is called pneumonia. It is susceptible to clindamycin.|$|E
