25|$|After {{returning}} to Quanzhou in 1346, Ibn Battuta began his journey back to Morocco. In Kozhikode, he once again considered throwing {{himself at the}} mercy of Muhammad bin Tughluq in Delhi, but <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and decided to carry on to Mecca. On his way to Basra he passed through the Strait of Hormuz, where he learned that Abu Sa'id, last ruler of the Ilkhanate Dynasty had died in Persia. Abu Sa'id's territories had subsequently collapsed due to a fierce civil war between the Persians and Mongols.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson {{did not go}} to Staunton: {{his term}} as {{governor}} had just expired, but the legislature had not met to hold an election. After the raid, he took refuge at his farm in Bedford County, and Virginia had no governor for ten days. A number of legislators complained of Jefferson's actions and called for an inquiry into the conduct of the executive (Jefferson and his council), and Henry was among those who took the lead. The resolution passed, but the inquiry was set for the next session, and the legislature <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Jefferson was angered at Henry's actions, and held a grudge that did not abate until well after Henry's death in 1799.|$|E
25|$|From 30 April 1830 to 17 June 1833 Clio {{was under}} Commander John James Onslow. Around 19 July 1830 she sailed for South America, and on 15 December {{she was in}} Rio de Janeiro. Next, on 2 January 1833, Clio participated in the {{re-establishment}} of British rule on the Falkland Islands. Onslow arrived at Luis Vernet's settlement at Port Louis to request that the Argentine authorities replace {{the flag of the}} United Provinces of the River Plate with the British one and leave the islands. Lieutenant-Colonel José María Pinedo, of the schooner Sarandi considered resisting, but as most of his crew were British, <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and sailed on 5 January.|$|E

50|$|Raskolnikov {{from the}} novel Crime and Punishment wore a top hat from Zimmerman's shop before killing the pawn broker, but <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> wearing <b>it</b> to the murder, {{since it was}} already unusual and thus too {{conspicuous}} in 1860s Russia.|$|R

500|$|The method {{eliminated}} the psychoanalytic doctrine of neutrality. Reich {{argued that the}} psychoanalytic taboos reinforced the neurotic taboos of the patient, and that he wanted his patients {{to see him as}} human. He would press his thumb or {{the palm of his hand}} hard (and painfully) on their jaws, necks, chests, backs, or thighs, aiming to dissolve their muscular, and thereby characterological, rigidity. He wrote that the purpose of the massage was to retrieve the repressed memory of the childhood situation that had caused the repression. If the session worked, he would see waves of pleasure move through their bodies, which he called the [...] "orgasm reflex." [...] According to Sharaf, the twin goals of Reichian therapy were the attainment of this orgasm reflex during sessions and orgastic potency during intercourse. Reich briefly considered calling it [...] "orgasmotherapy," [...] but <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{policeman}} whistled {{and turned}} to look at the dark windows; he then took a step towards the door, as though to knock, a course which had infallibly proved our ruin; but seeing us already hurrying down the street under our double burthen, <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> or worse <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and followed in our wake.|$|R
60|$|The {{man seemed}} {{as though he were}} about to slam the door, but <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

6000|$|WALTER MAP. The father's eye was so tender {{it would}} have called a goose off the green, and once he strove to hide his face, like the Greek king when his {{daughter}} was sacrificed, but he <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> it: <b>it</b> was but the sacrifice of a kingdom to his son, a smaller matter; but as to the young crownling himself, he looked so malapert in the eyes, that had I fathered him I had given him more of the rod than the sceptre. Then followed the thunder of the captains and the shouting, and so we came on to the banquet, from whence there puffed out such an incense of unctuosity into the nostrils of our Gods of Church and State, that Lucullus or Apicius might have sniffed it in their Hades of heathenism, so that the smell of their own roast had not come across it-- ...|$|R
60|$|Alfred {{had turned}} pale at his visitor's first words. There {{was no mistaking}} Col. Zane's manner. Alfred well knew that the Colonel, if he found Betty had really been insulted, would call him out and kill him. Col. Zane spoke quietly, ever kindly, {{but there was an}} {{undercurrent}} of intense feeling in his voice, a certain deadly intent which boded ill to anyone who might cross him at that moment. Alfred's first impulse was a reckless desire to tell Col. Zane he had nothing to explain and that he stood ready to give any satisfaction in his power. But he wisely <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> this. <b>It</b> struck him that this would not be fair, for no matter what the girl had done the Colonel had always been his friend. So Alfred pulled himself together and resolved to make a clean breast of the whole affair.|$|R
60|$|The little sisters, Gretchens and Katchens, were {{learning}} away almost {{as hard as}} the Hermanns and Fritzes, but the bigger sisters had what Lucy <b>thought</b> a <b>better</b> time <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> One <b>of</b> them was helping in the kitchen, and another in the ironing; but then they had their books and their music, and in the evening all the families came out into the pleasure gardens, and had little tables with coffee before them, and the mamma knitted, and the papas smoked, and the young ladies listened to the band. On the whole, Lucy thought she should not mind living in Germany, if {{they would not have}} so many lessons to learn.|$|R

60|$|You have {{submitted}} {{what you}} {{intended as a}} dedication of your poems to me. I need scarcely say that, as a private letter, such expressions from such a quarter {{could not have been}} received by me but with pleasure of no ordinary kind, unchecked by any consideration but the fear that my writings were overrated by you, and my character <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> than <b>it</b> deserved. But I must say, that a public testimony, in so high a strain of admiration, is what I cannot but shrink from: be this modesty true or false, it is in me; you must bear with it, and make allowance for it. And, therefore, as you have submitted the whole to my judgment, I am emboldened to express a wish that you would, instead of this dedication, in which your warm and kind heart has overpowered you, simply inscribe them to me, with such expression of respect or gratitude as would come within the limits of the rule which, after what has been said above, will naturally suggest itself. Of course, if the sheet has been struck off, I must hope that my shoulders may become a little more Atlantean than I now feel them to be.|$|R
