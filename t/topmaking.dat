50|$|Born in Sydney, Rowland Smith {{was educated}} at Knox Grammar School, graduating in 1942. He {{served in the}} Royal Australian Navy from 1943 to 1947 and in the Naval Volunteer Reserve 1947-60, with the rank of lieutenant. After one year at the University of Sydney he became a wool grower and processor, joining the Country Party in 1956. He was Chairman of the Australian Merino Wool Campaign Committee and the Wool Buyers' Association. He was also the founder of Canobolas Wool <b>Topmaking</b> Pty Ltd in Orange.|$|E
50|$|<b>Topmaking</b> mills make wool top, a semi-processed {{product from}} raw wool. The process {{requires}} that the wool be scoured (washed) and combed and sorted. The longer fibers resulting from the process are called tops, and are in a form ready for spinning. To be closer to customers, much of the industry has moved from Australia, Europe and the USA to China. Many British companies produce high quality wool top in Britain from British wool and fibre; most work with the fleece from cleaning it to hand dying.|$|E
40|$|Eri silk {{produced}} by Philosamia cynthia ricini silkworm is a fibre not well-known to the silk industry, {{in spite of}} the fact that Eri silk is finer, softer, and has better mechanical and thermal properties than most animal fibres. Eri silk has a high commercial potential, as the host plants of Eri silk worms are widespread in diverse geographical locations, and the worms also have a higher degree of disease resistance than most other silk worms. Mills are often not aware of the properties of Eri for designing appropriate end products. Thus, Eri silk yarn is traditionally {{produced by}} hand spinning, and Eri silk usually ends up as material for handwoven shawls. The potential for bulk fibre processing and the development of soft luxurious novel Eri silk products is yet to be discovered. To better understand the material and its processing behaviour, Eri silk was characterised and cocoons were processed into tops through degumming, opening, and cutting filaments into different lengths, followed by a worsted spun silk processing route. Fibre properties such as fineness, crimp, strength and length at different processing stages up to combed tops were measured. The results indicate that staple Eri silk can be processed via the worsted <b>topmaking</b> route, using a cut length of 200 mm or 150 mm for filament sheets prepared from degummed cocoons. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{impact of}} staple {{strength}} on later stage processing of fine fleece wools (19 Âµm) and the blending with pieces is investigated. The staple strength findings complement those of previous researchers who used wools of different fibre diameters or from single flocks. The results reported here show that, as previously, the direct effect of sta-ple strength {{is limited to}} the production of tops, where staple strength influences fibre length in the top and the generation of combing waste. Blend-ing fleece wool and pieces was shown to increase combing noil and reduce fibre length in the top. The <b>topmaking</b> results conducted at CSIRO sug-gest that there may be an economic advantage in incorporating lower staple strength, and hence cheaper wools, in an all-fleeces consignment while still being able to meet the technical requirements for yarn and fabric production. Although statisti-cally significant, the small tenacity and elongation differences for 1 / 64 Nm yarns produced from the high and low staple strength test batches appear to have had no significant impact on the fabric tensile properties. There were no inter-batch yarn even-ness and fault level differences recorded, with top dyeing having a much greater influence on yarn quality than any differences associated with staple strength. Blending fleeces and pieces in a 60 / 40 ratio had a greater impact on processing from raw wool to fabric than the effect of staple strength over the range investigated. In comparison to an all-fleeces batch it would appear the economics of processing a fleeces-and-pieces batch may not be attractive, as the blend composition had an adverse effect on yarn fault levels, tenacity and elongation, which in turn may adversely affect weaving performance. However, the effect on fabric properties appears to be minor. Key words fibre, yarn, fabric formation, process...|$|E
