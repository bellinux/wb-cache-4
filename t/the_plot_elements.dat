5|$|In {{the week}} before its release, a number of texts {{purporting}} to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16 July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the U.S. edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date. The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena {{in order to identify}} one source. This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series' history. Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks. Reviews published in both The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times on 18 July 2007, corroborated many of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> from this leak, and about one day prior to release, The New York Times confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{replaced}} {{a different}} script Whithouse {{had planned to}} write, and {{was designed to be}} a romantic episode that could also be a good introduction to the show. Whithouse chose the setting to be Venice, and vampires soon entered the plot as he felt they belonged in the setting. The episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia in late 2009, with the old-fashioned village portraying Venice. The episode was seen by 7.68 million viewers in the UK and received an Appreciation Index of 86. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the comedy, production design, and acting of guests Helen McCrory and Alex Price, but thought that <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> were somewhat similar to a couple of other recent episodes.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Tintin in America, Hergé had been keen to produce a mystery story, and had been inspired by the tabloid speculation surrounding an alleged Curse of the Pharaohs following the 1922 discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Cigars of the Pharaoh proved a commercial success in Belgium, and Hergé followed it with The Blue Lotus, a story which continues many of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> that began in Cigars. The series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1955, Cigars of the Pharaoh was re-drawn and coloured in Hergé's distinctive ligne-claire style by the cartoonist and his Studios Hergé team; during this process a number of minor plot elements were changed. The comic was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse/Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin. Critical reception of the story has been positive, with analysis being focused on its innovative narrative and stylistic choices, {{as well as its}} introduction of three recurring characters, the detectives Thomson and Thompson and Rastapopoulos, who in this album appears to be a friendly, but in the continuing album The Blue Lotus is revealed as a villain.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plot</b> <b>element</b> of <b>the</b> fatal {{misunderstanding}} of the white and black sails is similar to—and might have been derived from—the story of Aegeus and Theseus in Greek mythology.|$|R
50|$|The opera is {{somewhat}} satiric in its intentions, but <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>element</b> of <b>the</b> love of an exotic queen for a European {{is also found}} in Meyerbeer's later opera L'Africaine.|$|R
25|$|Obsession, a 1976 film by Brian De Palma, {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by Vertigo, while his 1984 thriller Body Double combines <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> of both Vertigo and Rear Window.|$|E
25|$|George Lucas's Star Wars {{universe}} is often {{believed to be}} heavily inspired by Cha's works, as <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> and characters are near identical with those in Cha's novel Return of the Condor Heroes.|$|E
25|$|Instead of from life, the {{character}} {{seems to come}} from literature, for his name is reminiscent of Oroondates, a character in La Calprenède's Cassandra, which Behn had read. Oroondates is a prince of Scythia whose desired bride is snatched away by an elder king. Previous to this, there is an Oroondates who is the satrap of Memphis in the Æthiopica, a novel from late antiquity by Heliodorus of Emesa. Many of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> in Behn's novel are reminiscent {{of those in the}} Æthiopica and other Greek romances of the period. There is a particular similarity to the story of Juba in La Calprenède's romance Cléopâtre, who becomes a slave in Rome and is given a Roman name—Coriolanus—by his captors, as Oroonoko is given the Roman name of Caesar.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plot</b> <b>element</b> is {{inspired}} by 2 Hindi movies -Pasand Apni Apni and Naram Garam. A famous hotel comedy sequence from this movie was reused by Priyadarshan in his 2005 Hindi movie Garam Masala.|$|R
50|$|W. H. Hudson's second novel, A Crystal Age (1887), {{published}} {{two years}} earlier than Corbett's book, also contains <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>element</b> of a nineteenth-century man who cannot adapt to a matriarchal society of the future.|$|R
500|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> of Ruddigore were {{introduced}} by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, Ages Ago (1869), including {{the tale of}} the wicked ancestor and the device of the ghostly ancestors stepping out of their portraits. When Ruddigore closed, no new opera was ready. Gilbert again proposed a version of the [...] "lozenge" [...] plot for their next opera, and Sullivan reiterated his desire to leave the partnership. While the two men worked out their artistic differences, Carte produced revivals of such old favourites as H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, and The Mikado.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Tom Swift was conceived about 1910 by Edward Stratemeyer, {{founder of the}} Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book-packaging business, although the name [...] "Tom Swift" [...] was first used in 1903 by Stratemeyer in Shorthand Tom the Reporter; Or, the Exploits of a Bright Boy. [...] Stratemeyer invented the series {{to capitalize on the}} market for children's science adventure. The Syndicate's authors created the Tom Swift stories by first preparing an outline with <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements,</b> followed by drafting and editing the detailed manuscript. The books were published using the house pseudonym [...] "Victor Appleton". Edward Stratemeyer and Howard Garis wrote most of the volumes of the original series; Stratemeyer's daughter, Harriet Stratemeyer Adams, wrote the last three volumes. [...] The first Tom Swift series ended 1941.|$|E
500|$|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull {{received}} strongly polarized reviews, yet mostly positive; as a result, it {{has been}} nominated both for numerous [...] "best of" [...] and [...] "worst of" [...] awards. Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 77% based on 257 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9 out 10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Though <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> are certainly familiar, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull still delivers the thrills and Harrison Ford's return {{in the title role}} is more than welcome." [...] Another aggregator, Metacritic, gives the film a weighted average rating of 65 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Surveys conducted by CinemaScore indicated a general [...] "B" [...] rating from audiences, on an A+ to F scale.|$|E

50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that Howard here anticipated <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>element</b> of an evil wizard seeking to regain a magic ring which {{is the source of}} his power, which would a decade later form the center of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.|$|R

500|$|Several of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> are self-referential {{to other}} episodes of the series. Fort Marlene's {{presence}} is {{a reference to}} the first season finale [...] "The Erlenmeyer Flask," [...] when the alien fetus was first introduced; the term [...] "purity control" [...] is also a reference to this episode. The references to MUFON were purposely placed in the episode to connect to the story-arc involving Scully's cancer, which had been discovered during the show's fourth season. The episode also references and mirrors elements of popular culture. Fowley's apartment was purposely located in the Watergate complex, a hotel notorious as the location of the 1970s Watergate scandal. The scenes featuring Mulder and Scully being decontaminated were based on a similar scene in the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No, according to Spotnitz. He felt that the scene successfully played upon the sexual tension between the two lead characters.|$|E
500|$|The 2006 {{role-playing}} {{video game}} Final Fantasy XII contains several references to Vagrant Story. Terms such as Riskbreaker, Leámonde and Kildea (albeit with different spellings in the localizations), {{are commonly used}} in both games. According to an interview with Joypad, a French gaming magazine, in 2004, Yasumi Matsuno claimed during its development that Ivalice, the game world he created when he joined Square in 1995, is a complex world with a very long history and the stories of Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Final Fantasy XII are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map. The original plan, however, was not to place Vagrant Story in the Ivalice universe. Matsuno stated in 2011 via his Twitter account that <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> of Final Fantasy Tactics found in Vagrant Story {{were meant to be}} intertextual reference to the Ivalice title as a form of [...] "fan service".|$|E
500|$|The Yeomen of the Guard (1888), {{their only}} joint {{work with a}} serious ending, {{concerns}} a pair of strolling players—a jester and a singing girl—who are {{caught up in a}} risky intrigue at the Tower of London during the 16th century. The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi-early modern English in style, and there is no satire of British institutions. For some of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements,</b> Gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy, Broken Hearts. The Times praised the libretto: [...] "It should... be acknowledged that Mr. Gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things." [...] Although not a grand opera, the new libretto provided Sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious score to date. The critics, who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio, The Golden Legend, considered the score to Yeomen to be Sullivan's finest, including its overture, which was written in sonata form, rather than as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of his other overtures. The Daily Telegraph wrote: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>plot</b> <b>element</b> of Willie being {{programmed}} to kill Modesty in sight is {{a reversal of}} the scenario featured in the early 1970s comics strip [...] "The Puppet Master" [...] in which it is Modesty Blaise who is kidnapped and {{programmed to}} kill Willie on sight.|$|R

500|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>{{elements}}</b> of the German Reed Entertainments (as well as {{some from}} his earlier plays and Bab Ballads) would be reused by Gilbert later in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. These elements include paintings coming to life (Ages Ago, used again in Ruddigore), a deaf nursemaid binding a respectable man's son to a [...] "pirate" [...] instead of to a [...] "pilot" [...] by mistake (Our Island Home, 1870, reused in The Pirates of Penzance), and the forceful mature lady who is [...] "an acquired taste" [...] (Eyes and No Eyes, 1875, reused in The Mikado). During this time, Gilbert perfected the 'topsy-turvy' style {{that he had been}} developing in his Bab Ballads, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd. Mike Leigh describes the [...] "Gilbertian" [...] style as follows: [...] "With great fluidity and freedom, [...] continually challenges our natural expectations. First, {{within the framework of the}} story, he makes bizarre things happen, and turns the world on its head. Thus the Learned Judge marries the Plaintiff, the soldiers metamorphose into aesthetes, and so on, and nearly every opera is resolved by a deft moving of the goalposts... His genius is to fuse opposites with an imperceptible sleight of hand, to blend the surreal with the real, and the caricature with the natural. In other words, to tell a perfectly outrageous story in a completely deadpan way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Broken Steel was {{released}} on May 5, 2009 on Xbox Live and Games for Windows – Live (GFWL). It was quickly removed from GFWL due to bugs which made the PC version of the expansion unplayable, [...] and rereleased two days later. Some Xbox 360 users have reported a bug that prevents them from activating Project Purity, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> added by the DLC being inaccessible. [...] PC users report that changes caused by Broken Steel and the 1.5 patch adversely affect mods to the game.|$|E
2500|$|Noel Kirkpatrick of TV.com {{found that}} while the two-part episode {{provided}} a good adventure and several moments of comedy, there was an emotional disconnect between some of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements,</b> such as the lack of connection between King Sombra's rule and Twilight and her friends, or {{on the impact of}} Celestia's test on the events. Daniel Alvarez of Unleash the Fanboy awarded the episode five stars out of five and called it [...] "a truly great premiere to a great show" [...] with a premise that [...] "is pretty much perfect". He did, however, criticize King Sombra, noting that the character [...] "has virtually no backstory, and is just there". Alvarez did enjoy the design of the villain, calling it [...] "pretty good [...] like a demonic unicorn", but ultimately felt that was the only positive thing about the character.|$|E

50|$|Researcher Ruth North {{noted that}} <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>element</b> of a sinful human being {{transformed}} into a donkey as a punishment and then restored to humanity {{as an act of}} Divine mercy {{is similar to that of}} The Golden Ass by Apuleius — a classic of Latin literature with which Lewis was certainly familiar.|$|R
2500|$|After The Mikado {{opened in}} 1885, Gilbert, as usual, {{promptly}} turned his thoughts to finding {{a subject for}} a next opera. [...] Some of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> of Ruddigore had been introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, Ages Ago (1869), including {{the tale of the}} wicked ancestor and the device of the ancestors stepping out of their portraits. [...] Heinrich Marschner's 1828 opera, Der Vampyr, involves a Lord Ruthven who must abduct and sacrifice three maidens or die. [...] Locals claim that the Murgatroyd ancestors in Ruddigore are based on the Murgatroyd family of East Riddlesden Hall, West Yorkshire. [...] According to his biographers, Sidney Dark and Rowland Grey, Gilbert also drew on some of his earlier verse, the Bab Ballads for some plot elements. [...] The song [...] "I know a youth who loves a little maid," [...] {{can be traced back to}} the Bab Ballad, [...] "The Modest Couple", in which the very shy and proper Peter and Sarah are betrothed but are reluctant to shake hands or sit side by side.

2500|$|Andreas Deja {{declined}} {{to return to}} the film observing his more serious version of Yzma was incompatible with the wackier, comedic tone of the film, and moved to Orlando, Florida, to work on Lilo & Stitch. Animator Dale Baer would replace Deja as the supervising animator for Yzma. Fulmer would inform Sting by telephone that his songs, related to specific scenes and characters that were now gone, had to be dropped. Bitter about the removal of his songs, the pop musician commented that [...] "At first, I was angry and perturbed. Then I wanted some vengeance." [...] Disney eventually agreed to allow three of the six deleted songs as bonus tracks on the soundtrack album such as Yzma's villain song titled [...] "Snuff Out the Light", the love song titled [...] "One Day She'll Love Me", and a dance number called [...] "Walk the Llama Llama". <b>The</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> such as the romance between the llama herder Pacha and Manco's betrothed Nina, the sun-capturing villain scheme, similarities to The Prince and the Pauper stories, and Inca mythology were dropped. The character of Hucua was also dropped from the story, though he would make a cameo appearance as the candle holder during the dinner scene in the finished film. Kuzco – who was a supporting character in the original story – eventually became the protagonist.|$|E
2500|$|Gilbert's complex rhyme {{schemes and}} satirical lyrics {{served as a}} model for Edwardian musical comedy writers such as Adrian Ross and Owen Hall, and for such 20th century Broadway lyricists as P. G. Wodehouse, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Yip Harburg, Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick. Even some of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> <b>elements</b> from G operas entered {{subsequent}} musicals; for example, 1937's Me and My Girl features a portrait gallery of ancestors that, like the portraits in Ruddigore, come alive to remind their descendant of his duty. [...] Johnny Mercer said, [...] "We all come from Gilbert." [...] Alan Jay Lerner wrote that Gilbert [...] "raised lyric writing from a serviceable craft to a legitimate popular art form," [...] and, despite professing not to be a Gilbert fan, Stephen Sondheim wrote [...] "Please Hello" [...] for Pacific Overtures (1976), a song that has been called [...] "an homage" [...] to Gilbert. [...] Yip Harburg said, [...] "Perhaps my first great literary idol was W. S. Gilbert. ... Gilbert's satirical quality entranced us – his use of rhyme and meter, his light touch, the marvelous way his words blended with Sullivan's music. [...] A revelation!" [...] In the number [...] "Right Hand Man" [...] from the 2015 musical Hamilton by Lin-Manuel Miranda, George Washington refers to himself with irony as [...] "The model of a modern major general", which he rhymes with [...] "men are all" [...] and [...] "pedestal".
