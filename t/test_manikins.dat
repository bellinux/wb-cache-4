A 2 -stage programme of work has been defined to achieve this goal; comparison of the current in service harnesses, leading to the development of future restraint designs. This paper presents a sample of the results from the first phase of this research programme. It highlights areas where problems occurred and how they were overcome, the harness assessments that have been undertaken and it details the harness tensioning procedure that had to be developed to enable consistent strapping-in of the <b>test</b> <b>manikins.</b> The aim of {{the first phase of the}} programme is to identify and understand the biodynamic interactions of current in-service restraint systems in order to identify any issues that need addressing in future restraint system design. The QinetiQ decelerator track was used to produce 2 idealised ejection phases and a crash scenario. Four restraint types were assessed, the PCU- 56 /P (family), PCU 15 /P (family), which are torso harnesses and the Generation 1 and 4 integrated or combined harnesses. The restraint systems were mounted on a strengthened ejection seat structure, which enabled over 77 runs to be carried out at various seat attitudes including + 11 Gz,- 17. 5 Gxy and- 26. 5 Gxyz. Hybrid III manikin sensor outputs and tracked motion points were collated for each of these runs in order to determine the effect of the harness restraint...|$|E

40|$|A `user {{tracer gas}} test` was {{performed}} on laboratory hoods, with a human subject {{standing in front of}} the hood, to assess hood containment ability. The relationship of face velocity and cross draft variables to hood containment ability is investigated. The ability of these variables and other tests, such as smoke challenges or tracer gas tests performed with a manikin at the hood, to predict the results of the user tracer gas test is evaluated. All of the laboratory hoods tested in this study were identical bench top bypass hoods with horizontally sliding sashes. A face velocity traverse, cross draft measurements, a pitot traverse to measure exhaust flow, a smoke <b>test,</b> a <b>manikin</b> tracer gas <b>test,</b> and a user tracer gas test were performed on each hood in several different sash positions. Based on the data collected, face velocity, its distribution and variability, and the magnitude of cross drafts relative to face velocity are important variables in determining hood leakage. `Unblocked` vortices, formed such that no physical barrier exists between the vortex and room air or a person in front of the hood, are identified as important sites of leakage. For the hoods evaluated in this study, unblocked vortices were observed along the beveled side edges. The data support the hypothesis that in the presence of a person {{standing in front of the}} hood, leakage is more likely to occur if unblocked vortices are formed than if all vortices are blocked. Evidence suggests that cross drafts are more likely to cause leakage when flowing in a direction that may cause separated flow along a beveled edge of the hood and thereby augment the unblocked vortices along the edge. Results indicate that smoke <b>tests,</b> <b>manikin</b> tracer gas <b>tests,</b> and average face velocity all serve as useful monitoring techniques.

Details are provided regarding the NIST system for measuring the hearing aid directivity index under these conditions and how this system is used to implement a standardized procedure for performing such measurements.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the correlation of}} N 95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) fit between a Static Advanced Headform (StAH) and 10 human test subjects. Quantitative fit evaluations were performed on test subjects who made three visits to the laboratory. On each visit, one fit evaluation was performed on eight different FFRs of various model/size variations. Additionally, subject breathing patterns were recorded. Each fit evaluation comprised three two-minute exercises: "Normal Breathing," "Deep Breathing," and again "Normal Breathing. " The overall test fit factors (FF) for human tests were recorded. The same respirator samples were later mounted on the StAH and the overall <b>test</b> <b>manikin</b> fit factors (MFF) were assessed utilizing the recorded human breathing patterns. Linear regression {{was performed on the}} mean log 10 -transformed FF and MFF values to assess the relationship between the values obtained from humans and the StAH. This is the first study to report a positive correlation of respirator fit between a headform and test subjects. The linear regression by respirator resulted in R(2) = 0. 95, indicating a strong linear correlation between FF and MFF. For all respirators the geometric mean (GM) FF values were consistently higher than those of the GM MFF. For 50 % of respirators, GM FF and GM MFF values were significantly different between humans and the StAH. For data grouped by subject/respirator combinations, the linear regression resulted in R(2) = 0. 49. A weaker correlation (R(2) = 0. 11) was found using only data paired by subject/respirator combination where both the test subject and StAH had passed a real-time leak check before performing the fit evaluation. For six respirators, the difference in passing rates between the StAH and humans was < 20 %, while two respirators showed a difference of 29 % and 43 %. For data by test subject, GM FF and GM MFF values were significantly different for 40 % of the subjects. Overall, the advanced headform system has potential for assessing fit for some N 95 FFR model/sizes. VZB 3 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 06 - 17 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 25265037 PMC 447038...|$|R

Thermal manikins offer an alternative to the ethics of human subject testing; however, some manikin results have disagreed in a recent round-robin test. The source of the inconsistency between manikins could be methodological or calibration. Inconsistent measurements dilute the argument for using manikins in place of human subjects. Since manikins are not mass-produced and a variety of designs are in use, a calibration tool is needed to make manikin data credible and prove equivalence to human subject testing. Calibration by means of a standard clothing set can demonstrate consistency among manikins but not absolute accuracy.

40|$|Abstract Objective The {{quality of}} {{external}} chest compressions (ECC) is of primary importance within basic life support (BLS). Recent guidelines delineate the so-called 4 “-step approach” for teaching practical skills within resuscitation training {{guided by a}} certified instructor. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether a “media-supported 4 -step approach” for BLS training leads to equal practical performance compared to the standard 4 -step approach. Materials and methods After baseline testing, 220 laypersons were either trained using the widely accepted method for resuscitation training (4 -step approach) or using a newly created “media-supported 4 -step approach”, both of equal duration. In this approach, steps 1 and 2 were ensured via a standardised self-produced podcast, which included all of the information regarding the BLS algorithm and resuscitation skills. Participants were <b>tested</b> on <b>manikins</b> in the same mock cardiac arrest single-rescuer scenario prior to intervention, after one week and after six months with respect to ECC-performance, and participants were surveyed about the approach. Results Participants (age 23 [*]±[*] 11, 69 % female) reached comparable practical ECC performances in both groups, with no statistical difference. Even after six months, there was no difference detected in the quality of the initial assessment algorithm or delay concerning initiation of CPR. Overall, at least 99 % of the intervention group (n[*]=[*] 99; mean 1. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 8; 6 -point Likert scale: 1 [*]=[*]completely agree, 6 [*]=[*]completely disagree) agreed that the video provided an adequate introduction to BLS skills. Conclusions The “media-supported 4 -step approach” leads to comparable practical ECC-performance compared to standard teaching, even with respect to retention of skills. Therefore, this approach could be useful in special educational settings where, for example, instructors’ resources are sparse or large-group sessions have to be prepared. </p...|$|R
