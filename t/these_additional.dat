5|$|At each of {{the three}} schools, there are four main characters, who {{comprise}} the original twelve characters created for the short stories when the series began. Only those twelve appear in the subsequently adapted visual novel version. Other characters were introduced in the manga and light novel versions to create plotlines and conflict, and <b>these</b> <b>additional</b> characters are also featured in the anime adaptation.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the {{guidelines}} were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as {{up to two}} categories for that year. <b>These</b> <b>additional</b> awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but {{were not required to}} be repeated by future conventions. This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded for more than one year.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the features in common with HDMI (such as HDCP encrypted uncompressed high-definition video and eight-channel surround sound), MHL also adds the provision of power charging for the mobile device while in use, and also enables the TV remote to control it. Although support for <b>these</b> <b>additional</b> features requires connection to an MHL-enabled HDMI port, power charging can also be provided when using active MHL to HDMI adapters (connected to standard HDMI ports), provided there is a separate power connection to the adapter.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinals {{have made}} 18 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and 27 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. <b>These</b> <b>additional</b> picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. As the Cardinals have signed all of their first-round picks, they have never been awarded a supplementary pick under this provision.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{have made}} 11 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and have never made the first overall selection. They have also had 16 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. <b>These</b> <b>additional</b> picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.

5|$|The Rays {{have made}} nine {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft since their establishment in 1995. <b>These</b> <b>additional</b> picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Rays have failed to sign one of their first-round picks, LeVon Washington (2009), a client of Scott Boras who could not come to an agreed contract with the team. The Rays received the 31st pick in 2010 as compensation.|$|E
5|$|The Tigers {{have made}} nine {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and have made the first overall selection once (1997).

A clause was also inserted into the budget cutting state aid for schools that hold over $1 billion in endowments. The only school in New Jersey that fell into this category was Princeton University, which had an endowment with assets over $11 billion in 2006. The university that had the largest endowment next to Princeton {{at the time was}} Drew University which had a $225 million endowment fund.|$|E

5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by <b>these</b> <b>additional</b> discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E

5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price {{he would make a}} suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover <b>these</b> <b>additional</b> costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 27 June 1954, a CIA Lockheed P-38M Lightning {{attacked}} Puerto San José and dropped napalm bombs on the British cargo ship, , which was on charter to the U.S. company W.R. Grace and Company Line, and was being loaded with Guatemalan cotton and coffee. This incident cost the CIA one million U.S. dollars in compensation. On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed the Honduran town of San Pedro de Copán; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by the Guatemalan air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. The handful of bombers that the rebel forces had begun with were shot down by the Guatemalan army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide <b>these</b> <b>additional</b> planes, bolstering the rebel force. William Pawley had a crucial role to play in the delivery of these aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's Basic Law, {{implemented}} in the territory on 1 July 1997, consists of outstanding articles which require bill adoption by the Legislative Council before becoming effective laws. Two {{of the most prominent}} articles include Article 23 ("National Security") and universal suffrage of Chief Executive elections. In 2002, the government's motion of an anti-subversion bill pursuant to Article 23, was met with fierce opposition and eventually dropped. Reform bills on universal suffrage, however, have made partial progress in expanding the Chief Executive election's committee (from 600 to 800 in 2007 and to 1,200 selected members in 2012) and the Legislative Council (from 60 to 70 seats). <b>These</b> <b>additional</b> 10 seats are created through directly elected members of District Offices.|$|E
