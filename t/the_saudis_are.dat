25|$|While the {{campaign}} was successful, the power of <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>was</b> not broken. They continued to harass Ottoman and Egyptian forces from the central Nejd region of the Peninsula. Consequently, Muhammad Ali dispatched another of his sons, Ibrahim, {{at the head of}} another army to finally rout <b>the</b> <b>Saudis.</b> After a two-year campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, Abdullah ibn Saud, was sent to Istanbul, and executed.|$|R
25|$|A {{few years}} {{after the fall of}} Diriyah in 1818, <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> able to re-establish their {{authority}} in Najd, establishing the Emirate of Nejd, commonly known as the Second Saudi State, with its capital in Riyadh.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> out of <b>the</b> picture, exiled in Kuwait, the House of Rashīd sought {{friendly}} {{ties with}} the Ottoman Empire to its north.

50|$|Saudi Arabia {{attempts}} to block co-operative projects between other GCC members. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>are</b> blocking a proposed causeway project between Qatar and the UAE and a proposed gas pipeline project between Qatar and Kuwait, because of Saudi objections, the Kuwaitis are now {{turning to the}} Iranians for gas. The Qatar-UAE causeway, when combined with the planned Qatar Bahrain Causeway, would greatly facilitate travel between the three countries this would eliminate the need to transit through Saudi Arabia.|$|E
50|$|A {{history of}} modern {{relations}} between the Wahhabi-Islamic state and Ethiopia, beginning in the 1930s and culminating in today’s radicalization of Islam {{in the region and}} Ethiopia’s transformation from a “Christian island” into a multicultural state. The narrative follows the development of strategic relations ever since Mussolini’s conquest of Ethiopia through the Ogaden War and local activities of the terrorism networks of the 1990s. The conceptual dilemmas of Ethiopia’s Christian establishments, of Ethiopia’s Muslim communities and of <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>are</b> analyzed as they have developed along and influenced these processes.|$|E
5000|$|February 10: U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson visits Saudi Arabia {{to discuss}} {{potential}} U.S. {{investment in the}} Kingdom's oil and gas sectors. Following his visit, Richardson says <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>are</b> primarily interested in foreign investment in the natural gas sector and in the oil refining and marketing sectors, {{rather than in the}} upstream crude oil sector. Secretary Richardson's visit comes several months after a September 1998 meeting between several U.S. oil companies, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi, in which Abdullah requested proposals from the companies on the development of Saudi oil reserves.

50|$|In April 2008, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees {{estimated}} that the conflict had created 77,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Sa'dah Governorate.

50|$|In September 2009, it was {{reported}} that the S-400 system is part of a $US2 billion arms deal being negotiated between Russia and Saudi Arabia. As of March 2010, this was still under negotiation. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> want to buy twelve systems, each of eight launchers. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> trying to buy the more modern S-400, but the Russians reportedly only wanted to sell the older S-300.|$|R
2500|$|Richard Dearlove, {{former head}} of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), said that <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> [...] "deeply {{attracted}} to any militancy that can effectively challenge Shia-dom [...]" [...] Dearlove stated that, [...] "For ISIS {{to be able to}} surge into the Sunni areas of Iraq in the way that it has done recently has to be the consequence of substantial and sustained funding." ...|$|R
5000|$|Saudi Assistant Interior Minister, Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, {{described}} [...] "Yemen as {{a dangerous}} failed state and a growing threat to Saudi Arabia because it attracts Al Qaida and many Yemenis were more sympathetic to Al Qaida than Afghans." [...] He also said [...] "Yemeni President Saleh is losing control, and outlined a Saudi strategy of co-opting Yemeni tribes with assistance projects". The insurgent Houthi tribes were [...] "Takfiri and Shi'a 'like Hizballah South'. This was a threat forming around Saudi Arabia that required action now. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>are</b> funding projects in Yemeni tribal areas so the tribal leaders eject radicals." ...|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, Saudis had {{pressured}} Kuwait {{to backtrack}} on initial agreements with Iraq on issues {{dating to the}} Saddam-era. Saudi Arabia was also opposed to Qatar's and Bahrain's plan to seek better ties with Iraq. According to American diplomats, like the Iranians, the Saudis have not hesitated to use their money and political influence inside Iraq. Iraqi contacts assess that the Saudi goal and that of most other Sunni Arab states, to vary degrees is to enhance Sunni influence, diminish Shia dominance and promote {{the formation of a}} weak and fractured Iraqi government. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>are</b> using their money and media power through satellite channel like Al-Arabiyya, Al-Sharqiya and other various media they control or influence to support Sunni political aspirations, exert influence over Sunni tribal groups and counter the Shia-led Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) and Iraqi National Alliance (INA). A recent Iraqi press article quoted anonymous Iraqi intelligence sources assessing that Saudi Arabia was leading a Gulf effort to destabilize the Maliki government and was financing [...] "the current al Qaida offensive in Iraq." ...|$|E
50|$|In January 2014, Newsweek {{revealed}} that Saudi Arabia had secretly bought {{a number of}} DF-21 medium-range ballistic missiles in 2007. They {{also said that the}} American CIA had allowed the deal to go through as long as the missiles were modified to not be able to carry nuclear warheads. Saudi Arabia had previously secretly acquired Chinese DF-3A ballistic missiles in 1988, which was publicly revealed. While the DF-3 has a longer range, it was designed to carry a nuclear payload, and so had poor accuracy (0.6-2.4 miles (1000-4000 m) CEP) if used with a conventional warhead. It would only be useful against large area targets like cities and military bases. This made them useless during the Gulf War for retaliating against Iraqi Scud missile attacks, as they would cause mass civilian casualties and would not be as effective as the ongoing coalition air attacks. After the war, the Saudis and the CIA worked together to covertly allow the purchase of Chinese DF-21s. The DF-21 is solid-fueled instead of liquid-fueled like the DF-3, so it takes less time to prepare for launch. It is accurate to 30 meters CEP, allowing it to attack specific targets like compounds or palaces. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>are</b> not known to possess mobile launchers, but may use the same 12 launchers originally bought with the DF-3s. The number of DF-21 missiles that were bought is unknown. Newsweek speculates that details of the deal being made public is part of Saudi deterrence against Iran.|$|E
50|$|The Palestinian Arab {{delegation}} {{was led by}} Jamal Husseini and {{consisted of}} Awni Abd al-Hadi, Husayin al-Khalidi, Alfred Roch and Musa Alami. They were accompanied by George Antonius and Fu'ad Saba who were to act as secretaries. The Egyptian delegate was Aly Maher and Iraq was represented by its Prime Minister, Nuri Said. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> represented by Prince Faisal and Prince Khalid, both future kings of Saudi Arabia.|$|R

50|$|The {{precursor}} {{states to}} Saudi Arabia were Nejd and Hejaz. The state flag of Nejd followed today's Saudi flag pattern very closely. The state of Hijaz followed the patterns seen {{in countries like}} Palestine and Sudan. From 1744 a crescent was present. From 1902 until 1921 a different Arabic inscription was used. One of the primary opponents to <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Al Rashid family {{in the north of}} the peninsula, until their defeat in 1921.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{called the}} {{dispersal}} the [...] "clearest sign yet {{that the old}} Egyptian police state was re-emerging" [...] and added that its reporters saw no evidence of weapon stockpiles in the protest camps. Al Jazeera featured an article entitled [...] "The Egyptian coup and the lessons of Turkey" [...] with the sub-heading that military was backtracking on the democracy that Egyptians had fought for. International commentators asked if this could lead Egypt into a civil war or even make the country a failed state. Al Jazeera suggested that the Egypt conflict divided the U.S. and its other [...] "longtime" [...] regional partners over their stance on the issue. Qatari-owned Al Jazeera also singled out Qatar as an exception to Gulf Arab reactions in a supportive stance to the ones who ousted Morsi. It also highlighted the Gulf Arab reversion for the Muslim Brotherhood as a potential destabiliser to its own regimes. Bloomberg suggested the U.S. was in bind as its regional allies were supporting different sides in Egypt. It also drew parallels for foreign support for Syrian rebels amongst its allies, yet different sides in the Egyptian conflict. It quoted Brian Katulis, a foreign policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, who said: [...] "What we’re seeing in the Middle East is a competition for power and influence among the key states that are wealthier and have more resources. What Qatar and Turkey say is almost a 180-degree opposite of what the Emirates and <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>are</b> saying publicly." ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) leaves Iran with residual capabilities that positions {{it for the}} rapid development of nuclear weapons should it abandon the deal. This thesis examines how the JCPOA affects Saudi Arabia and what actions <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>are</b> likely to take. The Saudi premise of whatever they have, we'll have in regard to Iran leans toward a Saudi Arabian nuclear hedging strategy, but is it feasible? This thesis proposes a model that explores the interaction of threat, domestic factors, and current international nonproliferation regimes and how they drive a nation toward nuclear hedging. The model {{is applied to the}} cases of Pakistan, a nuclear proliferate nation, and Japan, the archetypical hedging nation, and later to Saudi Arabia. This comparative case study finds that despite its national will, technological factors—such as an impoverished scientific community—make Saudi Arabia's nuclear hedging untenable at this time. In addition to technical capability, {{the presence or absence of}} strong alliances factor into the national decision to hedge or proliferate. This thesis concludes by offering insight into when the United States should reexamine the Saudi Arabian case and what it should consider if the Saudis consider nuclear optionality.

40|$|The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia {{has survived}} the {{revolutions}} in the Arab world largely unscathed and entrenched {{itself as the}} undisputed leader of the Arab monarchies and the wealthy oil- and gas-producing states. More broadly, though, Saudi and Gulf rulers' concerns about their restive populations meld with confessional tensions associated with the pre-existing conflict between Iran and its regional adversaries. Saudi Arabia and its allies interpret unrest among the Shiites in the Saudi Eastern Province and Bahrain not as protest movements against authoritarian regimes but as an Iranian plot to topple legitimate governments {{with the assistance of}} the Arab Shiites. Riyadh has long feared that Tehran aspires to hegemony in the Middle East, and has consequently been pursuing an increasingly determined anti-Iranian regional policy since 2005. Since spring 2011 Riyadh has adopted a twin-track approach. Firstly, the Saudis have worked to stabilise the Jordanian and Moroccan monarchies and backed the Egyptian military, making Saudi Arabia the central proponent of the authoritarian status quo (ante) in the region. Secondly, Riyadh has increasingly taken the offensive. In March 2011 Saudi Arabia led the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar to rescue the Bahraini House of Khalifa after protests by Shiites threatened to spin out of control. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>are</b> operating even more decisively in Syria, where since September 2013 they have stepped up their supplies of money and arms to opposition and insurgent groups in order to bring about the fall of Iran's ally Assad.

5000|$|Michael Isikoff {{also argued}} {{there was nothing}} {{extraordinary}} about the evacuation of <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> because <b>the</b> Tampa airport had reopened.

Three planes violated that order and were forced down by American military aircraft that day. Yet <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> allowed to fly on the ten passenger Learjet. … The Tampa to Lexington flight is vital because it required permission from {{the highest levels of}} our government.

5000|$|The Saudi {{government}} {{issued a}} statement {{on the day of}} the attacks calling them [...] "regrettable and inhuman." [...] Saudi recognition to the Taliban (which worked with bin Laden) stopped and as of November 2001, the Bush administration continued to publicly praise Saudi support for the war on terrorism. However, published media reports have indicated U.S. frustration with Saudi inaction.

40|$|Saudi Arabian {{foreign policy}} {{decisions}} are made by a small group in private and with little public discussion or explanation. Open debates on issues are not encouraged, particularly those that have a direct relation to the nation's security. No concept of public accountability exists. Secrecy is stressed to ensure internal security, as well as stability in the society. However, foreign policy decisions are not made without considerable thought and time spent in discussing the issues with those the leaders of government believe can {{make a contribution to}} their understanding of the problems. The decision-making process has the following four characteristics: 1) There is a strong link between domestic and foreign policies because of the historical legacy of the state. For this reason, decision-making includes {{members of the royal family}} and religious establishment. 2) Other groups do participate and wield differing degrees of influence depending on the issue area. 3) Much bargaining occurs before an important decision is announced. 4) The process is slow, as the leaders are not prepared to meet crisis situations. For this reason, the leadership usually turns to outside powers to settle the problem. In addition to the delay in making a decision, there is also the failure to follow through. These characteristics are influenced by the increasing complexity of Saudi Arabia's regional and global environment, and by the growing demand on the country to play a larger role in global politics. The methods used by the government result more in a reactive rather than a pro-active policy. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>are</b> more likely to react to events, panic in crises, and delay making decisions at the time the decisions should be made...|$|E
5000|$|On 25 January 2010, the Houthis {{offered a}} truce.

A Saudi general announced that the Houthis had stopped fighting and were not on Saudi land anymore and that in response <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> also stopped fighting saying, [...] "The battle has ended by God's will." [...] But the Saudi king denied the Houthis had withdrawn saying they were forced out, and declared military victory {{for the end of}} their conflict with the Houthis.

50|$|On 2 January 2016, 47 {{people were}} put to death in several Saudi cities, {{including}} prominent Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr. Protesters of the executions responded by demonstrating in Iran’s capital, Tehran. That same day a few protesters would eventually ransack the Saudi Embassy in Tehran and later set it ablaze. Police donned riot gear and arrested 40 people during the incident. In response, Saudi Arabia, along with its allies, Bahrain, Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, and the Comoros cut diplomatic ties with Iran. Iran's foreign ministry responded by saying <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> using <b>the</b> incident as a pretext for fueling tensions.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Saudi Air Force {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as inferior in training and discipline to other Coalition air forces, and was seen as mediocre at best. For this reason, Saudi jets were kept well out of the active combat zone and assigned to patrols just inside the Saudi border {{in order to prevent}} them from interfering with ongoing operations {{by the rest of the}} coalition. It was for this reason that on top of vectoring the Saudi jets to intercept the Iraqi bombers, the AWACs routed a number of US Marine Corps AV-8B Harriers behind them in case <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> unable to complete the air-air kill.|$|R
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1979 Iranian Revolution <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> forced to deal with the {{prospect}} of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the Grand Mosque seizure in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979, and a Shiite Muslim revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year, which was known as the 1979 Qatif Uprising. Saudi Arabia is a near absolute monarchy, an Arabic speaking country, and has a Sunni Muslim majority, while Persian speaking Iran since 1979 is an Islamist theocracy with a Shiite Muslim majority, which explains the current hostility between Saudi Arabia and Iran.|$|R

5000|$|As Saudi {{expansion}} slowed in the 1920s, some {{among the}} Ikhwan pushed for continued expansion, {{particularly to the}} British-controlled territories such as Transjordan to the north - where the Ikhwan raided in 1922 and 1924. The few areas of central Arabia that hadn't been overrun by the Saudi-Ikhwan forces had treaties with Britain, and Abdul Aziz was sober enough to realize the folly of a potential conflict with the British. However, the Ikhwan had been taught that all non-Wahhabis were infidels. Faisal al-Dawish of the Mutair tribe and Sultan bin Bajad of the Otaiba tribe, {{the leaders of the}} Ikhwan, were among those who accused Abdul Aziz of going [...] "soft", with the former reportedly telling the latter that <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>were</b> [...] "as much use as camel bags without handles".|$|R

His son, Ibrahim Pasha, meanwhile led Ottoman forces into the heart of Nejd, capturing town after town in the Nejd Expedition. On reaching the Saudi capital at Diriyah, Ibrahim placed it under siege for several months until it surrendered in the winter of 1818. He then sent many members of the clans of Al Saud and Ibn Abdul Wahhab to Egypt and the Ottoman capital of Constantinople and ordered the systematic destruction of Diriyah.
