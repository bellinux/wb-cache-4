5|$|In 858, Bardas deposed patriarch Ignatios and {{appointed}} Photios, well-educated but a layman, in his stead. Later chronicles report that Ignatios had excluded Bardas from communion because he maintained an incestuous relationship {{with one of}} his daughters-in-law, but <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>reason</b> for Ignatios's deposition was probably the patriarch's staunch refusal to tonsure Empress Theodora against her will, as demanded by Bardas. The irregular elevation of Photios, however, riled with Pope Nicholas I, who refused to recognize it. Coupled with competition between Rome and Constantinople over their missionary activities in and jurisdiction over Moravia and Bulgaria, relations with the papacy remained tense.|$|E

On 12 October, Brezhnev called Khrushchev to notify him of a special Presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly {{on the subject of}} agriculture.

5|$|Presently Alcibiades {{sailed to}} Tissaphernes with a {{detachment}} of ships. According to Plutarch, the supposed {{purpose of this}} mission was to stop the Persian fleet from coming {{to the aid of}} the Peloponnesians. Thucydides is in agreement with Plutarch that the Persian fleet was at Aspendus and that Alcibiades told the troops he would bring the fleet to their side or prevent it from coming at all, but Thucydides further speculates that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>reason</b> was to flaunt his new position to Tissaphernes and try to gain some real influence over him.

5|$|The feud between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels also dated back to {{the fall}} of 1993. Jack Tunney {{announced}} that he was stripping Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough. There have been reports that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>reason</b> for vacating the title was because Michaels refused to drop the belt. Ramon won the title after competing in a battle royal and defeating Rick Martel, the other finalist in the match. In the angle, Michaels refused to acknowledge the title change, however, as he insisted that he was the true Intercontinental Champion. To gain revenge against Ramon for taking the belt, Michaels attacked Ramon and helped Irwin R. Schyster to steal Ramon's gold chains.|$|E

5|$|With {{the third}} edition of Erasmus's Greek text (1522) the Comma Johanneum was included. An often {{repeated}} {{story is that}} Erasmus included it, because he felt bound by a promise to include it if a manuscript was found that contained it. When a single 16th-century Greek manuscript subsequently had been found to contain it (Codex Montfortianus), Erasmus included it, though he expressed doubt as to {{the authenticity of the}} passage in his Annotations. Henk Jan de Jonge, a specialist in Erasmian studies, stated that there is no explicit evidence that supports this frequently made assertion concerning a specific promise made by Erasmus. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>reason</b> to include the Comma by Erasmus, was his care for his good name and for the success of his Novum Testamentum.|$|E

Jack takes Todd to the hospital, where he recovers but is frustrated when his family continues to defend Victor. Victor realizes he must leave town and says goodbye to his family.

5|$|On 20 May 1221 Maulay {{was accused}} of treason by Richard Mucegros and Hubert de Burgh before the king. The {{specific}} crime was alleged to be a plot to hand over Eleanor of Brittany, then held at Corfe Castle, to King Louis IX of France. Maulay was imprisoned for a short time, but on 4 June was released after surrendering Corfe to the king. He was allowed to retain his sheriffdom. The accusation may have owed more {{to the fact that}} Maulay had recently taken Mucegros' lands into custody because Mucegros had failed to make a payment due for a royal fine. The event may also have been used by de Burgh as an opportunity to weaken Maulay's patron and de Burgh's rival for power, Peter des Roches, while des Roches was out of England. The loss of Corfe by one of des Roches' primary supporters would have weakened des Roches' standing and power. In July Peter des Roches returned to England and in late July was instrumental in the clearing of Maulay from the charges of treason. Maulay was not given back custody of Corfe, but on 29 July the royal government discharged the 7000 marks that Maulay still owed for his marriage fine. The stated reason for the release of this debt was to compensate Maulay for his expenses while controlling Corfe, but <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>reason</b> appears to have been to compensate for the loss of Corfe. In late 1221 Maulay agreed to go on crusade with Peter des Roches and Falkes de Breauté, another of des Roches supporters. The loss of Damietta in September meant that the three men postponed their departure, and in November 1221 Maulay was replaced as sheriff. In return for Maulay's agreement to the ouster, the Exchequer wrote off more debts that Maulay owed the government, this time over 8800 marks. Maulay retired to his lands in Yorkshire.|$|E
