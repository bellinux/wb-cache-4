Häkkinen completed the top four, 1.2 seconds behind teammate Coulthard.|$|E

5|$|The {{race was}} resumed on lap 13 and Button, who had changed to {{intermediate}} tyres before the safety car period, {{was given a}} drive-through penalty for speeding behind the safety car, emerging in 15th place. Vettel began to enlarge his lead over Alonso and Massa in second and third. Alonso and the Mercedes pitted for intermediate tyres, leaving Massa in second and Kobayashi in third by lap 17. Barrichello, who switched for intermediates as the safety car came in, began setting times at the same pace as the leaders, and gained 15th position as <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> in front changed tyres. On lap 19, a rain storm arrived at the circuit, forcing <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> on intermediate tyres to switch back to full wets. Alonso and Button, who were in fifth and eighth respectively, fell to ninth and eleventh, while <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> on the full wet tyres began pitting for fresh wet tyres. The safety car was brought out on lap 20 due to {{the intensity of the}} rain, and Vettel, Webber, Massa and Buemi, who had not changed tyres, went to the pitlane for fresh full wets. After six laps under the safety car, the conditions were getting worse, and the race was suspended.|$|E

50|$|Pay-by-phone parking {{technology}} {{can be used in}} multiple ways: “start stop” and “start duration.” “Start stop” parking requires <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> to contact <b>the</b> pay-by-phone provider first when <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> initiates <b>the</b> parking session and then again when <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> wishes to terminate the session. Alternatively, “start duration” requires <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> to only contact the pay-by-phone provider when the parking session is to be initiated in which <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> dictates <b>the</b> amount of time the session will last. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> can also add on additional time or extend the parking session if needed.|$|R

5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with the soft tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers {{would be able to}} {{challenge}} the eleven-year old track record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the kerbs, forcing <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> {{to stay away from the}} insides of the corners. Pirelli chose the soft and medium compounds for the event.|$|E
50|$|The {{main part}} of the Artificial Passenger is the {{disruptive}} speech recognition.

It can recognize fluctuations in <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> voice to determine if <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> is sleepy, upset, or in a good mood through different vibration patterns in <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> speech. It also record the time it takes for a driver to respond in the conversation and from that determine if <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> is nodding off or being distracted by something.|$|R

5|$|At {{the final}} {{meeting of the}} World Motorsports Commission in December 2011, a series of {{amendments}} to the sporting regulations were published. Chief among these is the re-introduction of a rule that will allow all lapped traffic under the safety car (which remained the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG introduced in 2010) {{to be released from}} the queue before the car returns to pit lane, allowing <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> to unlap themselves and to ensure a clean restart.|$|E
5|$|Carless {{makes an}} {{impressive}} speech in Persian to convince <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> to continue into Nuristan. They climb an extremely indistinct track to the pass.

5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the National Anthem, three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte commanded <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> to start their engines. Edwards maintained his pole position lead going into the first corner with Earnhardt, Jr. in second. On lap two, Tony Stewart passed Edwards around the outside to take the lead. Edwards, with assistance from Bayne, moved in front of Stewart going into turn three to reclaim the first position two laps later. On the fifth lap, Earnhardt moved into the lead and Ambrose moved into second place. Edwards temporarily moved back into first before Earnhardt reclaimed the position. Bayne, who also battled for the lead, had moved down the field by lap seven. On lap nine, Michael McDowell made contact with David Gilliland's left-rear quarter panel between turns one and two; Gilliland went up the track towards the outside wall, and collected Menard and Montoya, triggering the first caution of the race and the appearance of the pace car. Keselowski was also caught up in the wreckage and his car sustained minor damage. Most of <b>the</b> <b>drivers,</b> including Earnhardt, made pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt was required to make an additional pit stop after one of his pit crew went over the wall too soon, dropping him down the field.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the rain-affected practice and qualifying sessions, the track was dry {{for the duration of}} the race. All of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> except Jenson Button, Jarno Trulli and the two Red Bull drivers started on the softer option tyre. The first lap was eventful: Alonso started better than polesitter Massa and was able to take the inside line into turn one and gain the lead. Hamilton passed Räikkönen for third into the first corner, then drove round the outside of Massa into turn two to take second place. Meanwhile, the suspension on Adrian Sutil's Spyker failed at turn four, causing it to collide with Button's Honda and retire from the race. Button continued after making an early pitstop to repair the damage. Liuzzi and Sato also collided at turn four, causing Liuzzi to pit for a new front wing. After the race <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> blamed each other for the incident.|$|E
5|$|In the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher was {{involved}} in a race-ending collision whilst trying to lap David Coulthard in heavy spray. After the race he stormed into the McLaren garage and accused Coulthard of trying to kill him, and McLaren and Ferrari team members had to separate <b>the</b> <b>drivers.</b> Coulthard admitted some five years later that the accident had been his mistake.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{terrorist}} attacks in Paris on the Friday evening of the race weekend, Formula One decided to honour the victims with all drivers wearing black armbands during the parade lap on race day as well as the French tricolore being displayed on the truck that took <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> around the track. French driver Romain Grosjean had already worn an armband with the flag of his country during Saturday's sessions. However, a long planned minute of silence for the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims was upheld and plans to dedicate the salute to the Paris attacks discarded.|$|E
