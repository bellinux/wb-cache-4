50|$|These devices sense {{a voltage}} {{to decide the}} Earth leakage. A {{single-phase}} voltage ELCB will have six terminals. Line in and out, neutral in and out, Earth (E), and fault (F). Metal body of the load {{is connected to the}} fault terminal of ELCB and Earth terminal is connected to the ground. For normal working, voltage across the <b>trip</b> <b>coil</b> is zero, because, the body of the load is isolated from the supply line. When an Earth fault occur on the load, due to the contact of line wire to the metal body, a current will flow through F to the ground.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper centers on the {{condition}} assessment of 11 kV- 33 kV distribution circuit breakers from the analysis of their <b>trip</b> <b>coil</b> current signatures captured using an innovative condition monitoring technology developed by others. Using available expert knowledge {{in conjunction with a}} structured process of data mining, thresholds associated with features representing each stage of a circuit breaker's operation may be defined and used to characterize varying states of circuit breaker condition. Knowledge and understanding of satisfactory and unsatisfactory breaker condition can be gained and made explicit from the analysis of captured trip signature data and subsequently used to form the basis of condition assessment and diagnostic rules implemented in a decision support system, used to inform condition-based decisions affecting circuit breaker maintenance. This paper proposes a data mining method for the analysis of condition monitoring data, and demonstrates this method in its discovery of useful knowledge from <b>trip</b> <b>coil</b> data captured from a population of SP Power System's in-service circuit breakers. This knowledge then forms the basis of a decision support system for the condition assessment of these circuit breakers during routine trip testing...|$|E

The method identifies the critical time instants in the close coil current, to be used for diagnostic analysis. Change points detection based automatic signal segmentation plays a significant role in recognition-oriented signal processing.

40|$|A {{distributed}} system, {{which supports}} circuit breaker maintenance and asset management, is described. It uses a client/server architecture for propagating expert knowledge from switchgear maintenance experts directly to maintenance operatives for on-site circuit breaker condition assessment and diagnosis. Prior {{research in the}} field of distribution level circuit breaker condition monitoring has shown the <b>trip</b> <b>coil</b> of a circuit breaker yields a current profile that, when tripped, can subsequently be interpreted as an indicator of plant health. Exploiting existing circuit breaker test equipment, a centralised archive of asset condition is built from routine tests permitting experts to examine trends in the data and pass their definition of the operating conditions to personnel in the field. This provides diagnostic support to engineers in the field. The system is currently in use as the subject of a pilot study conducted by SP PowerSystems intended to improve its ongoing maintenance and asset management activities...|$|E

Knowledge and understanding of satisfactory and unsatisfactory plant condition can be gained and made explicit from the analysis of data observations and subsequently used to form the basis of condition assessment and diagnostic rules/models implemented in decision support systems supporting plant maintenance. This paper proposes a data mining method for the analysis of condition monitoring data, and demonstrates this method in its discovery of useful knowledge from <b>trip</b> <b>coil</b> data captured from a population of in-service distribution circuit breakers and empirical UHF data captured from laboratory experiments simulating partial discharge defects typically found in HV transformers.

40|$|New {{maintenance}} {{techniques for}} circuit breakers are studied in this dissertation by proposing a probabilistic maintenance model {{and a new}} methodology to assess circuit breaker condition utilizing its control circuit data. A risk-based decision approach is proposed at system level making use of the proposed new methodology, for optimizing the maintenance schedules and allocation of resources. This dissertation is focused on developing optimal maintenance strategies for circuit breakers, both at component and system level. A probabilistic maintenance model is proposed using similar approach recently introduced for power transformers. Probabilistic models give better insight into the interplay among monitoring techniques, failure modes and maintenance techniques of the component. The model {{is based on the}} concept of representing the component life time by several deterioration stages. Inspection and maintenance is introduced at each stage and model parameters are defined. A sensitivity analysis is carried to understand the importance of model parameters in obtaining optimal maintenance strategies. The analysis covers the effect of inspection rate calculated for each stage and its impact on failure probability, inspection cost, maintenance cost and failure cost. This maintenance model is best suited for long-term maintenance planning. All simulations are carried in MATLAB and how the analysis results may be used to achieve optimal maintenance schedules is discussed. A new methodology is proposed to convert data from the control circuit of a breaker into condition of the breaker by defining several performance indices for breaker assemblies. Control circuit signal timings are extracted and a probability distribution is fitted to each timing parameter. Performance indices for various assemblies such as, <b>trip</b> <b>coil,</b> close coil, auxiliary contacts etc. are defined based on the probability distributions. These indices are updated using Bayesian approach as the new data arrives. This process can be made practical by approximating the Bayesian approach calculating the indices on-line. The quantification of maintenance is achieved by computing the indices after a maintenance action and comparing with those of previously estimated ones. A risk-based decision approach to maintenance planning is proposed based on the new methodology developed for maintenance quantification. A list of events is identified for the test system under consideration, and event probability, event consequence, and hence the risk associated with each event is computed. Optimal maintenance decisions are taken based on the computed risk levels for each event. Two case studies are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed new methodology for maintenance quantification. The risk-based decision approach is tested on IEEE Reliability Test System. All simulations are carried in MATLAB and the discussions of results are provided...|$|E
40|$|For {{predictive}} maintenance of circuit breakers, {{a number of}} variables {{must be considered in}} order to assess the genuine working condition of a circuit breaker [CB]. This thesis selects vibration signatures obtained on the operating mechanisms and arcing chambers as a source of monitoring breaker conditions. The task of analyzing the behavior of a circuit breaker is perennial and difficult but the thesis has an attempt to tackle this problem. Experiments have been devised to monitor CBs; however, these have limitations details of which will be discussed. For example, each circuit breaker has its own unique vibration signature and the shape of the vibration may be different even though breakers confront similar problems. CBs have decades-long service life spans and failure rates are relatively low. Those that fail are not necessarily saved and there have been relatively few samples to base evidence upon. There are different vibration analysis algorithms available including Dynamic Time Warping [DTW], Resolution Ratio [RR], Discrete Envelope Statistics [DES], event time extraction, Chi-square based shape methods, and fractal theory. Some of these algorithms are based on acoustic properties of materials and rely on assessing extracted time component and the frequency components are extracted. This research applies multi-resolution analysis [MRA] to decomposed signals to in order to assess different sub-wave levels so that wave features may be captured and modeled. There are many ways to analyze the waves. This thesis uses optimizing fuzzy rules with genetic algorithm [GA] as the proposed method. The simuation part of the thesis uses spring performance {{as an example of how}} vibration signature analysis may be implemented. Spring vibrations are evaluated by two classification algorithms: Dynamic Time Warping [DTW] and multi-resolution analysis [MRA] with optimizing fuzzy rules with genetic algorithm [GA]. The first method is competent to identify the faulty cases from the normal ones by looking at the deviation of the vibration signature frequency content. In contrast, it is not capable to identify the degree of how bad it performs from looking at the frequency variation. For the second method, it is capable of not only classifying the abnormal cases from the normal cases, but also distinguishing the vibration signatures into different category so that the spring condition can be retrieved immediately. Fuzzy rules is capable of classify a new case to a category and genetic algorithm is an effective tool to minimize the applicable fuzzy rules. The accuracy of the identification is very satisfactory, which is over 90 %. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is very useful for asset management purpose of breaker since the lifespan of the spring is known. Diagnostic technicians are able to make decision on the replacement scheme of the spring. There are some areas that this research uncovered that suggests further study is mandated. For example, there are other parameters that can be monitored and compared other than spring constant such as valve position in <b>trip</b> <b>coil</b> and close coil, acceleration parameter in changeover valves, damping in hydraulic cylinders and mechanical linkages, gas pressure in primary contacts and breaker resistance in line system...|$|E
