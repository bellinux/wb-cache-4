Engen {{was nominated for}} a SoapCentral Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2009. Some fans were upset that Adam and Rafe's [...] "sex scene" [...] was implied rather than shown onscreen; Branco spoke out about the issue, saying, [...] "ilming a sex scene between a straight and gay man could come off as offensive. Firstly, Adam would have to appear uncomfortable in the situation which could anger gay right groups, etc." [...] Muhney also approved of the decision not to show the sex scene, saying, [...] "or me, the way it was done was tasteful and it almost makes the audience wonder what exactly happened.

Writing for Rolling Stone, Barry Walters {{praised the}} {{acoustic}} songs, while considering <b>that</b> <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> Honor [...] "could have been easily pruned {{down to one}} disc", claiming the rock songs besides [...] "Resolve" [...] "strain so hard that the melody gets lost" [...] and went in a [...] "cartoonish headbanging fashion" [...] that [...] "accentuates the band's self-inflicted one-dimensionality", and that the [...] "sameness and vagueness of [...] love lyrics blunt their impact". [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club criticized the acoustic disc as [...] "gooey, undercooked, and embarrassingly unpalatable" [...] and [...] "reveal Dave Grohl's songwriting shortcomings", but praised the rock songs which are [...] "as loud and assaultive as just about anything Grohl has ever recorded", and considered that the [...] "first 10-song set sounds especially tight and ferocious; it's not all that diminished by the unfortunate revelations of disc two". BBC Music reviewer Tanya Byrne found the track list lacking, with [...] "several songs on this double disk that stand {{head and shoulders above}} the rest and truly represent how the Foo Fighters have developed" [...] while others [...] "let the album down" [...] and the record ultimately [...] "doesn't live up to the hype."

500|$|As the {{acoustic}} tour made Grohl realize [...] "we were making music worth listening to, rather than music made for pummelling the person next to you" [...] {{he decided to}} give more importance to the lyrics and [...] "have a connection with the crowd in front of us", considering that among the many compositions the band made on pre-production [...] "the ones that stand out {{are the ones that}} say something". So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that he was suddenly more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to show more of Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and the last thing I want to do is read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is." ...|$|E

That person is so close to you that you are able to share some things only with him.

2500|$|In early Japanese films, {{kissing and}} sexual {{expression}} were controversial. In 1931, a director slipped a kissing scene past the censor (who was a friend), {{but when the}} film opened in a downtown Tokyo theater, the screening was stopped and the film confiscated. During the American Occupation of Japan, in 1946, an American censor required a film to include a kissing scene. One scholar says that the censor suggested [...] "we believe that even Japanese do something like kissing when they love each other. Why don't you include <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> films?" [...] Americans encouraged such scenes to force the Japanese to express publicly actions, feelings that had been considered strictly private. Since Pearl Harbor, Americans had felt that the Japanese were [...] "sneaky", claiming that [...] "if Japanese kissed in private, they should do it in public too." ...|$|E

2500|$|The central {{message of}} the book is that gay men must accept {{responsibility}} for their lives, and that those who are still living must give back to their community by fighting for People With AIDS (PWA's) and LGBT rights, for, as Kramer states, [...] "I must put back something into this world for my own life, which is worth a tremendous amount. [...] By not putting back, you are saying that your lives are worth shit, and that we deserve to die, and that the deaths of all our friends and lovers have amounted to nothing.

2500|$|In this {{particular}} sonnet, the couplet {{acts as a}} summary of the basic sentiment of silent and stifled desire that fill the lines of the poem. [...] "So true a fool is love <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> will, though you do anything, he thinks no ill," [...] not only reiterates the dark romanticism that characterizes the entire sonnet, but Shakespeare also subtly establishes a connection between sonnet 57 and the succeeding 58th sonnet. Helen Vendler states, [...] "The slave of [...] reappears, rhyming for his couplet hell and well instead of their cousins will and ill of 57. The hell/well rhyme will return in the couplet of 129, and the will/ill of 57 has already been introduced into the sequence by sonnets 12 and 22. The complex will/ill/hell/well shared by sonnets 57/58 seems to have a life of its own, as its components add to themselves other conceptually related words". Literary editor Stephen Booth analyses the sonnet and claims, [...] "This whole poem may be described as a sustained play on 'to wait' meaning 'to serve', 'to wait on' and 'to wait' meaning 'to tarry in expectation', 'to await'". Booth also remarks upon the rhymes present throughout the sonnet and states, [...] "Note the incidental rhyme-like relationship of the very different functions performed by 'Nor think', 'think of nought' and 'thinks no ill'." [...] He also identifies the fact that Shakespeare, [...] "rhymes 'adieu' with 'you' a dozen times; {{there is no evidence that}} he ever gave 'adieu' its French pronunciation". Upon further analysis Booth also cites an undertone of forbidden love (reminiscent of Petrarch's signature poetry) and discusses the many double meanings present throughout the sonnet.|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare's Sonnet 57, {{shows that}} [...] "his {{love for the}} fair youth is seen as pure and even heavenly…" [...] but in other sonnets he {{introduces}} new characters, one in particular the Dark Lady, [...] "his association with the dark lady leads to infection and madness of love". [...] He also uses a terminology about his love and how beautiful it appears, but when this love is being directed {{to a young man}} this might appear out of the norm at this time. In the line [...] "Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you" [...] the word [...] "sovereign" [...] implies that the youth is held at a higher degree and [...] "watch the clock for you" [...] implies that he will wait for something to happen because of the youth's age or because he is waiting for the youth to recognise his love. [...] The line [...] "nor dare I question with my jealous thought" [...] implies that he has considered that jealously will raise doubts in his head and might drive his love to madness. [...] That this could end up driving the poet to insanity is suggested in this line, [...] "but, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought." [...] The Speaker is referring to himself as the slave again and is diminishing himself by implying no one would love so low and asking the fair youth to clear his mind of all thoughts of him. [...] Although he is comparing himself to a slave, the poet's love has never once subsided. [...] The last two lines saying [...] "so true a fool is love, <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> will, though you do anything, he thinks no ill." [...] The word [...] "will" [...] could be seen as desire or possibly used as a pun on his name, Will. [...] Since he thinks no ill, he is admitting that his love for the youth has made him a fool: [...] "Ultimately Shakespeare provides space for the homoerotic but must eventually return to the perpetuating systems of heterosexual love". This critique states that Shakespeare's sonnets must seen as a continuation of love sonnets that play with different ideas of love. Love could imply economic interest or patronage. Another way of viewing the poet's intent could be a sexual or erotic attraction (as the critic Rudd emphasises) or a brotherly or platonic affection.|$|E
