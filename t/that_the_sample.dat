5|$|Skorokhod {{function}} {{spaces are}} frequently {{used in the}} theory of stochastic processes because it often assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> functions of continuous-time stochastic processes belong to a Skorokhod space. Such spaces contain continuous functions, which correspond to sample functions of the Wiener process. But the space also has functions with discontinuities, which means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> functions of stochastic processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the real line), are also members of this space.|$|E
5|$|The metal is {{divalent}} {{and has a}} noticeably high volatility. In {{order to}} reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid einsteinium and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing. Also, some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant gas, for example H2O+HCl for EsOCl so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> is partly regrown during its decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, it is assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E
50|$|To scientifically {{prove that}} a {{compression}} method is not transparent, double-blind tests may be useful.

5|$|In 2012, Leo Joseph {{and colleagues}} {{acknowledged}} the finding but pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> {{might have been}} damaged and that further testing was needed before the issue could be fully resolved. They also noted that if Mascarinus was confirmed to be embedded within the Coracopsis genus, the latter would become a junior synonym, since the former name is older. In 2012, Hume expressed surprise at these findings due to the anatomical similarities between the Mascarene parrot and other parrots from the Mascarene islands that {{are believed to be}} psittaculines. He also pointed out that there is no fossil evidence found on other islands to support the hypothesis that the species evolved elsewhere before reaching Réunion.|$|E

Although Bear insists on leaving, {{the others are}} concerned about infecting the outside world. When he is asked to provide a stool sample, he attacks Mulder and tries to flee. Something moves under Bear's skin, and he dies when Hodge removes a small worm {{from the back of}} his neck. Now without a pilot, the group is informed that evacuation is impossible because of the weather.|$|E
5|$|While the {{question}} of whether Fermi's experiment had produced element 93 was stalemated, two additional claims of the discovery of the element appeared, although unlike Fermi, they both claimed to have observed it in nature. The first of these claims was by Czech engineer Odolen Koblic in 1934 when he extracted a small amount of material from the wash water of heated pitchblende. He proposed the name bohemium for the element, but after being analyzed it turned out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> was a mixture of tungsten and vanadium. The other claim, in 1938 by Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French chemist Yvette Cauchois, claimed to have discovered the new element via spectroscopy in minerals. They named their element sequanium, but the claim was discounted because the prevailing theory at the time was that if it existed at all, element 93 would not exist naturally. However, as neptunium does in fact occur in nature in trace amounts, as demonstrated when it was found in uranium ore in 1952, it is possible that Hulubei and Cauchois did in fact observe neptunium.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, the {{variance}} of the mean {{of a large number}} of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation.

To ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> sinks {{to the bottom of}} the gel, sample buffer is {{supplemented}} with additives that increase the density of the sample.

25|$|As {{early as}} 1913, David Waterston of King's College London {{published}} in Nature his conclusion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> consisted of an ape mandible and human skull.

A third opinion from the American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller concluded that Piltdown's jaw came from a fossil ape. In 1923, Franz Weidenreich examined the remains and correctly reported that they consisted of a modern human cranium and an orangutan jaw with filed-down teeth.|$|E

25|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry, or DSC, is a thermoanalytical {{technique in}} which {{the difference in the}} amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned.|$|E
25|$|For {{a finite}} {{population}}, the population mean of a property {{is equal to}} the arithmetic mean of the given property while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height {{is equal to the}} sum of the heights of every individual divided {{by the total number of}} individuals. The sample mean may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples. The law of large numbers dictates that the larger the size of the sample, the more likely it is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> mean will be close to the population mean.|$|E
25|$|To use {{a sample}} {{as a guide}} to an entire population, it is {{important}} that it truly represents the overall population. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{drawbacks}} to the TEM technique. Many materials require extensive sample preparation to produce a sample thin enough to be electron transparent, which makes TEM analysis a relatively time consuming process with a low throughput of samples. The structure of the sample may also be changed during the preparation process. Also the field of view is relatively small, raising the possibility that the region analyzed may not be characteristic of the whole sample. There is potential <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> may be damaged by the electron beam, particularly in the case of biological materials.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{suppose we}} wish to sample people from a long street that starts in a poor area (house No. 1) and ends in an {{expensive}} district (house No. 1000). A simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end (or vice versa), leading to an unrepresentative sample. Selecting (e.g.) every 10th street number along the street ensures <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> is spread evenly {{along the length of}} the street, representing all of these districts. (Note that if we always start at house #1 and end at #991, the sample is slightly biased towards the low end; by randomly selecting the start between #1 and #10, this bias is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|While, in principle, all fission {{reactors}} can act in {{all three}} capacities, in practice the tasks lead to conflicting engineering goals and most reactors have been built with {{only one of the}} above tasks in mind. (There are several early counter-examples, such as the Hanford N reactor, now decommissioned). Power reactors generally convert the kinetic energy of fission products into heat, which is used to heat a working fluid and drive a heat engine that generates mechanical or electrical power. The working fluid is usually water with a steam turbine, but some designs use other materials such as gaseous helium. Research reactors produce neutrons that are used in various ways, with the heat of fission being treated as an unavoidable waste product. Breeder reactors are a specialized form of research reactor, with the caveat <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> being irradiated is usually the fuel itself, a mixture of 238U and 235U.|$|E
