They suggested that existing methods partially recovered the performance losses due to skewness. On average, about 30 % {{or less of}} the performance loss due to class imbalance was recovered by these methods. Lopez et al. (2013) listed the main approaches to solve <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> data set problem during classification as instance pre-processing, cost-sensitive learning {{and the use of}} ensemble methods, and discussed the effect of data intrinsic characteristics. Paula et al. (2015) suggested a slightly different taxonomy of the methods to learn from <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> data as data pre-processing, special-purpose learning (changing existing algorithms to alleviate <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> data bias), prediction post-processing (using a threshold for class membership and cost-sensitive post-processing), and hybrid methods based on the first three approaches. Sun et al.

5|$|The {{mayor and}} council set local taxes and a budget, {{which must be}} {{approved}} by Congress. The Government Accountability Office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470million and over $1billion per year.

5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce <b>the</b> <b>imbalance</b> as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E

40|$|To {{diagnose}} {{rotating machinery}} fault for imbalanced data, a method based on fast clustering algorithm (FCA) and {{support vector machine}} (SVM) was proposed. Combined with variational mode decomposition (VMD) and principal component analysis (PCA), sensitive features of the rotating machinery fault were obtained and constituted <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> fault sample set. Next, a fast clustering algorithm was adopted {{to reduce the number}} of the majority data from <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> fault sample set. Consequently, the balanced fault sample set consisted of the clustered data and the minority data from <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> fault sample set. After that, SVM was trained with the balanced fault sample set and tested with <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> fault sample set so the fault diagnosis model of the rotating machinery could be obtained.

5|$|By January 2011, {{much of the}} nation's {{attention}} {{had shifted}} from the Gascoyne flood to the devastating floods in Queensland. Many residents struggling to get their lives back together were frustrated {{with the government and}} demanded aid. Though people affected by the floods were to be given A$15,000 in funds, they expressed further anger after hearing that residents in Queensland would receive A$25,000. On 11 January, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that <b>the</b> <b>imbalance</b> in funds was to be corrected and residents of Western Australia would receive equal amounts to those in Queensland. By 20 January, donations for flood victims from the Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund exceeded A$1million. Power restoration, especially in Gascoyne Junction, was unusually sluggish. Dozens of residents were without power for eight weeks, as electricity was finally restored between 12 and 13 February. This coincided with the arrival of replacement furniture from Paraburdoo; however, heavy rains renewed flooding and prevented most residents from picking up the supplies.|$|E

40|$|Classification is an {{important}} topic in statistics and machine learning with great potential in many real applications. In this paper, we investigate two popular large margin classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD), under two contexts: the high-dimensional, low-sample size data and <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> data. A unified family of classification machines, the FLexible Assortment MachinE (FLAME) is proposed, within which DWD and SVM are special cases. The FLAME family helps to identify {{the similarities and differences}} between SVM and DWD. It is well known that many classifiers overfit the data in the high-dimensional setting; and others are sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> data, that is, the class with a larger sample size overly influences the classifier and pushes the decision boundary towards the minority class. SVM is resistant to <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> data issue, but it overfits high-dimensional data sets by showing the undesired data-piling phenomena. The DWD method was proposed to improve SVM in the high-dimensional setting, but its decision boundary is sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> ratio of sample sizes. Our FLAME family helps to understand an intrinsic connection between SVM and DWD, and improves both methods by providing a better trade-off between sensitivity to <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> data and overfitting the high-dimensional data. Several asymptotic properties of the FLAME classifiers are studied. Simulations and real data applications are investigated to illustrate the usefulness of the FLAME classifiers.

5|$|The Hong Kong {{government}} generally {{respects the}} human rights of its citizens, and members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and the District Council of Hong Kong are elected into office by Hong Kong citizens. However, there are 27 ex officio members of the district council (the Rural Committee Chairmen in the New Territories) as of the fifth District Council Assembly, and roughly half of the legislative council seats are elected by 3% of the people in Hong Kong through the functional constituency. <b>The</b> <b>imbalance</b> of voting power in the LegCo has led to widespread criticism of its inability to represent Hongkongers' socio-economic needs. In addition, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong is elected by 1,200 members based on their contributions to four different sectors of Hong Kong's society. This policy has received criticism from various political figures in Hong Kong, and led to the Umbrella Revolution.

5|$|The great {{influx of}} bullion from the California Gold Rush and other finds caused {{the price of}} silver {{relative}} to gold to increase starting in 1848, and silver coins were hoarded or exported for melting. In 1851, a bill for a three-cent piece in 75% silver and 25% copper was introduced in Congress by New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson, who wanted to lower postage rates from five to three cents. This percentage of silver was less than the normal 90% so that the coins would circulate {{at a time of}} hoarding. The copper large cent did not circulate in the Pacific Coast region or South due to prejudice against coins that did not contain precious metal, and some means of allowing the purchase of a postage stamp without the use of copper cents was necessary. Dickinson's bill passed on March 3, 1851, and in addition to authorizing the new three-cent silver, lowered rates for most domestic mails. By 1854, <b>the</b> <b>imbalance</b> had abated, and Congress increased the silver content of the three-cent piece to the standard 90% for silver coins, though its weight was reduced.|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in <b>the</b> <b>imbalance</b> direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
40|$|The Support Vector Machine (SVM), a known discriminative {{classifier}} is {{ineffective in}} dealing with imbalanced classification problems where the training examples of target class are outnumbered by non-target class examples. Though cost-SVM (cSVM) has been proposed to tackle <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> datasets by assigning different cost functions to different classes, the performance is less than satisfactory due to its limited ability to enforce cost-sensitivity. In this research, a generative classifier, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is studied which can learn the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> data to improve the discriminative power between imbalanced classes. By fusing this knowledge into cSVM, a model fusion approach, termed CSG (cSVM+GMM), is proposed to tackle <b>the</b> <b>imbalanced</b> classification problem.
