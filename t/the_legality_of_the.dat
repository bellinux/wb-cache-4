5|$|During November 2002, Metropolitan Partners filed a grant {{request to}} the West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee. It {{received}} $10.6 million in infrastructure improvements. A lawsuit was later filed by the Jackson County, West Virginia lawyer Larry Harless, questioning <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> committee and its work. Eventually, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia nullified the grant process and the grants that were given.|$|E
25|$|So it {{was that}} Richard Henderson and company did their due diligence. They sent Daniel Boone to explore and report the finding. Richard Henderson went with Thomas Price and Nathaniel Hart to meet with Attacullaculla. They inquired about <b>the</b> <b>legalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crown law from high British officials. They did not however foresee the change that was coming that {{transformed}} Crown Law to American law.|$|R
50|$|Charlotte has a {{run-in with}} her former {{mother-in-law}} over <b>the</b> <b>legalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apartment {{she shared with}} Trey, and she hires Harry Goldenblatt as her divorce attorney. Despite his physical shortcomings she finds herself attracted to him, and they begin a sexual relationship. She soon finds that she is developing real feelings for him. Harry, however, reveals that he must marry within his Jewish faith, causing Charlotte to actually consider conversion.|$|R

5|$|Rockall {{is a small}} rocky islet in the North Atlantic {{which was}} {{declared}} part of Scotland by the Island of Rockall Act 1972. However, despite no posession by any other state and other precedents, <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> claim is disputed by the Republic of Ireland, Denmark and Iceland and some say, it is may be unenforceable in international law.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{was never}} {{successful}} in her {{more than a decade}} of legal pursuits for recompense from the United States government for seized land, in 1911 she was finally granted a $1,250 a month lifetime pension by the Territory of Hawaii. Historian Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted that besides being a greatly reduced figure from what she had asked for recompense, it also never addressed the question of <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seizure itself.|$|E
5|$|An {{order for}} review of {{detention}} directs someone holding {{a person in}} detention to produce the detainee before the High Court so that <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detention can be established. The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E

50|$|As January {{came and}} went, Travis Barker and La Salle {{still did not}} have any plans of {{releasing}} 144 Hours. The band played a few local shows and felt increasingly stifled by <b>the</b> label's lack <b>of</b> interest and support. <b>The</b> <b>legalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract were difficult to maneuver and with Shane now part of Travis' new band, personal feelings and relationships became stressed. the Nervous return was at a standstill holding the best record they had ever recorded in one hand and an oppressive recording contract in the other. After a few months of cognitive dissonance and psychological disintegration, the Nervous return finally called it quits in April 2006.|$|R
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Bradley moved to Louisville and resumed his legal practice. Shortly after Bradley left office, Goebel and his running mate, J. C. W. Beckham, {{challenged}} {{the results of}} the 1899 election in the General Assembly, per the state constitution. All the candidates for the state's minor offices contested as well. Bradley and his colleague Augustus Willson formed part of the legal team that represented the Republicans before the General Assembly and in court, where they challenged <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goebel Election Law and, later, the actions of the General Assembly's contest committee.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 1781, Zong {{arrived at}} Black River, Jamaica, with 208slaves on board, {{less than half}} the number taken from Africa. These sold for an average price of £36 each. The Jamaican Vice-Admiralty court upheld <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British capture of Zong from the Dutch, and the {{syndicate}} renamed the ship Richard of Jamaica. Luke Collingwood died three days after Zong reached Jamaica, two years before the 1783 court proceedings about the case.|$|E
40|$|Although the new Criminal Code made {{a series}} <b>of</b> {{amendments}} to <b>the</b> criminal legislation, <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation has not been significantly changed, but only from <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> governing rules. Thus, while the previous Criminal Code regulated through a single provision both <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminal penalties, <b>the</b> new Criminal Code has split <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and criminal penalties into two principles - <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminal penalties, by allocating them two separate articles in Chapter I of Title I <b>of</b> <b>the</b> General Part. In this article, we aim to examine <b>the</b> theoretical side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and to analyse some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important legal issues concerning <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> this principle in the case-law...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{atmosphere}} in which the New York City press accused <b>the</b> Soviets <b>of</b> holding Kasenkina against her will, on 11 August New York Supreme Court Justice Samuel Dickstein issued a writ of habeas corpus on Consul-General Lomakin, demanding that he present Kasenkina the following day in court. The same day a Soviet consular official stated that Lomakin would not be presenting Kasenkina, and the following morning Ambassador Panyushkin presented the State Department with a note disputing <b>the</b> <b>legalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writ under international law. A State Department legal adviser wrote to Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey, outlining the Soviet complaints and urged Justice Dickstein {{to take the case}} under advisement. Shortly afterwards Justice Dickstein reserved decision in the proceedings.|$|R
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture. Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E
5|$|The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is a {{permanent}} rescue funding programme to succeed the temporary European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism in July 2012 {{but it had to}} be postponed until after the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany had confirmed <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measures on 12 September 2012. The permanent bailout fund entered into force for 16 signatories on 27 September 2012. It became effective in Estonia on 4 October 2012 after the completion of their ratification process.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> annexation of Texas {{stems from the}} fact that Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E
40|$|Iraqi Freedom Operation {{has opened}} a wide debate on the {{international}} law concerning <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> force. <b>The</b> terms <b>of</b> this debate exceed {{in many ways the}} discussions usually accompanying an isolated use of armed force.

50|$|Community {{archaeology}} in the United Kingdom {{has existed}} for many years, although only recently has it {{come to be known}} by that name. <b>The</b> roots <b>of</b> archaeology in <b>the</b> United Kingdom lie in <b>the</b> tradition <b>of</b> antiquarian and amateur work, and many county or locally based archaeology and history societies founded over a century ago have continued to enable <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> local people in archaeology. Up until the 1970s volunteers often had opportunities to initiate or take part in archaeological investigations. Since then the recognition that more investigations were required by <b>the</b> subsequent establishment <b>of</b> archaeological units eroded some of these opportunities; more significantly <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> archaeology to <b>the</b> <b>legalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planning process through Planning Policy Guidance note 16 (PPG16) and <b>the</b> full professionalization <b>of</b> archaeology, has made public participation in archaeology extremely limited.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bat'leth in the United States differs between states.

In New Jersey, bat'leths are {{considered}} weapons and are liable to be seized. The Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered and seized a bat'leth as part of a cache of weapons in connection with a $4 million Medicare fraud investigation in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Around late 1224 {{or early}} 1225, Alice married Bohemond, eldest son of Bohemond IV, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. Pope Honorius ordered Eustorgius, Archbishop of Nicosia, to inquire into <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriage. Alice, who {{continued}} to regard herself as regent, wanted to appoint her new husband as bailli, but this appointment was opposed by all Cypriot barons. Alice then offered the office to Aimery Barlais, who was amenable, but the High Court ruled that Alice could not replace Philip of Ibelin who had been made bailli {{for the duration of}} her son's minority. Barlais left the island to join Alice, while his supporter, Gavin of Chenichy visited with the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, who had decided to launch a crusade for the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, a Mr Bowker from Shawford {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the towpath to be diverted, but this was overturned when Rev. J H Du Boulay appealed against the decision. The diversion was sanctioned in 1914, {{although there have been}} doubts about <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action, and subsequently two further diversions were made, at Chickenhall, near the southern end and at Hockley, near the northern end. No maintenance was carried out on the waterway until the formation of Catchment Boards. Thus responsibility for the waterway as a drainage channel passed to the Hampshire Catchment Board in 1942, and some work was carried out to maintain the integrity of the waterway. These responsibilities later passed to the Southern Water Authority, and now reside with the Environment Agency.|$|E
50|$|Djuanda's {{death and}} <b>the</b> {{abolition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post <b>of</b> Prime Minister in the Indonesian Republican system allowed far greater {{power to be}} exercised by the President- now being given full ruling power with minimal oversight, as both Head of State and Head of Government. This had {{an enormous impact on}} Indonesian politics, allowing <b>the</b> constitutional <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> autocracy <b>of</b> Sukarno and Suharto.|$|R
50|$|After a {{high court}} victory by two MPs {{challenging}} <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> DRIPA, <b>the</b> UK government {{appealed to the}} ECJ, but in December 2016 <b>the</b> verdict <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national court was upheld. The ECJ ruled that general and indiscriminate retention of emails and electronic communications by governments was illegal, opening the way to challenges against the UK’s new Investigatory Powers Act (2016), which replaced DRIPA.|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s, {{the value}} of the towpath as a leisure amenity began to be recognised. The Deputy County Clerk for Hampshire walked along the towpath from end to end in 1966, {{together}} with members of the Ramblers Association. He decided that rather than challenge <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towpath diversions, he would invite the local authorities through which the navigation ran to assume responsibility for maintaining the towpath. These organisations were Southampton County Borough Council, Eastleigh Borough Council, Winchester Rural District Council and Winchester City Council. The construction of weirs at most of the locks by the Southern Water Authority resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of the navigation. The powers of the navigation were enshrined in Acts of Parliament obtained in 1665, 1767, 1795, 1802, 1811 and 1820, none of which have been repealed.|$|E
5|$|In their decision, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the {{application}} of curfews against citizens is constitutional. As a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States, both decided on June 21, 1943, the court affirmed the conviction of U.S.-born Minoru Yasui. The court remanded {{the case to the}} district court for sentencing as the lower court had determined the curfew was not valid against citizens, but Yasui had forfeited his citizenship by working for the Japanese consulate. The Yasui and Hirabayashi decisions, along with the later Ex parte Endo and Korematsu v. United States decisions, determined <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curfews and relocations during the war. In the 1980s, new information was used to vacate the conviction of Yasui.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 {{amendments}} to the ISA were challenged before the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989). Justice Frederick Arthur Chua held that sections 8B(1) and 8B(2) of the ISA govern judicial review {{in the context of}} that Act, and thus preclude any consideration of the legal position laid down in the obiter remarks of the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Therefore, applying the subjective test, the respondents' burden of justifying <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applicant's detention was discharged as the respondents had produced a valid detention order and evidence of the subjective satisfaction of the President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, that the applicant was a risk to national security.|$|E
25|$|After the Second World War, {{during which}} Sarawak and Borneo had been {{occupied}} by Japanese forces, the third rajah, Vyner Brooke, ceded his life interest in Sarawak to the Colonial Office. Unclear as to <b>the</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> cession, <b>the</b> British Government simultaneously passed a Bill of Annexation. Rajah Vyner's nephew and legal heir, Anthony Brooke, initially opposed annexation by the Crown, as did a majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> native members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council Negri.|$|R
