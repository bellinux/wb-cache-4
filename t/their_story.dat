5|$|Among evangelical Christians, {{the five}} men are {{commonly}} considered martyrs and missionary heroes. Books {{have been written}} about them by numerous biographers, most notably Elisabeth Elliot. Anniversaries of their deaths have been accompanied by stories in major Christian publications, and <b>their</b> <b>story,</b> as well as the subsequent acceptance of Christianity among the Huaorani, has been turned into several motion pictures.|$|E
5|$|The {{piece is}} often contrasted to modern {{magazine}} profiles {{in which the}} writers spend little time with their subjects or when writers fabricate elements of <b>their</b> <b>story,</b> such as Jayson Blair, Stephen Glass, or Janet Cooke.|$|E
5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} several {{significant}} works of modern literature. Her romantic attachment with Pericles has inspired {{some of the}} most famous novelists and poets of the last centuries. In particular the romanticists of the 19th century and the historical novelists of the 20th century found in <b>their</b> <b>story</b> an inexhaustible source of inspiration. In 1835 Lydia Maria Child, an American abolitionist, novelist, and journalist, published Philothea, a classical romance set in the days of Pericles and Aspasia. This book is regarded as the most successful and elaborate of the author's productions, because the female characters, especially Aspasia, are portrayed with great beauty and delicacy.|$|E

5|$|In {{a review}} {{of the history of the}} Moberly-Jourdain {{adventure}} and the extensive public reaction to it, Terry Castle noted with skepticism the claim that a shared delusion may have arisen out of a lesbian folie à deux between the two women. Castle concludes that, when all proposed explanations have been considered, a core of mystery remains as much in relation to the psychological dynamics of the pair as to any aspects of the paranormal associated with <b>their</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
5|$|Malick {{was upset}} that the studio {{screened}} his unfinished version for critics and Penn ended up helping {{him in the}} editing room, shaping the final version. Malick spent three more months and cut 45 additional minutes from the film. The director refused to subject his film to test screenings before delivering his final cut. After Geisler and Roberdeau told <b>their</b> <b>story</b> to Vanity Fair magazine, Medavoy's attorneys declared them in breach of contract and threatened to remove their names from the film unless they agreed to do no future interviews until after the Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell <b>their</b> <b>story</b> to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.|$|E
25|$|On 8 April, the Ministry of Defence {{announced}} that the detainees would, exceptionally, be permitted to sell <b>their</b> <b>stories.</b> It was subsequently revealed that the Second Sea Lord, Vice Admiral Adrian Johns {{made the decision to}} grant the marines and sailors permission to tell <b>their</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|R
40|$|In two experiments, {{we tested}} the {{hypotheses}} that (a) the difference between liars and truth tellers will be greater when interviewees report <b>their</b> <b>stories</b> in reverse order than in chronological order, and (b) instructing interviewees to recall <b>their</b> <b>stories</b> in reverse order will facilitate detecting deception. In Experiment 1, 80 mock suspects told the truth or lied about a staged event and {{did or did not}} report <b>their</b> <b>stories</b> in reverse order. The reverse order interviews contained many more cues to deceit than the control interviews. In Experiment 2, 55 police officers watched a selection of the videotaped interviews of Experiment 1 and made veracity judgements. Requesting suspects to convey <b>their</b> <b>stories</b> in reverse order improved police observers' ability to detect deception and did not result in a response bias. 8848...|$|R

5|$|Quatermass and Lomax {{then turn}} to {{journalist}} Jimmy Hall (Sid James), who is skeptical of <b>their</b> <b>story</b> but asks to visit Winnerden Flats. At {{the local community}} centre, they receive a hostile reception from locals employed to do heavy construction and other work at the complex. The mood changes, however, {{when one of the}} meteorite-missiles crashes through the building roof, injuring barmaid Sheila (Vera Day). Armed guards arrive and gun down Hall after he telephones the press. The villagers form a mob that marches on the complex. Rushing the gates, Quatermass, Lomax, and the villagers barricade themselves in the pressure control room.|$|E
5|$|Rick Holland, an {{instructor}} at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible. Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant Bible verses they do quote and {{he argued that the}} advice the Ludys share in the book is sound and that <b>their</b> <b>story</b> is an encouraging one.|$|E
5|$|Survival horror {{refers to}} a subgenre of horror video games. The player {{character}} is vulnerable and under-armed, which puts emphasis on puzzle-solving and evasion, rather than violence. Games commonly challenge the player to manage their inventory and ration scarce resources such as ammunition. Another major theme throughout the genre is that of isolation. Typically, these games contain relatively few non-player characters and, as a result, frequently tell much of <b>their</b> <b>story</b> second-hand through the usage of journals, texts, or audio logs.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} an eight-player co-operative multiplayer mode called the Chaos Squad, which tasks players {{to complete a}} series of missions, as decided by the players themselves. Players defend vats of Overcharge Delirium XT from waves of OD'd at night and stop their progression by setting up fortifications and barriers, {{in a manner similar}} to tower defense games. It is inter-connected with the single-player mode allowing players to transfer <b>their</b> <b>story</b> character, with all the weapons and gadgets they have already accumulated, to the mode. Although players work together, players also try to earn more Style points during play than their co-op partners.|$|E
5|$|The joke {{became an}} {{international}} sensation when publications from Europe, Hong Kong {{and other countries}} reprinted the trick without verifying it or asking EGMs permission. A Hong Kong comic based on Street Fighter II by Jademan Comics altered <b>their</b> <b>story</b> to include the character. Players tried unsuccessfully for weeks to unlock Sheng Long, until it was revealed in the December issue of EGM {{that it was a}} hoax, with the staff stating they were surprised at the worldwide coverage the joke had received.|$|E
5|$|The romantic {{nationalism}} that Tod espoused {{was used}} by Indian nationalist writers, especially those from the 1850s, as they sought to resist British control of the country. Works such as Jyotirindranath Tagore's Sarojini ba Chittor Akrama and Girishchandra Ghosh's Ananda Raho retold Tod's vision of the Rajputs in a manner to further their cause. Other works which drew <b>their</b> <b>story</b> from Tod's works include Padmini Upakhyan (1858) by Rangalal Banerjee and Krishna Kumari (1861) by Michael Madhusudan Dutt.|$|E

50|$|This {{misrepresentation}} {{of voice}} {{often leads to}} the misunderstanding and exploitation of storytelling rights. An example, would be the stories of abused women, because women are told by government agencies that by telling <b>their</b> <b>stories</b> they will be heard and helped. But, in truth, {{the irony is that}} domestic violence has become ‘big business' because the law system does not listen to the voices of these battered women. This example illustrates how women reshape <b>their</b> <b>stories</b> to gain assistance from shelter and charities. But women reshaping <b>their</b> <b>stories</b> violates the ethics of storytelling rights, because this fuels the “big business” of domestic violence.|$|R
5|$|Digital Devil Saga began {{development}} pre-2002 under the working title New Goddess. The game's concept and original draft {{were written by}} Japanese author Yu Godai, but she withdrew from the project for personal reasons, {{and was replaced by}} Atlus scriptwriter Tadashi Satomi. The gameplay concept of the characters transforming into demons was based on an unused idea for Shin Megami Tensei. The second game {{began development}} immediately after the first, with the main development effort going into refining and improving the gameplay. While their commercial performances varied, both games were praised by critics for <b>their</b> <b>story,</b> graphics and gameplay. Since release, the game has inspired a mobile prequel, and Godai wrote a series of novels based on her original premise for the story.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching {{another project}} and visited the {{memorial}} to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. Researching the 20 July plot, {{he was moved}} and fascinated {{by the fact that}} the conspirators were fully aware of what would happen if they failed their assassination attempt, and he wanted to make <b>their</b> <b>story</b> more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing.|$|E
5|$|The viewers' {{confused}} {{reaction to}} <b>their</b> <b>story</b> {{based on the}} first half, disappointed and frustrated Sato and Ibira. Sato explained the first two episodes were to capture the viewers' attention, and remaining episodes would reveal greater details of the story. Mania complained this franchising tactic is a poor excuse for initial episodes lacking substance. They said although the later half answered much of the questions raised in the first, it created unanswered questions of its own. IGN and DVD Talk felt the story was darker and flowed better in the later half than the first, but IGN felt the revelation of details came {{too late in the}} show. DVD Verdict felt the story was pointless. Despite the protagonist reaffirming himself as a protector of the city, his showdown with the antagonist reduced most of Shinjuku to ruins. Reviewers found if they stripped the plot to its basics, it is a shallow good-versus-evil story made complex by its presentation in the first half. They, however, appreciated the surprising deaths of certain characters whose sacrifice in vain rendered a poignant emotion at that point of story.|$|E
