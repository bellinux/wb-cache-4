5000|$|Since a cost {{estimate}} is the approximation {{of the cost}} of a project or operation, then estimate accuracy is a measure of how closely the estimate is able to predict the actual expenditures for the project or operation. This can only be known after the project is completed. If, for example, a project estimate was $1,252,000 for a specific scope and conditions, and at completion the records showed that $1,172,451.26 was expended, the estimate was 6.8% too high. If the project ended up having a different scope or conditions, an unadjusted computation does not fairly assess <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Predictions of <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy</b> may accompany the estimate. Typically this is expressed as a range higher or lower as compared with the point estimate with an expected probability that the actual cost will fall in the range. [...] An example for a definitive estimate might be that the estimate has a -5/+10% range of accuracy with a 90% confidence that the final value will fall in that range. The accuracy of an early estimate relates to the estimate quality. Factors affecting the quality of the estimate include the people who prepared the estimate, how the estimate was prepared, and what was known about the project. For the same project, the range of uncertainty about the total estimate decreases over time, as illustrated in the cone of uncertainty diagram.|$|E
5000|$|Geographic {{information}} {{systems such as}} GIS, GPS, and GNSS, have become so widespread that the term [...] "ground truth" [...] has taken on special meaning in that context. If the location coordinates returned by a location method such as GPS are an estimate of a location, then the [...] "ground truth" [...] is the actual location on earth. A smart phone might return a set of estimated location coordinates such as 43.87870,-103.45901. The ground truth being estimated by those coordinates is the tip of George Washington's nose on Mt. Rushmore. The accuracy of the estimate is the maximum distance between the location coordinates and the ground truth. We could say {{in this case that}} <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy</b> is 10 meters, meaning that the point on earth represented by the location coordinates is thought to be within 10 meters of George's nose—the ground truth. In slang, the coordinates indicate where we think George Washington's nose is located, and the ground truth is where it's really at. In practice a smart phone or hand-held GPS unit is routinely able to estimate the ground truth within 6-10 meters. Specialized instruments can reduce GPS measurement error to under a centimeter.|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} in-bank river discharge exclusively from remotely sensed hydraulic data is developed. Water-surface width and maximum channel width measured from 26 aerial and digital orthophotos of 17 single channel rivers and 41 SAR images of three braided rivers were coupled with channel slope {{data obtained from}} topographic maps to estimate the discharge. The standard error of the discharge estimates were within a factor of 1. 5 – 2 (50 – 100 %) of the observed, with the mean estimate accuracy within 10 %. This level of accuracy was achieved using calibration functions developed from observed discharge. The calibration functions use reach specific geomorphic variables, the maximum channel width and the channel slope, to predict a correction factor. The calibration functions are related to channel type. Surface velocity and width information, obtained from a single C-band image obtained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL’s) AirSAR was also used to estimate discharge for a reach of the Missouri River. Without using a calibration function, <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy</b> was C 72 % of the observed discharge, which is within the expected range of uncertainty for the method.

30|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a new hybrid {{algorithm}} for 2 D DOA estimation {{in the presence}} of mutual coupling for sparse UCAs. Based on the manifold decomposition technique, we will present two new formulations of the steering vector {{in the presence of}} mutual coupling for sparse UCAs. One formulation, corresponding to Jacobi-Anger expansion [12], allows applying a modified UCA-RARE algorithm to estimate the azimuth angle without the exact knowledge of mutual coupling and elevation angle. The other formulation, corresponding to Bauer's formula [13], allows executing a Root-MUSIC algorithm in the elevation direction to estimate the elevation angle for each estimated azimuth angle. For sparse UCAs, compared with the original UCA-RARE, the modified UCA-RARE is able to avoid obtaining spurious estimates which only arise from the sparseness of the array elements. Note that the steering vector expansion for estimating the elevation angle in this article differs from that in [5] and has a more universal application [10, 14, 15]. In fact, these two kinds of decomposition techniques applied in this article can be considered as manifold decomposition transformations [11, 16 – 18]. It is shown that the DOA estimate accuracy usually depends on the truncation error introduced by the transformation [16 – 19]. Hence, we analyze the truncation errors for sparse UCAs and derive expressions describing the truncation errors in the DOA estimates. We find that the impact of the truncation error on <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy</b> of azimuth angle is weaker than it for the elevation angle estimate. Therefore, a method to choose an appropriate truncated degree for the elevation estimates is presented to enhance <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy.</b>|$|E

We prove that the ZDE algorithm is appropriate for real-time applications, since it is computationally very efficient, needs very little storage memory, and is fully automatic; a first guess of DC is not needed. Nevertheless, the results obtained with simulated data prove that the computational efficiency is not achieved at the expense of <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>accuracy,</b> which is in fact comparable to the one of the existing techniques...|$|E

A {{common practice in}} supervised machine learning, is thus to test if <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>accuracy</b> is significantly better than chance level. This method of signal detection is particularly popular in neuroimaging and genetics. We provide evidence that using a classifier's accuracy as a test statistic can be an underpowered strategy for finding differences between populations, compared to a bona-fide statistical test. It is also computationally more demanding than a statistical test. Via simulation, we compare test statistics {{that are based on}} classification accuracy, to others based on multivariate test statistics. We find that probability of detecting differences between two distributions is lower for accuracy based statistics. We examine several candidate causes for the low power of accuracy tests. These causes include: the discrete nature of the accuracy test statistic, the type of signal accuracy tests are designed to detect, their inefficient use of the data, and their regularization. When the purposes of the analysis is not signal detection, but rather, the evaluation of a particular classifier, we suggest several improvements to increase power.
