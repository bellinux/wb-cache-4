5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|An Atlantic {{hurricane}} or {{tropical storm}} is a tropical cyclone that forms in <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> {{usually in the}} summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only {{on the basis of}} location. A hurricane is a storm that occurs in <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The harbour from Church Point, {{where the}} two arms meet, to <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> is {{referred}} to as Sheet Harbour. It is wider than either arm.

It then curves and flows southwest-ward to southward toward the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> has a moderating {{effect on}} {{temperature}} in Jersey, as water {{has a much}} greater specific heat capacity than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year. This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer. The highest temperature recorded was 36.0°C (96.8°F) on 9 August 2003, and the lowest temperature recorded was −10.3°C (13.5°F) on 5 January 1894. By comparison, higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom, which achieved 38.5°C (101.3°F) in Faversham, Kent on 10 August 2003. The impact of <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly cooler than the southern and central parts of England during the summer months.|$|E
