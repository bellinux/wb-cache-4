5|$|Luna, Ron, Ginny, and Neville {{join them}} in the forest and all six fly to the Ministry on thestrals, expecting to find and rescue Sirius. Once in the Department of Mysteries, Harry realises that his vision was falsely planted by Voldemort; however, he finds a glass sphere that bears his and the Dark Lord's names. Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy attack in order to capture the sphere, which is a {{recording}} of a prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort, which is revealed to be the object Voldemort {{has been trying to}} obtain for the whole year, the Dark Lord believing <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> he missed when he first heard the prophecy. Lucius explains that only the subjects of the prophecies, in this case Harry or Voldemort, can safely remove them from the shelves. During a heated fight Neville accidentally kicks and smashes the prophecy. Harry and his friends, soon joined by members of the Order, enter a battle with the Death Eaters, during which Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius and Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Dumbledore rescues him and climatically fights the Dark Lord to a stalemate. In the midst of the duel, Voldemort unsuccessfully tries to possess Harry in an attempt to get Dumbledore to kill the boy, then escapes just as Cornelius Fudge appears, finally faced with first-hand evidence that Voldemort has truly returned.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, Edward Gibbon had {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> {{wrong with the}} numbers and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject. A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who {{was meant to be}} writing his biographies in 305-6. Then in 1889, Hermann Dessau, who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, Vulgar Latin vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious personae, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of Theodosius I. Among his supporting evidence was that the life of Septimius Severus appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian Aurelius Victor, and that the life of Marcus Aurelius likewise uses material from Eutropius. In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve {{at least some of the}} six Scriptores as distinct persons and in favor of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, Mommsen postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the Scriptores work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since. Hermann Peter (editor of the Augustan History and of the Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae) proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language. Others, such as Norman H. Baynes, abandoned the early 4th century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of Julian the Apostate (useful for arguing the work was intended as pagan propaganda).|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Buendia became {{employed}} as a student copywriter by BMG Records (Pilipinas) Inc. (now part of Sony BMG Music Entertainment). He worked with BMG {{during the day and}} wrote songs with the band during the night. Eventually, the songs of Buendia and the band caught the attention of BMG A director Vic Valenciano. Valenciano listened to the songs and then commented that they were very raw technically, but <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> promising in them. Subsequently, BMG gave Eraserheads' songs a try. In 1992, BMG signed up the band for a three-year record deal.|$|E
25|$|During {{her time}} working at Castelli Gallery, Lawler was making paintings, artist’s books, prints, and {{photographs}} of her own. But when she landed her first official gallery exhibition, in 1978 at Artists Space, she did not exhibit any of that work. Instead, she borrowed a small 1883 portrait of a horse from Aqueduct Racetrack — it had been hanging over a Xerox machine in the offices — and mounted it on an empty wall at the gallery. To highlight her appropriation, she installed two spotlights: one above the picture and another pointed out the window, at the building next door, hinting to sidewalk passersby <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of note going on upstairs.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{or perhaps}} because of the Bitburg controversy, in 1985 a {{campaign}} had been started to build a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust in Berlin. It was felt by at least some Germans <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> wrong about the Chancellor and the President of the United States honoring the memory of the SS men buried at Bitburg while there was no memorial to any of the people killed in the Holocaust. The campaign to build a Holocaust memorial, which Germany until then lacked, was given a major boost in November 1989 by the call by television journalist Lea Rosh to build the memorial at the site for the former Gestapo headquarters. In April 1992, the City of Berlin finally decided that a Holocaust memorial could be built. Along the same lines, in August 1987, protests put a stop to plans by the City of Frankfurt to raze the last remains of the Frankfurt Jewish Ghetto in order to redevelop the land, arguing that the remnants of the Frankfurt ghetto needed to be preserved.|$|E

Even though they thought that many fans would not appreciate the song, they released it as a promotional single in early August 1998, before the release of Follow the Leader.

500|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, pushed Eliot {{further into the}} belief <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> worth defending in society and that Germany had to be stopped.

The war became central to Little Gidding as Eliot added in aspects of his own experience while serving as a watchman at the Faber building during the London blitz. The Four Quartets were favoured as giving hope during the war and also for a later religious revival movement. By Little Gidding, WWII is not just the present time but connected also to the English Civil War.|$|E

The Guardian took up his case at one point. One or more Guardian journalists began corresponding with him in 2006, and two interviewed him in 2011. Describing him as [...] "clever and strategic", they wrote <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> about him that made the public unsympathetic toward him. He was [...] "handsome in a rather cruel, caddish way—he seemed to exude arrogance and indifference....

500|$|After all, {{the carpet}} {{was only one}} of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the {{financial}} affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the [...] "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted [...] "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{was long}} {{suspected}} by several of Britten's close associates <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> exceptional about his attraction to teenage boys: Auden referred to Britten's [...] "attraction to thin-as-a-board juveniles... to the sexless and innocent", and Pears once wrote to Britten: [...] "remember there are lovely {{things in the}} world still– children, boys, sunshine, the sea, Mozart, you and me". In public, the matter was little discussed during Britten's lifetime and much discussed after it. Carpenter's 1992 biography closely examined the evidence, as do later studies of Britten, most particularly John Bridcut's Britten's Children (2006), which concentrates on Britten’s friendships and relationships with various children and adolescents. Some commentators have continued to question Britten's conduct, sometimes very sharply. Carpenter and Bridcut conclude that he held any sexual impulses under firm control and kept the relationships affectionate – including bed-sharing, kissing and skinny dipping – but strictly platonic.|$|E
500|$|From a cricketing viewpoint, the {{apartheid}} policy made little difference. Although cricket was played widely {{among the different}} racial groups in South Africa, the Test team, which represented the country in international matches, had always been all white. Under apartheid, this became official policy under the government reasoning that black, coloured (mixed race) and Indian players were inherently inferior and not worthy of selection. Different races were forbidden from competing against each other. South African cricket teams did not compete against India, Pakistan or the West Indies, but teams from England, Australia and New Zealand continued to visit the country. English cricketers particularly enjoyed tours to South Africa owing to the hospitality they received {{and the quality of}} living. The political writer and historian Peter Oborne commented: [...] "Relations between the cricket establishments of the two countries were exceptionally warm. Only few visitors noticed, and even fewer cared, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> wrong." ...|$|E
