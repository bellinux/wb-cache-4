5|$|Allen's manager {{introduced}} her to production duo Future Cut in 2004. They worked in a small studio {{in the basement of}} a Manchester office building. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records; the label gave her £25,000 to produce an album, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases such as Coldplay's X and virtual band Gorillaz' Demon Days.|$|E

5|$|Amin {{recruited}} {{his followers}} {{from his own}} ethnic group, the Kakwas, along with South Sudanese. By 1977, these three groups formed 60 percent of the 22 top generals and 75 percent of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80 percent and 87.5 percent of these groups even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> only 5 percent of the population. This helps explain why Amin survived eight attempted coups.|$|E
5|$|At about 2:00p.m., the American {{military}} authorities, who {{had arrived}} in the city, ordered that the bodies be taken down and delivered to the city morgue for autopsies to be carried out.

5|$|During {{the liberation}} of Manila {{buildings}} of the University in Intramuros, {{as well as in}} Sampaloc were damaged or destroyed. The facility in Intramuros was burned on February 8, 1944.

5|$|Halfway {{through the}} year South Katanga was further divided into the provinces of Katanga Oriental and Lualaba (also known as the new South Katanga). <b>Though</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> opposed to such divisions, many Katangese leaders from the secession joined the new provincial governments.

5|$|RAFA domains, or {{polymorphic}} interphase karyosomal associations, {{were first}} described in microscopy studies in 1991.

The authors also found that Pacific angelsharks from the Gulf of California differed genetically from those elsewhere, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> equivocal as to whether this represented a species-level distinction.|$|E
