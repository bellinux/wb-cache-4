5|$|Mrs Smith's Cottage is a {{mid-19th century}} Grade II listed {{building}} made from early Victorian red bricks. The range, {{the heart of}} the house, was in daily use for cooking and heating until the mid-1990s. The only access to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> is by a ladder. Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap – installed to prevent the local council condemning the cottage in the late 1970s – and an inside toilet. The original outside privy and washhouse can still be viewed.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} were streamlined {{as much as}} possible, without traditional touches such as baseboard moldings. Indirect lighting {{was used}} throughout. Curves were abundant, with rounded fireplaces topped with indirect lighting and a round dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows. Rounded balcony edges were set off by rounded bay windows. <b>The</b> <b>bedrooms</b> included circular dressing rooms with ample closet space. In some of the units, glass brick was used as partition material.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room and kitchen. The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E

5|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor of the west wing housed the dining room, service areas and led through to the kitchen and bakehouse. The service area was fitted with a {{mezzanine}} floor to provide sleeping facilities for male servants; the sleeping quarters for female servants were {{on the top floor of}} the mansion to keep the two sexes a good distance away from each other. On the same level, the east wing had a study with ante-room set in the northwest corner, a boudoir, two drawing rooms and a billiard room. An expansive library, divided into sections by pillars, was between the boudoir and study, beside the large bay window. The first floor, accessed via the main staircase positioned within the entrance hall, had all the family bedrooms, and featured balconies. Hip baths were carried to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> each evening as no bathrooms were incorporated. Cubitt had furniture workshops in London where the majority of the mansion's furnishings and fittings were crafted from mahogany. Nurseries were on the top floor beside the female servant accommodation. Around thirty rooms made up the basement, among them a smoking room where editions of Punch and The Illustrated London News were supplied as reading material. The remaining rooms on the basement level were workshops, wine cellars and individual parlours for the butler, housekeeper and other principal servants, together with general storerooms.|$|E
5|$|The room to {{the east}} of the Oak Bedroom is known as The Great Room. The room was {{established}} in the mid 17th century as part of a reception suite, and was used by George John, the Second Earl for important political conferences during his period as First Lord of the Admiralty and Home Secretary. The Great Room, predominantly red and gold in design like many of the first floor rooms, contains a table and chairs with a large gilded mirror with three urns in front of it. The long mirror, designed by James Stuart, who was noted for his Athenian designs, features a tableaux at the top with the Spencer coat of arms and the pulling of chariots by cherubs, representing the love between John and Georgiana. The Great Room contains an extensive collection of miniature portraits, including a very rare Lucas de Heere portrait of Lady Jane Grey as a teenage girl at her family residence in Bradgate, Leicestershire. The Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa is mentioned in the 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana as hanging in one of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> at Althorp. It was sold in 1924 to art merchant Joseph Duveen, who sold it the following year to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{house is}} first {{mentioned}} (as Broke House) in {{the reign of}} Elizabeth I in a grant dated 1589, but this was an earlier building, though some parts of it are incorporated in the present house. Arthur Oswald thought that the interior wall parallel to the front outside wall and fireplaces in two of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> may come from the Elizabethan house. The house was substantially enlarged and rebuilt in the mid-17th century.|$|E

25|$|Park End House, {{originally}} {{a home for}} the principal, was converted into residential accommodation in 1946, and houses on Didsbury Park were purchased by the college in the 1960s as student hostels. In 1968, <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> of the college were converted into tutorial offices, and the Old Social Room, which had been built during World War II, was converted into a College Club, complete with a bar, which eventually moved into the old chapel.|$|E
25|$|From the street, {{through the}} {{staircase}} {{and the main}} entrance, a foyer leads to an interior courtyard from which all the spaces of the house are distributed. Special features of the interior are the stained glass panels in the living room, showing a strong moorish influence in its form (lobulated arches) and its colour. The doors have louvered panels and stained glass insets. The living room, the studio and <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> have pressed tin ceilings.|$|E
25|$|All {{habitable}} {{rooms in}} the houses had gas lighting. The streets were gas lit supplied from Ripley's gas works in Mill Lane. All habitable rooms had a fireplace or range. In <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> fireplaces were decorative cast iron. Type 1 houses had ranges {{in the back room}} and cellar kitchen and a polished slate fireplace in the ground floor front room. Type 2 houses had ranges in both ground floor rooms. Type 3 houses had a range in the single ground floor room.|$|E

25|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} a vacation beach cottage, but the Adamsons eventually made it their permanent home. In December 1932, a fire {{started in the}} electrical wiring of the garage. One of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> was badly damaged, and the entire house was threatened by intense flames. The fire was put out by pumping crews from the forestry stations at Fernwood and Las Flores, aided by the Malibu Beach colony fire department. During World War II, the bathhouse {{was used by the}} United States Coast Guard as a local headquarters to watch out over the Malibu coast.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} {{development of the}} modern park, the Category A listed Pittencrieff House, built around 1610 for Sir William Clerk of Penicuik, {{was designed as a}} centre piece. Two of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> were converted to create two long galleries for museum and art exhibition space in a restoration programme undertaken by Sir Robert Lorimar between 1911 and 1913. Work on the building was completed in 2010 to repair and reharl the property, restoring the original ochre-coloured limewash exterior. The project was funded through the £1.7 million Dunfermline Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme (CARS) under a partnership between Fife Council and Historic Scotland.|$|E
25|$|By now {{the murders}} had {{attracted}} widespread media attention and many students were taking extra precautions, such as changing their daily routines and sleeping together in groups. Because the spree was happening {{so early in}} the fall semester, some students withdrew their enrollment or transferred to other schools. Twenty-three year old Tracy Paules was living with Manny Taboada, also 23, her burly 200lb roommate. On Monday, August 27, Rolling broke into the apartment by prying open the sliding glass door with the same tools he had used previously. Rolling found Taboada asleep in one of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> and, after a struggle with the young man, eventually killed him.|$|E

25|$|Alfred was {{heir to the}} Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Expecting to be the Duchess there, Maria Alexandrovna had {{a palace}} built for her family in Coburg. The building, known as the Edinburgh Palais, was built across the central square from the Schloss Ehrenburg, the {{official}} residence of the reigning duke, and next to the town's opera hall. The royal couple's rooms were on the second floor, while <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> of the four young princesses were on the third floor. Both the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were avid collectors. In the Edinburgh Palais, there were many objects that reminded Maria Alexandrovna of her homeland. As a reminder of Russia, Maria Alexandrovna organised entertainment in the Russian fashion.|$|E
25|$|Richard Cotton's {{alterations}} to the Great Hall (now the library) {{are thought}} to include concealing the hammerbeam roof with a plaster ceiling and putting in a fireplace. Timbers in one of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> have been dated to around this time. It is unclear whether he installed a grand staircase to access the Hall, {{which is on the}} first floor. The room's existing screen is believed to date from somewhat later; it is known to have been moved at some point from its original northern position to {{the south side of the}} Hall, where it now stands. William III stayed at the house in 1690, while travelling to the Battle of the Boyne, and his visit may have been the cause of internal reorganisation. The room where the king is thought to have slept, known as the Orange Bedroom, is adjacent to the Great Hall; its timbers have been dated to 1546–81. There is also evidence for building work in around 1725.|$|E
25|$|While staff {{accommodation}} {{continues to be}} built for hotels and similar buildings, in domestic use it has declined along with the numbers of staff kept. This major decline began in Europe following World War I. In Europe many owners of large mansions have {{gone so far as}} to demolish whole service wings. Queen Elizabeth II made this decision at Sandringham House in the 1980s, while at West Wycombe Park the roofless former service wing now contains a garden. In many other houses open to the public the former servants' domains are now restaurants, shops and offices, while <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> are let to holiday makers and tourists. Where staff are retained in private houses, they are more likely to live in purpose-built apartments created from the former servants' quarters, or as at Woburn Abbey converted from former stables; at Woburn the servants' attic bedrooms have now been altered to provide more spacious bedrooms for the use of the owners, thus providing a retreat and privacy from the paying public viewing the rooms below.|$|E

50|$|A {{bedroom is}} located on the {{northern}} side of the entrance, the room has French doors opening to the northern end of the eastern verandah. This section of the verandah has been enclosed. The verandah returns on the northern side with French doors opening to <b>the</b> main <b>bedroom.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bedroom</b> has a high timber ceiling and fireplace with tiled surrounds. A walk-in wardrobe is located along the western side of the room. The pressed metal ceiling in <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> has been replaced with timber. On the northern side of the hall are located two bathrooms and a <b>bedroom.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bedroom</b> has a bay window opening to the enclosed western verandah.|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} level, the living {{quarters}} consist of 15 rooms divided among sleeping quarters, living room, antesala, dining room, kitchen (with an original 19th century stove), bathroom and studio/library. The layout {{responds to the}} L-shaped arrangement. A massive rectangular volume, divided in three spacious rooms with 15-foot high ceilings, faces west overseeing Paseo Atocha. <b>The</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> kitchen, bathroom and dining room are lined-up along the longitudinal axis, facing north overlooking Calle Castillo. This section of the quarters, the most private section of the house, also faces south, towards the interior courtyard. The entrance to each room in the longitudinal axis is accentuated {{by the use of}} a classical pediment framing each doorway. Each room facing the patio, {{with the exception of the}} dining room at the eastern end, has a distinguishable feature of a double door system. First a double wooden door with adjustable louvers, crowned with a wooden fixed transom with frosted glass panel. Another solid mahogany double door is added, which covers the entire doorway.|$|E
25|$|The home's {{interior}} features 16th, 17th, and 18th century French and English details. The {{building is}} heated by an oil-burning, hot air furnace and contains an Otis passenger elevator and freight elevator. The passenger elevator is wood-paneled and the freight elevator measures 5x4feet (1.5x1.2m) in diameter. The flooring consists {{of black and}} white marble squares and the walls are plastered to simulate limestone. In {{the back of the house}} is a five-bay entrance hall and staircase. The library entrance is located on the right side of the hallway and two reception rooms and a lavatory are located on the left side. Near the end of the hall are service rooms, service elevator, dining room (now the ambassador's office), and a breakfast room. A lavatory is located beneath the main staircase. At the end of the hall are two parlors and a large drawing room. The second floor contains three bedrooms, two baths, and a service area. One of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> the master suite, contains a separate staircase that gives access to the upper floors. The third floor contains bedroom suites and a playroom in the southeast corner. The fourth floor contains additional bedrooms and servants' quarters.|$|E
25|$|Residential Life at the University of Massachusetts Amherst {{is one of}} {{the largest}} on-campus housing systems in the United States. Over 14,000 {{students}} live in 52 residence halls, while families, staff, and graduate students live in 345 units in two apartment complexes (North Village and Lincoln). The fifty-two residence halls and four undergraduate apartment buildings are grouped into seven separate and very different residential areas: Central, Northeast, Orchard Hill, Southwest, Sylvan, North Apartments, and the recently constructed Commonwealth Honors College Residential Community (CHCRC). Each possesses its own distinctive characteristics, inspired in part by location, in part by architecture, and in part by the different cultural or academic living/learning programs housed within. Each residential area houses classrooms, recreational and social centers, kitchenettes, and cultural centers - in addition to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> study areas, laundries, television rooms, and dining facilities you might expect. Each also has its own student governing body and is,in effect, a community unto itself. Located in the central corridor of campus, the Honors Community houses undergraduate members of Commonwealth Honors College. In this community, undergraduates, staff, and faculty share an interwoven mix of double, single, suite, and apartment-style living options spread across six halls. This area featured a 24-hour full-service cafe during its first year, but it soon became clear that 24-hour operation was not profitable. The cafe is closed between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. during the school year and closed during the summer. The community includes assembly and workshop rooms, as well as most Honors College programming and staff offices.|$|E
