2500|$|Specified at 5 to 50MiB/s, Nintendo {{cited the}} ROM cartridges' very fast load times in {{comparison}} to disc-based games. Few contemporary CD-ROM drives have speeds above 4×, and the competing consoles Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation have 2× drives running at about [...] with high latency. This can be observed on the loading screens that appear in many PlayStation games but are typically nonexistent in Nintendo 64 games. ROM cartridges are so much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges {{as if they are}} additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM. This was a common practice for developers in many games, such as Nintendo EAD's Super Mario 64 or Factor 5's Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. Howard Lincoln said, [...] " [...] and those guys felt very strongly that it was absolutely essential to have it on a cartridge in order to do <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we wanted to do with Super Mario." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{point it}} is my purpose to urge might perhaps be {{suggested}} thus: that Socialists and most social reformers of their color are vividly conscious of the line between <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> belong {{to the state and}} <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> belong to mere chaos or uncoercible nature; they may force children to go to school before the sun rises, but they will not try to force the sun to rise; they will not, like Canute, banish the sea, but only the sea-bathers. But inside the outline of the state their lines are confused, and entities melt into each other. They have no firm instinctive sense of one thing being in its nature private and another public, of one thing being necessarily bond and another free. That is why piece by piece, and quite silently, personal liberty is being stolen from Englishmen, as personal land has been silently stolen ever since the sixteenth century.|$|E

M.; and if I behave very badly, such as prodding him with the dagger, or something of that sort, then I will let you know the details. You can't do it here, so you may as well go."

All she was {{thinking}} of was the number of furs her aesthetic father took the trouble to keep on hand, not their value. I could have told her that those masses of rich furs constituted wealth--or would in my country--but she would not have understood that; those were not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> ranked as riches with her people. I could have told her that the clothes she had on, or the every-day clothes of the commonest person about her, were worth twelve or fifteen hundred dollars, and that I was not acquainted with anybody at home who wore twelve-hundred dollar toilets to go fishing in; but she would not have understood it, so I said nothing.

6000|$|When Brooke {{went back}} to the house in the Close, Miss Stanbury was quite fussy in her silence. She would have given much to have been told {{something}} about Barty, and, above all, to have learned what Barty had said about herself. But she was far too proud even to mention the old man's name of her own accord. She was quite sure that she had been abused. She guessed, probably with tolerable accuracy, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> had been said of her, and suggested to herself what answer Brooke would make to such accusations. But she had resolved to cloak it all in silence, and pretended for a while not to remember the young man's declared intention when he left the house. [...] "It seems odd to me," [...] said Brooke, [...] "that Uncle Barty should always live alone as he does. He must have a dreary time of it." ...|$|E

The {{reconciliation}} of the two women in Ginistrella, for instance, which could never really have taken place. That sort of thing is ignoble; I blush when I think of it! This new affair must be a golden vessel, filled with the purest distillation of the actual; and oh, how it bothers me, the shaping of the vase--the hammering of the metal! I have to hammer it so fine, so smooth; I don't do more than an inch or two a day. And all the while I have to be so careful not to let a drop of the liquor escape! When I see <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Life does, I despair of ever catching her peculiar trick. She has an impudence, life! If one risked a fiftieth part of the effects she risks! It takes ever so long to believe it. You don't know yet, my dear fellow. It is n't till one has been watching life for forty years that one finds out half of what she's up to! Therefore one's earlier things must inevitably contain a mass of rot. And with what one sees, on one side, with its tongue in its cheek, defying one to be real enough, and on the other the bonnes gens rolling up their eyes at one's cynicism, the situation has elements of the ludicrous which the artist himself is doubtless in a position to appreciate better than any one else. Of course one mustn't bother about the bonnes gens." [...] Mark Ambient went on, while my thoughts reverted to his ladylike wife, as interpreted by his remarkable sister.|$|E

50|$|Generic {{data models}} are generalizations of {{conventional}} data models. They define standardized general relation types, {{together with the}} kinds of things that may be related by such a relation type. The definition of generic data model is similar to the definition of a natural language. For example, a generic data model may define relation types such as a 'classification relation', being a binary relation between an individual thing and a kind of thing (a class) and a 'part-whole relation', being a binary relation between two things, one with the role of part, the other with the role of whole, regardless <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are related.|$|E

5000|$|In 2014 it was {{announced}} an upgraded - or even new - hospital for Goulburn could soon be a reality following an announcement of $600,000 towards redevelopment plans by NSW Health Minister Jillian Skinner. [...] "I do have a feeling though from some of my previous visits {{that part of the}} core of this hospital cannot be redeveloped because of the load bearing nature of the walls.

5000|$|Opposition leaders {{stated that}} Mr Harper’s {{real reason for}} the prorogation was to end an {{embarrassing}} debate on the government’s alleged complicity in the torture of Afghan detainees, and in particular to avoid complying with a parliamentary motion to hand over all documents relevant to those charges. They also stated that the prime minister wanted to name new senators and then reconstitute the Senate’s committees to reflect the Conservatives’ additional representation, something {{that could not be}} done if Parliament was merely adjourned.
