5|$|In 1924, a fire almost {{destroyed}} {{the upper level}} of the school building, but the congregation repaired the damage. Another renovation was begun in 1928, and included installing illuminated stained glass over the ark and bronze memorial tablets {{at the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary,</b> and repainting <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> walls and columns in a trompe-l'œil manner imitating Jerusalem stone and marble.|$|E
5|$|In most temples, {{the focus}} was the cult image: a statue of the temple god which that god's ba was {{believed}} to inhabit while interacting with humans. <b>The</b> <b>sanctuary</b> in these temples contained either a naos, a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model barque containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness. Whereas in earlier times <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> lay {{at the very back}} of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms.|$|E
5|$|Inside, the {{building}} held a two-story balconied main sanctuary and dining room, {{in addition to}} the basement kitchen and bathrooms. The heating system was in a sub-basement. The front ark and wood bimah in <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> were ornate; the red velvet draped ark was elaborately decorated, and the bimah was also decorated, and supported a large bronze candelabra. <b>The</b> <b>sanctuary</b> floor was wood, with wood wainscoting and plaster walls.|$|E

5|$|Membership {{peaked in}} the 1920s, {{but with the}} onset of the Great Depression {{declined}} steadily, and by the 1970s the congregation could no longer afford to heat <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary.</b> Membership has recovered since that low point; the congregation renovated its school/community center in 2004, and in 2008 embarked on a million-dollar capital campaign to renovate <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary.</b> Many of these rooms {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> itself, and in temples without a barque in <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary,</b> there was a separate shrine to store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.|$|E

While venturing the streets, Magnus finds herself under attack by a savage humanoid creature, but is saved by two men in Hazmat suits, who proceed to capture and decontaminate her. Magnus is later shocked to discover that her protégé, Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne), {{is the leader of}} the survivalist group. Unlike his original personality, Zimmerman is acting far more violent and aggressive, and believes Magnus to be an imposter, citing she died three years ago. As more creatures attack the base, Magnus escapes and returns to <b>the</b> <b>Sanctuary,</b> where on the way she is joined by a young girl, Jessica Mitchell (Nicole Muñoz).|$|E

5|$|It was {{designed}} by the British architectural firm Gostling & Morris of Bombay. The basement part of the edifice is built in stone masonry and the superstructure is built in brick masonry. The exterior facade of the synagogue is painted turquoise. <b>The</b> <b>sanctuary</b> within {{the interior of the}} building is in western direction, towards Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 300 {{households}} {{were members}} by 2006, {{and in the}} same year, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation awarded the synagogue a grant of $350,000 for exterior restoration of <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary.</b> The grant was part of a million-dollar capital campaign that the membership intended to carry out in 2008, as the synagogue building still required extensive repairs: the roof leaked, causing interior damage, and (along with the gutters) needed to be replaced; interior columns were taped to prevent plaster from falling off them; <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> doors needed to be replaced; and the stained glass windows needed to be removed, the metal holding them repaired, and their wooden framing replaced. In 2007 the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites Program awarded Baith Israel Anshei Emes grants totaling $17,500, for copper roof and masonry restoration.|$|E

5|$|The {{church has}} a single {{elongated}} nave. It is surmounted by a dome and finishes with a single apse in its eastern part.

To the west of it is <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> which features three vaults which hosted the bema, the prothesis and the diaconicon. <b>The</b> <b>sanctuary</b> was separated {{from the rest of the}} nave via two pillars. Three buttresses support the south wall and the apse. The entrance to the church is on the south wall.

5|$|The most {{important}} part of the temple was <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary,</b> which typically contained a cult image, a statue of its god. The rooms outside <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> grew larger and more elaborate over time, so that temples evolved from small shrines in the late Predynastic Period (late fourth millenniumBC) to large stone edifices in the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070BC) and later. These edifices are among the largest and most enduring examples of Egyptian architecture, with their elements arranged and decorated according to complex patterns of religious symbolism. Their typical design consisted of a series of enclosed halls, open courts, and entrance pylons aligned along the path used for festival processions. Beyond the temple proper was an outer wall enclosing a wide variety of secondary buildings.|$|E
