25|$|Captain Nutsch soon {{requested}} {{replacements for}} the traditional small, hard, wooden saddles used by the Afghanistan soldiers. He specified a supply of lightweight saddles, either McClellan or Australian-style, suitable for the smaller Afghan horses. A supply of saddles was air-dropped in mid-November. The last U.S. Army unit to receive horseback training was the 28th Cavalry in 1943. A picture of the soldiers on horseback was shown by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld during a news conference on 15 November 2001. When sculptor Douwe Blumberg saw that image, he felt impressed that he had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> created what became the only public sculpture to commemorate special forces, America's Response Monument.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Sarikamish, the Ottoman army {{runs out}} of {{ammunition}} and appeals for help {{to the people of}} Van, who happen to have supplies. However, the First World War is on and all the men are fighting at the four corners of the empire and therefore can not respond to the appeal. The young children of Van want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> when the principal of a school, who has lost a son in the war, suggests that they transport ammunition, 120 young boys aged 12 to 17 volunteer and take to the road. The movie tells the true story of the 120 boys and their sisters and mothers left behind, who wait for their return.|$|E
500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} a little like writing about the Beatles—that {{there are so many people}} out there who know so much about him and who revere him that I just saw a {{minefield}} of disappointment. Frankly, that I was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> that people who ... hopefully, when I'm done with my research, I'll be in the same ball park of knowledge about Steve Jobs that so many people in this room are.|$|E

500|$|Six {{years after}} {{cancellation}} of Police Squad!, the film [...] returned Nielsen to {{his role as}} Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: [...] "You {{have an idea of}} how you're going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> it's your vision... unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance." [...] This movie grossed over $78million and was well received by critics. Ebert's 3½–star review (out of four) noted, [...] "You laugh, and then you laugh at yourself for laughing." ...|$|E
500|$|Babe {{made her}} final {{appearance}} on 9 February 2017. In the episode, Babe {{tries to make}} amends with her family by taking care of Sylvie, but instead takes her to the canal and tells her that Stan {{is on the other}} side, before leaving her alone. Badland explained that Babe [...] "would not have actually killed" [...] Sylvie, but instead [...] "enticed her <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> then walked away from it". When Shirley discovers Babe's actions, she tells her to leave so Babe tries to steal money from the pub's safe. Shirley catches her in the act and announces her actions to Mick. Babe pleads with Mick for another chance, but when she calls Linda a [...] "stuck-up cow", Mick escorts her out. Badland explained that Babe does this because she is [...] "absolutely desperate". Outside the pub, Babe curses the family and exclaimed, [...] "I hope you lose everything and your precious pub", which caused media outlets to question whether it foreshadows speculation the family would lose their pub. Badland believed that [...] "with all the threats she made, Babe might be back at some point." [...] She added that, [...] "She's cursed the Carters, and you don't cross Aunt Babe and get away with it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Harris, {{the head}} of the casting {{department}} refused to negotiate her salary, stating that she was a [...] "scale character who dies in the first twenty minutes." [...] This ultimately led to her dropping out of the project. [...] "People automatically assume I wanted some crazy amount of money, or something," [...] Harris commented in 2014, [...] " [...] it's not like I [...] demanding of anything, really... When you've been asked <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> then they insult you by saying, [...] "You're a piece of shit, you die in the first act—I don't give a fuck that you were in two other Halloween movies, who cares?"... I was in shock." [...] Actress J. C. Brandy was cast as Harris's replacement.|$|E

2500|$|In the film, Hugo and his {{grandfather}} were supposed to [...] "travel to a diamond moon" [...] and the storyboards showed Hugo battling Scylla in space. The plot premise was described by Helbrandt as following: [...] "Afskyelia [...] have obtained a way to threaten Hugo and his forest friends. Therefore Hugo has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> when he discovers a moon behind the moon we know today, he will set forth. Afskyelia chases after him. But I promise you, that unfortunately for her, the story is to end happily." [...] The movie's basic plot premise resembles the educational game Hugo in Space, which was released in 2003, {{one year after the}} planned release of the movie. In this game, she plans to extract the rare magical black diamonds (first introduced in an action game [...] in 2002) from an asteroid's core and become the most powerful witch of all time.|$|E
2500|$|Unterberger continues, [...] "Perhaps {{they were}} saying they wished they {{could be on the}} front lines, but were not {{in the right place at}} the right time; perhaps {{they were saying}}, as John Lennon did in the Beatles' [...] "Revolution", that they didn't want to be {{involved}} in violent confrontation. Or perhaps they were even declaring indifference to the tumult." [...] Other writers' interpretations varied. [...] In 1976, Roy Carr assessed it as a [...] "great summer street-corner rock anthem on the same echelon as 'Summer in the City', 'Summertime Blues', and 'Dancing in the Street'." [...] In 1979, Dave Marsh wrote that it was the keynote of Beggars Banquet, [...] "with its teasing admonition <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> its refusal to admit that doing it will make any difference; as usual, the Stones were more correct, if also more faithless, philosophers than any of their peers." ...|$|E
2500|$|From a New York Times {{interview}} in 1942: [...] "When the war started... {{felt that it}} was up to me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> the only thing I know is show business. I went around during the last war and I saw that the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army." [...] Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering [...] "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he [...] "would work without pay... would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed United Services Organization (USO), [...] "the group his letter to Early had helped create".|$|E

6000|$|Guy Pollock {{answered}} with disconcerting readiness, [...] "I'll tell you: since we're going <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> artistic, <b>and</b> not simply fool around, I believe {{we ought to}} give something classic. How about 'The School for Scandal'?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Scope - A {{practical}} {{issue is}} whether {{the fact that an}} accused is labouring under a [...] "mental disability" [...] should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to know that what one is doing is wrong, or to control an impulse <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see Doyle v Wicklow County Council 1974) 55 IR 71. The Butler Committee recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an irrebuttable presumption of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{findings}} of the inquiry into Wright's death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television's Live Tonight the UVF's mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, [...] "It was obvious he [...] was doing his own thing and going his own way. I think he had become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him {{to get out of the}} country – that's when the LVF was formed, that's when the breakaway group appeared." [...] When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, [...] "You have to be prepared to kill people if you tell them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> they don't do it – something of that magnitude. If you say they had to go and they don't go – the defiance alone, it doesn't leave many alternatives". McDonald expressed his personal belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright's death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.|$|E
