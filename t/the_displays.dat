5|$|During the Christmas time, {{locals and}} {{visitors}} visit places around their towns and suburbs {{to view the}} outdoor and indoor displays. All over the towns, the places are lit with colorful and modern spectacular lighting displays. <b>The</b> <b>displays</b> of nativity scenes with Aussie featured native animals like kangaroos and koalas are also evident.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> in turn, causing one of <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate sexual {{displays}} and posturing are {{encountered in the}} behavioural ecology of animals. The birds-of-paradise, for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during courtship. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and desirable genes. <b>The</b> <b>displays</b> are driven by sexual selection as an advertisement of quality of traits among suitors.|$|E
50|$|When {{a visual}} display with non-vanishing size {{is seen by}} an observer, every point of <b>the</b> <b>display</b> area is seen from a {{different}} direction as illustrated in fig. 1. No two spots on <b>the</b> <b>display</b> are seen from the same direction. <b>The</b> larger <b>the</b> <b>display</b> is and <b>the</b> closer the observer is to <b>the</b> <b>display</b> <b>the</b> more the viewing direction varies over the surface area of <b>the</b> <b>display.</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, a VGA-signal, {{which is}} created by <b>the</b> <b>display</b> controller, is being transported over a VGA-cable to <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> Both ends of the cable end in a VGA connector. Laptops and other mobile {{computers}} use different interfaces between <b>the</b> <b>display</b> controller and <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> A display controller usually supports multiple computer display standards.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>display</b> manager must {{authenticate}} {{itself to}} the server. To do this the X server sends a [...] packet to <b>the</b> <b>display</b> manager, which returns an [...] packet. If the [...] packet contains the response the X server expects, <b>the</b> <b>display</b> manager is authenticated. Producing the correct response might require <b>the</b> <b>display</b> manager {{to have access to}} a secret key, for example. If authentication succeeds, the X server sends a [...] packet to inform <b>the</b> <b>display</b> manager. Then <b>the</b> <b>display</b> manager displays its login screen by connecting to the X server as a regular X client.|$|R
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Exhibitors {{showed off}} {{a variety of}} items {{including}} works of art, local raw materials like manganese marble, and wood work. Many prominent figures of the day were in attendance to see <b>the</b> <b>displays.</b> Governor David B. Hill of New York spoke at the event as well as President Grover Cleveland who attended with his wife, Frances Folsom. Over 50,000 people were in attendance for Cleveland's speech. When the exposition was over, civic leaders said that it had successfully expanded Atlanta's reputation {{as a place to}} visit and to conduct business.|$|E
5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on <b>the</b> <b>displays.</b> If the blip was slightly longer on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] A {{low cost}} {{solution}} is presented for transforming a regular display into an interactive <b>display.</b> <b>The</b> <b>display</b> light is modulated using frequencies invisible to human eye. A camera captures images and the known light modulation {{is used to}} isolate <b>the</b> <b>display</b> generated light. <b>The</b> resulting demodulated images do {{not depend on the}} ambient light conditions. Furthermore, the objects close to <b>the</b> <b>display</b> are clearly visible and easy to detect/track.

5|$|The farm {{continues}} its research into improving farming and farm practices under Western Australian conditions. Avondale's displays {{are open to}} the public with picnic facilities available, included in <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> are the original homestead, the stables complete with Clydesdales and a machinery shed. There is also road maintained around the farm with information boards on each paddock explaining its current usage.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Miyazaki {{announced}} that he was retiring from the production of feature films due to his age, but wished to continue working on <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> at the Studio Ghibli Museum. Miyazaki was awarded the Academy Honorary Award at the Governors Awards in November 2014. He is currently developing Boro the Caterpillar, a computer-animated short film which was first discussed during pre-production for Princess Mononoke. It will be screened exclusively at the Studio Ghibli Museum in July 2017. He is also working on an untitled samurai manga. In August 2016, Miyazaki proposed a new feature-length film, titled How Do You Live?. He began animation work on the project without receiving official approval. He hopes to complete the film by 2019, though Suzuki predicts a 2020–2021 release.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1947, the Kings County {{council in}} New York City of the Army and Navy Union {{under the command}} of General Samuel Hoch made {{available}} an escort party for the families who were having their soldier dead brought home from World War II. The organization participants gathered at the Flatbush Post of the American Legion on Nostrand Ave at 9 AM to get their instructions from Hoch. He also coordinated the Brooklyn Naval Yard Garrison of the organization later, that participated in the Freedom Train Brooklyn display at the Vanderveer Park freight yards of the Long Island Rail Road. There were thousands that saw the one-day Brooklyn event that displayed Americana and original nineteenth-century historical documents in the rail cars. Many were not able to get to see <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> that day and planned on viewing the next day when the train would stop a few miles away at Jamaica, Queens, New York.|$|E

50|$|Early {{interactive}} {{molecular computer}} graphics systems were vector graphics machines, which used stroke-writing vector monitors, sometimes even oscilloscopes. The electron beam does not sweep left-and-right as in a raster <b>display.</b> <b>The</b> <b>display</b> hardware followed a sequential list of digital drawing instructions (<b>the</b> <b>display</b> list), directly drawing {{at an angle}} one stroke for each molecular bond. When the list was complete, drawing would begin again {{from the top of}} the list, so if the list was long (a large number of molecular bonds), <b>the</b> <b>display</b> would flicker heavily. Later vector displays could rotate complex structures with smooth motion, since the orientation of all of the coordinates in <b>the</b> <b>display</b> list could be changed by loading just a few numbers into rotation registers in <b>the</b> <b>display</b> unit, and <b>the</b> <b>display</b> unit would multiply all coordinates in <b>the</b> <b>display</b> list by <b>the</b> contents of these registers as the picture was drawn.|$|R
30|$|DisplayPersonCoincidance {{uses the}} values of DisplayInRange and InformationRepitition to {{determine}} if <b>the</b> <b>display</b> and <b>the</b> person (p_i) coincides each others or not. It yields a true value if <b>the</b> <b>display</b> is in range and the “same” information is not received from <b>the</b> <b>display</b> earlier.|$|R
5|$|Pair {{formation}} in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. <b>The</b> <b>displays</b> are performed {{in the middle of}} the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, poo-eee-chk, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.|$|E
5|$|Serrate {{used the}} Mk. IV {{equipment}} for reception and display, replacing only the receiver unit. This could be switched {{in or out}} of the circuit from the cockpit, which turned off the transmitter as well. In a typical interception, the radar operator would use Serrate to track the German fighter, using the directional cues from <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> to direct the pilot on an intercept course. Range was not supplied, but the operator could make a rough estimate by observing the signal strength and the way the signals changed as the fighter maneuvered. After following Serrate to an estimated range of , the fighter's own radar would be turned on for the final approach.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Age of Trucking Museum {{featured}} {{a collection of}} historic trucks, cars and other items related to the trucking operation, with a special focus on trucking in the 1950s. Many of the historic vehicles on display were noted for their rarity or otherwise unique quality. These include the first registered car in Connecticut, a 1902 Merry Oldsmobile, and a 1928 Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company five-to-seven ton dump truck, one of only 55 Pierce-Arrow trucks produced. <b>The</b> <b>displays</b> included a 1916 Mack Paddy Wagon, a 1929 Diamond T truck, a 1931 Ford Model AA Service Car, a 1936 Ford Roadster Deluxe and a Model T Ford Tank Truck. A 1953 Fageol moving van with original owner's banner was located near some surreys and carriages. Other early period vehicles on display included a 1912 Autocar two-cylinder transit bus, a 1914 Trumbull, a 1915 Barker, and a 1917 Republic Model 10 1-ton express and a 1920 3 ½ ton Model AC Mack.|$|E
50|$|A Lay-flat design hinges <b>the</b> <b>display</b> at <b>the</b> {{front edge}} of <b>the</b> <b>display</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>display</b> folds back. <b>The</b> {{advantage}} to this design is the full 1U height {{can be used}} for keyboard and track-ball height.

5|$|The Knicks' success due to Lin's play {{reportedly}} {{contributed to}} the end of a dispute that had for 48 days prevented Time Warner Cable customers from watching Knicks games and other MSG Network programs. The market capitalization of the Madison Square Garden Company, the team's owner, rose by $250 million in February and $600 million by July 2012. The Knicks quickly began selling replicas of Lin's No. 17 jerseys and T-shirts, and the sales and traffic for its online store increased more than 3,000%; Lin's merchandise dominated <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> at Knicks stores, while those for the team's high-priced stars—Anthony, Stoudemire, and Tyson Chandler—were moved to the sale racks. He had the best selling jersey in the NBA in February and March. For the one-year period ending April 2012, Lin had the second highest selling jersey in the league behind Derrick Rose. Both Nike and Adidas introduced Lin-related athletic apparel, and expected that his fame would help sales in China. His popularity was attributed with growing the NBA's popularity there since Yao Ming's retirement in the offseason; the audience for NBA games on television and online in China rose 39percent over the previous season.|$|E
5|$|The Shroud Exhibit And Museum, {{located in}} White Sands Mall, showcases a {{full-sized}} back-lit photographic transparency of the Shroud of Turin, a religious relic believed {{by some to}} be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. They also feature a working VP8 Image Analyzer, {{the only one in the}} world where one can walk in and interact with this old analog computer. This town was founded the same year (1898) that Secundo Pia took the first photograph of the Shroud which started the modern investigation into the Shroud. This is highlighted in the museum. In 1977 in Albuquerque, they held the conference that resulted in the 1978 study of the Shroud with more scientists from New Mexico than any other state. The displayed photograph was created from the 1978 photographs made by Barrie M. Schwortz as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP). <b>The</b> <b>displays</b> include historical background materials, scientific information, kiosks with a variety of information, videos available for viewing and an exhibit of electronic image analysis of the shroud, among other interesting artifacts.|$|E

2500|$|For normal operation, the {{brightness}} {{was turned down}} until the lines just disappear. The output of the radar receiver is fed into {{the brightness}} channel, so any echoes caused <b>the</b> <b>display</b> to momentarily brighten, producing a dot on <b>the</b> <b>display</b> known as a blip. The distance of the blip from the centre of <b>the</b> <b>display</b> indicates <b>the</b> range to the target; a target at [...] would produce a blip near {{the outer edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> <b>The</b> empty portion in the centre essentially magnifies the close-range area so that blips in this area do not become too cluttered on <b>the</b> <b>display</b> as <b>the</b> fighter approaches its target.|$|R

50|$|FireTrack {{switches}} from a non-continuous to {{a continuous}} graphics mode part way down <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> By using <b>the</b> palette {{to mask the}} top area of <b>the</b> <b>display</b> and taking care about when it changes mode it can shift the continuous graphics {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>display</b> down in two pixel increments because <b>the</b> internal <b>display</b> counter is not incremented on blank scanlines during non-continuous graphics modes.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Display</b> List and <b>the</b> <b>display</b> {{data are}} written into RAM by the CPU. ANTIC reads <b>the</b> <b>Display</b> List instructions, screen memory, and {{character}} set information from RAM using a technique known as {{direct memory access}} (DMA). A BASIC or 6502 machine language program's job is to initialize the display—set up <b>the</b> <b>Display</b> List instructions, organize screen memory (and character set if applicable), and then direct ANTIC to start <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> After this, ANTIC automatically takes care of generating <b>the</b> screen <b>display.</b> This powerful design allows the Atari 8-bit computers to produce complex, mixed-mode displays without direct CPU intervention while other platforms, even those designed much later, cannot either mix graphics modes in one display, or do so without direct, complex CPU interrupts.|$|R
