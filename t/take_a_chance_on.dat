5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower {{to help pay for}} condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction.|$|E

25|$|In August 2003, it was {{reported}} that the film was set to start shooting in January, with Smith still at the helm. Though Smith insisted on casting Lee in the lead role, Miramax head Harvey Weinstein refused to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> Lee, citing the general inability of his films to gross more than $30million at the box office. The role of Fletch remained uncast, with Smith considering a list of actors including Affleck, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, and Jimmy Fallon. Though Smith considered compromising and casting Zach Braff in the role, he eventually left the project in October 2005.|$|E
500|$|The novel marked Roberts' {{return to}} {{contemporary}} romance. [...] The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. [...] This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie [...] "Mac" [...] Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. [...] Like several other Roberts novels, Vision In White explored how a protagonist balanced {{a successful career}} with a dysfunctional family environment. [...] Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> love.|$|E
500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates. [...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that {{you had a chance to}} play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> you." ...|$|E

500|$|Reactions to {{his death}} came from many quarters, many paying tribute to his {{scientific}} prowess. His father recalled that [...] "he always got everything the first time.

[...] Greg Sampson, Dirks' math teacher at Lewis and Clark, remembered when his student had finished an advanced class in trigonometry in just two weeks, something no other student of his has ever done, saying [...] "he was just an amazing, amazing student." [...] Niles Pierce recalled how Dirks was willing to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> working with a younger professor.

500|$|DuVall joined Alice in Chains as {{lead singer}} during the band's reunion concerts. Duff McKagan again joined the band for the reunion tour, playing rhythm guitar on {{selected}} songs. Cantrell explained the reunion, [...] "We want to celebrate {{what we did}} {{and the memory of}} our friend. We have played with some [...] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [...] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together.

[...] Additionally, she noted that: [...] "Angelina may {{have a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin and she is not afraid to show it." [...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can be a bit of a stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> me.

500|$|In 1985, she {{audition}}ed for a guest spot as Cynthia in Cheers. The audition called {{for her to}} say her line and walk off the set. Cartwright decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> being different and continued walking, leaving the building and returning home. The production crew was confused, but she received the part. In search of more training as an actress, Cartwright joined a class taught by Hollywood coach Milton Katselas. He recommended that Cartwright study La Strada, a 1956 Italian film starring Giulietta Masina and directed by Federico Fellini. She began performing [...] "every imaginable scene" [...] from La Strada in her class and spent several months trying to secure the rights to produce a stage adaptation. She visited Italy with the intention of meeting Fellini and requesting his permission in person. Although they never met, Cartwright kept a journal of the trip and later wrote a one-woman play called In Search of Fellini, partially based on her voyage. The play was co-written by Peter Kjenaas, and Cartwright won a Drama-Logue Award after performing it in Los Angeles in 1995. In a 1998 interview, she stated her intention to make it into a feature film, which she succeeded in doing in 2017.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began as}} a single {{stand-alone}} animated short titled [...] "Adventure Time", which ran for seven minutes. It aired in January 2007 and again as part of Frederator Studios' Random! Cartoons on December 7, 2008. After its release, the short video became a viral hit on the internet. Frederator Studios then pitched an Adventure Time series to Nicktoons Network, but the network passed on it twice. The studio approached Cartoon Network, which {{said it would be}} willing to produce a series if Ward could prove the short could be expanded into a full series while maintaining elements of the original's pilot. Rob Sorcher, the chief content officer at Cartoon Network, was influential in getting the network to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> the show; he recognized the series as [...] "something that felt really indie...comic book-y [...] really new". Ward quickly rethought the concept of the pilot; he wanted a potential series to be [...] "fully realized", rather than be characterized by the [...] "pre-school vibe" [...] that permeated the original film. Ward's college friends Patrick McHale and Adam Muto helped him produce a rough storyboard that featured Finn and Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date. Cartoon Network was not happy with this story and asked for another. Ward then created a storyboard for the episode [...] "The Enchiridion!", which was his attempt to emulate the style of the original Nicktoons short. Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008, and [...] "The Enchiridion!" [...] was the first episode to enter into production.|$|E
2500|$|After {{opening with}} {{a death in}} the core Matthews family, Irna planned to follow up with an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, a septic abortion, a shooting, and murder trial. As Allen M.

She felt that with this kind of showy story she could build an {{audience}} more quickly." [...] Said Tom Donovan, [...] "In construction, Irna was attempting to follow the structure of As the World Turns. Irna would never conceive of a story not based on a family." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nichols also <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> using Dustin Hoffman, {{who had no}} film experience, for the lead, {{when others}} had {{suggested}} using known star Robert Redford.

50|$|Before being drafted, Murray played hockey in the Western Hockey League, for the Regina Pats. He {{was never}} {{known as a}} scorer (peaking at 33 goals, 63 points), but {{made a name for}} himself for his hard work and {{willingness}} to stand up for his teammates, demonstrated by three 150 PIM-exceeding seasons.

2500|$|Despite his {{prolific}} college career, no NBA {{teams were}} willing to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> the undersized guard in that year's draft, so he went unselected (years later, Kobe Bryant would claim that Rashad Phillips was [...] "he best player never drafted"). Then in November, the NBA Development League began its inaugural season and held its first draft on November 1. The upstart league chose {{from a pool of}} players who were not under contract with any professional team at the time and had all competed collegiately in the United States at some point.|$|E
2500|$|When Rose {{reached his}} senior year, {{he had used}} up his four years of sports eligibility, so {{in the spring of}} 1960, he joined the Class AA team {{sponsored}} by Frisch's Big Boy of Lebanon, Ohio in the Dayton Amateur League. He played catcher, second base and shortstop and compiled a [...]626 batting average. This would have been the pinnacle of Rose's baseball career if not for the help of his uncle Buddy Bloebaum. Bloebaum was a [...] "Bird dog" [...] scout for the Reds and he pleaded the case for his nephew. The Reds, who had recently traded away a number of prospects {{who turned out to be}} very good, decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> Pete. Upon his graduation from high school, Rose signed a professional contract.|$|E
2500|$|Sky high {{salaries}} {{also changed}} {{many of the}} strategies of the game. Players rarely were [...] "sent" [...] down to the minors if they failed to perform. Who could justify paying a slumping player millions to sit in Toledo where the major league fans couldn't pay their way? Other players in the Triple-A level of the minor leagues, who used to rise on merit, became trapped under these overpaid [...] "stars." [...] Also, {{in order to make}} the media happy, trades, rather than call-ups, became the order of the day. It was much better to buy someone else's shortstop who was a known quantity to the national sports media than to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> a player with no name value and no visibility if you were in a major market ballclub.|$|E

By 1965 his company, Daniels and Associates [...] had brokered in excess of $100 million and this represented about 80 percent of the year's transactions.|$|R
2500|$|Recognizing that Wagner {{should be}} {{playing at the}} highest level, Barrow {{contacted}} the Louisville Colonels, who had finished last in the National League in 1896 {{with a record of}} 38-93. They were doing better in 1897 when Barrow persuaded club president Barney Dreyfuss, club secretary Harry Pulliam, and outfielder-manager Fred Clarke to go to Paterson to see Wagner play. Dreyfuss and Clarke were not impressed with the awkward-looking man, not surprising, as Wagner was oddly built – 5-feet-11, 200 pounds, with a barrel chest, massive shoulders, heavily muscled arms, huge hands, and incredibly bowed legs that deprived him of any grace and several inches of height. Pulliam, though, persuaded Dreyfuss and Clarke to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> him. Wagner debuted with Louisville on July 19, and hit [...]338 in 61 games.|$|E
2500|$|In {{coming up}} with ideas for new shows, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner of Carsey-Werner Productions decided {{to look into the}} concept of the working mother as a central voice. Up until that point, there had been shows with working mothers, but only as an adjunct to the father in the family. Werner had {{suggested}} that they <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> Barr whom they had seen on The Tonight Show. This was because he saw the unique [...] "in your face" [...] voice that they were looking for, and he contacted her agent and offered her the role. Barr's act at the time was the persona of the [...] "domestic goddess", but as Carsey and Werner explains, she had the distinctive voice and attitude for the character and she was able to transform her into the working class heroine they envisioned.|$|E
2500|$|Merman's next show, Humpty Dumpty, began rehearsals in August 1932 and opened—and {{immediately}} closed—in Pittsburgh {{the following}} month. Producer Buddy DeSylva, {{who also had}} written the book and lyrics, was certain it could be reworked into a success, and with a revamped script and additional songs by Vincent Youmans, it opened with the new title <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Chance</b> <b>on</b> November 26 at the 42nd Street Apollo Theatre, where it ran for 243 performances. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it [...] "fast, loud, and funny" [...] and added Merman [...] "has never loosed herself with quite so much abandon." [...] Following the Broadway run, she agreed to join the show on the road, but shortly after the Chicago opening, she claimed the chlorine in the city's water supply was irritating her throat, and returned to Manhattan.|$|E
