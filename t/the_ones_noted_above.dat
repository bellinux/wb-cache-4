5000|$|The first English New Testament to use {{the verse}} {{divisions}} was a 1557 translation by William Whittingham (c. 1524-1579). The first Bible in English to use both chapters and verses was the Geneva Bible published shortly afterwards in 1560. These verse divisions soon gained acceptance as a standard way to notate verses, and have since been used in nearly all English Bibles {{and the vast majority}} of those in other languages. (Nevertheless, some Bibles have removed the verse numbering, including <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>noted</b> <b>above</b> that also removed chapter numbers; a recent example of an edition that removed only verses, not chapters, is The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language by Eugene H.

5000|$|For example, if <b>one</b> <b>note</b> has a {{frequency}} of 440 Hz, <b>the</b> <b>note</b> <b>one</b> octave <b>above</b> is at 880 Hz, and <b>the</b> <b>note</b> <b>one</b> octave below is at 220 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times {{the frequency of}} that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55 Hz and 440 Hz are one and two octaves away from 110 Hz because they are [...] (or 2−1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively.|$|R
40|$|This report {{reviews the}} {{appropriateness}} {{and effectiveness of}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s counter-terrorism legislation, focusing on ASIO 2 ̆ 7 s passport confiscation powers, laws relating to Australians fighting in foreign conflicts, and other issues. Summary Chapter II reports that Part IIIAAA of the Defence Act 1903 (Cth) is with one exception appropriate (in the sense discussed in Chapter II of the INSLM’s First Annual Report). The call out powers are also, {{based on the same}} considerations, necessary (again, in the sense discussed in Chapter II of the INSLM’s First Annual Report). Mercifully, there are no empirical data to enable the INSLM to report whether, in practice, these provisions for the call out powers are effective (again, in the sense discussed in Chapter II of the INSLM’s First Annual Report). However, the INSLM has not found any reason to doubt the suitability of these laws to achieve their intended purpose, in practical terms. That does not mean that continuing consultation should not be had, in particular with ADF officers experienced in the area, to detect in advance any curable defects in the efficient deployment of lawful military force against terrorism in Australia. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> exception <b>noted</b> <b>above</b> consists of non-compliance of Division 3 B of Part IIIAAA of the Defence Act with ICCPR. The ADF should not be authorized to kill innocent passengers and crew in airliners. Chapter III seeks to reconcile with the CT Laws the related legislation comprising the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 (Cth). There are defects in Commonwealth statutory powers and authorities desirable to counter terrorism, in relation to that overlap. The matters concerning which the INSLM makes recommendations in this area are relatively urgent, given the currency and gravity of the involvement of Australians in Syria. Chapter IV confronts what may be an intractable difficulty in the proper administration of criminal justice in countering terrorism: the typical need to investigate and prove events and circumstances that took place in foreign countries. Some of the most significant examples of these countries suffer from extraordinary breakdowns of law and order. Chapter V is also actuated by some urgency pointed up by current experiences in Syria. We need more rapid control of the way passports are used to facilitate travel for the purposes of terrorist activity. The topic engenders a broader and deeper concern with dual citizenship. Chapter VI is the INSLM’s response to matters raised by agencies, themselves in response to the INSLM’s request for suggestions as to practical improvements to the laws governing their counter-terrorist activities. It is intended to advance effectiveness while observing appropriateness...|$|R
