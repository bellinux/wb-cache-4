2500|$|Healey was {{appointed}} Shadow Chancellor in April 1972 after Roy Jenkins resigned {{in a row}} over the European Economic Community (Common Market). At the Labour Party conference on 1 October 1973, he said, [...] "I warn you <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be howls of anguish from those rich enough to pay over 75% on their last slice of earnings".

5000|$|In addition, another {{important}} point {{in considering the}} effects of cobalt bombs is that deposition of fallout is not even throughout the path downwind from a detonation, so <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be areas relatively unaffected by fallout and places where there is unusually intense fallout, so that the Earth would not be universally rendered lifeless by a cobalt bomb.

Todd stipulates that his daughter is not allowed to go out anymore, she has to do all of her chores and cannot miss another day of school. Deena reluctantly agrees, but soon finds ways to do what she wants by lying and being manipulative. Her violent eruptions still continue and she even goes as far as breaking one of her father's fingers, for which he has to go to the hospital.

40|$|Highly {{glass powder}} filled photo-curing dental filling {{materials}} based on acrylic resins are used as an alternative for classical amalgam fillings for almost two decades. To improve {{the performance of the}} fillings nowadays nano-particles are introduced in these resins. However, surprisingly less is known about their curing kinetics and how it is affected by the composition of the resin and the kind of the filler. It is shown how the dielectric analysis (DEA) can be used to trace both the short-term photo-curing (Figure 1) as well as the long-term post-curing of such resins when measuring its ion viscosity. Especially if assisted by other thermo-analytical methods the DEA allows for a deeper insight in the processes occurring in the {{dental filling materials}}. Long-term measurements over several days using DEA and DMA (dynamic mechanical analysis) exhibit <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on significant changes of the properties of the dental material which are relevant for the long-term performance (Figure 2). The DEA is an easy to handle and cost efficient method to investigate the curing kinetic either for dental composite material engineering as well as for quality insurance purposes...|$|E
