5|$|The sauropods {{were the}} largest and {{heaviest}} dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> their habitat, and the largest were {{an order of magnitude}} more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as Paraceratherium (the largest land mammal ever) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size. There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but {{it may be that the}} most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.|$|E

Henry's parents {{died when he was}} young and he was raised by his older brother, Bill. Taylor learned to swim in the Hollinwood Canal, and practised in any water body he could find – baths, becks, canals, lakes, etc., {{including}} the Hollinwood Canal and Alexandra Park's boating lake. Austin Rawlinson, who was Taylor's friend and later president of Amateur Swimming Association, recalled that Taylor [...] "loved his swimming more <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> life".

[...] One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, [...] "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head. In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, [...] "...I must confess {{that the degree of}} their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise." [...] After moving to the U.S., he described the book burnings as a [...] "spontaneous emotional outburst" [...] by those who [...] "shun popular enlightenment," [...] and [...] "more <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence." ...|$|E

500|$|Henry Goldblatt, {{writing for}} Entertainment Weekly, gave the episode a grade B. He accused {{the show of}} abandoning the [...] "racial {{diversity}} and the gritty poverty" [...] of the film, but still allowed that Peter Berg had [...] "kept the thrust". The Matt Saracen character was singled out as particularly promising. While positively contrasting the show with other teen-age dramas like One Tree Hill, Goldblatt also had doubts about its staying power. Varietys Brian Lowry called the show [...] "Earnest, beautifully shot and perhaps more organically religious <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> primetime". Still, he felt the show was [...] "like one of those family programs middle America and conservatives pine for that too few of them actually bother to watch". He {{pointed out that the}} show had to compete with both House and Dancing With the Stars, among women as well as men, in order to survive. The Washington Post critic Tom Shales called the show [...] "Extraordinary in just about every conceivable way," [...] particularly emphasising the quality of the cast. Shales did have issues with the documentary style of show's camera movements, but still thought it could be the [...] "best new drama series of the season".|$|E
500|$|The set design, {{costumes and}} props took {{about two weeks}} to prepare. Warm worked {{primarily}} on the sets, while Röhrig handled the painting and Reimann {{was responsible for the}} costumes. Robinson noted the costumes in Caligari seem to resemble a wide variety of time periods. For example, Dr. Caligari and the fairground workers' costumes resemble the Biedermeier era, while Jane's embody Romanticism. Additionally, Robinson wrote, Cesare's costume and those of [...] policemen in the film appear abstract, while many of the other characters seem like ordinary German clothes from the 1920s. The collaborative nature of the film's production highlights the importance that both screenwriters and set designers held in German cinema of the 1920s, although film critic Lotte H. Eisner said sets held more importance <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> German films at that time. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was the first German Expressionist film, although Brockmann and film critic Mike Budd claims it was also influenced by German Romanticism; Budd notes the film's themes of insanity and the outcry against authority are common among German Romanticism in literature, theatre and the visual arts. Film scholar Vincent LoBrutto said the theatre of Max Reinhardt and the artistic style of Die Brücke were additional influences on Caligari.|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss of Time magazine, {{considered}} the film a [...] "by the numbers adaptation," [...] criticising {{the pace and}} the [...] "charisma-free" [...] lead actors. CNN's Paul Tatara found that Columbus and Kloves [...] "are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative {{is more like a}} jamboree inside Rowling's head." [...] Nathaniel Rogers of The Film Experience gave the film a negative review and wrote: [...] "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is as bland as movies can get." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wished that the film had been directed by Tim Burton, finding the cinematography [...] "bland and muggy," [...] and the majority of the film a [...] "solidly dull celebration of dribbling goo." [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times was highly negative about the film, saying [...] " [...] is like a theme park that's a few years past its prime; the rides clatter and groan with metal fatigue every time they take a curve." [...] He also said it suffered from [...] "a lack of imagination" [...] and wooden characters, adding, [...] "The Sorting Hat has more personality <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the movie." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{months of}} acting and singing auditions, Hal Prince offered the still {{relatively}} unknown Paige {{the title role}} of Eva Perón {{in the first stage}} production of the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Evita. Her performance won her critical acclaim and brought her into public prominence at the age of 30. Julie Covington, who played the role on the original concept album, had turned down the opportunity of playing the role on stage leading to a long search for a new star. Paige eventually competed against Bonnie Schoen, an American initially favoured by Prince for the role. She later said, [...] "Bonnie was already a big name on Broadway. In a way, she didn't have anything to prove. She was smoothly, silkily professional. But I saw this as my big chance and, like Eva when she clapped eyes on Peron, I grabbed with both hands. I wanted the role more <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the whole world." [...] For her performance in Evita, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical, which at that time was called the Society of West End Theatre Award. She also won the Variety Club Award for Showbusiness Personality of the Year. She played the role for 20 months in total, from 1978 to 1980. She also released her first studio album in 1978, titled Sitting Pretty. Just prior to her success in Evita, Paige had strongly considered becoming a nursery nurse, but after she sang for Dustin Hoffman, he made her promise that she would continue in theatre work. She admitted that she was [...] "fed up with the whole thing" [...] and that she could not even afford new clothing or to eat out; [...] "Evita saved me" [...] she stated.|$|E
500|$|Giving a {{partially}} negative {{review of the}} film was Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York, who said the [...] "movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into Twilight-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act" [...] and that [...] "Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through. But for a while, this has real fangs". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said, [...] "There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with Jennifer's Body" [...] but that [...] "dmittedly, this {{is the stuff of}} lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema" [...] and [...] "is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to Drag Me to Hell on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on". San Francisco Chronicle Peter Hartlaub stated, [...] "Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of Murder, She Wrote has more thrills." [...] Hartlaub felt the film is not bad, is [...] "almost always pleasing" [...] and that Fox [...] "proves that she has some [...] range" [...] but [...] "the chances that it will be somebody else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none". Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News said, [...] "Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the Transformers boy-toy does spookily well" [...] but [...] "ords and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a pretty bad actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all". He reasoned the [...] "movie's partially redeemed by Seyfried, who makes her character more than a repository for audience sympathy" [...] and [...] "her make-out scene with Fox is handled with more suspense and care <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the movie".|$|E
500|$|Q {{magazine}} {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, stating [...] "It speaks volumes for Pearl Jam's continuing creative acumen that they can respond so confidently to a new punk scene that has sprung up." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album an A- rating, writing that [...] "Three or four of these songs are faster and riffier <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> P. Jam's book, token experiments like [...] "Bugs" [...] are genuinely weird, and in an era of compulsory irony [...] sincerity is something like a relief—a Kurtlike relief at that." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+. He said, [...] "Vitalogy marks the first time it's possible to respect the band's music as much as its stance." [...] He added that [...] "despite its musical advances, Vitalogy leaves an odd, unsettling aftertaste. You walk away from it energized, but wondering what price Eddie Vedder, and Pearl Jam, will ultimately pay for it." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis gave it three out of four stars and commended Pearl Jam for their earnest songwriting. However, DeRogatis also wrote that the album [...] "leaves you wishing that they'd just lighten up". USA Todays Edna Gundersen gave Vitalogy three and a half out of four stars and stated that it [...] "delivers the band's most compelling, inventive and confident music to date", while calling it [...] "the rebel yell of a band that is maturing without mellowing". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn gave Vitalogy four out of four stars and viewed its music as an improvement over Pearl Jam's previous work, writing [...] "This isn't just the best Pearl Jam album but a better album than the band once even seemed capable of making". AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars, saying, [...] "Pearl Jam are at their best when they're fighting, whether it's Ticketmaster, fame, or their own personal demons." [...] According to The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), [...] "By Vitalogy PJ hit their apex … the band's creative zenith, finding them doing a Led Zeppelin III on acoustic tracks like 'Corduroy' and turning in a Tom Waits-like weird attack on 'Bugs'".|$|E

2500|$|The {{influence}} of the Welsh language, which Tolkien had learned, is summarized in his essay English and Welsh: [...] "If I may once more refer to my work.

This element in the tale has given perhaps more pleasure to more readers <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bekenstein {{assumed that}} black holes are maximum entropy objects—that {{they have more}} entropy <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the same volume. In a sphere of radius R, the entropy in a {{relativistic}} gas increases as the energy increases. The only known limit is gravitational; when {{there is too much}} energy [...] the gas collapses into a black hole.
