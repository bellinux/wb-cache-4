It is a 2 -substituted 1 [...] methyl carbap-enem with a unique guanidine-pyrrolidine side chain. Pharmaco-kinetic studies indicate that <b>tomopenem</b> has a longer half-life (about 2 h) than those of launched carbapenem (about an hour), such as imipenem-cilastatin and meropenem (6, 9, 11). Ertap-enem, one of the new parenteral carbapenems, also has a pro-longed plasma half-life of about 5 h, largely due to its high protein binding of 95 % (13). As for <b>tomopenem,</b> it is reported that its low affinity to renal transporters {{is one of the reasons}} for its long plasma half-life in humans (10). <b>Tomopenem</b> has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Tomopenem</b> (CS- 023) {{is a novel}} {{parenteral}} carbapenem with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, as well as potent activity against drug-resistant pathogens, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We {{compared the}} in vivo activity of <b>tomopenem</b> and that of meropenem in a chronic lower respiratory infection mouse model of P. aeruginosa. METHODS: Mice with chronic airway infection by P. aeruginosa were treated with saline (as the control, twice daily), <b>tomopenem</b> (100 mg/kg, twice daily) or meropenem (100 mg/kg, twice daily) for 7 days. After treatment, the number of viable bacteria in lungs and histopathological findings were analysed. The pharmacokinetics of <b>tomopenem</b> and meropenem were also analysed after initial treatment. RESULTS: The number of viable bacteria in lungs treated with saline, <b>tomopenem</b> or meropenem was 4. 21 +/- 1. 28, 2. 91 +/- 0. 87 and 3. 01 +/- 1. 00 log(10) cfu/lung (mean +/- SEM), respectively (P < 0. 05, control versus tomopenem- or meropenem-treated groups). In the histopathological examination of lung specimens, the control group had the features of chronic bronchial infection; however, tomopenem- and meropenem-treated groups had fewer inflammatory cells compared with the control group. The pharmacokinetic parameter of % time above MIC for <b>tomopenem</b> and meropenem was 16 % and 17 % in sera and 15 % and 18 % in lungs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Tomopenem</b> significantly {{reduced the number of}} viable bacteria in a murine model of chronic airway infection by P. aeruginosa, compared with the control. Considering the longer half-life of <b>tomopenem</b> in humans compared with most other carbapenems, <b>tomopenem</b> treatment of chronic airway infection with P. aeruginosa is expected to be efficacious...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tomopenem</b> (formerly CS- 023), a novel 1 β-methylcarbapenem, {{exhibited}} high {{affinity for}} penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 in Staphylococcus aureus, PBP 2 in Escherichia coli, and PBPs 2 and 3 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are considered major lethal targets. Morphologically, <b>tomopenem</b> induced spherical forms in E. coli and short filamentation with bulges in P. aeruginosa, which {{correlated with the}} drug's PBP profiles. The potential of resistance of these bacteria to <b>tomopenem</b> was comparable to that to imipenem...|$|E
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} effects (ABE) of <b>tomopenem</b> (formerly RO 4908463 /CS- 023) against seven Staphylococcus aureus strains (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] strain <b>tomopenem</b> MICs, 0. 5 to 16 mg/liter; methicillin-sensitive S. aureus [MSSA] strain <b>tomopenem</b> MIC, 0. 06 mg/liter) {{were studied}} in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model. Initially, two human doses were simulated, 750 mg every 8 hours (8 hly) and 1, 500 mg 8 hly intravenously, using S. aureus at a standard inoculum of 106 CFU/ml. There was a rapid clearance of bacteria {{from the model}} by 12 h after drug exposure with most strains. Clearance {{was not related to}} the <b>tomopenem</b> MIC. The ABE of these two <b>tomopenem</b> dose regimens were also tested at a high inoculum, 108 CFU/ml; in all simulations, there was a > 4 -log drop in viable count at 24 h. Strains were not cleared from the model at 108 CFU/ml, in contrast to what was seen for the standard inoculum. When the ABE of <b>tomopenem</b> at 750 mg 8 hly was compared to those of vancomycin, <b>tomopenem</b> was seen to have a superior effect, as measured by the area under the bacterial kill curve at 24 h (AUBKC 24) and 48 h (P MIC) drug exposures of 0 to 100 % (8 to 10 doses per strain) with five MRSA/MSSA strains. The T>MIC for a 24 -h bacteriostatic effect was 8 % ± 5 % (range, 1. 3 % to 15. 4 %); the T>MIC for a 4 -log drop in viable count was 32 % ± 18 % (range, 12. 8 % to 36. 2 %). The T>MIC for a 90 % maximum response using AUBKC 24 as ABE was 24. 9 % ± 15. 7 %. Inoculum had little impact on T>MIC exposures for ABE. There was emergence of resistance to <b>tomopenem</b> in the dose ranging studies, with increased growth of subpopulations on plates containing <b>tomopenem</b> at 2 × and 4 × the MIC compared to what was seen for preexposure population analysis at T>MICs of MICs achievable in humans...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tomopenem</b> (formerly CS- 023) {{is a novel}} 1 β-methylcarbapenem with broad-spectrum {{coverage}} of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Its antibacterial activity against European clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was {{compared with those of}} imipenem and meropenem. The MICs of <b>tomopenem</b> against MRSA and P. aeruginosa at which 90 % of the isolates tested were inhibited were 8 and 4 μg/ml, respectively, and were equal to or more than fourfold lower than those of imipenem and meropenem. The antibacterial activity of <b>tomopenem</b> against MRSA was correlated with a higher affinity for the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 a. Its activity against laboratory mutants of P. aeruginosa with (i) overproduction of chromosomally coded AmpC β-lactamase; (ii) overproduction of the multidrug efflux pumps MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, and MexEF-OprN; (iii) deficiency in OprD; and (iv) various combinations of AmpC overproduction, MexAB-OprM overproduction, and OprD deficiency were tested. The increases in the MIC of <b>tomopenem</b> against each single mutant compared with that against its parent strain were within a fourfold range. <b>Tomopenem</b> exhibited antibacterial activity against all mutants, with an observed MIC range of 0. 5 to 8 μg/ml. These results suggest that the antibacterial activity of <b>tomopenem</b> against the clinical isolates of MRSA and P. aeruginosa should be ascribed to its high affinity for PBP 2 a and its activity against the mutants of P. aeruginosa, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of impaired renal function on the pharmacokinetics of <b>tomopenem</b> (RO 4908463 /CS- 023), a novel carbapenem antibiotic, and its major metabolite in humans. Thirty-two subjects were enrolled in an open-label, two-center study. Subjects were evenly assigned to one of four groups, based on creatinine clearance ranges of ≥ 80, 50 to 79, 30 to 49, and < 30 ml/min. The drug was given as a single 1, 500 -mg constant-rate intravenous infusion over 60 min. There were no safety concerns with increasing renal dysfunction. Renal impairment had a significant impact on exposure of both <b>tomopenem</b> and its metabolite. Mean (± standard deviation) areas under the curve for <b>tomopenem</b> increased with decreasing renal function, from 191 ± 35. 2 to 1, 037 ± 238 μg·h/ml. The maximum concentration of drug in plasma (Cmax) increased with a maximum difference of 44 % between the severe and normal groups. In contrast, the corresponding increase in Cmax of the metabolite was much higher, at 174 %. Total body clearance was linearly correlated with creatinine clearance (R 2 = 0. 97; P < 0. 0001). Renal clearance for <b>tomopenem</b> decreased with increasing severity of disease, with mean values decreasing from 4. 63 ± 0. 89 to 0. 59 ± 0. 19 liters/h. The results of this study indicated a strong correlation between the creatinine clearance and total clearance of <b>tomopenem.</b> While renal impairment appeared to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of <b>tomopenem,</b> an even greater effect was seen on the elimination of the inactive metabolite...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tomopenem</b> (formerly CS- 023) {{is a novel}} {{carbapenem}} with broad-spectrum activities {{against diverse}} hospital pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We examined the in vivo pharmacodynamic characteristics of <b>tomopenem</b> against P. aeruginosa and MRSA by using a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with P. aeruginosa 12467 (MIC, 1 μg/ml) and MRSA 12372 (MIC, 2 μg/ml). The mice had 106 to 107 CFU/thigh of each strain 2 h after inoculation and were treated for 24 h with a fractionated administration of <b>tomopenem</b> given at intervals of 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. The serum protein binding of <b>tomopenem</b> was 17. 4 %. The efficacy of <b>tomopenem</b> in both infection models was enhanced by frequent dosing, which indicates that the efficacy {{is driven by the}} time above MIC (TMIC). In a sigmoid model, the cumulative percentages of the 24 -h period that the concentrations of free, unbound fractions of the drug exceeded the MIC under steady-state pharmacokinetic conditions (f%TMICs) were best correlated with efficacy when R 2 was 0. 79 and 0. 86 against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, respectively. Other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) indexes for the free, unbound fractions, the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC) and the maximum concentration of the drug in serum divided by the MIC (Cmax/MIC), showed poor correlation with efficacy when R 2 was ≤ 0. 42. The f%TMIC values required for a static effect, 1 -log kill, and 2 -log kill against P. aeruginosa were 29, 39, and 51, respectively, which were similar to those for meropenem, for which the values were 24, 33, and 45, respectively. Against MRSA, the values for <b>tomopenem</b> were 27, 35, and 47. In conclusion, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of <b>tomopenem</b> were similar to those of meropenem against P. aeruginosa, and {{there was no difference between}} the target values for P. aeruginosa and MRSA required for efficacy in this study...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tomopenem</b> (formerly CS- 023) {{is a novel}} {{carbapenem}} {{with improved}} activity against diverse hospital pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and has a half-life about twice longer than the half-lives of other carbapenems such as imipenem and meropenem. Our objective {{in this study was}} to estimate the efficacy of <b>tomopenem</b> in humans by human-simulated exposures in a neutropenic murine thigh infection model against 9 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa with MICs of 4 to 32 g/ml and 9 clinical isolates of MRSA with MICs of 4 to 16 g/ml. Human-simulated dosing regimens in neutropenic mice were designed to approximate the cumulative percentage of a 24 -h period that the free drug concentration exceeds the MIC under steady-state pharmacokinetic conditions (f%TMIC) observed with tomo-penem at 750 and 1, 500 mg given as a 0. 5 -h infusion three times a day (TID) in humans. As reported previously, {{there was no difference between}} the target values of P. aeruginosa and MRSA required for efficacy (K. Sugihara et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 54 : 5298 - 5302, 2010). <b>Tomopenem</b> at 750 mg showed bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects against 10 of 11 strains of P. aeruginosa and MRSA with MICs of 41), and <b>tomopenem</b> at 1, 500 mg showed bactericidal effects against 16 of 17 strains of P. aeruginosa and MRSA with MICs of 43).
