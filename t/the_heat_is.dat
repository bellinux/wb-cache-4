5|$|The {{observed}} {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone, so {{the main source}} of heat remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus is not enough to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> produced through another mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E
5|$|Phil England {{writes in}} The Ecologist that the {{strength}} of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Ross Gelbspan’s <b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>is</b> On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Is</b> On is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by American soul and funk group The Isley Brothers, {{released}} June 7, 1975 on T-Neck Records and Epic Records. Written and produced entirely by the group, {{the album was}} recorded in 1975 at Kendum Recorders in Burbank, California. The group implemented many acoustic and electric instruments during its recording, including guitar, piano, and synthesizer. Primarily a funk and soul outing, <b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Is</b> On features musical elements of quiet storm and rock music, and it is divided between uptempo funk songs and subdued smooth soul-ballads.|$|E
25|$|Electricity can be {{produced}} by thermal processes that burn fecal and solid waste together to maintain stable combustion and <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> used to make steam that drives generators.|$|E
25|$|Cogeneration, or {{combined}} {{heat and}} power (CHP), {{refers to the}} concurrent generation of power and heat from the same energy source. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> then used in local applications such as heating homes.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Is</b> On sold 500,000 {{copies in}} its first month of release and spent 40 weeks on the U.S. Billboard Pop Albums chart. It became the Isley Brothers' first number-one album in the United States. The album {{initially}} received generally favorable reviews from publications, including The Village Voice, Melody Maker, and Rolling Stone. Music critics have since cited the album as among the Isley Brothers' best work. In 1999, <b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Is</b> On was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with shipments of two million copies. It was reissued on compact disc in 2001 by Epic Records.|$|E
25|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} June 1975 on the Epic imprint-label T-Neck Records in the United States. It was also made available {{that same year}} in 8-track cartridge and cassette formats, while Epic issued an LP release for distribution in the Netherlands. <b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Is</b> On charted on June 14, 1975 and spent 40 weeks on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. It became the Isley Brothers' first album to hit {{number one on the}} chart, which had been considered a rare feat for a black band at the time (the only other black bands who scored a number-one album on the pop charts were their funk contemporaries The Ohio Players and Earth, Wind & Fire). <b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Is</b> On also peaked at number one on the Billboard Black Albums chart.|$|E
25|$|About 80–85% of {{the core}} thermal power is removed by the fuel rod coolant channels, via the {{graphite}} rings. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> removed by the control rod channel coolant. The gas circulating in the reactor {{plays the role of}} enabling the heat transfer to the coolant channels.|$|E
25|$|After generation, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> {{distributed}} to the customer via a network of insulated pipes. District heating systems consist of feed and return lines. Usually the pipes are installed underground {{but there are also}} systems with overground pipes. Within the system heat storage units may be installed to even out peak load demands.|$|E
25|$|Process {{controllability}} - Unlike {{a traditional}} gas furnace the induction system requires no pre-heat cycle or controlled shutdown. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> available on demand. In {{addition to the}} benefits of rapid availability {{in the event of}} a downstream interruption to production the power can be switched off thus saving energy and reducing scaling on the components.|$|E
25|$|While the {{excessive}} heat produced by incandescent light bulbs is frequently {{seen as a}} drawback, in certain applications {{it is seen as}} an advantage. For example, automotive applications in cold climates benefit from the radiated heat as it melts potentially visually-obstructive snow and ice on warning lights and signs. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> also used to melt the wax inside lava lamps.|$|E
25|$|Solid-oxide {{fuel cells}} produce {{heat from the}} {{recombination}} of the oxygen and hydrogen. The ceramic can run as hot as 800 degrees Celsius. This heat can be captured and used to heat water in a micro {{combined heat and power}} (m-CHP) application. When <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> captured, total efficiency can reach 80–90% at the unit, but does not consider production and distribution losses. CHP units are being developed today for the European home market.|$|E
25|$|Just as many {{conventional}} {{thermal power}} stations generate electricity by harnessing the thermal energy released from burning fossil fuels, {{nuclear power plants}} convert the energy released from the nucleus of an atom via nuclear fission {{that takes place in}} a nuclear reactor. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> removed from the reactor core by a cooling system that uses the heat to generate steam, which drives a steam turbine connected to a generator producing electricity.|$|E
25|$|Despite Minnesota's cold winters, {{only the}} mall's entrances and some below ground areas are heated. Heat is allowed in through {{skylights}} above the central amusement park area. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> produced by lighting fixtures, other electric devices, {{and people in}} the mall. In fact, even during the winter, air conditioning systems may still be in use during peak hours to ensure a comfortable shopping environment. Although the common areas are unheated, the individual stores do have heating systems.|$|E
25|$|As a solid {{piece of}} chocolate, the cocoa butter fat {{particles}} {{are in a}} crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter are able to break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases – the melting process. When <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.|$|E
25|$|At 25°C, {{in excess}} water, {{half of the}} MIC is {{consumed}} in 9 min.; if <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> not efficiently removed from the mixture, {{the rate of the}} reaction will increase and rapidly cause the MIC to boil. If MIC is in excess, 1,3,5-trimethylbiuret is formed along with carbon dioxide. Alcohols and phenols, which contain an O-H group, react slowly with MIC, but the reaction can be catalyzed by trialkylamines or dialkyltin dicarboxylate. Oximes, hydroxylamines, and enols also react with MIC to form methylcarbamates. These reactions produce the products described below (Uses).|$|E
25|$|In 1881, the German {{physicist}} Emil Warburg put a {{block of}} iron into a strong magnetic field {{and found that it}} increased very slightly in temperature. Some commercial ventures to implement this technology are underway, claiming to cut energy consumption by 40% compared to current domestic refrigerators. The process works as follows: Powdered gadolinium is moved into a magnetic field, heating the material by 2 to 5°C (4 to 9°F). <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> removed by a circulating fluid. The material is then moved out of the magnetic field, reducing its temperature below its starting temperature.|$|E
25|$|Primarily a funk {{and soul}} outing, <b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Is</b> On {{features}} elements of quiet storm and rock. The latter musical style is mostly {{provided by the}} Jimi Hendrix-influenced guitar of Ernie Isley. The album {{is part of a}} succession of slickly-produced, successful soul records issued by the Isley Brothers during the 1970s that were divided between startlingly tough funk songs and subdued romantic ballads. This musical formula for the album serves as a development of the group's transitional sound last featured on their landmark tenth album, 3 + 3 (1973).|$|E
25|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place in}} 1975 at Kendun Recorders in Burbank, California. It was mixed at Westlake Audio in Los Angeles, California and mastered by engineer Kent Duncan. The album was entirely written and produced by the Isley Brothers. The group implemented many acoustic and electric instruments during its recording, including guitar, piano, and the ARP synthesizer, which was programmed by engineers Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff. <b>The</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Is</b> On is the third album recorded by the Isley Brothers with keyboardist Chris Jasper, bassist Marvin Isley, and guitarist Ernie Isley.|$|E
25|$|When thermal {{radiation}} strikes an object, part will be reflected, part transmitted, {{and the rest}} absorbed. The fraction that is absorbed depends on the nature and color of the material. A thin material may transmit a lot. A light colored object may reflect much of the incident radiation and thus escape damage, like anti-flash white paint. The absorbed {{thermal radiation}} raises {{the temperature of the}} surface and results in scorching, charring, and burning of wood, paper, fabrics, etc. If the material is a poor thermal conductor, <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> confined {{to the surface of the}} material.|$|E
25|$|District heating {{distributes}} {{heat generated}} in a centralized location for {{residential and commercial}} heating requirements. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> often obtained from a cogeneration plant burning fossil fuels but increasingly biomass, although heat-only boiler stations, geothermal heating and central solar heating are also used, as well as nuclear power. A system was built in France in the 14th Century and the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland began steam district heating service in 1853. However, the first commercially successful district heating system was launched in Lockport, New York, in 1877 by American hydraulic engineer Birdsill Holly, considered the founder of modern district heating.|$|E
25|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} coolant — usually water but {{sometimes}} a gas or a liquid metal (like liquid sodium) or molten salt — is circulated past the reactor core {{to absorb the}} heat that it generates. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the turbines, like the pressurized water reactor. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the reactor core; for example the boiling water reactor.|$|E
25|$|Three of {{the four}} probes have tiny heating {{elements}} and temperature sensors inside them. One probe uses internal heating elements to send out a pulse of heat, recording the time the pulse is sent and monitoring {{the rate at which}} <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> dissipated away from the probe. Adjacent needles sense when the heat pulse arrives. The speed that the heat travels away from the probe as well as the speed that it travels between probes allows scientists to measure thermal conductivity specific heat (the ability of the regolith to conduct heat relative to its ability to store heat) and thermal diffusivity (the speed at which a thermal disturbance is propagated in the soil).|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as if they have been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
25|$|The Passarell process uses reduced {{atmospheric}} pressure rather than heat to drive evaporative desalination. The pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor. The compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the reduced {{pressure in the}} evaporation chamber. The compressor centrifuges the pure water vapor after it is drawn through a demister (removing residual impurities) causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber. The compression of the vapor increases its temperature. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> transferred to the input water falling in the tubes, vaporizing {{the water in the}} tubes. Water vapor condenses {{on the outside of the}} tubes as product water. By combining several physical processes, Passarell enables most of the system's energy to be recycled through its evaporation, demisting, vapor compression, condensation, and water movement processes.|$|E
25|$|CO2 {{can bind to}} the MOF surface through either {{physisorption}} or chemisorption, where physisorption occurs through van der Waals {{interactions and}} chemisorption occurs through covalent bonds being formed between the CO2 and MOF surface. Once the MOF is saturated with CO2, the MOF would then be regenerated (CO2 {{is removed from the}} MOF to be transported elsewhere for sequestration or enhanced oil recovery) through either a temperature swing or a pressure swing. In a temperature swing, the MOF would be heated up until CO2 desorbs; temperature swing regeneration is usually used in post-combustion configurations where <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> supplied from heat exchangers with the power plant. To achieve working capacities comparable to the amine solvent process, the MOF must be heated up to around 200 C. In a pressure swing, the pressure would be decreased until CO2 desorbs; this would usually be used in a pre-combustion carbon capture configuration.|$|E
25|$|District heating (also {{known as}} heat {{networks}} or teleheating) {{is a system}} for distributing heat generated in a centralized location for residential and commercial heating requirements such as space heating and water heating. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>is</b> often obtained from a cogeneration plant burning fossil fuels but increasingly also biomass, although heat-only boiler stations, geothermal heating, heat pumps and central solar heating are also used, as well as nuclear power. District heating plants can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers. According to some research, district heating with {{combined heat and power}} (CHPDH) is the cheapest method of cutting carbon emissions, and has one of the lowest carbon footprints of all fossil generation plants. A combination of CHP and centralized heat pumps are used in the Stockholm multi energy system. This allows the production of heat through electricity when there is an abundance of intermittent power production and cogeneration of electric power and district heating when the availability of intermittent power production is low.|$|E
