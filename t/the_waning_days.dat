5|$|In 1934, {{when the}} Crown {{prosecutor}} for Prince Albert resigned {{to become the}} Conservative Party's legislative candidate, Diefenbaker took his place as prosecutor. Diefenbaker did not stand in the 1934 provincial election, in which the governing Conservatives lost every seat. Six days after the election, Diefenbaker resigned as Crown prosecutor. The federal government of Bennett was defeated the following year and Mackenzie King returned as Prime Minister. Judging his prospects hopeless, Diefenbaker had declined a nomination to stand again against Mackenzie King in Prince Albert. In <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> of the Bennett government, the Saskatchewan Conservative Party President was appointed a judge, leaving Diefenbaker, who had been elected the party's vice president, as acting president of the provincial party.|$|E
25|$|The fort {{remained}} in {{use during the}} Mughal era, and was used almost continuously until 1707, {{though it was not}} popular with the Mughal rulers since it lacked large gardens and the sort of grand architecture found at Mughal-era forts, such as at the Lahore Fort. Remilitarization of the fort occurred in <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> of the Mughal empire, as the rival Sikh Empire began to expand in the region. Nadir Shah of Persia and Afghan ruler Ahmed Shah Abdali had both camped at the fort in their expeditions in the Punjab during <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> of the Mughal empire.|$|E

As they neared the road a sudden waft of perfume from the lavender-fields beyond filled the air, and a breath of wind came sweeping through the yellow corn-fields. Brand, with his hat in his hand, looked thoughtfully about him.|$|R

25|$|However, Jonathan Chait of The American Prospect and The New Republic {{notes that}} Nader did indeed focus on swing states disproportionately during <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> of the campaign, {{and by doing}} so jeopardized his own chances of {{achieving}} the 5% of the vote he was aiming for.|$|E

At length, at eventide, the sweet-toned bell of the little cathedral rang to vespers,--a gentle message of peace to war. Colonel Clark looked into my upturned face.|$|R

In <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> of President John Adams's administration, Jay was confirmed by the Senate for another term as Chief Justice, but he declined the position and retired to his farm in Westchester County, New York.|$|E
25|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to win passage of the stalled legislation, the city commissioners held yet another hearing in <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> of the 52nd Congress. The January 15th hearing was {{cancelled}} when the commissioners were unexpectedly called to Capitol Hill to testify. But PHC representatives noted that lobbyists for real estate syndicates showed up in large numbers for the hearing. The hearing was eventually held on January 23, but there was no new evidence or testimony offered and the stalemate continued.|$|E
25|$|In December 1916, 60th Division was {{transferred}} to Salonika, although they remained for only six months and took part in no serious fighting. Moving to Palestine in June 1917, Bulfin was promoted to lieutenant-general and given command of XXI Corps. He proved a capable corps commander, leading his formation through Ottoman defenses at the Third Battle of Gaza, opening {{the way for the}} capture of Jerusalem.

And the breeze blew into those windows very softly and pleasantly, and great flocks of pigeons flew about in the air with noisy and clapping flight, and numbers of other pigeons strutted on the tiles of the roof and bridled and cooed {{to each other in the}} red sunlight of <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>day.</b> So this was a very pleasant place in which to dwell.

25|$|During the Italian {{campaign}} of 1943, 130,000 Free French soldiers fought on the Allied side and, {{by the time}} of the Normandy invasion, Free French forces numbered approximately half a million regulars and more than 100,000 French Forces of the Interior (FFI). The Free French 2nd Armored Division, under General Philippe Leclerc, landed in Normandy, and, in <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> of summer 1944, led the drive toward Paris. The FFI in Normandy and the Île-de-France region surrounding Paris began to harass German forces intensively, cutting roads and railways, setting ambushes and fighting conventional battles alongside their allies.|$|E
25|$|The US Standard Light Rail Vehicle was a {{light rail}} vehicle (LRV) built by Boeing Vertol in the 1970s. The Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) {{promoted}} it as a standardized vehicle for U.S. cities. Part {{of a series of}} defense conversion projects in <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> of the Vietnam War, the LRV was seen as both a replacement for older PCC streetcars in many cities and as a catalyst for new cities to construct light rail systems. The USSLRV was marketed as and is popularly known as the Boeing LRV (not to be confused with their prior lunar roving vehicles for NASA) and is usually referred to as such.|$|E

The Intercept, questioning Freeh's impartiality, reported that nine days after Freeh's investigation cleared Kazeminy of wrongdoing, Freeh's wife received a one-half ownership stake from Kazeminy in a Palm Beach property valued at $3 million.

25|$|When he {{was elected}} by the ministers to succeed King Thado Minbya, Swa took over a small kingdom barely three years old, and one that still faced several {{external}} and internal threats. In the north, he successfully fought off the Maw raids into Upper Burma, a longstanding problem since <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> of Sagaing and Pinya kingdoms. He maintained friendly relations with Lan Na in the east, and Arakan in the west, placing his nominees on the Arakense throne between 1373 and 1385. In the south, he brought semi-independent kingdoms of Toungoo (Taungoo) and Prome (Pyay) firmly into Ava's orbit. But his attempts to extend control farther south touched off the Forty Years' War (1385–1424) between Ava and Pegu.

25|$|Then {{there was}} the debate within the Nader {{campaign}} over where to travel in <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> of the campaign. Some Nader advisers urged him to spend his time in uncontested states such as New York and California. These states – where liberals and leftists could entertain the thought of voting Nader without fear of aiding Bush – offered the richest harvest of potential votes. But, Martin writes, Nader – who emerges from this account as the house radical of his own campaign – insisted on spending {{the final days of}} the campaign on a whirlwind tour of battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Florida. In other words, he chose to go where the votes were scarcest, jeopardizing his own chances of winning 5 percent of the vote, which he needed to gain federal funds in 2004.|$|E

60|$|Up the valley, under a dizzy precipice, nestled {{the village}} of Kandersteg, our halting-place for the night. We were soon there, and housed in the hotel. But <b>the</b> <b>waning</b> <b>day</b> had such an {{inviting}} influence {{that we did not}} remain housed many moments, but struck out and followed a roaring torrent of ice-water up to its far source in a sort of little grass-carpeted parlor, walled in all around by vast precipices and overlooked by clustering summits of ice. This was the snuggest little croquet-ground imaginable; it was perfectly level, and not more than a mile long by half a mile wide. The walls around it were so gigantic, and everything about it was on so mighty a scale that it was belittled, by contrast, to what I have likened it to--a cozy and carpeted parlor. It was so high above the Kandersteg valley that there was nothing between it and the snowy-peaks. I had never been in such intimate relations with the high altitudes before; the snow-peaks had always been remote and unapproachable grandeurs, hitherto, but now we were hob-a-nob--if one may use such a seemingly irreverent expression about creations so august as these.|$|R
