5|$|The <b>taxable</b> <b>value</b> of {{an estate}} was {{initially}} assessed from the Domesday Survey, but other methods were later employed, such as valuations {{based on the}} sworn testimony of neighbours or {{on the number of}} plough-teams the taxpayer used. Carucage never raised as much as other taxes, but nevertheless helped to fund several projects. It paid the ransom for Richard's release in 1194, after he was taken prisoner by Leopold V, Duke of Austria; it covered the tax John had to pay Philip II of France in 1200 on land he inherited in that country; and it helped to finance Henry III's military campaigns in England and on continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|When taxes once {{payable to}} Rome were {{transferred}} to the Crown, Cromwell saw the need to assess the <b>taxable</b> <b>value</b> of the Church's extensive holdings as they stood in 1535. The result was an extensive compendium, the Valor Ecclesiasticus. In September of the same year, Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions, to be undertaken by four appointee visitors. The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country's religious houses, with largely negative conclusions. In addition to reporting back to Cromwell, the visitors made {{the lives of the}} monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards. The result was to encourage self-dissolution. In any case, the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly {{to the beginning of the}} state-enforced dissolution of the monasteries with all religious houses worth less than £200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536. After a short pause, surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners, and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539. By January 1540 no such houses remained: some 800 had been dissolved. The process had been efficient, with minimal resistance, and brought the crown some £90,000 a year. The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed. Cromwell's actions transferred a fifth of England's landed wealth to new hands. The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown, which would use the lands much more efficiently. Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England's religious houses, they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform.|$|E

A tax rate of about 30 mills is applied to the <b>taxable</b> <b>value,</b> resulting in an effective tax rate of about 1%. In the 2005 tax year the average millage was about 26.47 for residential property and 29.80 for non-residential property.

2500|$|Leeds parish {{is thought}} to have {{developed}} from a large British multiple estate which, under subsequent Anglo-Saxon occupation was further sub divided into smaller land holdings. The ancient estate straddled the wapentakes of Morley and Skyrack, encompassing Leeds, Headingley, Allerton, Gipton, Bramley, Armley, Farnley, Beeston and Ristone (Wortley). Leeds parish in Skyrack was {{the most important of these}} holdings. Leeds was then further sub divided so that when the first dependable historical record about Leeds (as [...] "Ledes") [...] was written in the Domesday book of 1086, it was recorded as having comprised seven small manors in the days of Edward the Confessor. At the time of the Norman conquest, Leeds was evidently a purely agricultural domain, of about [...] in extent. It was divided into seven manors, held by as many thanes; they possessed six ploughs; there was a priest, and a church, and a mill: its <b>taxable</b> <b>value</b> was six pounds. When the Domesday records were made, it had slightly increased in value; the seven thanes had been replaced by twenty-seven villains, four sokemen, and four bordars. The villains were what we should now call day-labourers: the soke or soc men were persons of various degrees, from small owners under a greater lord, to mere husbandmen: the bordars are considered by most specialists in Domesday terminology to have been mere drudges, hewers of wood, drawers of water. The mill, when this survey [...] was made, was worth four shillings. There were [...] of meadow.

2500|$|Local {{historian}} T. Walter Hall (in 1931), following Sidney Addy (1893), {{suggested that}} the district's original settlement was at Hallam Head, above the River Rivelin, {{and that it had}} been destroyed during the Harrying of the North. [...] As evidence, he noted that the location lies by the ancient Long Causeway route and that the name of the neighbouring Burnt Stones Common referenced its destruction. A compilation of early maps of the area surrounding Hallam Head assembled by Hallam (2015) from a number of sources provides compelling evidence that a pre-Conquest nucleated settlement, almost assuredly the Domesday village of Hallam, was located immediately south of the old Roman road (Redmires Road) approximately 4.5 km west of Sheffield. The geographic centre coincides with the junction of Tom Lane and Carsick Hill Road; two ancient byways found mentioned in medieval charters from the 13th century. [...] Hallam provides corroborating charter evidence that leads to the identification of the location Hallam Head, the site for the village of Hallam identified by T. Walter Hall in 1931, being situated near the upper end, or head of the village. [...] A series of three communal fields designated Hallam fields (Hallam Field, Great Hallam Field and Common Fields of Hallam) are mentioned frequently in surrenders from 1550 onward in the context of common pasture. [...] The apparent pattern of a nucleated settlement and associated three-field system would be analogous to ‘town planning’ without a town, had the village of Hallam not existed. The arguments presented by T. Walter Hall and Hallam are rejected by David Hey, who notes that {{there is no evidence of}} any settlement larger than a hamlet ever having existed at the site, and that evidence suggests that the Harrying of the North did not affect the Sheffield area. The simple fact that the village of Hallam and Waltheof's aula had been destroyed and no longer existed, and that the <b>taxable</b> <b>value</b> of the manors in the area had been significantly devalued by the time of the Domesday Survey would contradict Hay's position. [...] Addy himself preferred a location just outside the village of Stannington, where there is evidence of a large manor house surrounded by a moat.|$|E

40|$|Proponents {{of urban}} {{revitalization}} assert that neighborhood redevelopment is a win-win proposition for all stakeholders involved, as development cre-ates positive externalities which resonate {{beyond the scope}} of each project. Property values for neighborhood residents improve, the local government en-joys the budget boost of a higher tax base, and developers collect well earned profits. This frequently studied and accepted line of thinking supports the use of measures such as tax increment financing, subsidized development, and lighter zoning standards in communities across America. This study examines the view that residential development creates positive externalities through the study of <b>taxable</b> <b>values</b> in the neighborhood surrounding Durham, North Caro-lina’s Lyon Park. In 2008 a sustained neighborhood revitalization effort led by Self Help, a local non-profit, coincided with a county wide tax reassessment, providing a unique ability to quantify the effects of redevelopment on property values in Lyon Park.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that revaluation {{and the use of}} current market value in principle as the underpinning for the property tax base will improve the equitable distribution of the property tax between taxpayers. Because the market place is dynamic and ever-changing, and the property tax is an annually recurring tax, it is necessary to establish an ongoing system of periodic revaluation to ensure that the relationships established in an initial appraisal are still accurate. All of this is justifiable from the standpoint of maximizing equity, assuming that equity is defined in terms of maintaining an accurate relationship between the tax and the market value of the underlying property. However, both initial establishment of appraised values and subsequent reappraisal are costly, time consuming endeavors. Depending on the type of property, the extent of the revaluation, and available resources, costs may vary from as little as a few dollars to more than $ 80 per parcel. In addition, taxpayers often fear that some aspect of tax amount stability and predictability that may have occurred without reappraisal may be lost with it. Also, depending on the underlying taxation system, taxpayers fear that reappraisal means higher <b>taxable</b> <b>values</b> and higher taxes. These factors have lead to a hodge podge of tax and reappraisal policies across the United States. In this paper, we will explore the connections between costs, equity, and taxpayer concerns regarding revaluation and the worsening prospects for successfully reconciling all of these issues in cases where revaluation has been infrequent. We will also attempt to outline features that should be contained within a model policy. property tax, Revaluation Policy, reappraisal policies,...|$|R
