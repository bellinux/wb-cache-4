5|$|A. Bjarne Riis has {{admitted}} to doping during the 1996 Tour de France. The {{organizers of the}} Tour de France have stated {{that they no longer}} consider him to be the winner, although Union Cycliste Internationale has so far refused to change the official status due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of time passed since his win. Jan Ullrich was placed second on the podium in Paris.|$|E
5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Chaoyangsaurus is {{recovered}} {{in a more}} basal position than Psittacosauridae, although Chinnery's original analysis finds it within Neoceratopsia. Protoceratopsidae {{is considered to be}} the sister group of Ceratopsoidea. The fragmentary Asiaceratops was included in these studies and is found to have a variable position, either as a basal neoceratopsian or as a leptoceratopsid, most likely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of missing information. Removal of Asiaceratops stabilizes the entire cladogram.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth {{into three}} {{categories}} according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of precipitation they received. In this now widely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least twelve consecutive months without precipitation, arid lands have less than 250mm (10in) of annual precipitation, and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250 and 500mm (10–20in). Both extremely arid and arid lands {{are considered to be}} deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different orangutan field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the animals from the different sites. They found the different orangutan populations behaved differently. The evidence suggested the differences were cultural: first, {{the extent of the}} differences increased with distance, suggesting cultural diffusion was occurring, and second, the size of the orangutans' cultural repertoire increased according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of social contact present within the group. Social contact facilitates cultural transmission.|$|E

5|$|Most states, {{including}} Alaska, do {{not allow}} samples after three hours and a preservative required to halt fermentation was not added to the sample. Fermentation could have added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of alcohol in the sample, making the result invalid. As {{a result of the}} accident, in 1991 the United States Coast Guard suspended his masters' license for a period of nine months. Hazelwood was acquitted on all felony charges, but was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil, fined $50,000, and sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service.|$|E
5|$|Power looms {{introduced}} in the early 19th century {{put an end to}} the last remnants of the domestic system in Crompton, but not without resistance. Weavers and spinners were paid according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of cloth they produced; independent hand loom weavers saw a drop in their income, and could not compete with the mechanised mass production that was gathering pace in the township. Luddites rioted in the township in 1826, smashing 24power looms at Clegg's mill at High Crompton in protest against their worsening standard of living.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{is composed of}} 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide. The amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere is relatively small compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of carbon dioxide, but because the atmosphere is so much thicker than that on Earth, its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Stalinist period, most Soviet {{workers had}} been paid for their work based on a piece-rate system. Thus their {{individual}} wages were directly tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of work they produced. This policy was intended to encourage workers to toil and therefore increase production as much as possible. The piece-rate system led {{to the growth of}} bureaucracy and contributed to significant inefficiencies in Soviet industry. In addition, factory managers frequently manipulated the personal production quotas given to workers to prevent workers' wages from falling too low.|$|E
5|$|United States {{swimmers}} {{have won}} the title 43 times, followed by Australia (13 times) and East Germany (11 times). This ratio is approximately proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of gold medals won by the respective nations at the Olympics. East Germany was particularly successful in the 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping.|$|E

5|$|While {{historically}} pure, {{the stream}} now suffers from urban stream syndrome, partially due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of impervious surfaces within its watershed.

5|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{the team}} encountered was converting all game elements into a fully-3D world, including {{the sound and}} radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> that existed within the open world; producer Dan Houser {{said that there was}} about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game, while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000. The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model. Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.|$|E

5|$|Although the Panzer IV was {{deployed}} to north Africa with the German Afrika Korps, until the longer gun variant began production, the tank was outperformed by the Panzer III {{with respect to}} armor penetration. Both the Panzer III and IV had difficulty in penetrating the British Matilda II's thick armor, while the Matilda's 40-mm QF 2 pounder gun could knock out either German tank; its major disadvantage was its low speed. By August 1942, Rommel had only received 27 Panzer IV Ausf. F2s, armed with the L/43 gun, which he {{deployed to}} spearhead his armored offensives. The longer gun could penetrate all American and British tanks in theater at ranges of up to , {{by that time the}} most heavily armored of which was the M3 Grant. Although more of these tanks arrived in North Africa between August and October 1942, their numbers were insignificant compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of matériel shipped to British forces.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens {{to design}} a {{memorial}} for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Lutyens proposed a U-shaped cloister sheltering a Stone of Remembrance {{standing in front of}} a circular lily pool, in the centre of which would be a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own epitaphs but this proved impractical due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of space that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties.|$|E
