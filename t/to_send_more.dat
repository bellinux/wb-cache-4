5|$|During an {{official}} visit by an Afghan delegation, Kosygin and Andrei Kirilenko criticised Afghan leaders Nur Muhammad Taraki and Hafizullah Amin for Stalinist-like repressionist behaviour. He promised <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> {{economic and military}} aid, but rejected any proposal regarding a possible Soviet intervention, as an intervention in Afghanistan would strain the USSR's foreign relations with the First World according to Kosygin, most notably West Germany. However, in a closed meeting, without Kosygin, who strongly opposed any kind of military intervention, the Politburo unanimously supported a Soviet intervention.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{a senior}} Kodokan {{instructor}} named Yamashita Yoshiaki {{traveled to the}} United States {{at the request of}} the Seattle businessman Sam Hill. In Washington, DC, Yamashita's students included Theodore Roosevelt and other prominent Americans. At Roosevelt's request, Yamashita also taught judo at the US Naval Academy. Capitalizing on the publicity, the Japanese Legation in the USA asked the Kodokan <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> judo teachers to America, providing continuity to Yamashita's work. Tomita reluctantly accepted the task; Maeda and Satake embraced the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Poles {{relieved}} {{the pressure on the}} British as the Germans were forced <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> forces south of the Rhine. Fearing an attack on {{the southern end of the}} road bridge or the Nijmegen road, a battalion of the 34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Landstorm Nederland, Machine Gun Battalion 47 and other Kampfgruppes headed across the river overnight.|$|E

5|$|Balon Greyjoy {{speaks to}} Yara about their {{war against the}} North. Yara {{points out that the}} armies of the North have retaken all of the Ironborn strongholds on the mainland, and pleads with him to end the war. However, Balon refuses and vows <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> troops to stage another {{invasion}} of the North. As Balon heads outside, he encounters his brother, Euron Greyjoy, who has come to overthrow him. Balon attempts to stab Euron, who throws him off a bridge to his death. At Balon's funeral, Yara swears revenge against Balon's killer, but is reminded by her uncle Aeron, a Drowned Priest, that her position as successor depends on the results of the Kingsmoot, a ceremony where the Ironborn elect their new leader.|$|E
5|$|The French {{arrived in}} Armenia {{in the late}} evening on Friday, December 9 and {{relieved}} the exhausted Armenian workers who then returned to Yerevan. Japan sent a monetary gift of $9 million while Italy had {{plans to build a}} prefabricated village for the victims, and West Germany offered <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> than a dozen heavy cranes. The Americans donated generously as well, with Washington dispatching eight official planeloads of official relief aid plus a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter from Italy. Private donations from the United States were also significant. Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca arranged for a fund drive, and in Chicago (one of five major Armenian population centers in the US) the community raised $800,000 and donated 20,000 pounds of supplies.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, the Arabs {{could not}} achieve a decisive result. The main Khazar army {{remained}} intact and a constant threat, since like all nomad forces {{it was not}} dependent on cities for supplies. Coupled {{with the fact that}} his rear was still insecure, al-Jarrah was forced to abandon any attempt at capturing Samandar as well, and to retreat to Warthan south of the Caucasus. From there he asked for reinforcements from Yazid, but although the Caliph promised <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> troops, he failed to do so. The sources are obscure on al-Jarrah's activity in 723, but he seems to have led another campaign north (which may indeed be the true date of the Balanjar campaign). In response, the Khazars raided south of the Caucasus, but in February 724, al-Jarrah inflicted a crushing defeat on them in a battle between the rivers Cyrus and Araxes that lasted for several days. Al-Jarrah followed up his success by capturing Tiflis, whose inhabitants were obliged to pay the kharaj but received a charter of rights in return. This campaign brought Caucasian Iberia and the lands of the Alans under Muslim suzerainty, and al-Jarrah became the first Muslim commander to march through the Darial Pass in the process. This expedition secured the Muslims' own flank against a possible Khazar attack through the Darial, while conversely it gave the Muslim army a second invasion route into Khazar territory.|$|E
50|$|Supporting his vision, he {{received}} his very first donation from none other than Eleanor Roosevelt. This is how the former First Lady also became the very FIRST donor to Dollars for Scholars, the signature program of Scholarship America. To date, Dr. Fradkin's vision {{has led to the}} inception of 1100 chapters across the U.S. including Jefferson Dollars for Scholars. Together, these chapters have raised over $3 billion and contributed <b>to</b> <b>sending</b> <b>more</b> than 2 million students to college.|$|R

25|$|Within a {{short time}} Prussia was being {{attacked}} on four fronts, by Austria from the south, France from the west, Russia from the east, and Sweden from the north. Frederick fought defensive actions trying to blunt the invaders, losing thousands of men and precious resources in the process.

25|$|Speculation {{immediately}} {{followed that}} the run-off election would be cancelled. Afghanistan {{was thrown into}} a crisis after the withdrawal of Abdullah, which in effect {{cleared the way for}} Karzai to retain power despite the accusations of fraud.

25|$|On 11 December 1941 Hitler {{declared}} war on the United States. While this gave German submarines plenty of targets, the order <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> vessels to American waters made less U-Boats available for cooperation with Fliegerführer Atlantik. Between 1 August 1940 and 31 December 1941, Fw 200s made 41 contacts with convoys, 18 were exploited by U-Boats that sank 48 merchant ships (129,771grt), along with two destroyers, a corvette and Audacity.|$|E

25|$|But {{the defeat}} at Calven had {{put an end}} to Maximilian's attempt to gain control over the Val Müstair and its passes. His allies of the Swabian League refused <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> {{soldiers}} to the Grisons, which was of no interest to them. Maximilian returned to Lake Constance, and subsequently led the operations on the northern border of the Swiss Confederacy. But his troops suffered many defeats, and in September 1499, he had to agree to the Peace of Basel.|$|E
25|$|Amer also advised Nasser <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> {{troops into}} the Sinai to inflict his promised defeat on Israel, {{even though the}} risk of their being cut off if the Canal zone were seized by Anglo-French forces was enormous. Not until late on 31 October did Nasser {{disregard}} Amer's rosy assessment and ordered his forces to disengage in the Sinai and to retreat back to the Canal zone to face the expected Anglo-French invasion. Eden and Mollet ordered Phase I of Operation Revise to begin 13 hours after the Anglo-French ultimatum.|$|E
25|$|Confronted with {{difficult}} terrain {{and a general}} European ignorance of the Urewera region to {{which most of the}} survivors fled, the government abandoned plans for a full-scale military invasion and opted <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> kupapa forces into the area on scouting missions, unaccompanied by European officers. On 16 March an exploratory expedition led by Pitiera Kopu set out from Wairoa, reached Onepoto three days later and immediately claimed its first victims. The expedition raided a camp of about 60 people, most of whom escaped. Three of their quarry were killed, with one elderly chief executed by Kopu; McLean viewed that execution as a reprisal for the earlier killing of his envoy to the Waikaremoana chiefs.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{his return}} to Tasmania in 1916, MacDonald {{attempted}} to enlist again and was successful due to what he {{believed to be the}} army's desire <b>to</b> quickly <b>send</b> <b>more</b> troops after large numbers of Australians had been killed while fighting in the war.|$|R

25|$|At the Rome Conference (5–6 January 1917) Lloyd George, {{advised by}} Hankey, {{proposed}} sending heavy guns to Italy {{with a view}} to defeating Austria-Hungary, possibly to be balanced by a transfer of Italian troops to Salonika. Robertson stressed that this was contrary to agreed policy and hinted that he might resign. Cadorna (Hankey suspected he had been “got at by Robertson”) stressed the logistical difficulty of accepting the heavy guns, even when Lloyd George removed the precondition that they be returned to the Western Front by May, and even Albert Thomas (French Minister of Munitions) thought it unwise to remove the guns from the Western Front. Robertson wrote to Lloyd George explicitly threatening to resign if he acted on Briand’s impassioned plea <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> divisions to Salonika.|$|E
25|$|The {{departments}} {{included in}} the uprising, called the Vendée Militaire, included the area between the Loire and the Layon rivers: Vendée (Marais, Bocage Vendéen, Collines Vendéennes), part of Maine-et-Loire west of the Layon, and the portion of Deux Sèvres west of the River Thouet. Having secured their pays, the deficiencies of the Vendean army became more apparent. Lacking a unified strategy (or army) and fighting a defensive campaign, from April onwards the army lost cohesion and its special advantages. Successes continued for some time: Thouars was taken in early May and Saumur in June; there were victories at Châtillon and Vihiers. After this string of victories, the Vendeans turned to a protracted siege of Nantes, {{for which they were}} unprepared and which stalled their momentum, giving the government in Paris sufficient time <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> troops and experienced generals.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the next}} morning, as he {{prepared}} to advance further, Caesar received word from Atrius that, once again, his ships at anchor had been dashed against each other in a storm and suffered considerable damage. About forty, he says, were lost. The Romans were unused to Atlantic and Channel tides and storms, but nevertheless, considering the damage he had sustained the previous year, this was poor planning on Caesar's part. However, Caesar may have exaggerated the number of ships wrecked to magnify his own achievement in rescuing the situation. He returned to the coast, recalling the legions that had gone ahead, and immediately set about repairing his fleet. His men worked day and night for approximately ten days, beaching and repairing the ships, and building a fortified camp around them. Word was sent to Labienus <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> ships.|$|E

25|$|On 2 January, Nivelle {{instructed}} the Aéronautique Militaire to co-operate with the British to investigate German defensive systems that spies and repatriated civilians had reported. Not until 26 January, did a British intelligence summary report {{a new line}} of defence between Arras and Laon. In February, attempts <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> aircraft to reconnoitre the line were hampered by mist, snow, rain, low cloud and an extremely determined German air defence. British air reconnaissance discovered diggings between Drocourt and Vitry en Artois at the end of January and on 15 February, found a line between Quéant and Etaing. The British were able to trace the new line (named the Drocourt–Quéant Switch) south to Bellicourt on 15 February and St Quentin on 25 February, the day after the first German withdrawal on the Ancre. British aircraft losses on these flights were severe due to the presence of Jagdstaffel 11 (the Richthofen Circus) near Douai; six British reconnaissance aircraft were shot down on 15 April, along with two escorts.|$|E
25|$|In May 1943, Kwok {{returned}} to Jesselton {{with a high}} determination to liberate North Borneo. Once he arrived there, he first contacted the Overseas Chinese Defence Association (OCDA), with whose help he acquired medical equipment and cash donations {{for the support of}} the resistance in Sulu. Once again, in June 1943, he travelled with Marajukim to the Philippines. Through the mediation of Suarez, he met with the representatives of the US army and was appointed Lieutenant on 1 July 1943. The second time he return to North Borneo, Kwok already get three pistols, a box of hand grenades and was promised to be given more weapons. However, as he could not induce the guerrillas in the Sulu Archipelago <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> firearms, he was forced to launch a revolt with limited supplies. A resistance group under his leadership was then established on 21 September 1943, with the group calling themselves as the Chinese National Salvation Association (CNSA), a branch of the OCDA. With collaboration between the Chinese and indigenous peoples, the group were subsequently known as Kinabalu Guerrillas Defence Force.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1900 the {{rebellion}} reached Peking, where the German legation was attacked and foreign nationals withdrew to the relative safety of the Legation Quarter. Government troops joined forces with the rebels and the railway to the Treaty Port of Tientsin was interrupted. Admiral Sir Edward Seymour, then the Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, sent reinforcements to Peking, but they were insufficient to defend the Legation. An attempt was therefore made <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>more</b> troops from Tientsin, where British ships had been joined by French, German, Russian, American, Austrian, Italian and Japanese. The international naval brigade force of naval marines placed itself under the senior officer present, which was Seymour. After an urgent call for help from the Legation, Seymour set out on 10 June 1900 with 2,000 troops to attempt to break through to Peking in the Seymour Expedition. The force got about half way before abandoning the attempt because the railway line had been torn up. By now rebels had begun destroying the track behind the force, cutting it off from Tientsin.|$|E
