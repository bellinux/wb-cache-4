5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bulky</b> body of Styracosaurus resembled {{that of a}} rhinoceros. It had {{powerful}} shoulders {{which may}} have been useful in intraspecies combat. Styracosaurus had a relatively short tail. Each toe bore a hooflike ungual which was sheathed in horn.|$|E
5|$|Mapracorat {{is one of}} {{a number}} of trifluoropropanolamines and -amides which are less {{obviously}} steroid-like in structure. Other typical examples of this group are ZK216348 and 55D1E1. <b>The</b> <b>bulky,</b> bicyclic aromatic substituents (R1 and R2) account for the structural similarity to corticoids. The R conformation of the asymmetric carbon atom seems to be essential for GR affinity.|$|E
5|$|LC filters at low {{frequencies}} become awkward; the components, especially the inductors, become expensive, bulky, heavy, and non-ideal. Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; that material will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large temperature coefficient). For applications such as a mains filters, the awkwardness must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then amplifiers {{can be used to}} make RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with vacuum tube amplifiers; these filters replaced <b>the</b> <b>bulky</b> inductors with bulky and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient active filter designs. Later, inexpensive operational amplifiers enabled other active RC filter design topologies. Although active filter designs were commonplace at {{low frequencies}}, they were impractical at high frequencies where the amplifiers were not ideal; LC (and transmission line) filters were still used at radio frequencies.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{explanation}} uses stereoelectronic {{effects and}} steric arguments. As mentioned, the substituent that is antiperiplanar to the peroxide {{group in the}} transition state will migrate. This transition state has a gauche interaction between the peroxyacid and the non-migrating substituent. If <b>the</b> <b>bulkier</b> group is placed antiperiplanar to the peroxide group, the gauche interaction between the substituent on the forming ester and the carbonyl group of the peroxyacid will be reduced. Thus, it is <b>the</b> <b>bulkier</b> group that will prefer to be antiperiplanar to the peroxide group, enhancing its aptitude for migration.|$|R

5|$|The red-billed chough breeds {{from three}} years of age, and {{normally}} raises only one brood a year, although the age at first breeding is greater in large populations. A pair exhibits strong mate and site fidelity once a bond is established. <b>The</b> <b>bulky</b> nest is composed of roots and stems of heather, furze or other plants, and is lined with wool or hair; in central Asia, the hair may be taken from live Himalayan tahr. The nest is constructed in a cave or similar fissure in a crag or cliff face. In soft sandstone, the birds themselves excavate holes nearly a metre deep. Old buildings may be used, and in Tibet working monasteries provide sites, as occasionally do modern buildings in Mongolian towns, including Ulaanbaatar. The red-billed chough will utilise other artificial sites, such as quarries and mineshafts for nesting where they are available.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} unique Titan classes, {{variants}} of light, medium, and heavy, with inversely related speed and armor: the all-rounder Atlas, <b>the</b> <b>bulky</b> Ogre, and the fleet-footed Stryder. The latter two chassis are unlocked upon finishing both faction campaigns and were later made unlockable by leveling up as well. Each chassis has a respective Core power that {{works on a}} cooldown timer: respectively, increased damage, increased shields, and unlimited dashes. Titan tactical ability options include stopping enemy ammunition in midair to throw back in their direction, emitting electrified smoke to hurt and repel pilots climbing the Titan's back, and deploying a defensive wall. Additionally, players can equip two perk kits to customize for their preferred strategy. Their primary weapons include rocket launchers, lightning cannons, and chainguns. Titans can act autonomously when put in guard and follow modes, which directs the Titan either to protect their vicinity or to tail their pilot, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that <b>the</b> <b>bulky</b> handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, {{the use of}} {{triethylamine}} as {{the base}} can lead to epimerisation at the carbon alpha to the newly formed carbonyl. Using <b>the</b> <b>bulkier</b> base diisopropylethylamine (iPr2NEt, Hünig's base) can mitigate this side reaction.|$|R
50|$|A {{derivative}} called Long March 2F/G, first {{launched in}} 2011, {{was designed to}} launch space laboratories such as Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2. It dispenses with the launch escape system and sports a larger fairing to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>bulkier</b> payloads.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} claimed that <b>the</b> <b>bulky</b> rear wing that was {{affixed to the}} rear of the car from 2007 to early 2010 {{increased}} the severity of many on-track incidents by causing cars to flip over or go airborne at high speeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{method has}} also been applied to the {{synthesis}} of enantiopure benzyl amines in scheme 3, which involves ortho-lithiation of tert-butyl phenyl sulfoxide.

25|$|Another possibility, {{suggested}} by Frederick Zugibe, {{is that the}} nails may have been driven in at an angle, entering in the palm in the crease that delineates <b>the</b> <b>bulky</b> region {{at the base of}} the thumb, and exiting in the wrist, passing through the carpal tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the parent ligand bearing phenyl groups on the phosphorus atoms, <b>the</b> <b>bulkier</b> derivatives DM-SEGPHOS and DTBM-SEGPHOS are also commercially available.

50|$|Unlike the Curtius rearrangement, {{there is}} a choice of R-groups on the phosphinic azide which can migrate. Harger {{has found that the}} alkyl groups migrate {{preferentially}} to aryl groups, and this preference increases in the order methyl < primary < secondary < tertiary. This is probably due to steric and conformational factors, as <b>the</b> <b>bulkier</b> <b>the</b> R-group, the less favorable the conformation for phenyl migration.|$|R
25|$|In {{the model}} studies to {{synthesize}} chlorothricolide, an intramolecular Diels Alder reaction gave {{a mixture of}} diastereomers. But by installing the a bulky TMS substituent, the reaction gave the desired product in high diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity in good yield. <b>The</b> <b>bulky</b> TMS substituent helps enhance allylic 1,3 strain in the conformation of the molecule.|$|E
25|$|Consumer use of {{magnetic}} tape machines only {{took off in}} the early 1960s, after playback machines reached a comfortable, user-friendly design. This was achieved primarily {{by the introduction of}} transistors which replaced <b>the</b> <b>bulky,</b> fragile, and costly vacuum tubes of earlier designs. Reel-to-reel tape then became more suitable to household use, but still remained an esoteric product.|$|E
25|$|Zinc enolates, {{prepared}} from {{alkali metal}} enolates and ZnCl2, provide control of stereochemistry in aldol condensation reactions due to chelation {{on to the}} zinc. In the example shown below, the threo product was favored over the erythro {{by a factor of}} 5:1 when ZnCl2 in DME/ether was used. The chelate is more stable when <b>the</b> <b>bulky</b> phenyl group is pseudo-equatorial rather than pseudo-axial, i.e., threo rather than erythro.|$|E
30|$|To reduce {{crowding}} instruments, {{the profile}} {{should be as}} slim as possible.

25|$|In 1985, a US {{specification}} {{model was}} produced by the factory, with styling changes to allow bumpers to meet US federal safety standards. Many owners, however, had those bumpers removed immediately, or never had them installed at all, as <b>the</b> <b>bulky</b> looking addition to the car was said to ruin the otherwise smooth lines of the body. The 1985 US model had a base price close to $100,000. Only two optional extras were available: a $5,500 aerodynamic spoiler and a $7,500 sound system.|$|E
25|$|His {{expertise}} in color photography subsequently {{brought him to}} National Geographic magazine, where he was officially hired on July 23, 1934. The magazine prided itself on publishing quality color photography, and Marden was making good use of a lightweight Leica, which could hang from a single neck strap. Marden persuaded the magazine to see the benefits of using the small 35mm cameras loaded with the new Kodachrome film over <b>the</b> <b>bulky</b> cameras with tripods and glass plates that were {{being used by the}} magazine's photographers at the time.|$|E
25|$|With the V70 Bi-Fuel Volvo {{continued}} {{to offer a}} factory CNG powered car. A 95-litre tank installed in the trunk allowed for a claimed range of 250km running on CNG only. Due to <b>the</b> <b>bulky</b> tank rear cargo space was considerably reduced. Drivers could choose whether their car should run on petrol or CNG {{at the touch of}} a button. On Bi-Fuel models the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster was replaced by a level gauge for the gas tank. Several options, such as a trip computer and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models.|$|E
