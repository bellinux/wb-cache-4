40|$|In {{the paper}} the {{development}} of educational psychology as a scientific discipline is presented, {{and the history of}} its development in Slovenia is described in detail. The key scientific research and professional areas of educational psychologists are outlined. The fact is that the educational psychology in the broader Euro-American psychological context has a relatively longer tradition than in Slovenia. However, the analysis of various sources shows that the Slovene educational psychologists with their contributions have established a strong position in the modern international flows, both in the areas of educational psychological issues {{as well as in the}} methodology of the research. Nowadays Slovene educational psychologists with their research results, teaching and professional work offer an important contribution to <b>the</b> <b>understanding,</b> <b>quality</b> and {{the development of}} educational practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{conceptual}} modelling of business processes is becoming popular. The number of techniques and tools is growing fast. At the same time, an appropriate framework for <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of these modelling techniques is lacking. In this paper we report upon {{the development of}} a framework for <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of business process modelling techniques, called the Q-ME framework. The framework defines the elements that constitute a modelling technique and presents a number of quality properties as well as ways to operationalise them. In this paper, the framework is applied to illustrate the quality of the Dynamic Essential Modelling of Organisations (DEMO) business modelling technique. Conclusions are drawn both on the quality of DEMO an...|$|R

The aim is to identify the conceptualizations of quality in higher education that underlie the use of different concepts such as efficiency and equity.

Finally, two ideological tendencies for <b>the</b> <b>understanding</b> of <b>quality</b> in higher education are presented: quality as productivity and quality as social responsibility...|$|R

Detecting and removing these discrepancies allows us to ensure the accuracy of the stored data as well as to increase <b>the</b> level of <b>understanding</b> of <b>the</b> data involved in an enterprise application...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>understanding</b> of <b>Quality</b> of Life is {{recognized}} as an increasingly important healthcare topic because the relationship between cost and value raises complex problems, often with high emotional attachment {{because of the potential}} impact on human life. For instance, healthcare providers must refer to cost-benefit analysis to make economic decisions about access to expensive drugs that may prolong life by short amount of time and/or provide a minimal increase to quality of life. Additionally, these treatment drugs must be weighed against the cost of alternative treatments or preventative medicine. In the case of chronic and/or terminal illness where no effective cure is available, an emphasis is placed on improving health-related quality of life through interventions such as symptom management, adaptive technology, and palliative care.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{established}} by Elijah Pepper, the distillery was {{passed on to}} his son and known as the Oscar Pepper Distillery when Dr. James Crow worked there in the mid-19th century. During this time Dr. Crow undertook a series of activities that improved and codified <b>the</b> <b>understanding</b> and <b>quality</b> of key bourbon-making processes such as sour-mash fermentation, pot still distillation and barrel maturation. The Pepper family sold the property to Leopold Labrot and James Graham in 1878, who owned and operated it (except during Prohibition) until it was sold to the Brown-Forman Corporation in 1941. Brown-Forman operated it until 1968, then sold the then-mothballed property in 1971. Brown-Forman re-purchased the property in 1993, refurbished it, and brought it back into operation.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{research}} problems for enabling content distribution and supporting real-time interpersonal communication services (e. g. voice and video) over best effort networks with sufficient quality. We take a practical view of content distribution and quality, {{and this is}} the reason for the term “sufficient”. We argue that <b>the</b> <b>understanding</b> of <b>quality</b> as perceived by the user is a key factor in this context, but also that <b>the</b> <b>understanding</b> of context dependence is a key factor for delivering services which are “good enough” to make the user satisfied. We base our assumptions upon results from the Celtic TRAMMS project, and we describe how to leverage upon the framework for traffic measurements that was built up in that project. Moreover, we identify key technological components that are common for optimization of content delivery and real-time interpersonal communication services such as VoIP and videoconferencing. We also describe how the research problems stated will be tackled in the newly started IPNQSIS project...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>understanding</b> of <b>quality</b> {{concepts}} of industrial research managers, in the USA, Australia and Brazil, has been assessed by evaluation of {{their responses to}} a questionnaire on <b>quality.</b> <b>The</b> levels of <b>understanding</b> of <b>the</b> industrial research managers from the three countries are compared. The results are illuminating. Industrial Research Managers occupy a pivotal position in the innovation process as they stand between the researcher and the manufacturing entity. It is postulated that they need a sound knowledge of basic quality processes if innovation is to result in internationally competitive products or services. From the results obtained it is concluded that limited appreciation of quality issues and mis-understandings of quality persist in the industrial community. In so far as differences exist between countries, this can impact the current push for increased innovation levels in differing ways in different companies. In the long term this can result in more, or less, internationally competitive industries, critically important given the apparently inexorable movement towards globalisation...|$|R
