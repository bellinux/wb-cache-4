2500|$|In the United States, lead is {{prohibited}} in solder and flux in plumbing applications for drinking water use, per <b>the</b> <b>Safe</b> <b>Drinking</b> <b>Water</b> Act (SDWA). Historically, {{a higher proportion}} of lead was used, commonly 50/50. This had the advantage of making the alloy solidify more slowly. With the pipes being physically fitted together before soldering, the solder could be wiped over the joint to ensure water tightness. Although lead water pipes were displaced by copper when the significance of lead poisoning began to be fully appreciated, lead solder was still used until the 1980s because it was thought that the amount of lead that could leach into water from the solder was negligible from a properly soldered joint. The electrochemical couple of copper and lead promotes corrosion of the lead and tin. [...] Tin, however, is protected by insoluble oxide. Since even small amounts of lead have been found detrimental to health, lead in plumbing solder was replaced by silver (food-grade applications) or antimony, with copper often added, and the proportion of tin was increased (see Lead-free solder.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Kaine endorses making coal energy {{production}} cleaner, {{saying that it}} is imperative [...] "to convert coal to electricity with less pollution than we do today." [...] He has criticized those who [...] "frame the debate as a conflict between an economy and the environment," [...] saying that [...] "protecting the environment is good for the economy." [...] Kaine co-sponsored the Advanced Clean Coal Technology Investment in Our Nation (ACCTION) Act, legislation to increase investment in clean coal technologies. He voted against passage of legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. Kaine supports the use of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) to harvest natural gas from shale formations. He believes this will reduce carbon pollution.

2500|$|At an {{oversight}} {{hearing before the}} House Committee on Government Reform in early March 2004, Marc Edwards testified that his studies showed the change from chlorine to chloramine {{was the cause of}} the elevated lead levels. [...] He stated that the chloramine-treated water was leaching lead not only from the old lead lines, but also from brass fixtures in homes. [...] Brass is made with lead; even brass classified as [...] "lead free" [...] under <b>the</b> <b>Safe</b> <b>Drinking</b> <b>Water</b> Act can contain up to eight percent lead. [...] Edwards said that this could be the cause of the high lead levels in areas where WASA did not use lead lines. [...] He also cautioned that replacing lead service lines with copper could make the problem worse; newly installed copper lines could react with the chloramine {{in a way that would}} increase corrosion of the remaining lead lines in the system. The chief of the Washington Aqueduct disagreed, saying that tests taken after the chloramine treatment commenced didn't show any additional corrosiveness. He believed corrosion inhibitors, like orthophosphate, could be added to the water to prevent lead leaching. In the spring of 2004, a temporary switch from chloramine back to chlorine for annual pipe flushing caused a 25 to 30 percent drop in lead levels, lending credence to the chloramine theory. In one home that was tested by WASA before and after the switch, lead levels dropped tenfold.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first known}} report of TCE in {{groundwater}} {{was given in}} 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE. Based on available federal and state surveys, between 9% to 34% of the drinking water supply sources tested in the U.S. may have some TCE contamination, though EPA has reported that most water supplies are {{in compliance with the}} maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 5 ppb. In addition, a growing concern in recent years at sites with TCE contamination in soil or groundwater has been vapor intrusion in buildings, which has resulted in indoor air exposures, such is in a recent case in the McCook Field Neighborhood of Dayton, Ohio. Trichloroethylene has been detected in 852 Superfund sites across the United States, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).
