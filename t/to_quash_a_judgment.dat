25|$|In Ex parte Tom Tong (1883), the Court held that—under 1872 {{amendments}} to the certification procedure, which went into effect during the Chase Court-era—because habeas corpus was a civil proceeding, questions arising in habeas cases could not be certified to the Supreme Court until <b>a</b> final <b>judgment</b> had been entered.

25|$|In short while, a mainly Junimist cabinet {{headed by}} Theodor Rosetti {{was to take}} over.

This has prompted {{some in the}} media and UK public to question how the United States has jurisdiction over a foreign media organisation or media taped and stored outside the United States and fully funded by a foreign government. Judge Ellis took the controversial position, because the footage does not qualify as confidential without considering jurisdiction of the US Federal District Court.|$|R
50|$|The {{information}} plaque at Seagate Castle {{records that}} the 'Treaty of Irvine' between Scotland and England was signed at Seagate Castle on 9 July 1297. In 1297 Edward I {{had sent a}} punitive expedition under Sir Henry Percy <b>to</b> Irvine <b>to</b> <b>quash</b> <b>an</b> armed uprising against his dethronement of John Balliol. The Earl of Carrick, Robert Bruce, Bishop Wishart and others led the Scottish army, however after much argument they decided to submit without a fight.

50|$|Mandamus, being a {{discretionary}} remedy, {{the application}} for {{that must be}} made in good faith and not for indirect purposes. Acquiescence cannot, however, bar the issue of mandamus. The petitioner must, of course, satisfy the Court {{that he has the}} legal right to the performance of the legal duty as distinct from mere discretion of authority. A mandamus is normally issued when an officer or an authority by compulsion of statute is required to perform a duty and that duty, despite demand in writing, has not been performed. In no other case will a writ of mandamus issue unless it be <b>to</b> <b>quash</b> <b>an</b> illegal order.|$|R

President Lyndon Johnson had ordered the invasion to stem what he claimed to be a [...] "Communist threat", however the mission appeared ambiguous and was roundly condemned throughout the hemisphere as a return to gunboat diplomacy. In 1983 the US invaded Grenada to remove populist left-wing leader Maurice Bishop. The US maintains a naval military base in Cuba at Guantanamo Bay. The base is one of five unified commands whose [...] "area of responsibility" [...] is Latin America and the Caribbean. The command is headquartered in a Miami, Florida office building.|$|R
