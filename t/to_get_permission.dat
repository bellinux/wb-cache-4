5|$|The {{idea for}} Sholay {{began as a}} four-line snippet which screenwriter pair Salim-Javed told G. P. Sippy and Ramesh Sippy; two other producer/director teams had earlier {{rejected}} the idea. Ramesh Sippy liked the concept and hired them to develop it. The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge {{the murder of his}} family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that it would be difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>permission</b> to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhist {{version of}} the Bhasmasura tale {{continues}} with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>permission</b> to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka ("eldest brother") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.|$|E
5|$|Since 1888, when Mahdist rebels {{forced the}} {{evacuation}} of then governor Emin Pasha, the Lado Enclave had been occupied by rebels {{under the leadership of}} Emir Arabi Dafalla. Rejaf was their strongest fortified position in the area, and it was there Arabi Dafalla stationed his equipment and soldiers. The establishment of Mahdist Sudan had provided the context for European powers to commence the invasion and colonization of the Sudan, in which King Leopold desperately wanted to take part in order to expand his Congolese empire. However, a direct military campaign into the area was not an option; Leopold {{would not have been able}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>permission</b> from either the French or the British according to the rules laid out in the 1884 Berlin Conference, especially considering both nations were looking to annex the Sudan themselves. King Leopold II therefore decided to disguise his campaign into the Sudan as an expeditionary force sent to reclaim the Lado Enclave from the Mahdists, although he inended to give his commanders covert orders to continue their advance far past the boundaries of Belgian territory, first to Fashoda and then on to Khartoum. After receiving a new loan of 6.5 million francs from the Belgian government in 1895, Leopold ordered preparations to be made for the execution of his plan.|$|E

The initiative, passed in 1992, prohibited unions from spending dues collected by non-members on political issues without first getting their permission. In the opinion, Ireland (serving as justice pro tempore) wrote the law was unconstitutional as it was “too heavy an administrative burden” on the union <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>permission</b> from each non-member. Subsequently, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Washington court’s decision in Davenport v. Washington Education Association.|$|E

25|$|Lithuanian encyclopedias are encyclopedias {{published}} in the Lithuanian language or encyclopedias about Lithuania and Lithuania-related topics. The first known {{attempt to create a}} Lithuanian encyclopedia was in 1883, when Jonas Jacevičius failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>permission</b> from the Tsarist authorities for such a publication during the Lithuanian press ban (1866–1904). Several general Lithuanian encyclopedias were published afterwards: one in independent Lithuania in the 1930s (interrupted by World War II and never completed), two in the United States, three in the Lithuanian SSR, and one that was {{published in}} 2001–2015 in independent Lithuania.

25|$|In October 1946, Stanley {{approached}} fur-dealer Cyril Ross, {{the common}} acquaintance from the Manchester train, {{with a business}} proposition. Ross {{said that he would}} be interested in a multiple store such as J.Jones of Manchester. Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>permission</b> for floatation as a public company from the Capital Issues Committee. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.|$|E
25|$|On the Batavian {{right wing}} of General Daendels, {{absolutely}} nothing happened that day, as the inundations made his lines impenetrable. There was a strange incident when the British General Don, under cover of a flag of truce, tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>permission</b> to cross the Batavian lines {{on a mission to}} the Batavian government. As on the Batavian left wing the battle had clearly started, Daendels considered this an abuse of the flag of truce. Besides, Don turned out to have papers on his person that could be considered to be of a seditious nature. Daendels therefore arrested Don as a spy and sent him to Brune's headquarters. Don was incarcerated in the fortress of Lille and only years later exchanged for the Irish rebel James Napper Tandy.|$|E

In January 1918, he was {{informed}} that Nicholas II {{and his family were}} sent as prisoners to Tobolsk. Eventually the situation took {{a turn for the worse}} in Finland. Desperate to escape and be reunited with his family after four years of separation, he made the mistake to ask for a new passport and permission to leave the country to the new Soviet government. This eventually sealed his fate. On 3 April 1918, he was arrested and brought back to Petrograd under the escort of Red Guards.|$|E
25|$|Land was, {{after some}} conflicts, {{acquired}} or expropriated and construction was started. The construction {{was completed in}} 1908 and employed between 200 and 300 people. Originally the plans were to only build the line from Thamshavn to Svorkmo while the stretch from Svorkmo to Løkken was to be operated by a cable car. But Thams soon realised {{that this was a}} mistake and decided to extend the line to Løkken. This caused some problems since he needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>permission</b> from the Ministry of the Interior and was not allowed to operate passenger traffic all the way to Løkken before 1910. The line between Thamshavn and Svorkmo was opened on 10 July 1908 by King Haakon VII while the last section to Løkken was opened on 15. August 1910 by Prime Minister Wollert Konow.|$|E
25|$|The project stalled for 18 months while Nicholson made The King of Marvin Gardens. Guber told Ayres that {{he could}} get Burt Reynolds, Jim Brown, and David Cassidy and a new writer, and he would approve {{production}} immediately. Ayres rejected this proposal, and the studio agreed to wait because they were afraid that the producer would take the film to another studio. Ashby and Ayres read navy publications and interviewed current and ex-servicemen who helped them correct minor errors in the script. The director wanted to shoot on location at the naval base in Norfolk, Virginia and the brig at Portsmouth, New Hampshire but was unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>permission</b> from the United States Navy. However, the Canadian Navy was willing to cooperate and in mid-August 1972, Ashby and his casting director Stalmaster traveled to Toronto, Ontario to look at a naval base and meet with actors. The base suited their needs and Ashby met Carol Kane, whom he would cast in a small role.|$|E
