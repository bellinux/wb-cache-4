5|$|With 7.f4 White stakes {{out even}} more {{space in the}} centre and threatens to overrun Black's {{position}} with a quick e4-e5. After 7...Bg7 White can <b>transpose</b> <b>to</b> the main line of the Four Pawns Attack in the King's Indian Defence with 8.Nf3 0-0 9.Be2. A rarer option is 8.e5, the Mikenas Attack, against which Black can equalize with either 8...Nfd7 or the rarer 8...dxe5 9.fxe5 Nfd7.|$|E

50|$|After 4...Nf6, White usually replies 5.Nc3. Black {{can play}} 5...d6, <b>transposing</b> <b>to</b> the Classical Variation; 5...e5, the Sveshnikov Variation; or 5...e6, <b>transposing</b> <b>to</b> the Four Knights Variation.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively White can {{transpose}} {{into the}} Danish {{by offering a}} second pawn with 5.Bc4 cxb2 6.Bxb2, an approach which John Emms considers far more dangerous for Black. If Black does not accept the second pawn with 5...cxb2, then White can avoid Black's most critical response to 5.Nxc3 (5...Bb4 6.Bc4 d6). For instance, after 5...d6, White's best is 6.Nxc3, <b>transposing</b> back <b>to</b> the 5.Nxc3 d6 line. 5...Nf6 6.Nxc3 <b>transposes</b> <b>to</b> the 5.Nxc3 Nf6 line, 5...Bb4 is well met by 6.0-0 or 6.bxc3 (<b>transposing</b> <b>to</b> the Scotch Gambit), 5...Bc5 also <b>transposes</b> <b>to</b> the Scotch Gambit while 5...Be7?! (which is well met by 6.Qd5) <b>transposes</b> <b>to</b> the Hungarian Defense.|$|R

Rb1 Rb8 7. b4 cxb4 8. axb4 b5 9. cxb5 axb5 Here Rowson remarks, [...] "Both sides want to {{push their}} d-pawn and play Bf4/...Bf5, but White has to go first so Black gets to play ...d5 before White can play d4. This doesn't matter much, but it already points to the {{challenge}} that White faces here; his most natural continuations allow Black to play the moves he wants to. I would therefore say that White is in 'Zugzwang Lite' and that he remains in this state for several moves." [...] 10.

Finally breaking the symmetry. 17. Kh2 The position is still almost symmetrical, and White can find nothing useful {{to do with his}} extra move. Rowson whimsically suggests 17.h4!?, forcing Black {{to be the one to}} break the symmetry. 17... Re8! Rowson notes that this is a useful waiting move, covering e7, which needs protection in some lines, and possibly supporting an eventual ...e5 (see Black's twenty-second move). White cannot copy it, since after 18.Re1? Nxf2 Black would win a pawn. 18. Be3?! Nxe5! 19. dxe5 Rc6! Rowson notes that with his more active pieces, [...] "It looks like Black has some initiative." [...] If now 20.Nxd5, Bxe5 [...] "is at least equal for Black". 20. Nxb5 Bxe5! 20...Nxf2? 21.Qxd5! wins. 21. Nd4 Bxd4 22. Bxd4 e5 Rowson writes, [...] "Now both sides have their trumps, but I think Black has some advantage, due to his extra central control, imposing knight and prospects for a kingside attack." [...] 23. b5 Rc8 24. Bb2 d4 Now White has a difficult game: Rowson analyzes 25.e3?! Nxg3 24.fxg3 Bc2 25.Qf3 Bxb3 26.exd4 Bc4!, winning; 25.g4 hxg4 26.hxg4 Nxf2! 27.Rxf2 Bc2, winning; 25.Qe1!?

5000|$|This is Black's most solid response, {{preparing}} 3...d5. It {{is closely}} related to the French Defense, to which it often transposes.
