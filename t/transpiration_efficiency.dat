40|$|A {{glasshouse}} {{study examined}} 49 diverse sorghum lines for variation in <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Three of the 49 lines grown were Sorghum spp, native to Australia; {{one was the}} major weed Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense), and the remaining 45 lines were cultivars of Sorghum bicolor. All plants were grown under non-limiting water and nutrient conditions using a semi-automatic pot watering system designed to facilitate accurate measurement of water use. Plants were harvested 56 - 58 days after sowing and dry weights of plant parts were determined. <b>Transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> differed significantly among cultivars. The 3 Australian native sorghums had much lower <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> than the other 46 cultivars, which ranged from 7. 7 to 6. 0 g/kg. For the 46 diverse cultivars, the ratio of range in <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> to its l. s. d. was 2. 0, which {{was similar to that}} found among more adapted cultivars in a previous study. This is a significant finding as it suggests that there is likely to be little pay-off from pursuing screening of unadapted material for increased variation in <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency.</b> It is necessary, however, also to examine absolute levels of <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> to determine whether increased levels have been found. The cultivar with greatest <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> in this study (IS 9710) had a value 9 % greater (P < 0. 05) than the accepted standard for adapted sorghum cultivars. The potential impact of such an increase in <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> warrants continued effort to capture it. <b>Transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> has been related theoretically and experimentally to the degree of carbon isotope discrimination in leaf tissue in sorghum, which thus offers a relatively simple selection index. In this study, the variation in <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> was not related simply to carbon isotope discrimination. Significant associations of <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> with ash content and indices of photosynthetic capacity were found. However, the associations were not strong. These results suggest that a simple screening technique could not be based on any of the measures or indices analysed in this study. A better understanding of the physiological basis of the observed genetic differences in <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> may assist in developing reliable selection indices. It was concluded that the potential value of the improvement in <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> over the accepted standard and the degree of genetic variation found warrant further study on this subject.

40|$|Triticale often out-yields wheat in both {{favourable}} and unfavourable growing conditions. Observed traits {{suggested for}} the higher yields in triticale include greater early vigour, a longer spike formation phase with same duration to flowering, reduced tillering, increased remobilization of carbohydrates to the grain, early vigorous root growth and higher <b>transpiration</b> use <b>efficiency.</b> To quantify {{the impact of these}} traits systematically across seasons and contrasting rainfall regions and soil types, these triticale traits were introduced into a wheat model (APSIM-Nwheat). The impact of each individual trait and their full combination was analysed in a simulation experiment for three Mediterranean growing environments, two contrasting soil types and long-term historical weather data. The simulated impact of these traits was compared with measured impacts from a range of field experiments across several environments. Simulated responses of various crop characteristics including yield, were in general similar to responses observed in wheat-triticale comparison field experiments across a large range of growing conditions. The simulation analysis indicated that the yield response to the incorporation of the triticale traits into wheat was positive, in both low and high yielding growing conditions, similar to measured differences, but the simulated benefit was on average lower than the range observed in data of triticale and wheat. This suggests that other traits might also be involved in higher-yielding triticale, or the magnitude of some of the traits may be underestimated in field experiments due to ‘trait by environment’ interactions. The simulation results suggest the highest yield benefit can be achieved from increasing <b>transpiration</b> use <b>efficiency</b> in wheat, but early vigour, remobilization of stem carbohydrates and early root growth also contribute positively to a yield increase in the different growing environments. The yield benefits from the triticale traits increased in the future climate change scenario in particular on soils with high water-holding capacity from contributions of increased early vigour, remobilization of stem carbohydrates and <b>transpiration</b> use <b>efficiency,</b> and remained stable on the lighter soils...|$|R

Pear (Pyrus communis L.) and peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch) trees were grown in field conditions on calcareous soils, in orchards with Fe deficiency-chlorosis. Gas exchange parameters were measured in situ with actual ambient conditions. Iron deficiency decreased photosynthetic and transpiration rates, instantaneous <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and stomatal conductances, and increased sub-stomatal CO 2 concentrations in the three species investigated. Photosynthesis versus CO 2 sub-stomatal concentration response curves and chlorophyll fluorescence quenching analysis revealed a non-stomatal limitation of photosynthetic rates under Fe deficiency in the three species investigated.

40|$|A sound {{understanding}} of the physiological basis of drought adaptation in cereals can assist crop improvement programs to target trait selection for variable stress environments, by incorporating such knowledge in dynamic crop growth simulation models. Based on detailed experiments on sorghum and maize, we identified physiological processes that explained observed differences in grain yield under drought stress for genotypes with similar <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> If water availability restricts crop growth, grain yield can be increased by restricting pre-anthesis water use to maximize post-anthesis water availability. Sorghum can achieve this by restricting plant size through early anthesis or through reduced tillering in response to vigorous main shoot growth {{around the time of}} tiller formation. Early vigour is associated with high leaf area, due to either a high leaf appearance rate or increased leaf width. However, in genotype*management*environment situations with limited tillering, this adaptation mechanism has limited value. In the absence of tillers, maize can improve grain yield under drought by changes in dry matter partitioning that reduce competition for assimilates with the primary ear during the period when grain set is determined. We are incorporating these crop physiological determinants into the APSIM-Cereal crop growth model to simulate adaptation for a range of sorghum genotypes, grown across locations and years that encompass a range of drought stress patterns. Such analyses allow breeders to match selection criteria to prevalent drought patterns in their target population of environments and should improve the efficiency of crop improvement...|$|R
40|$|Drought {{adaptation}} of wheat {{is one of}} the most significant and complex subjects in the rain-fed agricultural regions of West Asia. Interaction between root water-uptake and the remaining soil moisture is a key factor for drought adaptation. Under controlled conditions, root development was compared among four wheat genotypes under water deficit stress in relation to water-uptake. In addition, the effects of soil water deficit on the production of biomass and grain were examined using drought-adaptive varieties from different sources. Genotypic differences in root development were significant by the time of heading under well-irrigated conditions but were decreased under water-stressed conditions. After heading, water deficit stress also decreased grain yield through a reduction in grain number. Genotypic variations in <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> and harvest index, two components of water-use efficiency, were significant and <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> was negatively associated with root weight and water-uptake. The effect of harvest index was three-times greater than that of <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Two wheat genotypes, SYN- 10 and Drysdale derived from different sources, had high grain weights in contrast to reduced root development and low water-uptake under water deficit stress. Their differences in genetic mechanism remain uncertain. <b>Transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> and harvest index are critical factors for producing greater grain yield under water deficit stress. These components are closely related and highly dependent on wheat genotype.

Carbon isotope discrimination was also evaluated in flag leaf at anthesis (DLa) and grain at maturity (DGm). Under rainfed conditions, highly significant correlations were found between both DLa and DGm, and leaf CO 2 exchange rate (CER), stomatal conductance (gs) and internal to ambient CO 2 concentration ratio (Ci/Ca). DGm was correlated negatively with <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> (measured as CER/gs) under rainfed conditions, and positively under irrigated conditions. Under both conditions, DGm was positively associated with grain yield. No significant correlation was observed between mesophyll conductance and CER.

40|$|We used a water-centred {{framework}} (yield = transpiration × <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> × harvest index) {{to investigate}} the effect of soil salinity on growth and yield of wheat and barley. Our working hypothesis is that salinity reduces transpiration proportionally more than <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency.</b> We established a glasshouse experiment with the factorial combination of four varieties (wheat: Janz, Krichauff; barley: Mundah, Keel) and three soil treatments: a control with no NaCl added, and NaCl added to achieve soil EC 1 : 5 0. 75 dS m− 1 and 1. 5 dS m− 1. Pot-grown plants were watered to weight to determine transpiration and shoot dry matter was determined using a non-destructive image analysis system. Consistent with our hypothesis, salinity reduced transpiration (30 – 60 %) proportionally more than <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> (0 – 35 %); transpiration accounted for 90 % {{of the variation in}} shoot growth across varieties and treatments. Against this pattern, there were time- and variety-dependent responses. The rate of leaf appearance and the <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> of Janz, Krichauff and Keel showed a two-stage response to salinity. In stage 1, salt-stressed plants maintained rate of leaf appearance and <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> close to or slightly below those of the controls. After a clear break point where the slope changed, stage 2 was characterised by a substantial reduction in both traits. Stage 2 was not evident in salt-stressed Mundah, which maintained a relatively high rate of leaf appearance and <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Across species, harvest index increased from 0. 40 in controls to 0. 47 at 0. 75 dS m− 1. Harvest index of plants grown at 1. 5 dS m− 1 was unaffected in wheat, and was reduced in barley. We propose that an understanding of the effect of salinity on crop development, growth and yield requires integration of low-level traits in a framework of resource capture, resource-use efficiency and plant allocation. Osmotic stress tolerance, Na+ exclusion, and tissue tolerance to accumulated Na+ would improve yield of salt-stressed crops to the extent that these traits contribute to the maintenance of water uptake and harvest index. ...|$|E
40|$|Inadequate water {{resources}} and the ensuing climate change over the recent years are posing major challenges for food production. Drought in various forms is responsible for major losses to global crop production, affecting millions of resource-poor farmers in the semi-arid tropics. While developing drought-tolerant cultivars could alleviate such economical strains, genetic improvement of grain legumes is difficult to achieve through conventional means due to their highly self-pollinating characteristics and conserved genomes with very little variability. To generate additional genetic diversity, we attempted to enhance drought tolerance in chickpea and peanut through genetic engineering approaches. Independent transgenic events with high <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (TE) and desirable root and shoot traits were selected for further evaluation under a series of environments under glasshouse and confined field trials to comprehensively study the component traits of drought, and understand the stress adaptive mechanisms. Relationship between TE and its surrogate traits were explored, besides studying the role of biochemical changes in the anti-oxidative machinery under water-limiting conditions. Evaluations were based on water capture, effective use of captured water for producing biomass via photosynthesis, and converting assimilates into harvestable yield. Accordingly, critical assessment of drought tolerance and yield under contained field conditions proved the effectiveness of several events that showed substantial yield improvement under drought stress, without any accompanying yield penalty under irrigation. Details of various strategies to develop drought tolerant transgenc plants, and the results and scope of our own studies will be discussed...|$|R

Stomatal conductance, rates of light-saturated assimilation (Amax) and dark respiration were measured for six leaves from each {{of five or six}} trees. These leaves were then analyzed for total nitrogen, ether-soluble lipids, ash content, and heat of combustion. Construction and maintenance costs, nitrogen-use <b>efficiencies</b> and instantaneous <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were then calculated from these data. Evergreen species had significantly lower specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen and leaf ash content than deciduous species. Evergreen species also had significantly higher heat of combustion and lipid content of crude extracts than deciduous species. Light-saturated assimilation rates were higher in evergreen species on a leaf area basis, but were higher in deciduous species on a leaf dry weight basis. In both evergreen and deciduous species, Amax and total Kjeldahl nitrogen were linearly related. Similarly, nitrogen-use efficiency did not differ among species. Leaf construction costs were significantly higher for evergreen species than for deciduous species, but maintenance costs did not differ among species. Evergreen species had a higher cost:benefit ratio than deciduous species but because of their longer-lived leaves, the payback interval was longer in evergreen species than in deciduous species. These results support the hypotheses that: (1) longer-lived leaves are more expensive to construct than shorter-lived leaves, and (2) there is a higher investment of nitrogen into short-lived leaves to support a higher Amax over a shorter payback interval. We conclude that deciduous and evergreen species partition resources both temporally and spatially, thereby reducing interspecies competition...|$|R
40|$|Water {{is one of}} the key {{resources}} {{challenging the}} sustainability of modern agriculture. In developing countries, potato production is increasing because of its ability to provide nutritious food in a short season. However, the potato crop requires profuse irrigation. Yields of commercial potato varieties are often restricted by water availability. Their root systems are generally sparse and shallow, and they close their stomata, preventing photosynthetic carbon assimilation, whilst water is still available in the soil. To enable breeding of drought tolerant varieties, we are developing phenotypic screens that will allow us to explore the genetic basis of key traits for water use efficiency (WUE). From field trials of a genetic mapping population, ten genotypes with contrasting <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiencies</b> based on leaf δ 13 C values were cultivated under controlled glasshouse conditions. After emergence, plants were grown for 30 days in soils watered to field capacity (30 % volumetric content,- 5 kPa water potential) before being divided into three groups irrigated to 30 %, 20 % (- 300 kPa, slight stress) and 12 % (- 1500 kPa, wilting point) volumetric content. As WUE is a complex phenomenon, we evaluated a number of associated physiological and morphological traits. Tissue samples were also collected at different time points to determine differentially expressed genes at these moisture levels. Response to water stress not only includes closing stomata but also reducing the density of stomata during leaf development. Preliminary data from our experiments shows that transpiration-efficient genotypes, as indicated by low leaf δ 13 C values, have consistently lower stomatal conductance at 12 % volumetric soil moisture than transpiration-inefficient genotypes. Thus transpiration-inefficient genotypes transpire more water at lower soil water content...|$|R

Mean Anet (approximately 15 % increase) and gs (approximately 25 % decrease) were less affected by elevated [CO 2] than previously found in FACE-grown wheat (approximately 25 % increase and approximately 32 % decrease, respectively), potentially reflecting growth in a dry-land cropping system. In contrast to previous FACE studies, analyses of the Ball et al. model revealed an elevated [CO 2] effect on {{the slope of the}} linear regression by 12 % indicating a decrease in stomatal sensitivity to the combination of [CO 2], photosynthesis rate and humidity.

In the greenhouse, above ground dry matter was harvested at 80 % flowering, and data collected on water use, <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency,</b> weight of dry matter at flowering, and CID on dry matter at flowering analyzed. In the field, samples were collected from leaves at flowering, leaves at maturity, and kernels at maturity, and analyzed for CID. In all species in the greenhouse, genotypic differences in CID were observed under all three water regimes. For lentil and wheat, the 80 % field capacity water regime provided the largest differences in CID, whereas the 30 % field capacity water regime provided the largest differences in CID for canola. In all three crops, CID and <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> were independent under all three water regimes, or when averaged across water regimes and years. The correlation between CID and dry matter at flowering was inconsistent across water regimes and years.

The genotype by environment interaction for CID was low compared to that for grain yield. In addition, the correlations between grain yield and CID in lentil and spring wheat were positive, but inconsistent across locations and years. The broad-sense heritability for grain yield was greater or similar to the broad-sense heritability of CID measurements.

In the second experiment, the horseweed biotypes (susceptible and resistant to glyphosate) were evaluated in five periods as following: 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after herbicide application (DAH).

Growth under e[CO 2] stimulated yield and above ground biomass on average by ~ 18 %. 'Hartog' compared to 'Drysdale' had significantly greater crop growth rate (~ 14 %), above ground biomass (~ 15 %), leaf area index (~ 25 %) and tiller numbers (~ 16 %) during early development (stem elongation).

We designed a series of field experiments in Sardinia, Italy that were aimed at comparing the stomatal conductance and stomatal conductance-related traits (i. e., carbon-isotope discrimination and infrared canopy temperature) of durum wheat and triticale on different environments to evaluate the differences between these two species and the impacts of these differences on leaf <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> and on water- and radiation-use efficiency at the crop level. A large variation in stomatal conductance was observed between species, although differences decreased as development proceeded. The greater stomatal conductance of triticale before anthesis did not imply a greater soil water depletion because the good water availability allowed the development of dense canopies exerting a relevant aerodynamic resistance on water vapor fluxes. The greater radiation-use-efficiency of triticale associated with its greater stomatal conductance in pre-anthesis resulted in a greater biomass than durum wheat in correspondence with similar amounts of radiation intercepted and of water used. <b>Transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> of triticale was also higher at the crop level, in spite of similar <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> at the leaf level.

Using cubic smoothing splines to estimate plant growth and transpiration, we identify four time intervals that characterize the early responses of rice to salinity. Relative growth rate, transpiration rate and <b>transpiration</b> use <b>efficiency</b> (TUE) are analysed using a new association model {{that takes into account}} the interaction between treatment (control and salt) and genetic marker. This model allows the identification of previously undetected loci affecting TUE on chromosome 11, providing insights into the early responses of rice to salinity, in particular into the effects of salinity on plant growth and transpiration.

40|$|An {{association}} mapping panel, {{named as}} CIMMYT Asia association mapping (CAAM) panel, involving 396 diverse tropical maize lines were phenotyped for various structural and functional traits of roots under drought and well-watered conditions. The experiment was conducted during Kharif (summer-rainy) season of 2012 and 2013 in root phenotyping facility at CIMMYT-Hyderabad, India. The CAAM panel was genotyped to generate 955, 690 SNPs through GBS v 2. 7 using Illumina Hi-seq 2000 / 2500 at Institute for Genomic Diversity, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. GWAS analysis {{was carried out}} using 331, 390 SNPs filtered from the entire set of SNPs revealed a total of 50 and 67 SNPs significantly associated for root functional (<b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency,</b> flowering period water use) and structural traits (rooting depth, root dry weight, root length, root volume, root surface area and root length density), respectively. In addition to this, 37 SNPs were identified for grain yield and shoot biomass under well-watered and drought stress. Though many SNPs {{were found to have}} significant association with the traits under study, SNPs that were common for more than one trait were discussed in detail. A total 18 SNPs were found to have common association with more than one trait, out of which 12 SNPs were found within or near the various gene functional regions. In this study we attempted to identify the trait specific maize lines based on the presence of favorable alleles for the SNPs associated with multiple traits. Two SNPs S 3 _ 128533512 and S 7 _ 151238865 were associated with <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency,</b> shoot biomass and grain yield under well-watered condition. Based on favorable allele for these SNPs seven inbred lines were identified. Similarly, four lines were identified for <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> and shoot biomass under drought stress based on the presence of favorable allele for the common SNPs S 1 _ 211520521, S 2 _ 20017716, S 3 _ 57210184 and S 7 _ 130878458 and three lines were identified for flowering period water-use, <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency,</b> root dry weight and root volume based on the presence of favorable allele for the common SNPs S 3 _ 162065732 and S 3 _ 225760139...|$|E
40|$|Increased <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> (the {{ratio of}} biomass to water transpired, TE) {{could lead to}} {{increased}} drought tolerance under some water deficit scenarios. Intrinsic (i. e., leaf-level) TE is usually considered as {{the primary source of}} variation in whole-plant TE, but empirical data usually contradict this assumption. Sunflower has a significant variability in TE, but a better knowledge of the effect of leaf and plant-level traits could be helpful to obtain more efficient genotypes for water use. The objective of this study was, therefore, to assess if genotypic variation in whole-plant TE is better related to leaf- or plant-level traits. Three experiments were conducted, aimed at verifying the existence of variability in whole-plant TE and whole-plant and leaf-level traits, and to assess their correlation. Sunflower public inbred lines and a segregating population of recombinant inbred lines were grown under controlled conditions and subjected to well-watered and water-deficit treatments. Significant genotypic variation was found for TE and related traits. These differences in whole-plant <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency,</b> both between genotypes and between plants within each genotype, showed no association to leaf-level traits, but were significantly and negatively correlated to biomass allocation to leaves and to the ratio of leaf area to total biomass. These associations are likely of a physiological origin, and not only a consequence of genetic linkage in the studied population. These results suggest that genotypic variation for biomass allocation could be potentially exploited as a source for increased <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> in sunflower breeding programmes. It is also suggested that phenotyping for TE in this species should not be restricted to leaf-level measurements, but also include measurements of plant-level traits, especially those related to biomass allocation between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs...|$|E
40|$|Cultivars of {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea L.) {{were subjected}} to a period of reduced soil water supply during early reproductive development. During the period of water deficit, total biomass production of two Virginia type cultivars (Virginia Bunch and Q 18801) was {{greater than that of}} a Spanish type cultivar (McCubbin), even though all cultivars used similar amounts of radiation and water. Hence, the radiation use efficiency and <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> of Q 18801 were significantly greater than those of McCubbin. The radiation use efficiency of the stressed crops was only about 45 % of those that were fully irrigated. Throughout the period of water deficit, noon leaf water potential was lowest in McCubbin in both treatments. In the well-watered treatment, this was associated with a higher leaf temperature and lower leaf conductance, than in the Virginia cultivars. Under increasing soil water deficit, the leaves of McCubbin tended to wilt, while the Virginia cultivars displayed active leaf folding. Thus, the ratio of the fraction of radiation intercepted by the canopy to leaf area index (LAI) was always lower in the Virginia type cultivars. For a given LAI, this phenomenon may have allowed these cultivars to decrease the effective atmospheric demand within the canopy, while maintaining radiation interception at saturation for photosynthesis. The consequence of this, given that the supply of water from the roots did not differ, was that Q 18801 was able to maintain a higher LAI and a greater crop <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> (ratio of biomass production to transpiration) than McCubbin. The existence of differences among cultivars in <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> under drought may prove useful in improving adaptation of groundnut to these environments...|$|E
40|$|Physiological {{responses}} of the halophyte, Atriplex subspicata Nutt. Rydb., to defoliation injury were evaluated {{through a series of}} experiments measuring plant gas exchange, fluorometry, and enzyme activity. Leaves exposed to simulated insect herbivory exhibited reductions in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and <b>transpiration.</b> Carboxylation <b>efficiency,</b> maximum assimilation, and CO 2 compensation were also negatively associated with mechanical leaf injury. Insect injury by a herbivore generalist, Spilosoma virginica, also reduced photosynthesis and carboxylation efficiency within the saturated spectrum of A/Ci response curves. Initially, declines in photosynthesis occurred because of transient stomatal limitations. However, after time, mesophyll limitations impaired photosynthesis and the plant’s ability to compensate for injury. Fluorescence data and light assimilation responses indicated that defoliation did not play a role in limiting light reactions of photosynthesis. Enzyme analyses showed increased peroxidase activity with insect injury, suggesting the need for future characterization of oxidative enzymes, which have been associated with traits of resistance. Overall, we found a salt-tolerant plant to be susceptible to insect herbivory through a reduction in the efficiency of the plant to allocate energy resources. If salt tolerance comes at the cost of susceptibility to biotic interference, natural occurring halophytes or plants with transgenic salt tolerance may be at risk for heightened deleterious response to insect herbivory...|$|R
40|$|Background Because soil {{salinity}} {{is a major}} abiotic constraint affecting crop yield, much {{research has been conducted}} to develop plants with improved salinity tolerance. Salinity stress impacts many aspects of a plant’s physiology, making it difficult to study in toto. Instead, it is more tractable to dissect the plant’s response into traits that are hypothesized {{to be involved in the}} overall tolerance of the plant to salinity. Scope and conclusions We discuss how to quantify the impact of salinity on different traits, such as relative growth rate, water relations, <b>transpiration,</b> <b>transpiration</b> use <b>efficiency,</b> ionic relations, photosynthesis, senescence, yield and yield components. We also suggest some guidelines to assist with the selection of appropriate experimental systems, imposition of salinity stress, and obtaining and analysing relevant physiological data using appropriate indices. We illustrate how these indices can be used to identify relationships amongst the proposed traits to identify which traits are the most important contributors to salinity tolerance. Salinity tolerance is complex and involves many genes, but progress has been made in studying the mechanisms underlying a plant’s response to salinity. Nevertheless, several previous studies on salinity tolerance could have benefited from improved experimental design. We hope that this paper will provide pertinent information to researchers on performing proficient assays and interpreting results from salinity tolerance experiments...|$|R
40|$|Aquaponic is a {{combination}} of fish and plant cultivated in recirculating systems. Fish culture in closed recirculating systems causes organic waste accumulation in the system. If these metabolites are used for plant nutrition, they are not mere waste, but have economical value and however benefit the fish production systems. Most aquaponic systems are designed as perlite-filled media, thin layer of nutrient solution, or Raft system. Photosynthesis parameters and water relations are good indexes for recognition of healthy plants and are used as tools for studying physiological conditions of plants. In this experiment, mint plants were cultivated in Raft aquaponic system and perlite medium. In Raft system, plant roots were suspending in water and absorbed water from pot bottom. Whereas in perlite system, roots were in the perlite medium and irrigation water was applied from top of the pots. The plants grown in Raft system showed mineral elements’ deficiency as leaf chlorosis. Photosynthesis and water parameters analysis showed that photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, <b>transpiration,</b> mezophyll <b>efficiency,</b> water use efficiency and photosynthesis active radiation were higher in the plants grown in perlite than in raft aquaponic system. On the other hand, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature and sub-stomatal CO 2 were higher in the raft aquaponic system than perlite medium. Thus, due to better physiological conditions of mint plants, perlite medium might yield better results compared to raft aquaponic system...|$|R
40|$|Water use {{efficiency}} (WUE) is a {{key indicator}} to assess ecosystem adaptation to water stress. Rain use efficiency (RUE) is usually used {{as a proxy for}} WUE due to lack of transpiration data. Furthermore, RUE based on aboveground primary productivity (RUEANPP) is used to evaluate whole plant water use because root production data is often missing as well. However, it is controversial as to whether RUE is a reliable parameter to elucidate <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> (TE), and whether RUEANPP is a suitable proxy for RUE of the whole plant basis. The experiment was conducted at three differently managed sites in the Inner Mongolia steppe: a site fenced since 1979 (UG 79), a winter grazing site (WG) and a heavily grazed site (HG). Site HG had consistent lowest RUEANPP and RUE based on total net primary productivity (RUENPP). RUEANPP is a relatively good proxy at sites UG 79 and WG, but less reliable for site HG. Similarly, RUEANPP is good predictor of <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> based on aboveground net primary productivity (TEANPP) at sites UG 79 and WG but not for site HG. However, if total net primary productivity is considered, RUENPP is good predictor of <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> based on total net primary productivity (TENPP) for all sites. Although our measurements indicate decreased plant transpiration and consequentially decreasing RUE under heavy grazing, productivity was relatively compensated for with a higher TE. This offset between RUE and TE was even enhanced under water limited conditions and more evident when belowground net primary productivity (BNNP) was included. These findings suggest that BNPP should be considered when studies fucus on WUE of mor...|$|E
30|$|Due to its {{polygenic}} nature, drought tolerance is {{a complex}} trait. Drought is highly influenced by environmental conditions which makes breeding selection cycles difficult at pre- and post-flowering stages in sorghum (Tuinstra et al. 1996). However, progress in developing drought tolerant genotypes through breeding efforts is tremendous. Secondary component traits with moderate to high heritability values under drought stress include stay green, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, canopy temperature and <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> (Harris et al. 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Roháček et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2010; Kapanigowda 2011; Mutava et al. 2011; Talebi 2011). Improving these traits can increase drought tolerance potential in sorghum (Prasad et al. 2006; Borell et al. 2010). Kapanigowda (2011) observed high broad-sense heritability (0.77 to 0.90) for <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency</b> in sorghum and showed this trait could be improved through breeding. Mutava et al. (2011) studied diversity for chlorophyll content, leaf temperature, chlorophyll a fluorescence (PS II quantum yield), harvest index (HI) and yield among 300 genotypes from different races of sorghum and reported wide variability in sorghum.|$|E

These models in addition accumulating WUE; evaluate {{the contribution of}} its components. In this study, seven bread wheat cultivars were sown at four separate randomized complete block design with four replications at different moisture regimes in two growing seasons. Combined analysis of variance showed significant differences for total dry matter, WUE, relative water loss (<b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency),</b> and initial water of flag leaves (uptake efficiency). Sardary, Sabalan and Alamut cultivars had the lowest WUE and total dry matter, but Zarrin and Shahriar were the highest values. Sardary with low uptake efficiency and Zarrin with high grain yield had the minimum and maximum <b>transpiration</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The WUE and evapotranspiration efficiency had a positive significant correlation with total dry matter and grain yield respectively. Results of path analysis showed that WUE (0. 6) and total dry matter (0. 31) had the highest direct effect on grain yield. Contribution of evapotranspiration efficiency (0. 82) on WUE was higher than harvest index (0. 30) ...|$|E

40|$|All crop models, whether {{site-specific}} or global-gridded {{and regardless}} of crop, simulate daily crop transpiration and soil evaporation during the crop life cycle, resulting in seasonal crop water use. Modelers use several methods for predicting daily potential evapotranspiration (ET), including FAO- 56, Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor, Hargreaves, full energy balance, and <b>transpiration</b> water <b>efficiency.</b> They use extinction equations to partition energy to soil evaporation or transpiration, depending on leaf area index. Most models simulate soil water balance and soil-root water supply for transpiration, and limit transpiration if water uptake is insufficient, and thereafter reduce dry matter production. Comparisons among multiple crop and global gridded models in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) show surprisingly large differences in simulated ET and crop water use for the same climatic conditions. Model intercomparisons alone are not enough to know which approaches are correct. There is an urgent need to test these models against field-observed data on ET and crop water use. It is important to test various ET modules/equations in a model platform where other aspects such as soil water balance and rooting are held constant, to avoid compensation caused by other parts of models. The CSM-CROPGRO model in DSSAT already has ET equations for Priestley-Taylor, Penman-FAO- 24, Penman-Monteith-FAO- 56, and an hourly energy balance approach. In this work, we added transpiration-efficiency modules to DSSAT and AgMaize models and tested the various ET equations against available data on ET, soil water balance, and season-long crop water use of soybean, fababean, maize, and other crops where runoff and deep percolation were known or zero. The different ET modules created considerable differences in predicted ET, growth, and yield...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate gas exchange rates, plant height, yield components, and productivity of upland rice, as affected by type and application time of plant growth regulators. A randomized block design, in a 4 x 2 factorial arrangement, with four replicates was used. Treatments consisted of three growth regulators (mepiquat chloride, trinexapac-ethyl, and paclobutrazol), besides a control treatment applied at two different phenological stages: early tillering or panicle primordial differentiation. The experiment was performed under sprinkler‑irrigated field conditions. Net CO 2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, plant <b>transpiration,</b> and water‑use <b>efficiency</b> were measured four times in Primavera upland rice cultivar, between booting and milky grain phenophases. Gas exchange rates were neither influenced by growth regulators nor by application time. There was, however, interaction between these factors on the other variables. Application of trinexapac-ethyl at both tillering and differentiation stages reduced plant height and negatively affected yield components and rice productivity. However, paclobutrazol and mepiquat chloride applied at tillering, reduced plant height without affecting rice yield. Mepiquat chloride acted as a growth stimulator when applied at th...|$|R
