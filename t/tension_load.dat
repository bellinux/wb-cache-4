40|$|Abstract. The {{environment}} and load condition of tubing is severe in high pressure wells. The sealability and joint strength of tubing string {{plays an important}} role in production operation. In this study, the makeup, sealability and joint strength was analyzed from conditions of make-up <b>loading,</b> <b>tension</b> <b>loading,</b> compression loading and internal pressure loading by finite element method. The makeup torque, the contact pressure distributions of metal seal along the axis and the stress distributions of threaded connection are given. The results show that under <b>tension</b> <b>loading,</b> compression loading and internal pressure, the overall stress level of threaded connection is lower than of pipe. The anti-compression performance and joint strength of threaded connection is greater than of pipe. The contact pressures of metal seal maintain relatively high level of contact pressures under <b>tension</b> <b>loading,</b> compression loading and internal pressure. <b>Tension</b> <b>loading</b> and compression loading reduces the sealing performance and the internal pressure increases the sealing performance from the integral of the contact pressure...|$|R

Uniaxial tension-compression, fully relaxing uniaxial tension and non-relaxing uniaxial <b>tension</b> <b>loading</b> conditions were applied until sample failure. Results, summarized in a Haigh-like diagram, show {{that only one}} type of fatigue damage is observed for uniaxial tension-compression and fully relaxing uniaxial <b>tension</b> <b>loading</b> conditions, and that several different types of fatigue damage take place in non-relaxing uniaxial <b>tension</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. The different damage types observed under non-relaxing uniaxial <b>tension,</b> <b>loading</b> conditions {{are closely related to}} the improvement of rubber fatigue life. Therefore, as fatigue life improvement is classically supposed to be due to strain-induced crystallization (SIC), a similar conclusion can be drawn for the occurrence of different types of fatigue damage...|$|R

The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque.

Pile jacking has environmental benefits over the traditional method of pile driving which can cause noise and vibration damage to the marine mammals. Pile installation by jacking was shown to enhance the pile-soil stiffness response during compression loading.

5000|$|Since spoke {{threading}} and nipple threading must match, {{boxes of}} spokes usually include a like number of nipples. Weight savings or {{the need for}} great strength due to building a wheel with few spokes might call for obtaining different nipples than those shipped with the spokes. Standard materials for nipples are brass (usually nickel-plated) and aluminum. Brass is heavier but more durable and less prone to corrosion, rounding of flats while tightening, breaking and galling; aluminum is far lighter. If using aluminum nipples, the spokes should be long enough to engage {{the full length of}} spoke nipple threads so that the load is carried from spoke {{to the top of the}} nipple. [...] If the spoke is only part way into the nipple, the nipple carries the <b>tension</b> <b>load</b> and is prone to breaking from fatigue failure. Also, with aluminum nipples care and a good spoke wrench are needed to avoid rounding the flats while tightening. Recently, titanium nipples have become available from both US and Chinese sources. Proponents of titanium nipples suggest that they combine the advantages of brass and aluminum nipples (strength and weight, respectively), while being more corrosion resistant than either material.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a new {{experimental}} technique for applying impulse <b>tension</b> <b>loads.</b> Briefly, the technique {{is based on the}} use of pulsed-magnetic-driven <b>tension</b> <b>loading.</b> Electromagnetic forming (EMF) can be quite effective in increasing the forming limits of metal sheets, such as aluminium and magnesium alloys. Yet, why the forming limit is increased is still an open question. One reason for this is the difficulty to let forming proceed on a certain influence monotonically: the main phenomena causing this increase in formability are considered to due to “body force” effect, inertia effect, changes in strain rate sensitivity. In this study, an impulse <b>tension</b> <b>loading</b> setup is presented. “Body force” effect and strain rate, which are known to be the two key factors leading to higher formability, can now be separated freely by our designed device. Reproducible and adjustable loading rate (80 s- 1 ~ 3267 s- 1) can be achieved by adjusting the discharge voltage and capacitance. The relation between the discharge voltage and strain rate was obtained with the help of finite element calculations and high-camera measurement results. The results of an exploratory experiment carried out on the designed device are presented for aluminum alloy AA 5052 sheet. It shows that this technique could be used to study the dynamic response of sheets...|$|R
