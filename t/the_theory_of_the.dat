5|$|Between 1859 and 1866, he {{developed}} <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula, called the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, gives {{the fraction of}} gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the kinetic theory, temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments {{in a better way}} than had been achieved previously. Maxwell's work on thermodynamics led him to devise the thought experiment that {{came to be known as}} Maxwell's demon, where the second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{approach}} for designing decision procedures based on <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> complex <b>theories</b> to simpler ones. Specifically, we define reduction {{functions as a}} tool for reducing <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a complex <b>theory</b> to <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a simpler one. Reduction functions allow us to reduce <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> lists to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> constructors, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> arrays to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> sets to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> equality, and <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> multisets to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> integers. Finally, we provide a method for combining reduction functions. This method allows us to reduce <b>the</b> satisfiability problem <b>of</b> a combination <b>of</b> complex <b>theories</b> to <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> simpler ones. ...|$|R
5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continuous spectrum {{and his first}} published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E
5|$|Islamic society paid careful {{attention}} to medicine, following a hadith enjoining the preservation of good health. Its physicians inherited knowledge and traditional medical beliefs from the civilisations of classical Greece, Rome, Syria, Persia and India. These included the writings of Hippocrates such as <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four humours, and the theories of Galen. al-Razi (ca. 854–925/935) identified smallpox and measles, and recognized that fever {{was a part of}} the body's defenses. He wrote a 23-volume compendium of Chinese, Indian, Persian, Syriac and Greek medicine. al-Razi questioned the classical Greek medical theory of how the four humours regulate life processes. He challenged Galen's work on several fronts, including the treatment of bloodletting, arguing that it was effective.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arab hijackers {{was created by}} the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been argued by a number <b>of</b> writers that <b>the</b> evolutionary <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm is a genuine theoretical rival to <b>the</b> contractual <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm. This paper presents a reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evolutionary <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm. A taxonomy developed by the Polish philosopher Krajewski is then utilized for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discussing {{the relations between the}} evolutionary and <b>the</b> contractual <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm. It is possible to argue that the evolutionary and <b>the</b> contractual <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm are rivals.

25|$|Several {{problems}} in computational complexity and geometric graph theory may {{be classified as}} complete for <b>the</b> existential <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reals.

5|$|Domestically, Henry {{is known}} for his radical changes to the English Constitution, {{ushering}} in <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine right of kings to England. Besides asserting the sovereign's supremacy over the Church of England, he greatly expanded royal power during his reign. Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial, by means of bills of attainder. He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, Richard Rich, and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in Henry's administration. He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert into royal revenue the money that was formerly paid to Rome. Despite the influx of money from these sources, Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars, particularly with Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, as he sought to enforce his claim to the Kingdom of France. At home, he oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 he was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Research in the {{archives}} of pre-1914 horse breeding operations found at Windhoek, combined with blood typing studies, suggests that the animals descended from a gene pool of high-quality riding animals, as opposed to work horses. A study released in 2005 reinforces <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Namib Desert Horse descending {{from a combination of}} European-descended breeding stock and escaped military horses. One possible source of breeding stock was a stud farm near Kubub, leased by Emil Kreplin (previously mayor of Lüderitz) from 1911 to 1919. Photo albums from the stud show animals with conformation and markings similar to those seen in the modern Namib Desert Horse. In addition, in early 1915, during the fighting of World War I, bombs were dropped by a German aircraft onto the South African camp near Garub. Some ordnance seems to have been specifically targeted to land among a herd of 1,700 grazing horses, for the purposes of scattering them. These escaped army animals may have joined stock animals lost from Kreplin's stud farm during the turmoil of the war. Horses in the area would likely have congregated at the few existing watering places in the Aus Mountains and Garub.|$|E
5|$|The Norfolk Spaniel was {{believed}} to have come about from a cross of spaniels with the Black and Tan Terrier, which was cultivated by an unspecified Duke of Norfolk. However, later historians disagree with this theory, saying that the Duke of Norfolk's spaniels were of the King Charles type and that terrier stock {{had nothing to do}} with the origins of the Norfolk Spaniel. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Norfolk-based origins of the Norfolk Spaniel was thought disproved by the investigation of James Farrow, a 19th-century spaniel breeder, who wrote to Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk in order to find out the truth about the origins of the breed. The Duke responded, denying any connection to the breed, although he did state that his grandfather, Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, owned Sussex Spaniels. The letter from the Duke was printed in The Kennel Gazette in 1899. An alternative origin was proposed by Rawdon Briggs Lee in volume two of his 1897 work A History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland. Lee argued that the Norfolk Spaniel was descended from a crossing of a curly-coated water spaniel and a Sussex Spaniel or another strain of land spaniel.|$|E
