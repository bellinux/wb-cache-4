5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to <b>the</b> <b>erotic</b> excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|I Want You is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by American soul {{musician}} Marvin Gaye, released March 16, 1976, on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records.

The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's exotic, low-key production and <b>the</b> <b>erotic,</b> sexual themes in his and Gaye's songwriting. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar Shack (1971).|$|E
5|$|In {{the adult}} {{versions}} of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex.

Maeda remarked that the sex scenes were not written with reproduction in mind.|$|E

5|$|Krishna {{is found}} in {{southeast}} Asian history and art, but to a far less extent than Shiva, Durga, Nandi, Agastya, and Buddha. In temples (candi) of the archaeological sites in hilly volcanic Java, Indonesia, temple reliefs do not portray his pastoral life or his role as <b>the</b> <b>erotic</b> lover, nor do the historic Javanese Hindu texts. Rather, either his childhood or the life as a king and Arjuna's companion have been more favored. The most elaborate temple arts of Krishna are found {{in a series of}} Krsnayana reliefs in the Prambanan Hindu temple complex near Yogyakarta. These are dated to the 9thcentury CE. Krishna remained a part of the Javanese cultural and theological fabric through the 14thcentury, as evidenced by the 14th-century Penataran reliefs along with those of the Hindu god Rama in east Java, before Islam replaced Buddhism and Hinduism on the island.|$|E
