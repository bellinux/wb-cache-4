Nomination records are sealed for fifty years. While posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can be made if the individual died in the months between {{the decision of the}} prize committee (typically in October) and the ceremony in December. Prior to 1974, posthumous awards were permitted if the recipient had died after being nominated.|$|E
5|$|The {{troops were}} <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were {{to gather up}} all their {{ammunition}} and baggage and prepare for a night attack. By 21:00, the sick and wounded began {{to move to the}} Brooklyn Ferry in preparation for evacuation. At 23:00, Glover and his Massachusetts men, who were sailors and fishermen, began to evacuate the troops.|$|E

5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, to be <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had no real {{interest in the subject}} itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight years}} with the company, in March 2004, Runnels was {{released}} from WWE prior to a massive firing spree. In an April 2015 interview with Vince Russo, Runnels stated that she was flown up on April 1, 2004 to the WWE offices {{for a meeting with}} WWE executives Kevin Dunn and John Laurinaitis where she was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were parting ways with her; the reason she was told that she was flown up was because the WWE respected her. After leaving the company, Runnels spent time traveling the world.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} {{initially}} been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be {{withdrawn from the}} front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank. In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again.|$|E

Meanwhile, several drug dealers receive anonymous phone calls about {{the whereabouts of}} their competitors; they are <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are at the same diner. Two U.S. Marshals receive a similar phone call about an escaped prisoner. The drug dealers arrive in pairs as the man attempts {{to gain access to}} the files. Just as he does, the two Marshals appear and order everyone onto the floor, causing a shootout.|$|E
5|$|Bedsitcom was {{commissioned}} by the Channel Four Television Corporation and produced by Objective Productions. Producers auditioned thousands of people to be the show's genuine contestants and selected from them six young adults {{to live in the}} flat with the three actors. These six contestants were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be starring in a new reality TV series called Making Friends, and featured on the show three at a time over a period of eight weeks. The programme ran for a single series of eight episodes and featured various storylines, involving dead goldfish, dodgy dealings, promiscuous mothers and telephone psychics.|$|E
5|$|Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite In 1784, in Bordeaux, the man {{calling himself}} Count Alessandro di Cagliostro opened the first lodge of his Egyptian Rite masonry. This had the three degrees of normal French masonry (Apprentice, Companion and Master), {{but with a}} greatly different, more mystical ritual. Cagliostro claimed that he was re-introducing true Freemasonry, and he {{attempted}} to attract candidates wherever he went. Male candidates were already Freemasons, but women were also admitted. The ceremony for the two sexes differed only in minor points - males were admitted by Cagliostro (the Grand Copht) and females by his wife (the Queen of Sheba). On admission, the women were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were now Freemasons.|$|E

After appearing in the senior bowl, the Detroit Lions' safeties coach, Alan Williams, and other representatives from the organization {{had a meeting with}} Killebrew and <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not interested in him, he wasn't a right fit for the team, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not want him at all. Once they drafted him, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had said it to only see how he would respond.|$|R
5|$|Gauri {{tried for}} several weeks to persuade Chrisye to commit to the concert, and {{following}} Chrisye's introduction to Erwin Gutawa, who was scheduled to handle the arrangements, Jay Subyakto succeeded in convincing him {{that it might be}} the last chance to revive his career. Lacking the necessary funding, they approached RCTI in search of sponsorship but were refused, and laughingly <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should try holding a concert at the National Monument. Undeterred, Chrisye, Subaktyo, and Gutawa put together a group of artists and began rehearsals. Around the time of RCTI's fourth anniversary, the television station relented and agreed to fund the concert as part of their celebrations; the thousands of tickets available sold out within a week.|$|E
5|$|Nomination {{forms are}} {{sent by the}} Nobel Committee to about 3,000 {{individuals}}, usually in September {{the year before the}} prizes are awarded. These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize, inquiries are also sent to governments, former Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award. The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names.

All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize.|$|E

When ridiculed for this by Anwar, Hasan's faith is broken. This leads {{him to have a}} large fight with his family about their Islamic faith, which results in Hasan's family disowning him. Upon his return to Bandung, Hasan marries Kartini.|$|E

5|$|The coup was {{organised}} {{with the}} help of some VNQDĐ and Đại Việt members, civilians and officers alike. Đông enlisted the cooperation of an armoured regiment, marine unit and three paratrooper battalions. The marine battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Pham Van Lieu. The operation was scheduled to launch on November 11 at 05:00. However, the airborne soldiers were not aware of what their officers had in store. They were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were heading into the countryside to attack the Viet Cong. Once they were on their way, the officers claimed that the Presidential Guard, who were meant to guard the presidential palace, had mutinied against Diệm.|$|E
5|$|In April 1939 Britten and Pears {{sailed to}} North America, going first to Canada {{and then to}} New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, {{including}} the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances. Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. Pears was inclined to disregard the advice {{and go back to}} England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.|$|E

5000|$|Witnesses in the investigation, {{mostly from}} 9 to 13 years old, were often taken from their {{families}} and placed in foster care. Many later claimed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were subjected to hours of frightening grilling and <b>told</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> didn't believe they had been sexually abused, then they were either [...] "in denial", lying, or had suppressed {{the memory of the}} abuse. <b>They</b> were also <b>told</b> <b>that</b> siblings and other children had witnessed their abuse, or that their parents had already confessed. Children were also <b>told</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> agreed to the accusations they wouldn't be separated from parents or siblings. Many of them later recanted. Perez neither recorded nor kept notes of his interrogations.|$|R

5|$|Most of {{the rebel}} {{soldiers}} had been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were attacking {{in order to}} save Diệm from a mutiny by the Presidential Guard. Only one or two officers in any given rebel unit knew the true situation. A high wall, a fence and a few guard posts, surrounded the palace grounds. The mutinous paratroopers disembarked from their transport vehicles and moved into position for an attack on the main gate. Some ran forward and others raked automatic gunfire {{at the front of the}} palace, shattering most of the windows and puncturing the walls. Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes. A rebel machine gun fired into Diệm's bedroom window from the adjacent Palais de Justice and penetrated his bed, but the president had arisen just a few minutes earlier.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October, SAO Krajina police picked up 53 civilians in Hrvatska Dubica. Most of them were Croats, but there were several Serbs and Muslims by nationality. They were told they were being taken to a meeting, but they were {{detained}} under armed guard in the town's fire station. During the day, eleven people escaped or were released, either because they were Serbs or because they had Serb relatives. On 21 October, SAO Krajina forces moved 43 detainees from Hrvatska Dubica. The detainees were placed on a bus and <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be taken to Glina and released in a prisoner exchange. However the group, all of them Croats except for two Serbs, were taken to Krečane and killed. In the same period, an additional 24 civilians from villages around Hrvatska Dubica were killed by Serb forces at unknown locations.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Riga summit {{was held}} in Riga, Latvia, and {{highlighted}} the issue of energy security. It was the first NATO summit {{to be held in}} a country that {{had been part of the}} Soviet Union. At the April 2008 summit in Bucharest, Romania, NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania and both countries joined NATO in April 2009. Ukraine and Georgia were also <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could eventually become members. The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia, as did NATO plans for a missile defence system. Studies for this system began in 2002, with negotiations centered on anti-ballistic missiles being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia, both presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev criticized it as a threat.|$|E
