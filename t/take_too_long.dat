5|$|The {{plan was}} {{launched}} on 7 July 1810 as two combined forces of British sailors, soldiers, sepoys and Royal Marines landed at separate beaches. Although {{a number of}} men were drowned in the heavy surf, {{the majority of the}} invasion force reached the beaches safely and marched inland, attacking French outposts as they approached the capital. Recognising that his demoralised garrison would be unable to defend Saint Denis and that the militia would <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to mobilise, the French commander Colonel Chrysostôme de Sainte-Suzanne surrendered the island, its garrison and its stores to Rowley.|$|E
5|$|The {{phalanx of}} the German bombers headed for Dungeness. At the head were 43 Do 17s from KG 2; next, {{a couple of}} miles behind, came 24 He 111s of KG 53; finally, {{a couple of miles}} further behind, came 19 Do 17s from KG 3; {{followed}} by 28 He 111s of KG 26. The headwind was present again, and the 114 bombers battled against it. The German fighter pilots kept close escort. They detested the tactic. It handed the initiative to the British regarding how and when to attack. Moreover, if they were bounced by Spitfires, the Bf 109s would <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to accelerate to full throttle in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|While {{the liberation}} of the Brunei area had been {{authorised}} by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, it was {{not supported by the}} British Chiefs of Staff Committee. The British leadership did not want the BPF to be diverted from the main theatre of operations off Japan and preferred to establish a base for the fleet in the Philippines. In response to a suggestion from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Brunei Bay could support future operations in south-east Asia, the Chiefs of Staff Committee judged that it would <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to establish facilities there, especially as Singapore might have been recaptured {{by the time they were}} complete.|$|E

5|$|As the {{situation}} deteriorated, the Brazilian government mobilized army units from {{other regions of}} the Empire. On 1 January 1865, one brigade (composed of two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion) with 1,700 men from the Brazilian province of Rio de Janeiro disembarked and occupied the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. Paranhos, along with Tamandaré, met Flores in Fray Bentos and decided to launch a combined attack against Montevideo. It was apparent that the Paraguayans would <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to reach Uruguay and no help would come from Urquiza and his Argentine Federalists. Increasingly isolated, Aguirre hoped that the foreign powers could intervene, but when, on 11 January, he asked the diplomatic corps in Montevideo whether they would provide military assistance to him and his government, none responded positively. João Propício Mena Barreto sailed from Fray Bentos on 14 January with the Brazilian infantry, bound for a landing near the mouth of the Santa Lucía River near Montevideo. On the way, he occupied the Uruguayan town of Colonia del Sacramento, garrisoning it with 50 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|However it was {{considered}} the low-level sight's chief advantages would be demonstrated under operational conditions. The sight {{was considered}} a great advancement on any previous method of low-level bombing, either by eye or with a bombsight. The best figures from No. 59 Squadron's trials were 6yd range error with release from 800ft, and 5yd error when approaching at 100ft, but releasing from 400ft with the aircraft's nose slightly up. Some academics in the ORS stated a 20yd error range existed but maintained the Mark III was promising. Some crews did not trust the device, which was the case when asked to use equipment of which they had little experience. Instead, many continued relying on their own trusted eyesight. A continued lack of resources meant there was no widespread use of the sights. In later months, the aircrew changed tactics and with new weapons, they decided that it would <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to zero-in on a target using the device. Pilots and crew often opted {{to use their own}} judgement by direct sighting with considerable success.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fighting, the player {{can choose to}} talk to demons encountered on the field, and attempt to recruit them to their party; {{the success of this}} depends on the player's level, with more powerful demons only being recruitable if the player's level is sufficiently high. In Ronde, the player does not initiate these conversations themselves, however: instead, defeated demons sometimes choose to talk to the player, and sometimes decide to join their party. Like in other Megami Tensei games, the player can fuse multiple allied demons with each other, thereby creating more powerful demons. In Ronde, the player can form contracts with demons, allowing human characters to use demon magic. Demons are fueled by magnetite, so the player needs to manage the supply of this, and thus cannot have too many allied demons on the field at once or <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to finish a battle. By clearing battles, the player can advance to the next chapter. The games' stories are affected by player choices, and have multiple endings.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this failure, the Belgians were asked to fall back to the Yser river and protect the Allied left flank and rear areas. The King's aide, General Overstraten said that such a move could not be made and {{would lead to the}} Belgian Army disintegrating. Another plan for further offensives was suggested. The French requested the Belgians withdraw to the Leie and the British to the French frontier between Maulde and Halluin, the Belgians were then to extend their front to free further parts of the BEF for the attack. The French 1st Army would relieve two more divisions on the right flank. Leopold was reluctant to undertake such a move because it would abandon all but a small portion of Belgium. The Belgian Army was exhausted and it was an enormous technical task that would <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to complete.|$|E
5|$|In the Safari Rally, a {{rotor arm}} in Mouton's Quattro failed and caused the turbo {{to break down}} as well. She retired after falling victim to the team's ranking order; as the repairs were {{expected}} to <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long,</b> Gumpert ordered championship leader Blomqvist's Quattro to be fixed by using Mouton's sister car as spares. Her debut in the new Sport Quattro at the Acropolis Rally ended with engine overheating problems. In the 1000 Lakes, Mouton placed ninth after the short first day. She later crashed and continued without a windscreen, but the damage to her Quattro could not be repaired in service. Mouton retired and left Finland pointless for the fourth year in a row. In late October, she signed a contract extension with Audi. At the RAC Rally, a slight mistake led to a puncture and Mouton dropped from third to fifth. She went on to narrowly lose the final podium spot to Toyota's Per Eklund. Mouton's results placed her 12th in the drivers' world championship, a point behind Röhrl. Outside the WRC, Mouton debuted in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the United States, driving an Audi Sport Quattro together with her usual co-driver Fabrizia Pons. After her main opponent Martin Schanche got hampered by a flat right front tyre she won the open rally category (now known as unlimited) in a record time and placed second overall, leaving behind several specialised V8 single-seaters that had normally dominated the race.|$|E

Accordingly, new assistants were hired and two new demands were made on Murray. The first was that he move from Mill Hill to Oxford, which he did in 1885.

25|$|Proponents of {{this tactic}} claimed interceptions {{in large numbers}} caused greater enemy losses while {{reducing}} their own casualties. Opponents pointed out the big wings would <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to form up, and the strategy ran {{a greater risk of}} fighters being caught on the ground refuelling. The big wing idea also caused pilots to overclaim their kills, due to the confusion of a more intense battle zone. This led to the belief big wings were far more effective than they were.|$|E

25|$|The {{cabin is}} {{pressurized}} and air conditioned. On variants {{prior to the}} MiG-21PFM, the cabin canopy is hinged at the front. When ejecting, the SK-1 ejection seat connects with the canopy to make a capsule that encloses the pilot. The capsule protects the pilot from the high-speed airflow encountered during high-speed ejections. After ejection, the capsule opens to allow the pilot to parachute to the ground. However, ejecting at low altitudes can cause the canopy to <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to separate, sometimes resulting in pilot death. Starting from the MiG-21PFM, the canopy is hinged {{on the right side}} of the cockpit.|$|E

After some debate, the Lords of the Admiralty declined to approve the Board's recommendation, indicating that the suggested refit would <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to complete. On 27 March 1768, the Navy Board instead selected the Whitby collier Earl of Pembroke, commissioning her into the Navy as HM Bark Endeavour.|$|E
