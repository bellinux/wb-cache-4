40|$|The {{formation}} and characterisation of films of polyaniline (PANI) and poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) containing cellulose nanocrystals (CNXLs) from cotton are described. PANI/CNXL films were electrodeposited from a solution containing CNXLs, HCl and aniline, while PEDOT/CNXL films were electrodeposited from a solution containing CNXLs, lithium perchlorate and ethylenedioxythiophene. In each case, incorporation of CNXLs into the electrodepositing polymer film {{led to the}} formation of a porous polymer/CNXL nanocomposite structure. The films were characterised using scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis. The specific capacitances of the nanocomposite materials were higher than those of the CNXL-free counterparts (488 F/g for PANI/CNXL; 358 F/g for PANI; 69 F/g for PEDOT/CNXL; 58 F/g for PEDOT). The durability of the PANI/CNXL film under potential cycling was slightly better than that of the CNXL-free PANI, while the PEDOT film was slightly more durable than the PEDOT/CNXL film. Using electrodeposition, it was possible to form thick PANI/CNXL films, with <b>total</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>capacitances</b> of 2. 07 F farads per squared cm (and corresponding specific capacitances of 440 F/g), demonstrating that this particular nanocomposite may be promising for the construction of high performance supercapacitors...|$|R

50|$|For this to work, {{the cell}} {{capacitance}} must {{be higher than}} the <b>electrode</b> <b>capacitance</b> by at least an order of magnitude. Capacitance slows the kinetics (the rise and fall times) of currents. If the <b>electrode</b> <b>capacitance</b> is much {{less than that of}} the cell, then when current is passed through the electrode, the electrode voltage will change faster than the cell voltage. Thus, when current is injected and then turned off (at the end of a duty cycle), the electrode voltage will decay faster than the cell voltage. As soon as the electrode voltage asymptotes to the cell voltage, the voltage can be sampled (again) and the next amount of charge applied. Thus, the frequency of the duty cycle is limited to the speed at which the electrode voltage rises and decays while passing current.
