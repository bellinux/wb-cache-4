40|$|This {{research}} proposes fuzzy goal programming {{model for}} multi-objective multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem. Objectives {{of the problem}} are minimization of the total time and {{the total cost of}} the project. Currently, objective in a multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem is often limited to a single objective function. Moreover, all elements of cost functions in a project are not included in the cost objective function. Incomplete <b>total</b> <b>project</b> cost causes <b>errors</b> in finding the project scheduling time. In this research there methods; 1) goal programming, 2) fuzzy linear programming and 3) preemptive fuzzy goal programming are used to solve the multi-objective multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem. These methods can find the compromise solution of the problem. However, the proposed preemptive fuzzy goal programming is more flexible than the others because it can adjust to find variety of alternative solutions. ...|$|R
