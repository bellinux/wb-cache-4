500|$|On July 20, Hornsby {{appeared}} {{in what would}} be his final game, a 5–4 loss to the Yankees. A day later, Hornsby was fired as manager and released as a player by the Browns, who were in last place {{at the time of}} his release. His release was partly due to an incident with Browns owner Donald Barnes. On July15, Hornsby won $35,000 ($ today) from betting on a horse race. When he tried to use $4,000 of this money to pay off a debt to Barnes, Barnes refused it, since it had come from a bookmaker. Hornsby protested to Barnes, [...] "The money is as good as <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> take from people in the loan-shark business. It's better than taking interest from widows and orphans... "; that made his release five days later an easy decision for Barnes. Hornsby finished the 1937 season with a [...]321batting average and 18hits in 20games, and was the oldest player in the AL that season.|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? We have all <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E

Van der Walt replied that [...] "one can have a billion rand turnover and still have an overdraft. If you don't have <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> <b>you</b> can't operate."

Due to their US appearances and support from FM stations, [...] "It's a Long Way There" [...] reached No.28 on the Billboard Hot 100. This galvanised the commitment of the band members to tackle the US record market.|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 1788, the New Jersey Legislature gave Baron von Steuben {{full title}} to the former Zabriskie estate. A month later, {{recognizing}} his financial embarrassment, Steuben wrote another former aide-de-camp and companion, William North, recognizing: [...] "The jersey Estate must and is to be sold. Walker is my administrator, all debts are to be paid out of it." [...] On November6, 1788, Steuben again wrote North (at his new home in Duanesburg), noting [...] "My Jersey Estate is Advertised but not yet Sold, from this Walker Shall immediately pay to you <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> <b>you</b> so generously lend me and all my debts in New-York will be payed. I support my present poverty with more heroism than I Expected. All Clubs and parties are renounced, I seldom leave the House." [...] Steuben eventually sold the New Jersey property to a son of the previous owner, and it remained in the Zabriskie family until 1909. It is the only remaining eighteenth-century building that von Steuben owned.|$|E
