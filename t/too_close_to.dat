5|$|England and MCC captain Norman Yardley later {{admitted}} Barnes's close proximity {{throughout the season}} had a psychological effect on his batsmen, although the Australian did miss catches because he was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> react to the oncoming ball.|$|E
5|$|The World Cruise of 1907–1909 {{tested the}} {{seakeeping}} of the U.S. designs. Even the earlier designs, including the Connecticut class with their higher freeboard, carried their secondary armament <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the waterline.|$|E
50|$|Cluster {{states have}} also been created in optical lattices, but were not used for {{computation}} as the atom qubits were <b>too</b> <b>close</b> together <b>to</b> measure individually.|$|R
500|$|Auchinleck to Newmilns: {{the section}} between Auchinleck and Cronberry <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> {{passenger}} traffic on 3 July 1950. The line between Cronberry and Newmilns {{was part of}} a route between Ayr and Muirkirk, but this <b>too</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> passenger trains on 1 October 1950. [...] In 1951 services were reinstated for two weeks to accommodate diverted trains from Edinburgh to Ayr. The entire line from Auchinleck <b>to</b> Muirkirk then <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> regular passenger traffic on 1 October 1950; the line was used until 1976.|$|R

5|$|Isa was demoted in 1987, because Abu Nidal {{believed}} he had become <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> other figures within the ANO. Always keen to punish members by humiliating them, Abu Nidal insisted he remain in the Intelligence Directorate, forcing him to work for his previous subordinates, who according to Seale were told to treat him with contempt.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Joey is in a {{hospital}} room of his own, where a doctor informs him that he's suffering from kidney stones. As they're <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> his bladder, Joey is given two options: wait until he passes them naturally, or have a procedure, which he finds too invasive. Opting for the former, he gives 'birth' to the kidney stones, concurrent with Phoebe’s birth.|$|E
5|$|Momoko is a {{childhood}} friend and classmate {{in junior high school}} of Chizuru; she is nicknamed Momo. She constantly hangs around Chizuru and is visibly annoyed when Chizuru socializes with others, or even if someone simply sits <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> her. Momoko inevitably starts fighting Saori, who does not particularly respect Chizuru, when they talk.|$|E

5|$|On 25 January 2012, it was {{reported}} that an incident occurred when testing The Swarm. Limbs of test dummies were broken off when the ride passed an object that was located <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the track. The Daily Mail suggested that the incident might have been a publicity stunt.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1941, Adolf Hitler {{resolved}} {{to end the}} conflict in the Balkans and subjugate Allied-sympathetic states. The Invasion of Yugoslavia began in the morning. The German Wehrmacht also intervened in Greece thus beginning the Battle of Greece. Italian failures had allowed another British foothold on the continent <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the Romanian oilfields — Germany's ally.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> call on election night. Knowing that a challenged election would {{be decided by}} the heavily Democratic General Assembly, Morrow conceded a week later. Official results showed that Stanley won the election by 471 votes, the closest gubernatorial vote in the state's history.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{convection}} requires {{free flow}} of air over the heat sink. If fins are not aligned vertically, or if fins are <b>too</b> <b>close</b> together <b>to</b> allow sufficient air flow between them, {{the efficiency of the}} heat sink will decline.|$|R

5|$|Written by Brian Hayles. Hayles was {{commissioned}} {{to write a}} storyline for “The Nazis” on March 8, 1966. Shortly thereafter, however, he was engaged to write The Smugglers, which he was told should take a higher priority. “The Nazis” was ultimately abandoned on June 15, 1966, with the sentiment being that the events it portrayed were <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the present day.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
5|$|Black's {{contact in}} the Seattle Police Department, Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), insists that Black should not get {{involved}} in the case as he is <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the victims. However, Black insists he can be of assistance, and reviews security footage of a stranger investigating Tom's luggage after their flight. Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area—Black recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as the man from the airport footage.|$|E

5|$|Hextall's first {{international}} recognition {{came when he}} was named as part of Team Canada's squad for the 1987 Canada Cup. During a practice session, he chopped Sylvain Turgeon's arm with his stick during a scrimmage, claiming that the left wing was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the goal. Turgeon missed the tournament with a fractured arm; Hextall was back-up to Grant Fuhr and did not play a single game. He later represented Canada in the 1992 World Championships, playing five games to record one win and a GAA of 2.86 as Canada were eliminated in the quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|However, Lauderdale was disliked for his {{opposition}} to the popular Queen Caroline, which became a significant issue in the campaign. His agents claimed that Balfour would have opposed her trial for alleged adultery, but he was portrayed as <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Liverpool's Tory ministry to properly represent interests of the borough. After four days of polling, Balfour lost by 9 votes (374—363) to the Whig baronet Sir Francis Blake.|$|E
5|$|If {{permanent}} brachytherapy is used, {{low dose}} radioactive sources (seeds) {{are left in}} the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need to be careful.|$|E

It is found that the induced gravity model tends to stabilize the inflationary phase if the initial conditions get <b>too</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> the condition ϕ_ 0 ∂_ϕ_ 0 V(ϕ_ 0) = 4 V(ϕ_ 0). The presence of higher derivative terms will act against the stabilily of this expanding solution unless a strong constraint on the possible field parameters and possible scalar potential is obeyed. Some models are analyzed for their implication to the early universe...|$|R

5|$|In November 2014, three MV-22Bs {{were placed}} on alert at Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait to be ready within 30 minutes to recover downed pilots during the Military {{intervention}} against ISIL. On 29 occasions between 1 November and 24 April 2015, two Ospreys and a KC-130J aerial tanker assigned to this Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP) mission spent 145 flight hours loitering, ready to perform rescue missions if required. The only pilot that was downed was a Jordanian, {{but he did not}} have a radio on him when he ejected and landed <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> ISIL forces.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{apparently}} expected Elizabeth to {{help her}} regain her throne. Elizabeth was cautious, ordering an inquiry into {{the conduct of the}} confederate lords and the question of whether Mary was guilty of Darnley's murder. In mid-July 1568, English authorities moved Mary to Bolton Castle, because it was further from the Scottish border but not <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> London. A commission of inquiry, or conference as it was known, was held in York and later Westminster between October 1568 and January 1569. In Scotland, her supporters fought a civil war against Regent Moray and his successors.|$|E
5|$|On graduation, Kraft {{accepted}} {{a job with}} the Chance Vought aircraft company in Connecticut. He had also sent an application to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), a government agency whose Langley Research Center was located in Hampton, Virginia; Kraft considered it to be <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> home, but applied as insurance. On arrival at Chance Vought he was told that he could not be inducted without his birth certificate, which he had not brought with him. Annoyed by the bureaucratic mindset of the company, he decided to accept the offer from NACA instead.|$|E
50|$|During {{the violent}} {{rainstorm}} {{in the area}} in August 1948 the line was breached west of Earlston, and the passenger train service ceased permanently. Duns reverted to being a branch line terminus from Reston until that <b>too</b> was <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> passengers in 1951.|$|R

In this situation it is possible for the relationship <b>to</b> become <b>too</b> <b>close,</b> leading <b>to</b> capture. This may result in the regulator protecting the interests of the regulated.|$|R
