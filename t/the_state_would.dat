5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> manage the businesses. With the money generated, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Wetherby resumed his private law practice. In 1956, Senator Alben Barkley {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a}} heart attack. The timing of his death meant that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> elect two senators in 1956â€”Clements' term was expiring and now Barkley's seat was vacant. President Eisenhower convinced former senator and ambassador John Sherman Cooper to be the Republican candidate for the seat, hoping Cooper's immense popularity in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> help his own re-election bid. Barkley's death occurred so late in the year that there was not time for a Democratic primary to choose the party's candidate for the open seat. The Democratic state committee chose Wetherby, who was only six months removed from his term as governor.|$|E
5|$|The latter schools, {{unable to}} cope with the costs of the {{reorganisation}} required by the 1944 Act, had been offered the status of voluntary controlled or voluntary aided schools, under which <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> pay all their running costs and all or most of their capital costs.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{formation}} of the Australian Constitution, [...] "the bedrock principle was that the powers of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>would</b> continue, subject to powers exclusively vested in the Commonwealth, or otherwise withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> and on this point there was no doubt or dissent". [...] Section 118 was the thus a key mechanism whereby the powers of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>would</b> continue within <b>the</b> new Commonwealth of Australia.|$|R
25|$|Though {{most of the}} Constitution's framers {{supported}} the right of individual States to regulate alcohol, some - such as Richard O'Connor - believed Section 113 to be unnecessary because <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> already have this power despite Section 92. Furthermore, O'Connor was concerned that by the specific inclusion of Section 113 (and Section 112), the police power of <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> {{be limited to the}} powers which were specifically enumerated.|$|R

5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, {{but the group}} {{splintered}} by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart around that time, owing to a cold winter {{and the failure of}} General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which ensured that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> remain under Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>would</b> cost his party the election. Instead, he threw his support behind Thomas Metcalfe, {{who went on to}} carry a very close election over Democrat William T. Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that swaraj {{not only can}} be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Palestinian <b>state</b> <b>would</b> gain {{sovereignty}} over its own airspace, with special reservations for Israeli training and operational needs. <b>The</b> Palestinian <b>state</b> <b>would</b> also {{be defined as}} a [...] "non-militarized state", and would not possess conventional military forces, but would be allowed to have a [...] "strong security force". <b>The</b> Palestinian <b>state</b> <b>would</b> also have an international force for border security and deterrence.|$|R
5|$|Mountbatten {{used his}} {{influence}} with the princes {{to push them}} towards accession. He declared that the British Government would not grant dominion status to any of <b>the</b> princely <b>states,</b> nor <b>would</b> it accept them into the British Commonwealth, which meant that <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>would</b> sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan. He {{pointed out that the}} Indian subcontinent was one economic entity, and that <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>would</b> suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of communal violence and communist movements.|$|R

5|$|In 1850 Congress {{passed a}} law that gave several states {{wetlands}} within their state boundaries. The Swamp and Overflowed Lands Act ensured that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> be responsible for funding the attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands. Florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for such attempts, though attention and funds were diverted owing to the Civil War and Reconstruction. Not until after 1877 did attention return to the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{through the}} 86th Amendment Act, Article 21(A) was incorporated. It {{made the right}} to primary {{education}} part {{of the right to}} freedom, stating that <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>would</b> provide free and compulsory education to children from six to fourteen years of age. Six years after an amendment was made in the Indian Constitution, the union cabinet cleared the Right to Education Bill in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Times Union of Albany {{received}} {{letters from}} readers requesting {{that all of}} NY149 be widened from two to four lanes. The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> also {{have to take a}} significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E
5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by <b>the</b> <b>states</b> rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> 0.25% retained by <b>the</b> <b>states</b> amounts to $5 billion <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>would</b> have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, {{which is more than}} the $327 million budget for <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>would</b> be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>would</b> have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that <b>state</b> economies <b>would</b> benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|R
25|$|Initially, at the Adelaide Constitutional Convention, Alfred Deakin {{proposed}} a resolution which <b>would</b> have allowed <b>States</b> to prohibit <b>the</b> importation of anything {{which they had}} first prohibited the sale of. After other delegates found problems with this amendment, Deakin amended it such that <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> {{only be able to}} restrict the importation of alcohol and opium, and such that <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> be able to regulate, not just prohibit, the sale of these items, provided that the regulation did not discriminate against imports. This proposal also failed in a 15-14 vote, largely due to Richard O'Connor's opposition.|$|R
50|$|The {{problem can}} be {{interpreted}} as a search problem where the set of possible partial-order plans is the search space. <b>The</b> initial <b>state</b> <b>would</b> be <b>the</b> plan with the open preconditions equal to the goal conditions. <b>The</b> final <b>state</b> <b>would</b> be any plan with no open preconditions, i.e. a solution.|$|R
5|$|On June 21, the Congressional {{committee}} {{met again}} at the State House {{with members of the}} Pennsylvania Executive Council, including its president, John Dickinson. The members of Congress asked the council to do more to protect the federal government. Dickinson and the council agreed to consult with the militia commanders and reply to Congress the next day. The following morning, the Pennsylvania Council again refused Congress' request. Lacking sufficient assurances that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> be willing to protect Congress, the members left Philadelphia that day for Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|On October29, Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards {{requested}} that the state's congressional delegation ask President Ronald Reagan for a disaster declaration. President Reagan responded and issued a disaster declaration on November1, which included the parishes of Ascension, Jefferson, Lafourche, Livingston, Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, Saint Charles, Saint John the Baptist, Saint Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Terrebonne, {{as well as the}} Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans. The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development estimated that highways in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> require $3 million in repairs from damage wrought by the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The Abwehr {{was also}} active in Ireland. German {{intelligence}} operations effectively ended in September 1941 when police made arrests {{on the basis}} of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin, including that of the United States. To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men {{at the start of the}} war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.|$|E

5|$|The {{city council}} voted {{in favour of}} {{building}} the Ring Line on 25 June 1997, against the votes of the Progress Party. However, the decision did not include how the line would be financed, and the politicians stated that they were hoping that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> use national road funds to finance the project. This was partially ensured in December, when a political agreement was reached for Oslo Package 2, a financing plan for investments in public transport in Oslo and Akershus between 2002 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was opened}} in 2001 after just under {{a year of}} {{construction}} and almost two decades of community requests. Local residents led by Doug and Bruce Stephens urged the state to connect I-84 directly to Adams Avenue, bypassing the congested US-89. Then-governor Mike Leavitt suggested that a private company rather than <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> need to build the road.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign that}} <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E

5|$|During the 1990s, the Department of Transportation {{looked into}} the {{expansion}} of NY347 and NY454. The studies suggested that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> add one additional traffic lane in each direction, giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge. The new lanes would also be capable of holding rapid-commute vehicles for the Long Island Rapid Commute. The interchange where Routes 347 and 454 fork in Hauppague is slated to go from an at-grade fork to a grade-separated interchange. The project, which will cost $359 million (2009 USD) {{was scheduled to be}} completed between 2012 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, {{both of whom were}} gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> work against local gay men and lesbians. Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005, the City of Marquette {{agreed to}} {{exchange}} jurisdiction {{over a number}} of roadways with MDOT. These transfers placed Bus. US41 and the unsigned M-554 under city jurisdiction; at the same time, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>would</b> take over a section of McClellan Avenue to extend M-553 to its current northern terminus at the Marquette Bypass. Negotiations regarding the transfer centered on MDOT deferring to city zoning ordinances along McClellan Avenue regarding driveway and snowmobile access and the city's assumption of expenses and liabilities related to the business loop. The transfers were made official on October 10, 2005, when MDOT and the city finalized the paperwork. As a result, Bus. US41 was decommissioned when the city took control over Washington and Front streets; signage was removed on November 9, 2005, to complete the process. Some local maps continue to label Bus. US41 through downtown Marquette, even years after the decommissioning of the designation, and some local businesses and organizations still use it in their advertising.|$|E
