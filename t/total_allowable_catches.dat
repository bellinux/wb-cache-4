25|$|EU {{legislation}} currently {{states that}} there are <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> for each species, which are sub-divided between European Union member states, the intention {{of which is to}} conserve fish stocks. The individual countries then use this figure as a basis for quota allocation to individual fishermen or fishermens organisations. The quota rules however require that any fish which is caught outside quota allowances or below minimum landing size be discarded and that it is an offence for a fishing vessel to be carrying on board any fish for which it does not have a valid quota or which is outside regulated size limits. This is an example of discarding practice being driven by political considerations. Years after difficult negotiations between stakeholders and member states, the EU updated the Common Fisheries Policy and included in Article 15 the Landing Obligation (Discard ban). Until 2019 the law will be implemented progressively. The Landing Obligation does not allow the fisher to land bycatches, it is the obligation to do so. All species subject to an regulation like catch quotas or minimum sizes, have to be landed. However, these landings are not feasible for direct human consumption and are therefore expected {{to be used in the}} fishmeal industry. The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is based on regulation formats in Norway and Iceland.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{criticism}} of the CFP is its centralised, top-down approach to management; although Member States {{are responsible for the}} policy's implementation and enforcement, the EU adopts sole competence in the creation of proposals and the making of decisions. The Commission is not exclusively responsible for the setting of <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches.</b> These are proposed by the commission but ultimately determined by the Council of Ministers. [...] Allocation of national catch quotas to Member States is on a pre-determined basis—the so-called relative stability—giving each member state pre-determined percentages of the available fishing opportunities. Although Member States hold some responsibilities, such as the distribution of quotas, it is argued that the EU retains too much authority over fisheries management. Furthermore, critics maintain that the organisation is ill-suited to the task of fisheries management as it lacks sufficient understanding of fisheries, and is too far removed from the realities of the industry to set accurate TACs and quotas. The command-and-control method characterised by the CFP is no longer deemed an effective form of fisheries management, and advocates of CFP reform consider a shift from traditional government to participatory third-order governance, incorporating the fisheries industry and Member States, to be vital {{to the success of the}} policy.|$|E

50|$|Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) are fishery rationalization instruments defined {{under the}} Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act as limited access permits to harvest quantities of fish.

50|$|Also in 2010, ClientEarth {{highlighted}} to the EU fisheries ministers that, {{given the}} rapid decline of bluefin tuna stocks, they were legally obliged to ban bluefin {{fishing in the}} Mediterranean and Atlantic {{for at least three}} years, from 2011-2013. ClientEarth also argued that France's overfishing in 2007 meant they should be banned from receiving any bluefin catch quota in 2011, and that Italy should also be penalised for overfishing, although less severely than France. However, following the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the European Council announced that it unanimously agreed to support <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> (TACs) in line with ICCAT's scientific advice. ClientEarth argued that these TACs would mean only a 30-45 percent likelihood that bluefin levels would recover by 2020, despite EU law demanding that all fish stocks are at sustainable levels by this date.|$|E
5000|$|The Barents Sea {{contains}} the world largest remaining cod population, {{as well as}} an important stocks of haddock and capelin. Fishing is managed jointly by Russia and Norway {{in the form of the}} Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission, established in 1976, in an attempt to keep track of how many fish are leaving the ecosystem due to fishing. [...] The Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission sets <b>Total</b> <b>Allowable</b> <b>Catches</b> (TACs) for multiple species throughout their migratory tracks. Through the Commission, Norway and Russia also exchange fishing quotas and catch statistics to ensure the TACs are not being violated. However, there are problems with the system and the effects of fishing on the Barents Sea ecosystem are not completely accurate. Cod is one of the major catches. A large portion of catches are not reported when the fishing boats land to account for profits that are being lost to high taxes and fees. Since many fishermen do not strictly follow the TACs and rules set forth by the Commission, the amount of fish being extracted annually from the Barents Sea is underestimated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel experiment designed {{to examine how}} rent dissipation may occur in fisheries in which the right {{to participate in the}} fishery is limited and fishermen compete amongst themselves for shares of an exogenous <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catch.</b> We demonstrate that rent dissipation may occur through multiple mechanisms, and that the heterogeneity of fishermen has important implications for how rent dissipation occurs {{and the extent to which}} different individuals may benefit from the implementation of rights-based management. We apply this approach to investigate the concept of voluntary rights-based management under which managers divide the <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catch</b> between two separate fisheries, and fishermen may choose between fishing for a guaranteed individual harvest quota or competing for a share of the total catch in a competitive fishery. ...|$|R

40|$|Fishery {{management}} {{is a complicated}} task that often results in overfishing, overcapacity, and low profits for the industry. The management of shared fish stocks is particularly problematic, especially if national authorities pursue different objectives. Multi-species fisheries add further complexity to the problem. It {{is no accident that}} management tools frequently used in Northern Europe, such as <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> and individual quotas, are not applied in the Mediterranean Sea, where more target species are caught simultaneously. However, the European Commission intends to introduce a market-based driver for a strong, profitable fishing industry by phasing in transferable fishing concessions. This management approach is new for the Mediterranean, and it requires in-depth examination at institutional, legal, and economic levels. In this paper, after a review of the institutional setting, the economic perspective was analyzed by estimating the production function for the Italian small pelagic fishery in the Adriatic Sea. With the addition of Croatia to the European Union, the Adriatic Sea can become a Mediterranean communal exclusive fishing area. The results indicate that output measures such as <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> and individual quotas should not cause serious discarding problems for this multi-species fishery...|$|E

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The {{success of}} fishery {{management}} ultimately {{depends on the}} approach of implementation. Past fishery management has relied largely on technical regulations. Examples for such command-and-control measures include detailed gear prescriptions, restrictions on the days-at-sea spent fishing and vessel capacity, and minimum landing sizes. Resource economists have argued in favor of incentive-based approaches, such as individual transferable quota (ITQ) systems and harvesting fees. For a fishery with multiple ecological and economic interactions, neither of the two approaches can assure a first-best solution in general. A central question thus is, {{which of the two}} approaches is more effective and efficient with respect to the objectives of ecosystem-based management. Here, we focus on intra-specific ecological and technical interactions which arise within an age-structured fishery. We use an age-structured ecological-economic optimization model of the Eastern Baltic cod fishery to quantify and analyze the effects of gear regulations and <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches,</b> as they have been applied since the mid 1980 s, as well as alternative, incentive-based systems, i. e. tradable quotas. We find that gear restrictions have not been effective and that the gradual increase of mesh sizes may even have been detrimental, as <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> have been set as ineffectively high levels. Setting <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> at sufficiently restrictive levels could have achieved an efficient outcome. Tradable quotas in terms of numbers of fish would achieve a similarly effective outcome in ecological terms, and would be economically preferable, because no technical restrictions are needed. We discuss possibilities to extend our results to multi-species fisheries...|$|E
