25|$|Chopin {{appeared}} {{to express her}} belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction {{in terms of her}} work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> nonfictional element, {{but more often than not}} the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might have been surprised to know her work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, just as she had been in her own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.|$|E

Unlike {{others in}} the Memphis Mafia, he was {{interested}} in spiritual questions and recalls how, from their first conversation, Presley revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties: [...] "I mean <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> purpose... there's got to be a reason... why I was chosen to be Elvis Presley.... I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get. And how empty I really feel." [...] Thereafter, Geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism, which the singer read voraciously. Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life, taking trunkloads of books with him on tour.|$|E

History Today editor Paul Lay called the idea [...] "frightening". Historian and Labour Party MP Tristram Hunt, while admitting {{that he had not}} yet actually seen the programme, voiced his concerns that the show's content was not [...] "challenging and stimulating" [...] enough for the BBC, adding that [...] "For children, Horrible Histories is an exciting aid to engage with the guts and gore of the past, but there are more sophisticated, populist ways of getting people involved in history than this.

500|$|Many {{different}} kinds of analysis are performed on ice cores, including visual layer counting, tests for electrical conductivity and physical properties, and assays for inclusion of gases, particles, radionuclides, and various molecular species. [...] For {{the results of these}} tests to be useful in the reconstruction of palaeoenvironments, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> way to determine the relationship between depth and age of the ice. [...] The simplest approach is to count layers of ice that correspond to the original annual layers of snow, but this is not always possible. [...] An alternative is to model the ice accumulation and flow to predict how long it takes a given snowfall to reach a particular depth. [...] Another method is to correlate radionuclides or trace atmospheric gases with other timescales such as periodicities in the earth's orbital parameters.|$|E

500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] {{was written}} by Williams, Carmen Reece, Al Sherrod Lambert and Harmony Samuels who also served as its producer. The song marked the third {{collaboration}} of the trio consisting of Williams, Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland, after their group Destiny's Child disbanded in 2006. Williams sent an advanced demo of the album Journey to Freedom to her former bandmates Beyoncé and Rowland which contained the song as a solo track titled [...] "When Jesus Says Yes". Later, Williams {{received a call from}} Rowland who said, [...] "We love 'When Jesus Says Yes'... <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Destiny's Child mix of the song." [...] Both Rowland and Beyoncé recorded their respective verses in a studio afterwards. Williams stated she wanted to keep the project in secrecy [...] "until it was time" [...] to reveal it.

500|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind the scenes. Actor Markinson, upon seeing the costume, said [...] "this is what's driving me crazy?" [...] Director Kim Manners was highly critical of the monster and later told people that after the episode would air, his career would be [...] "over". Gilligan attributed the problems due to the episodic work schedule, he noted, [...] "we're usually on such a short schedule that <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> weak link somewhere". Gilligan also stated that the [...] "over engineered" [...] aspects of the suit made it somewhat comical. To fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the filmed footage to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who [...] "took the footage with the monster in it, erased the monster completely, took the monster to a different screen [...] animated it, and added speed blur". The effects took a large amount of time to complete. They were only finished at 7:30 the morning the episode was scheduled to air. In the end, the monster is not clearly visible in the installment, which allowed the scariness of the episode to be more real, according to Gilligan.|$|E
500|$|Oberman has {{described}} her {{time on the}} show as [...] "hectic". During Chrissie's tenure there was constant shuffling behind the scenes, with three different executive producers taking the reins, with each new producer bringing in new writing teams. Uncertainty came to be manifested in writing and scripts, with character inconsistencies and plot holes working their way into production. One notable example was ownership of The Queen Victoria, with Chrissie legally owner of half the pub after Den legitimately signed over the deed before they renewed their vows in February. However, in November this fact was forgotten, with Chrissie represented as forging Den's signature to nullify her ownership of the pub which legally became Sharon's. Problems with the script did not escape Oberman, who criticised her character's storylines after she left the show, saying the writers [...] "must have been on crack", adding how [...] "plots didn't make logical or emotional sense – but they said, 'That's the soap convention, dear, get used to it'". She also considered some scenes to be irresponsible, saying [...] "I was worried when four-year-olds said to me, 'I saw you kill Den.' I don't agree with censorship but <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> level of responsibility." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he {{believed}} the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for Agent Carter, before airing the remaining 12. Explaining this decision, Bell said, One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [...] tune in to something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's {{going to be a}} Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, Agent Carter comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It takes out the need for repeats in the back half.|$|E

2500|$|Semiautonomous swarming, {{in which}} the actors {{occasionally}} interfere with one another, is seen in attacks on computer networks by loose confederations of malicious hackers. On occasion, especially when the attack uses a botnet, some of the units may try to overpower and control one another, {{as well as the}} target. One of the observations of the Center on Terrorism and Irregular Warfare was that unfocused mass disruption was not a useful terrorist, and by extension general military, tactic.
