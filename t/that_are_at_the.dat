5|$|In the UK, Christmas {{number one}} albums are those <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} UK Albums Chart on Christmas Day. Typically, this will refer to the album that was {{announced}} as {{number one on the}} Sunday before 25 December—when Christmas Day falls on a Sunday itself, the official number one is considered by the OCC to be the one announced on that day's chart. During the 1990s, the following albums were Christmas number ones.|$|E
5|$|The cool, damp habitat {{provided}} by the bogs at Black Moshannon State Park provides a home for some birds <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> southern limit of their habitat in central Pennsylvania. The Canada warbler and northern waterthrush nest in the bogs, as do the alder flycatcher, common yellowthroat, swamp sparrow, red-winged blackbird, and gray catbird. The olive-sided flycatcher, which is designated as locally extinct in Pennsylvania, has been seen during the breeding season at Black Moshannon State Natural Area. Bird watchers have observed nesting barred owls in the IBA, as well as Virginia rail and sora.|$|E

At the {{lower end of the}} visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule retinal in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.|$|E

25|$|The Brome Abraham's {{relation}} to the play of the same subject in the cycle of Chester Mystery Plays has attracted attention. A comparison of the texts reveals around 200 lines of striking similarity, in particular during the debates between Abraham and Isaac <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hearts of the plays. A. M. Kinghorn judged the Brome play to be a superior reworking of the Chester barbers' play of Abraham, and accordingly dated the play to late in the fifteenth century. However, comparing the two, J. Burke Severs decided that the Chester play was an expansion and reworking of the Brome one.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{he won a}} {{large number}} of {{international}} awards. It could be argued that although his films show the development of ideas from existentialism, surrealism, Marxism, German expressionism, Postmodernism, Nouvelle Vague and Italian neorealism. Sen's cinema for the most part does not provide a happy ending or a definitive conclusion (unlike many of the films of Sen's better known contemporary Satyajit Ray). In many of Sen's later films, the audience becomes a participant in the process of the development of the plot. The director invites and provokes the audience into a shared process of forming multiple conclusions, <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time unique and different. The director does not play the role of god, his audience does. It is not really surprising that unlike Allen who has a steady niche audience in the Western literati and aficionados, Sen's experimentation with parallel cinema had significantly cost him much of a devoted audience composing of largely the Calcutta-based westernized intelligentsia.|$|E

25|$|In a solid, {{only those}} {{particles}} <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface can {{be involved in}} a reaction. Crushing a solid into smaller parts means that more particles are present at the surface, and the frequency of collisions between these and reactant particles increases, and so reaction occurs more rapidly. For example, Sherbet (powder) is a mixture of very fine powder of malic acid (a weak organic acid) and sodium hydrogen carbonate. On contact with the saliva in the mouth, these chemicals quickly dissolve and react, releasing carbon dioxide and providing for the fizzy sensation. Also, fireworks manufacturers modify the surface area of solid reactants to control {{the rate at which the}} fuels in fireworks are oxidised, using this to create different effects. For example, finely divided aluminium confined in a shell explodes violently. If larger pieces of aluminium are used, the reaction is slower and sparks are seen as pieces of burning metal are ejected.|$|E

These festivals are {{the time for the}} Himachalis to adorn {{colourful}} dress and accessories and get mixed up with the rest of their kins. Some of these fairs and festivals in the upper regions are the Kullu Dussehra, Shivratri Fair (Mandi), Shoolini Mela (Solan), Minjar Fair (Chamba), Mani Mahesh Chhari Yatra (Chamba), Renuka fair (Sirmaur), Lavi Trade Fair (Rampur), Vrajeshwari fair (Kangra), Jwalamukhi Fair (Jwalamukhi), Holi Fair (Sujanpur Tira), and Naina Devi Fair (Bilaspur),Fulaich {Kinnaur valley}. In the lower regions of Himachal are temple Fairs in Una District such as the Peeplo Fair, the 'Mairi' Guruduwara Fair, the 'Chintpurni' temple Fair, the 'Kamakhya temple' Fair, including the annual Himachal Hill Festival in the village Polian Purohitan during the fourth week of October.|$|E
25|$|The Northern and Western {{parts of}} the city, which are closer to the Fijeh springs, receive better service than the Southern and Eastern parts <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the {{distribution}} network. Service is also better in winter when the yield of the spring is highest. During winter residents in the Northwestern parts of Damascus typically receive a continuous flow of water, while residents in the Southeastern {{parts of the}} city receive water for only a few hours per day or even every couple of days during summer. For example, the town of Sahenya, 16km south-west of Damascus, was for 10 days without water in 2006. Most houses in Damascus have rooftop tanks to store water during periods of supply. Many houses have dual plumbing systems, with one tap for water that comes directly from the network and another tap for water that comes from the rooftop tank. As a consequence, many residents do not perceive a water crisis during most of the year, because they have sufficient water either from the network or from their rooftop tanks.|$|E

500|$|Bass guitar {{players who}} may use {{subwoofer}} cabinets include performers who play with extended range basses {{that include a}} low [...] "B" [...] string (about 31Hz); bassists who play in styles where a very powerful sub-bass response {{is an important part}} of the sound (e.g., funk, Latin, gospel, R & B, etc.); and/or bass players who perform in stadium-size venues or large outdoor venues. [...] Keyboard players who use subwoofers for on-stage monitoring include electric organ players who use bass pedal keyboards (which go down to a low [...] "C" [...] which is about 33Hz) and synth bass players who play rumbling sub-bass parts that go as low as 18Hz. Of all of the keyboard instruments that are amplified onstage, synthesizers can produce some of the lowest pitches, because unlike a traditional electric piano or electric organ, which have as their lowest notes a low [...] "A" [...] and a low [...] "C", respectively, a synth does not have a fixed lowest octave.
