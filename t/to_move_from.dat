More than two years later, the application was dismissed and WINC remained at its original frequency and power.|$|E
5|$|Saltwater fish tend to lose water {{because of}} osmosis. Their kidneys return {{water to the}} body. The reverse happens in {{freshwater}} fish: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> freshwater to saltwater.|$|E

5|$|Along with Lazio and Roma, Juventus {{is one of}} {{only three}} Italian clubs quoted on Borsa Italiana (Italian stock exchange). Juventus was also the only {{association}} football club in the country member of STAR (Segment of Stocks conforming to High Requirements, Italian: Segmento Titoli con Alti Requisiti), one of the main market segment in the world. However, due to 2011 financial results, Juventus had <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> the STAR segment to MTA market.|$|E
5|$|Another radical leader, Communist {{spokesman}} and one-time {{leader of}} American {{forces in the}} Spanish Civil War Harry Haywood, was born in 1898 in South Omaha as Haywood Hall to parents who were former slaves. In 1913 his father was beaten by a white gang at the South Omaha meatpacking plant where he worked, forcing the family <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> the city. The African Blood Brotherhood, started in Omaha, contributed to radicalizing Haywood when he joined it the group in Chicago, where his family had moved in 1915.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{a distant}} uncle of Godwin's died, leaving her an {{inheritance}} of $5,000. She {{used the money}} {{to apply to the}} Iowa Writers Workshop and, after being accepted, <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> New York to Iowa City in 1967. There Godwin met her teacher and future mentor Kurt Vonnegut. At Iowa, Godwin worked as an instructor while earning an M.A. and Ph.D. from the same university in 1968 and 1971 respectively. She began teaching Greek Drama, before earning a position teaching literature. By age 30, Godwin had written three novels, but was unable to get any of them published.|$|E
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> one side of the ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Clint Grant {{was born}} in Nashville, Tennessee. During his time at Vanderbilt University, {{economic}} troubles {{brought on by the}} Great Depression forced Grant's family <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> Nashville; they settled in Dallas, Texas, where his father was asked to lead the Art Department at the Morning News. Grant got a job with the Photo Department, but he was drafted into the United States Army before he could report to work. Grant served during World War II in Europe, where he never used a camera.|$|E

5|$|Flagstaff {{grew and}} prospered through the 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, many {{businesses}} started <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> the city center, and {{the downtown area}} entered an economic and social decline. Sears and J.C. Penney left the downtown area in 1979 to open up as anchor stores in the new Flagstaff Mall, joined in 1986 by Dillard's. By 1987, the Babbitt Brothers Trading Company, which had been a retail fixture in Flagstaff since 1891, had closed its doors at Aspen Avenue and San Francisco Street.|$|E
5|$|George Burley {{took over}} from Redknapp in December 2005, though neither manager {{was unable to}} put {{together}} an effective promotion campaign and Southampton ended the season 12th in the Championship. Higginbotham rejected a new contract {{and as a result}} was placed on the transfer list in July 2006. He told the local press that he felt disrespected the way Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe had handled his contract – he had taken a pay cut <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> Derby, a 40% pay cut following relegation, and then the new contract offer was lower still than his current contract.|$|E
5|$|Imamura was {{up against}} a resourceful, {{resolute}} and aggressive opponent, who also had access to good intelligence. Allied Ultra codebreakers were reading the Japanese shipping codes, and, by 3 January 1943, Allied commanders knew in advance about the force that Adachi was planning to send from Rabaul to Lae, although {{they did not know}} the force's ultimate destination. Blamey chose not to wait for this to become clear, but immediately ordered the 17th Infantry Brigade <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> Milne Bay to Wau on 4 January 1943. Its commander—Brigadier Murray Moten—was ordered to assume command of Kanga Force and defend Wau.|$|E

The family moved to Saint Petersburg, a city previously off-limits to Jews. There, Ovsei adopted the more Russian name Alexander; he was known among family and friends as Sasha, a diminutive for Alexander. The Berkmans lived comfortably, with servants and a summer house. Berkman attended the gymnasium, where he received a classical education with the youth of Saint Petersburg's elite.|$|E

5|$|In her {{biography}} of McCracken, The Girl Who Fell Down, dance critic Mary Jo Sagolla says that McCracken is little remembered today, and not widely appreciated for her influence on Fosse, {{and for her}} efforts to encourage him <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> dance to choreography. Though her career went into {{a sharp decline in}} the 1950s due to her diabetes, she directly influenced the career of MacLaine, as well as Fosse, and was a pioneer in combining comedy and dance.|$|E

5|$|PedroI invaded Portugal at {{the head}} of an army in July 1832. Faced at first with what seemed a {{national}} civil war, he soon became involved in a wider conflict that enveloped the Iberian Peninsula in a struggle between proponents of Liberalism and those seeking a return to Absolutism. PedroI died of tuberculosis on 24 September 1834, just a few months after he and the liberals had emerged victorious. He was hailed by both contemporaries and posterity as a key figure who helped spread the liberal ideals that allowed Brazil and Portugal <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>from</b> Absolutist regimes to representative forms of government.|$|E
