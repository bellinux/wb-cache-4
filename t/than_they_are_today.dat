5|$|All lemurs, {{particularly}} the smaller species, {{are affected by}} predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs, despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native euplerids, such as the fossa, feral cats, domestic dogs, snakes, diurnal birds of prey, owls, and crocodiles. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus Aquila and the giant Malagasy crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus mahery), {{as well as the}} giant fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including the giant subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> Today, predator size only restricts owls to the smaller lemurs, usually 100g (3.5oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey, such as the Madagascan harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) and the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus).|$|E

30|$|The current, {{rechargeable}} battery technology implies {{the use of}} a liquid electrolyte, which needs to be imbibed into a separator. This characteristic brings to the commercial models several restrictions in terms of design, size and leak-proof assembly. In recent years, the concept of all-solid-state (micro)batteries has found large support from the scientific community due to the increased flexibility of the design of stand-alone microelectronic devices and the enhanced applicability brought by the complete absence of leakage (for example medical implants would be much safer <b>than</b> what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today)</b> [67].

30|$|Advances in {{mortality}} forecasts {{will become}} even more important in the future <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> already <b>today.</b> In many highly developed countries, improving chances of survival are the main driver of population aging (Preston and Stokes 2012); the increase in life expectancy at birth is due to mortality reductions at all ages, though the highest gains in mortality reductions advance to successively older ages (Christensen et al. 2009). Some forecasts underestimate this ongoing progress in mortality reductions from younger to older ages (Ševčíková et al. 2016; Li et al. 2013). In the past, this failure would have meant to underestimate mortality of people at working ages; in the future, it would probably lead to an underestimation of mortality of people aged 65 and older (because survival improvements will increasingly reach those ages). This will have an increasing impact on social welfare systems. Underestimating mortality of people at working ages corresponds to having more people who pay premiums. Underestimating mortality of people in retirement ages, however, will result in having more people who receive benefits for longer periods than previously anticipated.|$|R

25|$|In preindustrial times, deaths {{at young}} and middle age were more common <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> This {{is not due}} to genetics, but because of {{environmental}} factors such as disease, accidents, and malnutrition, especially since the former were not generally treatable with pre-20th century medicine. Deaths from childbirth were common for women, and many children did not live past infancy. In addition, most people who did attain old age were likely to die quickly from the above-mentioned untreatable health problems. Despite this, we do find many examples of pre-20th century individuals attaining lifespans of 85 years or greater, including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Cato the Elder, Thomas Hobbes, Eric of Pomerania, Christopher Polhem, and Michelangelo. This was also true for poorer people like peasants or laborers. Genealogists will almost certainly find ancestors living to their 70s, 80s and even 90s several hundred years ago.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{defining}} {{features of a}} new material is to be resistant, easy to process, to combine the qualities of basic materials, in the current technique, but not to borrow from them their negative properties. In recent years, carbon fiber composites have been increasingly used in different ways in reinforcing structural elements.

Before Mongols left besieged Crimean Kaffa the dead or dying bodies of the infected soldiers were loaded onto catapults and launched over Kaffa's walls to infect those inside.

From the overall perspective of the role and use of forensic science {{in the criminal justice}} system, the concepts of Forensic Information Value Added (FIVA) and Forensic Information Value Efficiency (FIVE) are introduced. From these concepts the key factors determining the added value of forensic investigations are discussed; Evidential Value, Relevance, Quality, Speed and Cost. By unravelling the added value of forensic science and combining this with the future needs and scientific and technological developments, six forensic grand challenges are introduced: i) Molecular Photo-fitting; ii) chemical imaging, profiling and age estimation of finger marks; iii) Advancing Forensic Medicine; iv) Objective Forensic Evaluation; v) the Digital Forensic Service Centre and vi) Real time In-Situ Chemical Identification. Finally, models for forensic innovation are presented that could lead to major international breakthroughs on all these six themes within a five year time span.

The national survey confirmed that the Z. marina beds almost totally disappeared from the French coasts during the 1930 s. However, the disease symptoms seem to have begun locally a few years before.

[...] Although it has lost nearly all of its woodland habitat, some lemur species still survive in isolated forest patches. Lemur diversity is tightly linked with plant diversity, which in turn decreases with increased forest fragmentation. In extreme cases, treeless sites such as the town of Ampasambazimba from the central region no longer support any of the lemur species represented in their subfossil record. However, other locations no longer have giant subfossil lemurs, yet they still maintain forested habitat that could support them. [...] Even though the giant lemurs have disappeared from these locations, while the smaller species survive in the forest patches that remain, the subfossil remains indicate that the living species used to be more widespread and coexisted with the extinct species. [...] Although the Central Highlands saw the greatest species loss, it was not the only region or habitat type to witness extinctions. However, the least-understood region is the eastern rainforests, which have not yielded subfossil lemur remains. [...] Consequently, {{it is impossible to know}} what percentage of lemur taxa were recently lost there, although studies of Malagasy customs (ethnohistory) along with archaeological evidence suggests the eastern rainforests were more ecologically disturbed in the past <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> [...] Hunting and trapping by humans may have severely impacted large lemurs in this region as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{threat of}} release of methane sequestered in the {{circumpolar}} Arctic {{regions of the}} world creates the possibility of triggering additional feedback effects from the terrestrial and the deep ocean systems which could potentially add large amounts of carbon (C) into the atmosphere. This paper analyses the implications for C mitigation policy under the threats of a substantial permafrost methane release. Several insights emerge from the analysis. First, the presence of non-linear feedbacks creates a bifurcation zone in the C emissions-stock space, on one side of which large accumulations of atmospheric C materialize leading to significant damages. Second, the bifurcation line does not have a steep slope, implying that {{it would be possible to}} avoid falling on the wrong side of this zone even if the current atmospheric stock of C <b>were</b> higher <b>than</b> what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> Third, when the release of permafrost C is uncertain, there is benefit in reducing anthropogenic C more than what would be optimal under a certain release of the same. Fourth, higher abatement cost scenarios do not necessarily imply significantly reduced abatement efforts. On the contrary, abatement efforts, which are only reduced marginally under this scenario, ensure that long run carbon path is stabilized. This is done in order to avoid incurring substantial costs of abatement in the future when non-linear feedback effects kick in. 19 page(s...|$|R
