5|$|The {{bacteria}} that cause urinary tract infections typically enter <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or lymph. It {{is believed that}} the bacteria are usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy. After gaining entry to <b>the</b> <b>bladder,</b> E. Coli are able to attach to <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> wall and form a biofilm that resists the body's immune response.|$|E
5|$|A {{predisposition}} for bladder infections may run in families. Other {{risk factors}} include diabetes, being uncircumcised, {{and having a}} large prostate. In children UTIs are associated with vesicoureteral reflux (an abnormal movement of urine from <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> into ureters or kidneys) and constipation.|$|E

5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual {{activity}} that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to urinary or fecal incontinence. Couples can prepare for sex by draining <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> using intermittent catheterization or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling urinary catheters must take special care with them, removing them or taping {{them out of the}} way.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is {{commonly}} used to treat some leukemias and Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as cancers of <b>the</b> <b>bladder,</b> breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide).|$|E
5|$|For {{those with}} {{recurrent}} infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs {{is associated with}} the lowest antibiotic use. A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective. Medications frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Methenamine is another agent used for this purpose as in <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop. Some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns of antibiotic resistance.|$|E
40|$|An adenyl cyclase {{preparation}} {{derived from}} epithelial cells of <b>the</b> urinary <b>bladder</b> of <b>the</b> toad, Bufo marinus, is described. This cyclase preparation is specifically stimulated by neurohypophyseal hormones and various synthetic analogs which evoke a hydroosmotic response in <b>the</b> intact <b>bladder.</b> <b>The</b> relative stimulatory {{effects of these}} compounds have been compared on the cyclase preparation and in <b>the</b> intact <b>bladder.</b> <b>The</b> peptide concentrations required for half-maximal stimulation (affinity) in the cell-free and intact systems were parallel; however the magnitude of stimulation produced by saturating concentrations of peptides did not correlate. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} peptide analogs which inhibit the hydroosmotic effect of [8 -arginine]-vasopressin on <b>the</b> intact <b>bladder</b> also inhibit <b>the</b> stimulation of <b>the</b> toad <b>bladder</b> cyclase preparation by vasopressin.

40|$|Abstract: Hybrids of Utricularia nelumbifolia × U. reniformis (and vice versa) were raised, and <b>the</b> <b>bladders</b> {{of adult}} {{individuals}} {{taken out of}} the soil were observed. With their long antennae they re-semble their parents, yet they differ noticeably from <b>the</b> identically situated <b>bladders</b> of U. cornigera that has characteristic short antennae.

50|$|Another variety, <b>the</b> dual <b>bladder</b> wing, {{contains}} a second, redundant bladder and inflation assembly, with <b>the</b> second <b>bladder</b> being {{intended for use}} if <b>the</b> primary <b>bladder</b> fails, either through a puncture, or through an inflation valve failing. Some technical divers may choose a dual bladder wing to have backup redundancy if <b>the</b> primary <b>bladder</b> fails. Detractors of this arrangement point out that if <b>the</b> extra <b>bladder</b> is inadvertently inflated, the diver may not realise that this has occurred, and it may result in an uncontrolled buoyant ascent. This risk may be reduced by having only oral inflation for the backup wing, or requiring the same inflator hose {{to be used for}} both wings, and having <b>the</b> backup <b>bladder</b> inflation on <b>the</b> opposite side to <b>the</b> primary <b>bladder.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} {{the upper part of}} the cervix lies <b>the</b> <b>bladder,</b> {{separated}} from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over the sides of the cervix. To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs onto the back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. The cervix is more tightly connected to surrounding structures than the rest of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Transient {{increased}} bowel frequency, diarrhoea, constipation or minor rectal bleeding, {{may also}} occur. Acute and subacute side effects usually resolve over {{a matter of}} days or a few weeks. In the case of permanent (seed) brachytherapy for prostate cancer, there is a small chance that some seeds may migrate out of the treatment region into <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> or urethra and be passed in the urine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{internal}} sphincter muscle of urethra: {{located at}} <b>the</b> <b>bladder's</b> inferior {{end and the}} urethra's proximal end at the junction of the urethra with <b>the</b> urinary <b>bladder.</b> <b>The</b> internal sphincter {{is a continuation of}} the detrusor muscle and is made of smooth muscle, therefore it is under involuntary or autonomic control. This is the primary muscle for prohibiting the release of urine.|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} the {{duplication}} of primary carcinoma of the prostate and <b>the</b> urinary <b>bladder</b> were recently experienced in our clinic. The first case was a fifty-nine y ear old man with the chief complaint of macroscopic hematuria with blood clots and difficulty in micturition. By systematic urological examinations, we noticed preoperatively a carcinoma of the prostate and <b>the</b> urinary <b>bladder,</b> and <b>the</b> pathological examination of the specimens removed by operations revealed adenocarcinoma of the prostate and transitional cell carcinoma of <b>the</b> urinary <b>bladder.</b> <b>The</b> second case was a fifty-four year old man and a carcinoma o f the prostate and <b>the</b> urinary <b>bladder</b> were also noticed preoperatively.

5|$|Utricularia purpurea, a bladderwort, {{comes from}} another genus of {{carnivorous}} plants {{and may have}} lost its appetite for carnivory, at least in part. This species can still trap and digest arthropod prey in its specialized bladder traps, but does so sparingly. Instead, it harbors a community of algae, zooplankton, and debris in <b>the</b> <b>bladders,</b> giving rise to the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>bladders</b> of U. purpurea favor a mutualistic interaction {{in place of a}} predator-prey relationship.|$|R
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in <b>the</b> <b>bladder)</b> may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Most stones form {{due to a}} {{combination}} of genetics and environmental factors. Risk factors include high urine calcium levels, obesity, certain foods, some medications, calcium supplements, hyperparathyroidism, gout and not drinking enough fluids. Stones form in the kidney when minerals in urine are at high concentration. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, urine testing, and medical imaging. Blood tests may also be useful. Stones are typically classified by their location: nephrolithiasis (in the kidney), ureterolithiasis (in the ureter), cystolithiasis (in <b>the</b> <b>bladder),</b> or by what they are made of (calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, cystine).|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
50|$|Growth {{occurs with}} {{lengthening}} of the stipe (central stalk), and splitting of the blades. At the growing tip {{is a single}} blade, {{at the base of}} which develop small gas bladders along one side. As <b>the</b> <b>bladders</b> and stipe grow, small tears develop in the attached blade. Once the tears have completed, each bladder supports a single separate blade along the stipe, with <b>the</b> <b>bladders</b> and their blades attached at irregular intervals.|$|R

40|$|Metastases of {{melanoma}} to <b>the</b> urinary <b>bladder</b> are infrequent.

5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not <b>the</b> <b>bladder.</b> These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E
5|$|Woodruff's {{contributions}} to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised {{a method of}} implanting a transplanted ureter in <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that {{remains one of the}} world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's {{contributions to}} the study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with anti-lymphocyte serum has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian {{but there is a}} septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. <b>The</b> <b>bladder</b> is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.|$|E

5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column in bowfin is ossified and {{in comparison to}} earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the {{vertebral column}} allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, in comparison to fish that had only a notochord. The bowfin has a homocercal tail, {{which means that the}} tail has equal lobes that appear symmetrical.This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.|$|E
25|$|Authorities on the genus, such as botanists Peter Taylor and Francis Ernest Lloyd, {{agree that}} <b>the</b> vacuum-driven <b>bladders</b> of Utricularia {{are the most}} {{sophisticated}} carnivorous trapping mechanism to be found anywhere in the plant kingdom. <b>The</b> <b>bladders</b> are usually shaped similarly to broad beans (though they come in various shapes) and attach to the submerged stolons by slender stalks.|$|R
