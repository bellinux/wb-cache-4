If your answer is TIA—transient ischemic attack—it could be wrong in up to 30 % of such cases. 1 And if the diagnosis is wrong, the patient’s management could be wrong, and the outcome could be costly—physically, emotionally, and financially. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> The diagnosis of TIA is difficult at best and is frequently made from the patient’s history, rather than from clinical observation. 2 Patients, however, vary widely {{in their ability to}} communicate effectively.

40|$|Are you a cow/calf {{producer}} worrying if this year’s gross revenues will {{be enough}} to cover production expenses and leave you something for family living withdrawals? Would you like {{to find a way to}} evaluate the opportunities to market your feeder calves so that you can determine which marketing opportunity allows you to cover your expenses, provides for family living withdrawals, and perhaps even lock in a profit? Your chances of achieving this lofty goal will be greatly improved if you can identify and implement the right cattle marketing strategy. Marketing is usually the most difficult management task that the cattle producer has to perform. Proper marketing can make the difference between profit and loss in the cattle business. Most cattle producers spend much of their time and effort on improving production practices, while spending very little time on the marketing of their product. However, time spent marketing cattle in today’s complex economic environment can pay equal or larger dividends than time spent on improving certain production practices. Today, feeder cattle producers have more flexibility in marketing than they often realize. There are numerous marketing alternatives available to cattle producers. In fact, each marketing alternative is defined by both the management and marketing programs that you select. For example, if a cow/calf producer chooses to sell his feeder calves during August in a satellite video auction after weaning and implementing a VAC 45 -day program, he has defined both a production program and marketing program. Most cattle producers do not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> but you...|$|E
