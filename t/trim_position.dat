40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} free-to-roll delta wings with A= 50 ° has been conducted. Roll time histories showed that multiple <b>trim</b> <b>positions</b> are possible. Only nonzero roll angles, {{or a combination}} of zero and nonzero roll angles, are possible, depending on the angle of attack. It was found that the free-to-roll dynamics is closely correlated with the static lift characteristics at zero roll angle. In a small range of incidences, self-excited roll oscillations are observed. The effects of leading-edge shape and wing thickness on the self-excited roll oscillations were investigated. The self-excited roll oscillations are also observed for the wing with sharp leading-edge (for which the separation point is fixed), but are much smaller in amplitude. As the amplitude of the motion is amplified for a round leading-edge, characteristics of flow separation at the leading-edge are a contributing factor. It is suggested that the interaction of the reattachment lines {{play an important role in}} the self-excited roll oscillations...|$|R
40|$|Bifurcation {{theory is}} {{used to analyze the}} {{nonlinear}} dynamic stability characteristics of single-degree-of-freedom motions of an aircraft or a flap about a <b>trim</b> <b>position.</b> The bifurcation theory analysis reveals that when the bifurcation parameter, e. g., the angle of attack, is increased beyond a critical value at which the aerodynamic damping vanishes, a new solution representing finite-amplitude periodic motion bifurcates from the previously stable steady motion. The sign of a simple criterion, cast in terms of aerodynamic properties, determines whether the bifurcating solution is stable (supercritical) or unstable (subcritical). For the pitching motion of a flap-plate airfoil flying at supersonic/hypersonic speed, and for oscillation of a flap at transonic speed, the bifurcation is subcritical, implying either that exchanges of stability between steady and periodic motion are accompanied by hysteresis phenomena, or that potentially large aperiodic departures from steady motion may develop. On the other hand, for the rolling oscillation of a slender delta wing in subsonic flight (wing rock), the bifurcation is found to be supercritical. This and the predicted amplitude of the bifurcation periodic motion are in good agreement with experiments...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study identifying the response of a 1. 5 MW Wave Dragon to extreme conditions typical of the DanWEC test center. The best strategies allowing for a reduction in the extreme mooring tension have also been investigated, showing that this is possible by increasing the surge natural period of the system. The most efficient strategy in doing this is to provide the mooring system with a large horizontal compliance (typically in the order of 100 s), which shall be therefore assumed as design configuration. If this is not possible, it can also be partly achieved by lowering the floating level to a minimum (survivability mode) and by adopting a negative <b>trim</b> <b>position.</b> The adoption of the design configuration would determine in a 100 -year storm extreme mooring tensions in the order of 0. 9 MN, 65 % lower than the worst case experienced in the worst case configuration. At the same time it would lead to a reduction in the extreme motion response, resulting in heave and pitch oscillation heights of 7 m and 19 ° and surge excursion of 12 m. Future work will numerically identify mooring configurations that could provide the desired compliance...|$|E
40|$|A pitch {{active control}} system (PACS) was {{developed}} and flight tested on a wide body jet transport (L- 1011) with a flying horizontal stabilizer. Two dual channel digital computers and the associated software provide command signals to a dual channel series servo which controls the stabilizer power actuators.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the open-loop stability analysis and an active control strategy for an airbreathing hypersonic vehicle. The 14 -XB, a bidimensional flow airframe {{derived from the}} Brazilian 14 -X Aerospace Hypersonic Vehicle, is adopted as study platform. In order to perform such analyses, a simulation mathematical model of the airframe longitudinal forces and moments is obtained using perfect gas equations, after considering {{the relevance of the}} real gas hypotheses for the expected Mach number range and verifying that the simpler formulation is sufficient. An all-moving horizontal tail is designed in order to enable the aircraft trimming. The horizontal tail design considered simple constraints based on static analysis, and the same gas equations as those used for the airframe study. In order to analyze the aircraft';s dynamic behavior, a Six-Degree-of-Freedom set of equations of motion considering a spherical, rotating Earth is presented in detail, and the necessary conditions to have adequate longitudinal trimming in this scenario are discussed. The open-loop stability of the 14 -XB with the designed horizontal tail is assessed through eigenvalue analysis and numerical flight simulations with the horizontal tail fixed at a <b>trim</b> <b>position.</b> Having observed that the aircraft presents unstable long-term natural modes, an active control strategy is suggested in order to stabilize the vehicle and track a desired flight path angle, assuming that thrust is constant and the control surface is an all-moving horizontal tail.

Optimal gains are calculated using linear quadratic design, along with a gain-scheduling strategy based on simultaneous control design, and the resulting controller presents proper results...|$|E
