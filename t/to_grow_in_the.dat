5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the northeastern United States, the {{population}} of Massachusetts has continued <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past few decades. Massachusetts is the fastest growing state in New England and the 25th fastest growing state in the United States. Population growth was largely due to a relatively high quality of life and a large higher education system in the state.|$|E
5|$|Although widely {{associated}} with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal elements. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released five studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. The band {{is known for}} its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and Cantrell (and later Cantrell and William DuVall). Cantrell started to sing lead on the 1992 acoustic EP Sap, and his role continued <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following albums, making Alice in Chains a two-vocal band.|$|E
5|$|English Freemasonry {{spread to}} France in the 1720s, first as lodges of expatriates and exiled Jacobites, {{and then as}} distinctively French lodges which still follow the ritual of the Moderns. From France and England, Freemasonry spread to most of Continental Europe {{during the course of}} the 18th century. The Grande Loge de France formed under the Grand Mastership of the Duke of Clermont, who {{exercised}} only nominal authority. His successor, the Duke of Orléans, reconstituted the central body as the Grand Orient de France in 1773. Briefly eclipsed during the French Revolution, French Freemasonry continued <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next century.|$|E

5|$|In recent decades, South Dakota {{has been}} {{transformed}} from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since {{the completion of the}} interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate caps on interest rates.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the leaves}} die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten pulling the bulbs {{deeper into the}} ground (contractile roots). The bulbs develop from the inside, pushing the older layers {{outwards}} which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the tunic or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk which will start <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths. The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.|$|E

5|$|With {{improvements}} in communications by rail and via the port, {{the population of}} Odense grew dramatically in the early 20th century. The 1901 census recorded 40,138 people, growing to 47,224 in 1911, 61,969 in 1921 and 87,090 in 1935. During the Second World War, the population passed the 100,000 mark, reaching 103,107 in 1945. It continued <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post war years, with 120,570 recorded in 1955 and 133,384 in 1965; the city reached a population of 139,490 people in 1970, {{a time when it}} was developing as a university city after Odense University was established in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a fairly easy plant <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century Ranulf Higden, a monk in Chester, {{described}} {{some of the}} Roman remains, {{including the}} sewers and tombstones. Antiquarians began to take interest in the remains in the 17th century and interest continued <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, fed by accounts of Roman Chester and discoveries such as an altar to Jupiter Tanarus. Jupiter Tanarus– also Taranis– was the Romanised version of the god Taranis who {{was the equivalent of}} Jupiter the god of thunder. In 1725, William Stukeley recorded the Roman arches of the east gate; they were demolished in 1768. Over the next century, accidental discoveries continued, such as parts of the Roman bath complex outside the fortress which were destroyed by a late-18th-century housing development.|$|E

5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{industrial}} base continued <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-war era partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC. Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its {{plant on the}} Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. 1970 marked {{the completion of the}} final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium. In 1974, with the addition of the fountain {{at the tip of the}} Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed. Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparatively}} {{warm and}} sunny climate allows {{species of plants}} to thrive which do not on the mainland. The limestone soil has low nutrient levels; hence smaller species of wild flowers and grasses are able <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of larger species. Portland sea lavender {{can be found on}} the higher sea cliffs—unique to Portland it is one of the United Kingdom's rarest plants. The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies; over half of the British Isles' 57 butterfly species can be seen on Portland, including varieties that migrate from mainland Europe. Species live on Portland that are rare in the United Kingdom, including the limestone race of the silver-studded blue.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} of local prisons in locations such as castles had been criticised, since John Howard's {{work in the}} 1770s, and pressure for reform continued <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1850s and 1860s. Reform of the legislation surrounding bankruptcy and debt in 1869 largely removed the threat of imprisonment for unpaid debts, {{and in the process}} eliminated the purpose of the debtor's prisons in castles such as St Briavels. Efforts were made to regularise conditions in local prisons but without much success, and these failures led to prison reform in 1877 which nationalised British prisons, including prisons at castles like York. Compensation was paid to the former owners, although in cases such as York where the facilities were considered so poor as to require complete reconstruction, this payment was denied. In the short term this led to a 39% {{reduction in the number of}} prisons in England, including some famous castle prisons such as Norwich; over the coming years, centralisation and changes in prison design led to the closure of most remaining castle prisons.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} {{of two major}} parallel dimensions, like time periods in Chrono Trigger, {{plays a significant role}} in the game. Players must go back and forth between the worlds to recruit party members, obtain items, and advance the plot. Much of the population of either world have counterparts in the other; some party members can even visit their other versions. The player must often search for items or places found exclusively in one world. Events in one dimension sometimes have an impact in another—for instance, cooling scorched ground on an island in one world allows vegetation <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other world. This system assists the presentation of certain themes, including the questioning of the importance of one's past decisions and humanity's role in destroying the environment. Rounding out the notable facets of Chrono Crosss gameplay are the New Game+ option and multiple endings. As in Chrono Trigger, players who have completed the game may choose to start the game over using data from the previous session. Character levels, learned techniques, equipment, and items gathered copy over, while acquired money and some story-related items are discarded. On a New Game+, players can access twelve endings. Scenes viewed depend on players' progress in the game before the final battle, which can be fought at any time in a New Game+ file.|$|E
