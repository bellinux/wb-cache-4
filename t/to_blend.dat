40|$|This chapter {{reports a}} {{collective}} study of research–based evidence of experiences of academic staff adopting ICT-facilitated education and transitioning <b>to</b> <b>blended</b> learning practices in a regional Australian university. It analyses seven dimensions of blended learning environments that these teachers create {{and provides a}} valuable framework for practitioners, researchers and policy makers seeking to understand the transition <b>to</b> <b>blended</b> learning. This chapter examines ways of analysing and defining blended learning environments (BLEs) {{by focusing on the}} scope, nature, and purpose of the blend adopted by individual faculty across their courses. The chapter provides case examples of BLE dimensions and their basis for a professional development model to support staff in their transition <b>to</b> <b>blended</b> learning environments and can be used in successful institutional adoption of blended learning practices...|$|R

5|$|Development of Panzer Dragoon Saga began {{around the}} same time as its predecessor, Panzer Dragoon II Zwei (1996). According to {{director}} Yukio Futatsugi, the need <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> the series' shooting elements into an RPG with full 3D and voice acting, unusual for RPGs at the time, made it the most difficult Panzer Dragoon game to develop. Two staff members died during its two-year development, which Futatsugi attributed to the stressful working conditions of the video game industry.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, {{the policy}} of {{time-based}} development freezes on a two-year cycle was announced. Time-based freezes are intended <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> the predictability of time based releases with Debian's policy of feature based releases, and to reduce overall freeze time. The Squeeze cycle {{was going to be}} especially short; however, this initial schedule was abandoned. In September 2010, the backports service became official, providing more recent versions of some software for the stable release.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} the result of {{numerous}} failed pitches to the network by the creators. Production proved difficult for World Leaders, who were simultaneously working on The Venture Bros. The series premiered on October 25, 2010 on Cartoon Network. The network marketed it to an older demographic, as the channel was attempting <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> its Adult Swim brand with its primary youth demographic. It saw its finale on January 24, 2011 after ten episodes in one season, and is the shortest-running original series on the network that isn't a mini-series.|$|E

A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott bleeds out on the floor, Riddick moves in for the kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E
5|$|Games in {{the series}} have been praised as being among the best modern {{role-playing}} games. Reviewers mostly aimed their praise at particular elements of the games: visual design, and its resemblance to Studio Ghibli's previous work; characters and story, for their believability and complexity; the soundtrack, and Hisaishi's ability to {{capture the essence of}} the game world; and the unique gameplay, particularly for its ability <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> formulas from other role-playing game franchises. The games also won awards from several gaming publications. In March 2014, Bandai Namco reported that the series had sold more than 1.7 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In a final {{gesture of}} love and comprehension, after a {{lifetime}} of despising his father's stories and his father as story-teller, Will finishes the story his father has begun, pulling together the themes, images and characters of his father's storied life <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> reality and fantasy in act of communion and care. By unselfishly releasing the anger he has held about his father's stories, Will gains the understanding that all we are our stories and that his father's stories gave him a reality and substance and a dimension that was as real, genuine, and deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out. Will comes to understand, then, that his father—and the rest of us—are our stories and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts is {{influenced}} by its parent franchise, Final Fantasy, and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, hack and slash system. The main battle party consists of three characters: Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Sora is directly controlled by the player from a third person camera angle. All other party members are computer-controlled, though the player can customize their behavior to an extent through the pause menu. Donald and Goofy comprise the party in most areas, but nearly every level features a character who may replace them. For instance, Jack Skellington can join Sora's party in Halloween Town, but cannot accompany the player elsewhere. In some worlds, the party changes its appearance, has abilities unique to that world or both, can fly in Neverland, acquire aquatic forms in Atlantica which enable them to survive underwater, and gain Halloween costumes in Halloween Town <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> in with the locals.|$|E
5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false bows and sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a very dark gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a very pale gray <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> in with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E
40|$|A {{treatment}} with differential or noncontingent reinforcement and nonremoval of the spoon increased {{the acceptance of}} one or two of 16 foods for 2 participants with severe food refusal. These differential levels of acceptance were demonstrated empirically in an ABAB design in which A was the presentation of the accepted (preferred) foods and B was the presentation of foods the participants refused (nonpreferred foods). Subsequently, we implemented a blending treatment that consisted of mixing (blending) nonpreferred foods into preferred foods in various ratios (e. g., 10 % nonpreferred/ 90 % preferred, 20 % nonpreferred/ 80 % preferred). We then presented nonpreferred foods that had been exposed <b>to</b> <b>blending</b> <b>to</b> determine if consumption of nonpreferred foods would increase following the blending treatment. We also conducted periodic reversals in which we presented nonpreferred foods that had not been exposed <b>to</b> the <b>blending</b> treatment. Following initial implementation of the blending treatment, consumption was high for nonpreferred foods that had been blended and low for nonpreferred foods that had not been blended. Consumption increased for all foods (i. e., foods that had been exposed <b>to</b> <b>blending</b> and foods that had not been exposed <b>to</b> <b>blending)</b> after seven or eight foods had been exposed <b>to</b> the <b>blending</b> treatment. Thus, the variety of foods consumed by the participants increased from one or two to 16. These results are discussed in terms of stimulus fading, conditioned food preferences, and escape extinction.

5|$|Mantises are preyed on by {{vertebrates}} such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders and ants. Generally, mantises {{protect themselves}} by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey. Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened {{so as to}} eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence. The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar. Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt {{towards the end of}} the dry season; at this time of year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> in with the fire-ravaged landscape (fire melanism).|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} are nocturnal {{and hide}} during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use camouflage {{to avoid being}} detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which {{makes it difficult for}} the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.|$|E
5|$|Measure 32 was {{a medium}} pattern of {{obtrusive}} polygons in navy blue or black, against background polygons of lighter grays and greens. This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> with the wake. This measure {{was based on}} the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific; and was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. Different patterns were devised for classes with large numbers of ships so the pattern would not identify the class of ship.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the experiences of}} students transitioning <b>to</b> <b>blended</b> learning in the University of Glasgow {{as part of the}} QAA Enhancement Themes work on Student Transitions. We draw here on exploratory, qualitative research to examine the benefits, challenges and skills developed by students during transitions <b>to</b> <b>blended</b> learning as a means of advancing understanding, and informing future curriculum design. Data from home undergraduate and international postgraduate students were collected over two years through focus groups, individual interviews and end-of-course quality assurance surveys. We found that while home/undergraduate and international/postgraduate students have similar transition experiences, international taught postgraduates encounter additional challenges in terms of acclimatising to UK higher education (HE), especially within shorter programmes of study and where pedagogical and language differences exist. The findings are integrated in a conceptual framework highlighting the importance of access, acculturation (attitudes) and attributes (skills) to enable learner autonomy to engage effectively in blended learning. The findings have implications for institutional infrastructure, curriculum design and learner development. Further research is required to collect a larger data set as a means of developing the study’s conceptual framework, in order to better understand and support diverse student transitions <b>to</b> <b>blended</b> learning...|$|R
