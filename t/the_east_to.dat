5|$|At its height, the Mongolian empire {{stretched}} from Shanhaiguan in <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>to</b> Budapest in the west, from Rus' {{in the north}} to Tibet in the south. This meant that an extremely {{large part of the}} continent was united under one political authority. As a result, the trade routes used by merchants became safe for travel, resulting in an overall growth and expansion of trade from China in <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>to</b> Britain in the west. Thus, the Pax Mongolica greatly influenced many civilizations in Eurasia during the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E
