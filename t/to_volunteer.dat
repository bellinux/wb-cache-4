40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the barriers <b>to</b> <b>volunteering</b> in nonprofit organizations working in Prague 5 in the field of social services. It is a qualitative research that specifically focuses on NGOs and also the state non-profit organization, which are compared in terms of their attitudes <b>to</b> <b>volunteering</b> in general and also in terms of perceived barriers <b>to</b> <b>volunteering.</b> In the analysis of barriers <b>to</b> <b>volunteering</b> is among others searched for the "locally-specific" factors, i. e. factors associated with Prague 5 or capital city Prague, which may affect the attitudes of non-profit organizations towards volunteering.

5|$|During the All Black tour of Australia, in {{the game}} against Metropolitan Union in Sydney on 5 August 1914, the news was posted on the {{scoreboard}} that the British Empire – and therefore New Zealand and Australia – had declared war.

5|$|In late 1913 Burgess {{was sent}} to Tasmania on {{exchange}} with the Australian Military Forces.

40|$|In many Western nations {{government}} policies are directed at increasing levels {{of participation in}} community sport. Recent {{research suggests that the}} sustainability of community sports system is under pressure due <b>to</b> declining <b>volunteer</b> numbers. Volunteers are often players transitioning from playing roles into non-playing roles such as administration and coaching. While a human resource management approach has been adopted <b>to</b> manage <b>volunteers,</b> little is understood in relation to the factors that contribute to players making the transition from playing <b>to</b> <b>volunteering.</b> Using Atchley's continuity theory, we propose a transition-extension framework that examines the psychological and social factors that provide the impetus for the transition <b>to</b> <b>volunteering</b> The framework also examines those factors that contribute <b>to</b> <b>volunteers</b> extending their involvement and may help community sport organisations provide an environment that will nurture volunteers in the transition phase to retain and extend their involvement <b>to</b> become long-term <b>volunteers.</b> Griffith Business School, Department of Tourism, Sport and Hotel ManagementFull Tex...|$|R
50|$|A {{consideration}} is that volunteers may dominate the workplace, undermine local management and work culture especially in small organisations. This is due <b>to</b> <b>volunteers</b> often being considered more highly educated than local staff, {{even if they}} do not have direct experience.

5|$|Born at Great Yarmouth on 9 April 1871, Thomas was {{the third}} son of Major Frank Astley Cubitt and his wife Bertha, {{daughter}} of Captain Thomas Blakiston of the Royal Navy. The family resided at Thorpe Hall in Norwich, with an estate at Fritton, near Great Yarmouth. Major Cubitt came {{from a family of}} rural gentry, and had attended Rugby and Jesus College, Cambridge before entering the British Army in 1853 as an ensign in the 5th Regiment of Foot. He saw service in the Indian Mutiny before returning to England to act as adjutant <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> battalions of the Norfolk Regiment, and retired from the Army in 1889. He later served as a Justice of the Peace and chair of the local district council.|$|E
5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> for {{essential}} war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange {{the comforts of home}} and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Godley {{attended}} Staff College at Camberley but, {{following the}} outbreak of the Boer War in 1899, ended his studies early <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> for service in Africa. Along with other officers of the Special Service Battalion, he helped to raise irregular mounted regiments. Godley was later adjutant to Colonel Robert Baden-Powell and was present during the Siege of Mafeking. He was also chief staff officer to Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Plumer and later commanded the Rhodesian Brigade. In 1900, Godley transferred to the Irish Guards before being appointed to the staff at Aldershot as commander of the Mounted Infantry. Three years later he transferred to Longmoor Military Camp, commanding the Mounted Infantry there until 1906.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, Hart's brother Walter {{travelled}} to South Africa {{for service}} with the Fourth Contingent in the Second Boer War. This inspired Hart <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> for the Eighth New Zealand South African Contingent, but his application was declined. However, he, {{along with another}} brother, George, successfully enlisted for the Ninth Contingent. The minimum age for volunteers was 20 and he falsified his age to enlist. By {{the time he reached}} South Africa in April 1902, the war was effectively over. He was discharged in July 1902 with the rank of lance sergeant but travelled to England instead of returning to New Zealand {{with the rest of the}} contingent.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Waldmann {{applied for}} a career as {{an officer in the}} Luftwaffe for the first time. Travelling to Berlin, he was deemed {{suitable}} but at the age of 16 was too young <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> for military service. After the outbreak of World War II, while still at school, Waldmann and his fellow students were forced into compulsory labour service (Reichsarbeitsdienst). Waldmann was assigned to the Brunswick Mechanical Engineering Institute. Since Waldmann had intended to study aircraft construction after his military service, he was reassigned to the Institute of Aeronautical Metrology and Flight Meteorology at the Braunschweig-Waggum airfield under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Heinrich Koppe.|$|E
5|$|In Halifax he {{was sent}} to Wellington Barracks, the city's peacetime barracks, where he {{wrestled}} freight onto large army vehicles and dug ditches. Tired of the work, Babcock took the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> for the Royal Canadian Regiment when fifty recruits were called on, claiming that his age was 18. Officials quickly discovered that he was only 16, however, and they placed him in a reserve battalion known as the Boys (or Young Soldiers) Battalion in August 1917. Babcock then undertook an ocean voyage to England and, in Liverpool, he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to Bexhill-on-Sea where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of whom were veterans from battles in France.|$|E

5|$|Josephine Ledesma, from Austin, Texas, was 24 {{when the}} war broke out and worked as an {{airplane}} mechanic from 1942 to 1944. When her husband, Alfred, was drafted she decided <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> to work as an airplane mechanic. Even though the army waived her husband's duty, she was sent to train at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, where {{she was the only}} Mexican-American woman on the base. After her training, she was sent to Bergstrom Air Field. There were two other women, both non-Hispanic, at Bergstrom Air Field, and several more in Big Spring, all working in the sheet metal department. At Big Spring, she was the only woman working in the hangar. She worked as a mechanic between from 1942 to 1944.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery's troops liberated Tailly, {{allowing}} Leclerc {{to return}} home to see Thérèse and the children again on 6 September 1944. His oldest sons, Henri and Hubert, now 18 and 17 years old respectively, lied about their ages <b>to</b> <b>volunteer</b> for service with 2e DB. Henri went on to serve with the RMT, while Hubert became a Sherman tank gunner with the 12e RCA. Other relatives also served with the division, including two nephews. The fighting in Paris cost 2e DB 97 killed and 238 wounded; nearly twice that number {{were lost in the}} fighting in surrounding areas. These were replaced by men and women who, like Leclerc's sons, offered themselves at a recruitment office the 2e DB established near the Bois de Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-year-old Crawford {{had been}} {{reluctant}} <b>to</b> <b>volunteer,</b> {{but he did}} so {{at the request of}} General Irvine. Williamson, although popular with the militia, was in disfavor with regular army officers such as Irvine because he had allowed the Gnadenhütten massacre. Hoping to avoid a repetition, Irvine made it known that he favored Crawford's election as commander. The election, which was acrimonious, ended in a close vote: Crawford received 235 votes to Williamson's 230. Colonel Crawford took command, and Williamson became second-in-command with the rank of major. The other majors included John B. McClelland, Thomas Gaddis, and either James Brenton or Joseph Brinton.|$|E

They became responsible for the training of recruits and provision of drafts for overseas service. The 2/10th, raised and organised by Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Adam Fairrie, was committed to the Western Front in 1917.
