After a 2–1 defeat to Croatia in a Euro 1996 qualifying match in November, their relationship hit <b>the</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>point,</b> and Baggio, supported by his teammates, {{asked for the}} manager's dismissal. Due to his disagreements with Sacchi, Baggio was called up to the national team less frequently, only making one more substitute appearance in a 1–0 home win against Slovenia in a Euro 1996 qualifier in September 1995. He eventually lost his spot in the squad, missing out on Italy's Euro 1996 squad, despite winning the Scudetto that year with Milan. Sacchi justified his decision by stating Baggio was not fully fit, and that Enrico Chiesa helped the team more when possession was lost. Italy were eliminated in the group stage of the competition.

As part of The Legacy, DiBiase entered the Royal Rumble match {{in order to help}} Orton win, and lasted until the final four, before being eliminated by Triple H. Rhodes and DiBiase became involved in Orton's scripted rivalry with the McMahon family, helping him to attack Shane and Stephanie McMahon, and Stephanie's real-life husband, Triple H. DiBiase was also elevated to main event status as a result of joining The Legacy, competing in handicap and six-man tag team matches, as well as the occasional singles match against Orton's opponents and rivals. On April 26, at the Backlash pay-per-view, DiBiase, Rhodes, and Orton defeated Triple H, Batista, and Shane McMahon in a six-man tag team match, which, per the pre-match stipulation, resulted in Orton winning the WWE Championship. During WWE's tour of Australia in early July, DiBiase suffered an arm injury, but did not miss any time because of it. Throughout mid-2009, DiBiase and Rhodes continued to compete against and attack Orton's rivals, particularly Triple H, preventing him from earning a match for Orton's championship.

5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. <b>The</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>point</b> is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Dickey and Fuller {{proposed}} the tests for unit root hypotheses in a uni-variate time series. Perron [1989] extended the t-ratio type unit-root tests {{so that they}} allow for a <b>break</b> in <b>the</b> deterministic trend and / or in the intercept term. In practice, it seems difficult to specify <b>the</b> <b>break</b> <b>point</b> correctly. Zivot and Andrews [1992] proposed a test in which <b>the</b> <b>break</b> <b>point</b> is statistically determined. Morimune and Nakagawa [1999] studied {{the effect of a}} miss specified <b>break</b> <b>point</b> on <b>the</b> Perron tests, and the accuracy of the asymptotic expression is examined under various specifications of the error. This paper proposes to set an interval that possibly covers a <b>break</b> <b>point</b> in <b>the</b> Perron tests. This helps to avoid miss specifying <b>the</b> <b>break</b> <b>point,</b> and <b>the</b> unit root test is less susceptible to the choice of a particular <b>break</b> <b>point.</b> Furthermore, an orthogonal decomposition of the F-ratio type test is proposed to find the correlation between the first difference of the series and the trend.
