40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> for Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Chapter Two is divided in ten parts. Part One defines the beginning of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Two looks at the extension of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three deals with the interruption of time [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{assessed}} whether undergraduate electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers {{would be more}} apt to set a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and spend less time gambling when asked to consider setting an explicit <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> prior to their gambling session. To this end, participants (N ¼ 43) {{were randomly assigned to}} a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition or control condition, both of which involved gambling on an EGM in a virtual reality (VR) casino. In the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants were asked (via pop-up message) to consider setting a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on play and entering that limit in an available text box prior to commencing play. In the no <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants engaged in play immediately upon accessing the EGM in the VR casino (i. e. they were not exposed to a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up message). As predicted, participants who were explicitly asked to consider setting a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on their EGM play were signiﬁcantly more likely to do so and spent less time gambling than those who were not given such instructions.

Arizona and Indiana imposed benefit-reduction <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> in which only the adult's portion of the welfare grant was canceled at the <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> Vermont imposed a work-trigger model in which recipients who reach the limit must work but benefits are not reduced or canceled. Five issues were related to program implementation: deciding on phase-in strategies, conveying the time-limit message, tracking the clock, determining when exemptions apply, and handling cases that reach the <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> Early findings on whether <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> make a difference were as follows: Florida and Vermont {{found no evidence that}} <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> reduced the number of applicants who went on to receive benefits; all four programs for which employment data wer...|$|R

40|$|A {{consensus}} {{has formed}} in the welfare reform literature suggesting that welfare eligible households (WEH) “bank ” benefits {{in the presence of}} <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> either by delaying enrollment in welfare or exiting well before the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> is reached. In this study, we use the standard labor-leisure lifetime utility to analyze the behavioral effects of imposing <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> on welfare use. Our approach is different from our predecessors (which model welfare participation) in that we model delayed enrollment in and early exit from welfare. Our results suggest that prior to <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> WEH enroll in welfare as soon as eligibility is established and remain on assistance programs until their youngest children reach adulthood. Moreover, <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> do not alter this behavior in WEH with older children. As such, being “forward looking ” in an era of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> is not a sufficient condition for banking welfare benefits...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of differing <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> {{and the level of}} {{language}} proficiency on the written recalls of 66 Japanese EFL undergraduates. Results showed that different <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> affected total recall, but not main ideas recalled. Regardless of proficiency level, the 20 -minute group (Group 2) recalled a greater number of idea units than the 8 -minute group (Group 1). However, no significant difference was found between Groups 1 and 2 regarding the recall of main ideas, although a longer time period of reading was given for Group 2. Furthermore, irrespective of differences in <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> the high-proficiency students recalled the overall text and main ideas of paragraphs better than the lowproficiency students. However, the lack of interaction between <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and proficiency level in terms of total recall, and the recall of main ideas as well as paragraph recall indicated that differing <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> did not affect the differences between the high- and low-proficiency students in the following: 1) the total number of idea units recalled; 2) the recall of main ideas; and 3) paragraph recall. Moreover, the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> x paragraph interaction was not significant, indicating that differences in paragraph recall were not affected by different <b>time</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R
