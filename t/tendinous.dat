5|$|Possible {{homologous}} {{structures in}} other {{species have been}} identified as the dorsoepitrochlearis muscle, the pectoralis quartus muscle or the panniculus carnosus. The dorsoepitrochlearis is an important climbing muscle in monkeys and apes where it has its origin in the <b>tendinous</b> region of the latissimus dorsi and extends down the arm as a superficial muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} musculature of the kakapo is also {{modified by}} flightlessness. The pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles are greatly reduced. The propatagialis tendo longus has no distinct muscle belly. The sternocoracoideus is <b>tendinous.</b> There is an extensive cucularis capitis clavicularis muscle that {{is associated with}} the large crop.|$|E
5|$|The shape, size, {{insertion}} and {{origin of}} the arch can vary widely. The arch usually occurs {{on both sides of}} the body; but may also occur only on one side. The muscular component of the arch varies, with some arches seen to be purely fibrous. The origin can be a direct continuation of the latissimus dorsi muscle fibres, originate with the <b>tendinous</b> element of the latissimus dorsi, or be a mixture of the two types originating from both the muscle and the tendon.|$|E
25|$|The sternal head is a round fasciculus, <b>tendinous</b> in front, fleshy behind, {{arising from}} {{the upper part of}} the front of the manubrium sterni. It travels superiorly, laterally, and posteriorly.|$|E
25|$|The {{front of}} the scapula (also known as the costal or ventral surface) has a broad {{concavity}} called the subscapular fossa, to which the subscapularis muscle attaches. The medial two-thirds of the fossa have 3 longitudinal oblique ridges, and another thick ridge adjoins the lateral border; they run outward and upward. The ridges give attachment to the <b>tendinous</b> insertions, and the surfaces between them to the fleshy fibers, of the subscapularis muscle. The lateral third of the fossa is smooth and covered by the fibers of this muscle.|$|E
25|$|The lateral {{approach}} is also commonly used for hip replacement. The approach requires {{elevation of the}} hip abductors (gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) to access the joint. The abductors may be lifted up by osteotomy of the greater trochanter and reapplying it afterwards using wires (as per Charnley), or may be divided at their <b>tendinous</b> portion, or through the functional tendon (as per Hardinge) and repaired using sutures. Although this approach has a lower dislocation risk than the posterior approach, critics note that occasionally the abductor muscles do not heal back on, leading to pain and weakness which is often very difficult to treat.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferior}} vena cava {{passes through}} the caval opening, a quadrilateral opening at the junction of the right and middle leaflets of the central tendon, so that its margins are <b>tendinous.</b> Surrounded by tendons, the opening is stretched open every time inspiration occurs. However, there has been argument that the caval opening actually constricts during inspiration. Since thoracic pressure decreases upon inspiration and draws the caval blood upwards toward the right atrium, increasing {{the size of the}} opening allows more blood to return to the heart, maximizing the efficacy of lowered thoracic pressure returning blood to the heart. The aorta does not pierce the diaphragm but rather passes behind it in between the left and right crus.|$|E
25|$|Diaphragmatic hernias {{are rare}} in horses, {{accounting}} for 0.3% of colics. Usually the small intestine herniates through a rent in the diaphragm, although {{any part of}} the bowel may be involved. Hernias are most commonly acquired, not congenital, with 48% of horses having a history of recent trauma, usually through during parturition, distention of the abdomen, a fall, or strenuous exercise, or direct trauma to the chest. Congenital hernias occur most commonly in the most ventral part of the diaphragm, while acquired hernias are usually seen at the junction of the muscular and <b>tendinous</b> sections of the diaphragm. Clinical signs usually are similar to an obstruction, but occasionally decreased lung sounds may be heard in one section of the chest, although dyspnea is only seen in approximately 18% of horses. Ultrasound and radiography may both be used to diagnose diaphragmatic herniation.|$|E
25|$|The opponens digiti minimi {{originates}} {{from the}} long plantar ligament and the plantar <b>tendinous</b> sheath of peroneus longus and is inserted on the fifth metatarsal. When present, it acts to plantar flex the fifth digit and supports the plantar arch. The flexor digiti minimi arises from the region of base of the fifth metatarsal and is inserted onto {{the base of the}} first phalanx of the fifth digit where it is usually merged with the abductor of the first digit. It acts to plantar flex the last digit. The largest and longest muscles of the little toe is the abductor digiti minimi. Stretching from the lateral process of the calcaneus, with a second attachment on the base of the fifth metatarsal, {{to the base of the}} fifth digit's first phalanx, the muscle forms the lateral edge of the sole. Except for supporting the arch, it plantar flexes the little toe and also acts as an abductor.|$|E
500|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle of the duodenum {{was first}} named in 1853 by Václav Treitz, as the [...] (in Latin), and described as {{consisting of a}} lower muscular portion with a broad base, and an upper <b>tendinous</b> portion blending with connective tissue around {{the origins of the}} superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries. It is commonly termed the ligament of Treitz by clinicians and as the suspensory muscle of the duodenum by anatomists. It has also been likened to [...] "a polar ice cap... a structure that many refer to but few have seen." ...|$|E
500|$|Remiges (from the Latin for [...] "oarsman") {{are located}} on the {{posterior}} side of the wing. Ligaments attach the long calami (quills) firmly to the wing bones, and a thick, strong band of <b>tendinous</b> tissue known as the postpatagium helps to hold and support the remiges in place. [...] Corresponding remiges on individual birds are symmetrical between the two wings, matching {{to a large extent}} in size and shape (except in the case of mutation or damage), though not necessarily in pattern. [...] They are given different names depending on their position along the wing.|$|E
500|$|Singular: remex. Also defined herewith: postpatagium. From the Latin for [...] "oarsman", {{they are}} the long, stiff, asymmetrically shaped, but symmetrically paired pennaceous {{feathers}} {{on the wings of}} a bird. They are located on the posterior side of the wing. Ligaments attach the long calami firmly to the wing bones, and a thick, strong band of <b>tendinous</b> tissue known as the postpatagium helps to hold and support the remiges in place.

2500|$|Chronic rheumatic {{heart disease}} (RHD) is {{characterized}} by repeated inflammation with fibrinous repair. [...] The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion, and shortening and thickening of the <b>tendinous</b> cords. It is caused by an autoimmune reaction to Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) that results in valvular damage. Fibrosis and scarring of valve leaflets, commissures and cusps leads to abnormalities that can result in valve stenosis or regurgitation. The inflammation caused by rheumatic fever, usually during childhood, {{is referred to as}} rheumatic valvulitis. About half of patients with rheumatic fever develop inflammation involving valvular endothelium. The majority of morbidity and mortality associated with rheumatic fever is caused by its destructive effects on cardiac valve tissue. The pathogenesis of RHD is complex and not fully understood, but it is known to involve molecular mimicry and genetic predisposition that lead to autoimmune reactions.|$|E
2500|$|The four lumbricales {{have their}} origin on the tendons of the flexor digitorum longus, {{from where they}} extend to the medial side of the bases of the first phalanx of digits two-five. Except for {{reinforcing}} the plantar arch, they contribute to plantar flexion and move the four digits toward the big toe. They are, {{in contrast to the}} lumbricales of the hand, rather variable, sometimes absent and sometimes more than four are present. The quadratus plantae arises with two slips from margins of the plantar surface of the calcaneus and is inserted into the tendon(s) of the flexor digitorum longus, and is known as the [...] "plantar head" [...] of this latter muscle. The three plantar interossei arise with their single heads on the medial side of the third-fifth metatarsals and are inserted on the bases of the first phalanges of these digits. The two heads of the four dorsal interossei arise on two adjacent metatarsals and merge in the intermediary spaces. Their distal attachment is on the bases of the proximal phalanges of the second-fourth digits. The interossei are organized with the second digit as a longitudinal axis; the plantars act as adductors and pull digits 3-5 towards the second digit; while the dorsals act as abductors. Additionally, the interossei act as plantar flexors at the metatarsophalangeal joints. Lastly, the flexor digitorum brevis arises from underneath the calcaneus to insert its tendons on the middle phalanges of digit 2-4. Because the tendons of the flexor digitorum longus run between these tendons, the brevis is sometimes called perforatus. The tendons of these two muscles are surrounded by a <b>tendinous</b> sheath. The brevis acts to plantar flex the middle phalanges.|$|E

60|$|But as if {{this vast}} local power in the <b>tendinous</b> tail were not enough, the whole bulk of the {{leviathan}} is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute to their might; {{so that in the}} tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.|$|E
60|$|Nippers. Strictly {{this word}} is not {{indigenous}} to the whale's vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman's nipper {{is a short}} firm strip of <b>tendinous</b> stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan's tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, {{is about the size}} of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.|$|E
60|$|Regarding the Sperm Whale's head as a solid oblong, you may, on an {{inclined}} plane, sideways {{divide it}} into two quoins,* whereof the lower is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, {{and the upper}} an unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At {{the middle of the}} forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick <b>tendinous</b> substance.|$|E
6000|$|Three {{principal}} sets of muscles, called [...] "flexors," [...] {{bend the}} fingers and thumb, as in clenching the fist, and three sets--the extensors--extend them, as in straightening the fingers. These muscles are all [...] "long muscles"; {{that is to}} say, the fleshy part of each, lying in and being fixed to {{the bones of the}} arm, is, at the other end, continued into tendons, or rounded cords, which pass into the hand, and are ultimately fixed to the bones which are to be moved. Thus, when the fingers are bent, the fleshy parts of the flexors of the fingers, placed in the arm, contract, in virtue of their peculiar endowment as muscles; and pulling the <b>tendinous</b> cords, connected with their ends, cause them to pull down the bones of the fingers towards the palm.|$|E
60|$|But, peradventure, {{it may be}} sagaciously urged, how is this? We {{thought the}} tissued, {{infiltrated}} head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense <b>tendinous</b> wall of the well--a double welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by {{the other parts of}} the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.|$|E

60|$|In July {{they set}} sail again for Monte Video, where the {{important}} question of climate and vegetation began to interest young Darwin's mind. Uruguay is almost entirely treeless; and this curious phenomenon, in a comparatively moist sub-tropical plain-land, struck him as a remarkable anomaly, and set him speculating on its probable cause. Australia, he remembered, was far more arid, and yet its interior was everywhere covered by whole forests of quaint indigenous gum-trees. Could it be {{that there were no}} trees adapted to the climate? As yet, the true causes of geographical distribution had not clearly dawned upon Darwin's mind; but that a young man of twenty-three should seriously busy himself about such problems of ultimate causation at all is in itself a sufficiently pointed and remarkable phenomenon. It was here, too, that he first saw that curious animal, the Tucutuco, a true rodent with the habits of a mole, which is almost always found in a blind condition. With reference to this singular creature, there occurs in his journal one of those interesting anticipatory passages which show the rough workings of the distinctive evolutionary Darwinian concept in its earlier stages. 'Considering the strictly subterranean habits of the Tucutuco,' he writes, 'the blindness, though so common, cannot be a very serious evil; yet it appears strange that any animal should possess an organ frequently subject to be injured. Lamarck would have been delighted with this fact, had he known it, when speculating (probably with more truth than usual with him) on the gradually acquired blindness of the Aspalax, a gnawer living under the ground, and of the Proteus, a reptile living in dark caverns filled with water; in both of which animals the eye is in an almost rudimentary state, and is covered by a <b>tendinous</b> membrane and skin. In the common mole the eye is extraordinarily small but perfect, though many anatomists doubt whether it is connected with the true optic nerve; its vision must certainly be imperfect, though probably useful to the animal when it leaves its burrow. In the Tucutuco, which I believe never comes {{to the surface of the}} ground, the eye is rather larger, but often rendered blind and useless, though without apparently causing any inconvenience to the animal: no doubt Lamarck would have said that the Tucutuco is now passing into the state of the Aspalax and Proteus.' The passage is instructive both as showing that Darwin was already familiar with Lamarck's writings, and as pointing out the natural course of his own future development.|$|E
