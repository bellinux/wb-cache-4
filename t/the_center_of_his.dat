However, Dagran kills Zangurak's arm so he can use the Arganan blood and Outsider half on it for himself.

Finding he is still not powerful enough to defeat the group, Dagran tries to absorb the Lazulis half of the Outsider into <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body, giving Zael an opening to kill him. Dagran reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell.

Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael's care, Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home, the mercenaries hold a funeral for Dagran, and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista.|$|E
