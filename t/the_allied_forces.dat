5|$|The Japanese army {{advanced}} swiftly southward {{through the}} Malay Peninsula, crushing or bypassing Allied resistance. <b>The</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> {{did not have}} tanks, which they considered unsuitable in the tropical rainforest, and their infantry proved powerless against the Japanese light tanks. As their resistance failed against the Japanese advance, <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> were forced to retreat southwards towards Singapore. By 31 January 1942, a mere 55 days {{after the start of}} the invasion, the Japanese had conquered the entire Malay Peninsula and were poised to attack Singapore.|$|E

5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,000 Royalist {{soldiers}} had been killed, {{many in the}} last stand of the whitecoats, and 1,500 captured, including Lucas and Tillier.

5|$|In March 2005, British Foreign and Commonwealth Office historians issued The Cicero Papers, an {{analysis}} of the potential consequences of the 'Cicero Affair'.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>Force</b> bar was {{presented}} to pilots and crew of what was then called the Canadian Forces Air Command (now the Royal Canadian Air Force) who flew a minimum of five sorties over Kosovo and other territories, including Albania and the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, {{as well as the}} Adriatic and Ionian Seas, during Operation <b>Allied</b> <b>Force,</b> between 24 March and 10 June 1999.

50|$|When {{the western}} forces of Han Sui, Ma Teng and Liu Yan formed an {{alliance}} {{to challenge the}} Han court controlled by the four, Li sent out his nephew Li Li (李利), Guo, and Fan to counter <b>the</b> <b>allied</b> <b>force.</b> <b>The</b> <b>allied</b> <b>force</b> was dealt a major defeat with a casualty up to ten thousand about 13 miles west to Chang'an. Knowing <b>the</b> <b>allied</b> <b>force</b> was low on grain, Li Li asked Fan to pursuit and wipe the enemy out, but was refused by the former because of his friendship with Han. This incident was reported by Li Li to Li Jue upon the army's return, and Li Jue assembled the officers in a banquet, whereins he had Fan openly executed, causing the Liang generals to distrust Li Jue.|$|R

5|$|Napoleon {{was hoping}} that <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> would attack, and to {{encourage}} them, he deliberately weakened his right flank. On 28 November Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters, who informed him of their qualms about the forthcoming battle. He shrugged off their suggestion of retreat.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> at Kranji {{were to be}} {{assaulted}} by the Imperial Guards Division led by Major General Takuma Nishimura. 400 Imperial Guards had landed and taken Pulau Ubin, {{an island in the}} north-east of Singapore, in a feint attack on 7 February, where they encountered minimal resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} successful. Many of the Allied officers, {{including}} the Tsar's aides and the Austrian Chief of Staff Franz von Weyrother, strongly supported an immediate attack {{and appeared to}} sway Tsar Alexander. Kutuzov's plan to retreat further to the Carpathian region was rejected, and <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> soon fell into Napoleon's trap.|$|E

5|$|The {{victory at}} Bardia enabled <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> to {{continue}} the advance into Libya and ultimately capture almost all of Cyrenaica. In turn this would lead to German intervention in the fighting in North Africa, changing {{the nature of the}} war in that theatre.|$|E
5|$|There is {{consensus}} among military historians that the Battle at Sedan sealed {{the fate of}} Belgium and France. On 14 May, <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> had been wrongfooted and through the failures in deployment had effectively lost the campaign. The advance to the Channel would trap 1,700,000 soldiers and expel the Allies from Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|After {{retreating}} into Arcadia {{and receiving}} {{news of his}} wife's death, Cleomenes returned to Sparta. This left Antigonus free to advance through Arcadia and on the towns that Cleomenes had fortified, including Athenaeum—which he gave to Megalopolis. He continued to Aegium, where the Achaeans were holding their council. He gave a report on his operations and was made chief-in-command of all <b>the</b> <b>allied</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
50|$|The British portion {{under the}} command of Major General John Griffin of <b>the</b> <b>allied</b> <b>force</b> is stated to be at least four battalions of foot; {{including}}: Hodgson's 5th, Cornwallis' 24th, Carr's 50th, Brudenell's 51st; five squadron's of horse including three of Bland's Dragoons and 2 of Howard's; and a brigade of 18 pieces of artillery under Captain Charlton.

The volunteers never saw action, as <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>Forces</b> signed an armistice with Germany during the same year, essentially ending the war.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to later}} {{internal}} struggle within the ruling family for power, however, the political influence of Vangteh {{began to decline}} from the early 19th century as had to surrender most of its tributary territories before <b>the</b> invading <b>allied</b> <b>force</b> of <b>the</b> Pois (Pawi) {{beginning in the early}} mid nineteenth century. According to <b>the</b> traditions, this <b>allied</b> <b>force</b> included <b>the</b> Zahau army, the Sizang (Liimkhai) army, and probably the Tlaisun army, in which the Sukte family served as guide to them in a secret attempt to replace the sovereignty of the Guite family in the region. Of course, after three heavy confrontations, ill-prepared Vangteh because of their Sialsawm festival of the biggest festivals that usually taken place during April in present calendar agreed to negotiate and surrender almost all of its tributary territories to <b>the</b> <b>allied</b> <b>force.</b> Since that time, it was seemed that the former tributary lands of the Guite family of Vangteh were turned to <b>the</b> <b>allied</b> <b>force</b> of <b>the</b> Pois through the indirect hand of the Sukte family of Mualbeam.|$|R
50|$|Major General Charles Colville {{arrived with}} <b>allied</b> {{reinforcements}} (<b>the</b> British 77th Foot, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Broomhead, and 21st Portuguese regiment commanded by Colonel Bacellar), and took command for <b>the</b> <b>allied</b> <b>force.</b> This force, now of about 1,500 men, maintained the post for three hours, although frequently charged by French cavalry, and exposed to heavy {{fire from the}} guns of a division of infantry in reserve. The position was eventually abandoned when the French infantry moved forward, and <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> were <b>forced</b> to retire. As the ground over which <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> retreated was very favourable for cavalry, <b>the</b> <b>allies</b> were <b>forced</b> retired in squares of regiments, and were repeatedly charged, but the French were unable to break into them.|$|R

5|$|Following the armistice, the Australian Mounted Division {{went into}} camp at Tripoli while the Anzac Mounted Division, having borne {{the brunt of}} the entire campaign, {{suffered}} heavily from malaria and influenza in the Jordan Valley. Australia's role in the Sinai and Palestine campaign was later acknowledged by Field Marshal Edmund Allenby, who had been commander-in-chief of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> in the Middle East, as having been considerable. Total Australian battle casualties in the campaign were 4,851, including 1,374 dead.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi opposed {{providing}} {{any help}} to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in the World War II. Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of Indian masses and many Indian leaders such as Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad. His campaign was a failure. Over 2.5million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of <b>the</b> <b>allied</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
