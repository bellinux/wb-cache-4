40|$|AbstractThis article {{describes}} the effects of some factors on the tip clearance flow in axial linear turbine cascades. The measurements of the total pressure loss coefficient are made at the cascade outlets by using a five-hole probe at exit Mach numbers of 0. 10, 0. 14 and 0. 19. At each exit Mach number, experiments are performed at the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>heights</b> of 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, 2. 0 %, 2. 5 % and 3. 0 % of the blade height. The effects of the non-uniform <b>tip</b> clearance <b>height</b> of each blade in the pitchwise direction are also studied. The results show that at a given <b>tip</b> clearance <b>height,</b> generally, total pressure loss rises with exit Mach numbers proportionally. At a fixed exit Mach number, the total pressure loss augments nearly proportionally as the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>height</b> increases. The increased <b>tip</b> clearance <b>heights</b> in the <b>tip</b> regions of two adjacent blades are to be blame for the larger clearance loss of the center blade. Compared {{to the effects of}} the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>height,</b> the effects of the exit Mach number and the pitchwise variation of the <b>tip</b> clearance <b>height</b> on the cascade total pressure loss are so less significant to be omitted...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{magnetic}} nanostructures {{is of great}} interest due to their potential applications in ultrahigh density storage and logic function [1] Anodization processes to achieve self-ordered nanopores in membrane have been {{proven to be a}} direct, simple, nonexpensive technique to fabricate templates for highly ordered densely packed arrays of magnetic nanowires. [2] Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) imaging is a very powerful technique to locally study the magnetic state of nanostructures. In this work, we have used the MFM to characterize the magnetization of chemically synthesized nickel nanowire of diameter between 100 nm and 200 nm, which allow imaging with the spatial resolution of 10 - 100 nm. [3]. In MFM, the magnetic contrast is obtained through detecting the force gradient between a ferromagnetic tip and the magnetic sample by amplitude, phase or frequency detection techniques. In this work we have used LiftMode [4] with phase detection technique to obtain magnetic imaging at different <b>tip</b> <b>height</b> ranging from 25 nm to 100 nm [Fig 1]. We have found that magnetic contrast of these nanowires changes with <b>tip</b> <b>height.</b> Phase shift vs different <b>tip</b> <b>height</b> graphs for different distances in the nanowire are also obtained [Fig 2].

At different <b>tip</b> <b>heights,</b> we found quantitatively different LCPD contrasts that characterize different properties of the molecule. In the small distance regime, the tip penetrates the electron density of the molecule, and the contrast {{is related to the}} size and topography of the electron shell of the molecule. For larger distances, the LCPD contrast corresponds to the electrostatic field above the molecule. However, in the medium-distance regime, that is, for <b>tip</b> <b>heights</b> similar {{to the size of the}} molecule, the nonspherical distribution of π- and σ-electrons often conceals the effect of the partial charges within the molecule. Only for large distances does the LCPD map converge toward the simple field of a dipole for a polar molecule...|$|R

40|$|The atomic force {{microscope}} {{can provide}} information on the atomic-level frictional properties of surfaces, but reproducible quantitative measurements are difficult to obtain. Parameters that are either unknown or difficult to precisely measure include the normal and lateral cantilever force constants (particularly with microfabricated cantilevers), the <b>tip</b> <b>height,</b> the deflection sensor response, and the tip structure and composition at the tip-surface contact. We present an in situ experimental procedure to determine the response of a cantilever to lateral forces {{in terms of its}} normal force response. This procedure is quite general. It will work with any type of deflection sensor and does not require the knowledge or direct measurement of the lever dimensions or the <b>tip</b> <b>height.</b> In addition, the shape of the tip apex can be determined. We also discuss a number of specific issues related to force and friction measurements using optical lever deflection sensing. We present experimental results on the lateral force response of commercially available V-shaped cantilevers.

5000|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope is used {{to obtain}} [...] "topographs" [...] - topographic maps - of surfaces.

40|$|Scanning-tunneling {{spectroscopy}} expts. {{performed on}} conjugated polymer films are compared with three-dimensional numerical model calcns. for charge injection and transport. It is {{found that if}} a sufficiently sharp tip is used, the field enhancement near the tip apex leads to {{a significant increase in}} the injected current, which can amt. to more than an order of magnitude and can even change the polarity of the predominant charge carrier. We show that when charge injection from the tip into the org. material predominates, it is possible to probe the electronic properties of the interface between the org. material and a metallic electrode directly by means of <b>tip</b> <b>height</b> vs. bias voltage measurements. Thus, one can det. the alignment of the MO energy levels at the buried interface, as well as the single-particle band gap of the org. material. By comparing the single-particle energy gap and the optical absorption threshold, it is possible to obtain an est. of the exciton binding energy. In addn., our calcns. show that by using a one-dimensional model, reasonable parameters can only be extd. from z-V and I-V curves if the tip apex radius is much larger than the <b>tip</b> <b>height.</b> In all other cases, the full three-dimensional problem needs to be considered...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of iron-based superconductors, a number of theories have been put forward to explain the qualitative origin of pairing, {{but there have been}} few attempts to make quantitative, material-specific comparisons to experimental results. The spin-fluctuation theory of electronic pairing, based on first principles electronic structure calculations, makes predictions for the superconducting gap. Within the same framework, the surface wavefunctions may also be calculated, allowing e. g. for detailed comparisons between theoretical results and measured scanning tunneling topographs and spectra. Here we present such a comparison between theory and experiment on the Fe-based superconductor LiFeAs. Results for the homogeneous surface as well as impurity states are presented as a benchmark test of the theory. For the homogeneous system, we show that and why the maxima of topographic image intensity may be located at positions above either the As or Li atoms, depending on <b>tip</b> <b>height</b> and the setpoint current of the measurement. We further report the experimental observation of transitions between As and Li-registered lattices as functions of both <b>tip</b> <b>height</b> and setpoint bias, in agreement with this prediction.

40|$|Transtibial stump volume {{can change}} {{dramatically}} postoperatively and jeopardise prosthetic fitting. Differences between individuals {{make it hard}} to give general recommendations of when to fit with a definitive prosthesis. Measuring the stump volume on every patient could solve this, but most methods for volume assessments are too complicated for clinical use. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate accuracy and intra- and interrater precision of a method to estimate stump volume from circumferential measurements. The method approximates the stump as a number of cut cones and the tip as a sphere segment. Accuracy was evaluated theoretically on six scanned stump models in CAPOD software and manually on six stump models. Precision was evaluated by comparing measurements made by four CPOs on eight stumps. Measuring devices were a wooden rule and a metal circumference rule. The errors were estimated with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), where 0, 85 was considered acceptable, and a clinical criterion that a volume error of ± 5 % was acceptable (5 % corresponds to one stocking). The method was accurate on all models in theory but accurate on only four models in reality. The ICC was 0, 95 - 1, 00 for intrarater precision but only 0, 76 for interrater precision. Intra- and interrater precision was unsatisfying when using clinical criteria. Variations between estimated <b>tip</b> <b>heights</b> and circumferences were causing the errors. The method needs to be developed and is not suitable for stumps with narrow ends. Using a longer rule (about 30 cm) with a set square end to assess <b>tip</b> <b>heights</b> is recommended to improve precision.
