5|$|Some {{scholars}} theorise {{that the}} galactic tide {{may have contributed}} to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest distances to the Sun) of planetesimals with large aphelia (largest distances to the Sun). The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect can be quite significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide. Statistical models of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> measured using a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm surge {{is defined as the}} rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is measured using tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E

25|$|There was a tidemill. When the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> rising, water {{flowed into}} the mill pond driving a mill, when the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> falling, water flowed {{back into the}} river, driving the mill.|$|R
50|$|Atmospheric <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> also {{produced}} through the gravitational {{effects of the}} Moon. Lunar (gravitational) <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> much weaker than solar (thermal) <b>tides</b> and <b>are</b> generated by {{the motion of the}} Earth's oceans (caused by the Moon) {{and to a lesser extent}} the effect of the Moon's gravitational attraction on the atmosphere.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the comets}} seen {{close to the}} Sun seem to have reached their current {{positions}} through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's tidal force deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to {{the gravity of the}} Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis directed toward the galactic centre and compress it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun. The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.|$|E

25|$|The {{narrow and}} shallow river {{estuaries}} around the upper Bay of Fundy regularly produce bores when the advancing <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> slowed by shallow waters creating a build-up with a steep surge of advancing water.

25|$|In Saint John {{the height}} {{difference}} from low to high <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> approximately 8 metres (28ft) {{due to the}} funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides {{one example of the}} power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge {{in the middle of the}} city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.|$|E

25|$|For {{specific}} surf spots, {{the state}} of the ocean tide can {{play a significant role in}} the quality of waves or hazards of surfing there. Tidal variations vary greatly among the various global surfing regions, and the effect the tide has on specific spots can vary greatly among the spots within each area. Locations such as Bali, Panama, and Ireland experience 2-3 meter tide fluctuations, whereas in Hawaii the difference between high and low <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> typically less than one meter.|$|E
25|$|In {{coastal areas}} because the ocean <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> quite {{out of step}} with the earth tide, at high ocean tide there is an excess (or at low tide a deficit) of water about what would be the {{gravitational}} equilibrium level and the adjacent ground falls (or rises) in response to the resulting differences in weight. Displacements caused by ocean tidal loading can exceed the displacements due to the earth body tide. Sensitive instruments far inland often have to make similar corrections. Atmospheric loading and storm events may also be measurable, though the masses in movement are less weighty.|$|E
25|$|He {{observed}} analogous {{trends in}} the field of repetitive or transposed genomic elements (TEs) including retroposed elements. These elements were initially considered to be junk, littering genomes, and proposed by only a few to constitute raw material for fortuitous and only occasional exaptations, and to be responsible for the plasticity of genomes and the modular architecture of genes. The current <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> moving in the opposite direction. A plethora of functions have been assigned to TEs, one example being the bewildering spectrum of tasks allocated to the evolutionarily young primate-specific Alu elements. Such sweeping interpretations should be challenged.|$|E

25|$|The Moon orbits the Earth in {{the same}} {{direction}} as the Earth rotates on its axis, so it takes slightly more than a day—about 24 hours and 50 minutes—for the Moon to return to the same location in the sky. During this time, it has passed overhead (culmination) once and underfoot once (at an hour angle of 00:00 and 12:00 respectively), so in many places the period of strongest tidal forcing is the above-mentioned, about 12 hours and 25 minutes. The moment of highest <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily when the Moon is nearest to zenith or nadir, but the period of the forcing still determines the time between high tides.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Godzilla {{appears in}} search of a source of nuclear energy, despite the edict {{shutting}} down all such attractants after its three previous appearances.

During the course of the battle, the Dimension <b>Tide</b> <b>is</b> launched, but Godzilla survives the attack. Most of the Meganula are killed by both Godzilla and the Dimension Tide, but a few manage to drain off some of Godzilla's energy and return to the sewer. With the last of their strength, the Meganula inject Godzilla's energy into a huge, sleeping larva that is in a giant, pulsating cocoon. It molts and appears from the water as Megaguirus, the queen of the Meganula.|$|E
25|$|The back bay, roughly {{anything}} {{south of}} the Morro Bay State Park Marina, is very shallow. However, there is some slightly deeper water in the channels. The largest channel continues from the bay's main channel, winding its way towards Los Osos, on {{the southern end of}} the bay. The second largest breaks off from the largest about halfway to Los Osos and takes an extremely windy route to the sandspit. A few small channels on the landward side formed by runoff meet the largest channel as well. The narrow, unmarked channels are very hard to navigate and are filled with eel grass, which can snag the boat or clog the propeller. They are easiest to find at low tide, but if the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> too low, the boat may run aground because the channels are only a few feet deeper than the surrounding water. An alternative to searching for the channels is to cross at very high tide.|$|E
