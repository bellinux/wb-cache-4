5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes <b>the</b> <b>tea</b> to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances the taste of <b>the</b> <b>tea.</b> The strips of tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded and rolled into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. <b>The</b> <b>tea</b> can also be pressed into bricks {{through the use of}} heavy stones or presses.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tea</b> is {{currently}} <b>the</b> second most popular beverage in the world, with only water being consumed more. For centuries, people have consumed <b>tea</b> for <b>the</b> taste, {{but as of}} late, it has been consumed for its medical benefits. Teas contain organic compounds known as polyphenols that {{have been shown to}} act as antioxidants in the body. The focus of this research was on analysis of these polyphenols. In order to do this, different types of teas, all of which come from the same plant, were brewed. These teas are white, green, oolong, and black. A number of other flavored teas and blends were looked at as well. In looking at <b>the</b> <b>teas,</b> there were several things that we looked for. We wanted to know the differences in the total amount of polyphenols present in each of <b>the</b> <b>teas,</b> <b>the</b> types of polyphenols present (along with how much of each was in <b>the</b> <b>teas),</b> as well as whether or not these polyphenols would decay over time. Previous work involved a number of spectroscopic techniques, but recent studies on <b>teas</b> has involved <b>the</b> use of differential pulse voltammetry, which is able to directly measure the reduction potentials of the polyphenols in order to better quantify their concentrations. High performance liquid chromatography is also being used which will separate out each individual polyphenol and help us to identify which ones are present in <b>the</b> <b>teas.</b> There are no definitive results that have arisen yet, and so work on <b>the</b> <b>teas</b> will continue into the foreseeable future...|$|R

5|$|In May 1773, the British Parliament passed <b>the</b> <b>Tea</b> Act, a tax law to {{help the}} {{struggling}} East India Company, one of Great Britain's most important commercial institutions. Britons could buy smuggled Dutch tea more cheaply than the East India Company's tea because of the heavy taxes imposed on tea imported into Great Britain, and so the company amassed a huge surplus of tea {{that it could not}} sell. The British government's solution to the problem was to sell the surplus in the colonies. <b>The</b> <b>Tea</b> Act permitted the East India Company to export tea directly to the colonies for the first time, bypassing most of the merchants who had previously acted as middlemen. This measure was a threat to the American colonial economy because it granted <b>the</b> <b>Tea</b> Company a significant cost advantage over local tea merchants and even local tea smugglers, driving them out of business. The act also reduced the taxes on tea paid by the company in Britain, but kept the controversial Townshend duty on tea imported in the colonies. A few merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charlestown were selected to receive the company's tea for resale. In late 1773, seven ships were sent to the colonies carrying East India Company tea, including four bound for Boston.|$|E
