500|$|Hull {{expressed}} {{a strong desire}} to retain Campbell's services for the 2008–09 season, with Hull chairman, Paul Duffen, describing Campbell as [...] "too good for the Championship". Following his successes leading to their promotion, Hull were hoping to secure either a permanent move or another season-long loan, depending on Manchester United's willingness to let him go. However, Campbell repeatedly expressed the desire to return to Old Trafford and try to break into the first team, saying [...] "Now I'm back at United, the plan is to try to force my way into the first team." [...] He added, [...] "I'm going to continue to work hard and try to do enough <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> go on from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, Robeson {{was called}} before HUAC after {{he refused to}} sign an {{affidavit}} affirming {{that he was not}} a Communist. In his testimony, he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to reveal his political affiliations. When asked why he had not remained in the Soviet Union because of his affinity with its political ideology, he replied, [...] "because my father was a slave and my people died to build , I am going <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> have a part of it just like you and no fascist-minded people will drive me from it!" [...] At that hearing, Robeson stated [...] "Whether I am or not a Communist is irrelevant. The question is whether American citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or sympathies, may enjoy their constitutional rights." [...] Robeson's passport was subsequently revoked. Campaigns were launched to protest the passport ban and the restriction of his right to travel over the next four years, but it was to no avail. In 1957, unable to accept invitations to perform abroad, Paul Robeson sang for audiences in London, where 1,000 concert tickets for his telephone concert at St Pancras Town Hall sold out within an hour, and Wales via the transatlantic telephone cable TAT-1: [...] "We have to learn the hard way that there is another way to sing".|$|E
6000|$|... "He is, my {{degenerate}} friend," [...] replied Bridge; [...] "and furthermore he's going <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> {{be perfectly}} safe. Do you grasp me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will give}} you a passage, Monsieur Pickard. I have nothing more <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> for, <b>and</b> shall sail up the coast to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why then," [...] {{said the}} lawyer good-naturedly, [...] "the {{best thing we}} can do is <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> down <b>here</b> <b>and</b> speak with you from where we are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can get brook trout," [...] {{answered}} Whopper. [...] "But {{just the}} same I'm willing <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> to-day <b>and</b> fish. Maybe {{we can get some}} big maskalonge, same as we did before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't be long tried; {{but in a}} way you're right. It's {{dangerous}} for him <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> you're responsible for his condition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{dear old}} farmer, I'd love <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> just dream--forever," [...] replied Carley, earnestly. [...] "But I came on purpose to talk seriously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oliver," [...] said Jonas, [...] "should you {{be willing}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> {{take care of the}} horse, while I go on and see about the logs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I think," [...] said Shep, after the boys had talked the matter over for several minutes. [...] "I think {{somebody}} ought <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> to-night <b>and</b> watch this outfit. For all we know, they may come back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will {{be easier}} <b>to</b> go than <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> listen <b>to</b> that fiendish orgy which will begin before many hours have passed!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton laughed, and Miss Deringham found {{something}} pleasant in his naive directness. [...] "Now, that's not fair. If I had been I should have gone," [...] said he. [...] "It would please me <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> <b>and</b> talk <b>to</b> you all day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} tell you," [...] he said gravely, [...] "that it is {{impossible}} for you <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> that I must take you home at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come to the carriage--quick!" [...] she said. [...] "I do {{not wish}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> talk to those policemen." [...] Hurrying out of the Gardens, she drove away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Reckon I'll have <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> boss {{the cargo}} all night. Want {{to get in}} as many trips as I can before--navigation closes," [...] the Captain {{concluded}} significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know. There are so {{many things}} I want to do. Those flowers in the garden are calling me--and I want to go down to that hollow and pick buttercups--and I want <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> <b>and</b> look at things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we'll have <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> <b>and</b> do {{the best}} we can," [...] said Bridge. [...] "I was {{thinking}} we might make a run for it if Miss Barbara was here; but as she's not we must wait for those who went out after her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I should prefer <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> a little <b>and</b> go into {{one or two}} {{questions}} of detail. Straker was brought back here, I presume?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He stopped, {{and looked}} at Leger. [...] "I can't push on to-night--I'm 'most used-up, but I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> make trouble for you. I'll light out again to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the picnic}} this afternoon, too!" [...] she sighed. [...] "I've {{looked forward to}} it all summer. And it's a perfect day--and I've got <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> nurse this foot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes, I {{should think}} so," [...] said Marco. [...] "If I should want any thing else, I can ask you, you know. You are going <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> study too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'm {{supposed}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>'ere</b> till eleven-thirty <b>and</b> lock up!" [...] he said. [...] "That's what I'm supposed <b>to</b> do. <b>Stay</b> <b>'ere</b> till eleven-thirty <b>and</b> lock up! And it ain't but ten forty-five now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] {{said the}} son, sternly, [...] "I wish her <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> at present, <b>and</b> I suppose {{you will not}} refuse to permit her to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I can quite believe, Sir Robert. I {{can only}} say that we are in your hands, and are ready to pursue any course that you may think best, either <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> quietly <b>and</b> take the risk of what may come of it or {{endeavour}} to escape in disguise if so it could be managed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You just go, Dick," [...] she cried, quickly. {{am going}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> write some letters. You go with Tom and Sam and enjoy yourself;" [...] {{and so it}} was arranged.|$|E
6000|$|... "You young folks {{can go to}} the festival," [...] said Mrs. Stanhope, with a smile. [...] "We {{are going}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> go to bed early;" [...] and so it was arranged.|$|E
6000|$|Appleby’s {{face was}} compassionate, but {{he shook his}} head. “It {{is out of the}} question, Tony. I can’t—even for you,” he said. “I have got <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> see this trouble through.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drop your {{anchor and}} come alongside," [...] shouted the skipper, [...] "I’ve got <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> another week, <b>and</b> I’ve got a dozen barrels o’ herring {{must be in}} London before then." ...|$|R
6000|$|Forel smiled. [...] "I fancied {{you were}} about to ask that {{question}} first," [...] he said. [...] "The girl seemed to take it very hard, and at last I sent my wife and her away up to the hotel in the Rockies. Hettie has persuaded her <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> I expect them home very shortly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not just now. It {{seems to}} me I've had about enough of billiards for one week. To be quite straight, one finds {{learning}} your amusements a trifle expensive, and I'm not sure they're worth it. You see, I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> forever, <b>and</b> once I go back, {{it will probably be}} a very long while before I take part in any of them again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{are you to}} lay {{hands on}} a gentleman?" [...] he asked. [...] "Keep your distance. I'm going <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and,</b> if I'd had my way, we'd have kicked you out of Silverdale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel like}} a gomeral," [...] says he, [...] "to be leaving Scotland {{on a day like}} this. It sticks in my head; I would maybe like it better <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> hing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm tired, girls," [...] she announced. [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> {{rest for}} a spell. I don't {{want to go to}} Gull Point. You go on yourselves; I'll wait for you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which {{forces us}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> another day, <b>and</b> {{according}} to the looks of things I don't think it safe. What made the fools come after agreeing to lay over in the city till we showed up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} be afraid of me, mother," [...] he replied, wearily; [...] "but you must not ask me to believe in your voices {{and all the rest}} of it. It's too unnatural and too foolish. But you're my good little mother all the same, and I'm not going to desert you. I'm going <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> <b>and</b> help you fight it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Cristie drew a long breath. [...] "Truly," [...] she said, [...] "your {{proposition}} is phenomenal. Half a dozen nurse-maids in a wagon, {{from whom}} I am {{to pick and}} choose! The thing is so startling and novel that I am inclined to accept. I should very much dislike {{to be on the}} road after dark, and if you have planned <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> to-night, <b>and</b> if it will not be much trouble--" ...|$|R
