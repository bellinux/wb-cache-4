40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>The</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> in galaxies {{have been}} used as {{distance}} indicators since Hubble(1936). However, the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> for distance estimates has been controversial. Recently, Rozanski and RowanRobinson (1994) argued large errors in the distance determination : 0. 58 mag and 0. 90 mag, respectively, for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> red <b>stars</b> and <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> blue <b>stars,</b> while Karachentsev and Tikhonov(1994) suggested much smaller errors in the distance determination : 0. 37 mag for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> red <b>stars</b> and 0. 46 mag for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> blue <b>stars.</b> <b>The</b> reasons for these conflicting results are not yet known. We have investigated the accuracy of this method using a sample of 17 galaxies(LMC, SMC, NGC 6822, IC 1613, M 31, IC 10, M 33, WLM, NGC 3109, Sextans B, Sextans A, NGC 300, LeoA, NGC 2403, M 81, IC 4182, M 101) for which Cepheid distances are known and reliable photometry of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> are available (Figure 1).

5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible to the naked eye.

In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula.

The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.|$|E
5|$|Canis Major is a {{prominent}} constellation {{because of its}} many bright stars.

Another, NR Canis Majoris, will be brightest at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87 million years' time.|$|E

5|$|Gamma Comae Berenices (15 Comae Berenices) is an orange-hued giant {{star with}} a {{magnitude}} of 4.4 and a spectral class of K1III C.

With Alpha Comae Berenices and Beta Comae Berenices, Gamma Comae Berenices forms a 45-degree isosceles triangle from which Berenice's imaginary tresses hang.|$|E
5|$|Sirius appears bright {{because of}} its {{intrinsic}} luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), {{as determined by the}} Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbours. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.|$|E

5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> {{in the night}} sky as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star {{in the night sky}} with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in Serpens is the {{red giant}} star Alpha Serpentis, or Unukalhai, in Serpens Caput, with an {{apparent}} magnitude of 2.63.

Notable extragalactic objects include Seyfert's Sextet, one of the densest galaxy clusters known; Arp 220, the prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy; and Hoag's Object, {{the most famous of}} the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in {{the night}} sky, Sirius is {{recorded}} in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days {{before returning to the}} night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior to the summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E

Polaris is the brightest Cepheid variable star visible from Earth. It is a triple star system, the supergiant primary star having two yellow-white main-sequence star companions that are 17 and 2,400astronomical units (AU) distant and take 29.6 and 42,000years respectively to complete one orbit.|$|E
