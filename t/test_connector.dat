5000|$|The {{earliest}} known GM {{data communication}} link from one electronic module to another {{was introduced in}} the 1980 model year Cadillacs. The link was one wire point to point, linking the engine control module to the fuel data panel. [...] In model year 1981 all GM passenger cars for the US market used a similar data link to a <b>test</b> <b>connector</b> for assembly line diagnostics. The value of this data in diagnosing emission systems after customer delivery was quickly identified. Scanner tools were made to view and interpret the data stream. The data line was the same line that turned on the [...] "Check Engine" [...] lamp in the instrument panel. Data was sent at 80 bits per sec. 9 bits per frame, 21 bytes (frames), 2.4 sec./transmission.|$|E
50|$|Control {{equipment}} was based around the 'Line Replaceable Unit' (LRU) ethos {{and consisted of}} 'trays' of circuit boards and equipment arranged in two cabinets. No.1 housed just the usual circuit breakers, relays, reversers and so forth. No.2 also housed standard equipment but included the complex electronic control circuits that ultimately were the un-doing of the class. Each tray could be slid {{in and out of}} the cabinet (with the locomotive switched off) with ease and each had a <b>test</b> <b>connector.</b> Specific testers were made that simply compared the electrical signals and stimuli on the test socket with the design values. If any were not as expected, the whole tray was replaced and the locomotive was good-to-go... at least that was the theory. The use of testers plugged into the test socket removed the need for engineering staff to be competent electronic engineers (as opposed to electrical engineers which they undoubtedly were), but often faults on one tray would only show themselves in combination with faults on other trays. This led to confusing diagnostics and locomotives were often failed for long periods pending in-depth exploration of a fault. Faulty trays were sent for repair. This early attempt was bold and fundamentally sound. Electronic circuit arrangements in modern locomotives use this approach almost unchanged. Unfortunately, powerful control and computational electronics were in their infancy in 1968. Had the resources of just ten years later been available, it is arguable that Class 74 would have been a success.|$|E
50|$|The {{functions}} of contacts in electrical connectors, be they power- or signaling-related, must be specified {{in order for}} connectors to be interchangeable. When connected, each contact of a connector must mate with the contact on the other connector that has the same function. If contacts of disparate functions are allowed to make contact, the connection may fail and damage may result. Therefore, pinouts are a vital reference when building and <b>testing</b> <b>connectors,</b> cables, and adapters.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the tensile strength properties of Rx Naturelle Plus and Option (high-palladium) alloys on soldered connectors under simulated preceramic and postceramic soldering conditions. Materials and methods: Eighty cylindrical castings were fabricated (40 using Rx Naturelle Plus alloy and 40 using Option alloy). The 40 castings for each alloy were subdivided into 2 groups of 20 each. In the first group, castings for each alloy were randomly paired and soldered with SMG 2 solder to produce 10 preceramic <b>test</b> <b>connector</b> specimens for each alloy. In the second group, castings were similarly paired and soldered with 490 fine solder to produce 10 postceramic <b>test</b> <b>connector</b> specimens for each alloy. Each solder connector {{was subjected to}} tensile force until failure using an Instron testing machine. Statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon Rank Sums Test was performed. Results: No {{significant difference was found}} between the mean connector strength for Rx Naturelle Plus preceramic solder (mean tensile failure stress, 50, 000 Psi; STD, 11, 250) compared to Option preceramic solder (mean tensile failure stress, 59, 700. 4 Psi; STD, 16, 350) (p= 0. 1202). However, the connector strength for Rx Naturelle Plus postceramic solder (mean tensile failure stress, 37, 800 Psi; STD, 32, 450) was significantly lower than the Option postceramic solder (mean tensile failure stress, 45, 300 Psi; STD, 17, 550) (p= 0. 0407). Not only did Rx Naturelle Plus postceramic solder connectors show evidence of lower strength, but also an increased variation among specimens. Conclusions: Rx Naturelle Plus solder connectors provided better strength with the preceramic are opposed with the postceramic connectors. For postsolder connectors, Rx Naturelle Plus alloy had less acceptable strength and a wider variation, suggesting it is more technique sensitive than Option alloy connectors...|$|E
40|$|All {{interconnections}} in the ALICE Inner Tracker Silicon Strip Layers are realised using kapton/aluminium microcables, Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) and soldering techniques. The major {{advantages are}} {{the reduction in}} material budget and the increased mechanical flexibility as compared to traditional wirebonding. Since the last reports (Snowmass LHC workshop ’ 99) considerable {{progress has been made}} and designs have been refined and adapted to facilitate production, which will start early next year. This paper describes the design of the three major interconnection parts: • The TAB-frame chipcable connects the front-end chips to the detector and to the flex. These cables are mounted in carrier frames for testing and have unique coding to identify cable type as well as coding to check correct alignment in the <b>test</b> <b>connector.</b> • The flex is essentially a multi-layer interconnecting bus supplying power and control to the front-end chips, with integrated LVDS terminating resistors. The flex is the constructive basis of the hybrid, SMD components can be mounted by soldering or gluing as well as by means of TAB bonds. Ultrasonic bonding and pulsed-bar reflow soldering techniques are used to interconnect the flex to the other parts. • The laddercable is a 60 cm long cable connecting the front-end modules to the endcaps. This flatcable is designed as a differential stripline for analog and LVDS signals using ultra-low density polyimide foam as spacer material. Optical and electrical testing of microcables and scanning techniques to inspect TAB-bonds connections are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is a vital}} key component when designing and miniaturizing self sustained microsystems. The smaller the system, the smaller is the possibility to store enough stored energy for a long and continuous operational time. To move such a system in an energy efficient way, a piezoelectrical locomotion module consisting of four resonating cantilevers has been designed, manufactured and evaluated in this work. The combination of a suitable substrate, a multilayered piezoelectric material to reduce the voltage, and a resonating drive mechanism resulted in a low power demand. A manufacturing process for multilayer cantilever actuators made of P(VDF-TrFE) with aluminum electrodes on a substrate of {{flexible printed circuit board}} (FPC), has been developed. An important step in this process was the development of an etch recipe for dry etching the multilayer actuators in an inductive plasma equipment. Formulas for the quasi static tip deflection and resonance frequency of a multilayered cantilever, have been derived. Through theses, {{it was found that the}} multilayered structures should be deposited on the polymer side of the FPC in order to maximize the tip deflection. Both a large and a miniaturized locomotion module were manufactured and connected by wires to verify that the three legged motion principal worked to move the structures forward and backward, and turn it right and left. By touching and adding load, to a fourth miniaturized cantilever, its ability to act as a contact sensor and carry object was verified. The presented locomotion module is part of a multifunctional microsystem, intended to be energy efficient and powered by a solar panel with a total volume of less than 25 mm 3 and weight 65 mg. The whole system, consisting of a solar cell, an infra red communication module, an integrated circuit for control, three capacitors for power regulating, the locomotion module and an FPC connecting the different modules, was surface mounted using a state of the art industrial facility. Two fully assembled systems could be programmed both through a <b>test</b> <b>connector</b> and through optical sensors in the multifunctional solar cell. One of these was folded together to the final configuration of a robot. However, the entire system could not be tested under full autonomous operating conditions. On the other hand, using wires, the locomotion module could be operated and used to move the entire system from a peak-to-peak voltage of 3. 0 V...|$|E

40|$|Bridge {{projects}} {{constructed in}} Texas which utilize precast bent caps typically employ grouted vertical ducts in the cap-to-column connections. This {{type of connection}} is preferred due to the simple geometry and because the volume of grout needed to complete the connections is minimized.

However, the results were not sensitive to epoxy coating on the connector or to the presence of spiral transverse reinforcement around the group of connectors.

40|$|Abstract—A 64 -site {{wireless}} current microstimulator chip (Interestim- 2 B) and {{a prototype}} implant {{based on the}} same chip have been developed for neural prosthetic applications. Modular standalone architecture allows up to 32 chips to be individually addressed and operated in parallel to drive up to 2048 stimulating sites. The only off-chip components are a receiver inductive-capac-itive (LC) tank, a capacitive low-pass filter for ripple rejection, and arrays of microelectrodes for interfacing with the neural tissue. The implant receives inductive power up to 50 mW and data at 2. 5 Mb/s from a frequency shift keyed (FSK) 5 / 10 MHZ carrier to generate up to 65 800 stimulus pulses/s. Each Interestim- 2 B chip contains 16 current drivers with 270 A full-scale current, 5 -bit (32 -steps) digital-to-analog converter (DAC) resolution, 100 M output impedance, and a voltage compliance that extends within 150 and 250 mV of the 5 V supply and ground rails, respectively. It can generate any arbitrary current waveform and supports a variety of monopolar and bipolar stimulation protocols. A common analog line provides access to each site potential, and exhausts residual stimulus charges for charge balancing. The chip has site potential measurement and in situ site impedance measurement capabilities, which help its users indicate defective sites or characteristic shifts in chronic stimulations. Interestim- 2 B chip is fabricated in the AMI 1. 5 m standard complemen-tary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process and measures 4 6 4 6 0 5 mm.
