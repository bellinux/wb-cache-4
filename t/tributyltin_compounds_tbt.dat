40|$|Key words: acrylic resin; HMBA side chain; {{antifouling}} Abstract: Biofouling on underwater engineered structures, {{especially on}} ship hulls, results in increased operational and maintenance costs. Fouling {{is not only}} of an ecological interest, {{but it is also}} important from applied and commercial perspectives. With the development of society, widely used <b>Tributyltin</b> <b>compounds</b> (<b>TBT)</b> for biofouling control have been prohibited worldwide at the end of 2008. The need to develop new environment friendly antifouling agents has been highlighted. Herein we report on the synthesis and characterization of a novel cross-linkable copolymer containing a HMBA side chain. The paper is mainly focused on the synthesis of novel resin and its antifouling performance. Apart from use of acrylate monomer, the two other important monomers γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (HD- 70) and N-(4 -Hydroxy- 3 -Methoxy-Benzyl) acrylanine (HMBA) were selected to construct low surface energy materials. Finally, the antifouling properties of resins were carried through by the colonization of benthic diatoms (Nitzschia flosterium) and ocean plates of an offshore platform. Experimental results indicated the novel resins containing a HMBA side chain possessing better antifouling properties than a standard polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) coating in the Qingdao ocean...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Biofouling on {{underwater}} engineered structures, {{especially on}} ship hulls, results in increased operational and maintenance costs. The {{traditional methods of}} protecting marine structures have been the use of toxic antifoulants, such as lead, mercury and <b>tributyltin</b> <b>compounds</b> (<b>TBT).</b> Such heavy metals {{have proven to be}} effective in deed, but severe shellfish deformities and the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in ducks, seals and fish lead to the global ban of toxic antifoulants. Therefore, our antifouling strategy is to develop minimally adhesive, mechanically stable and nontoxic fouling release coatings which degrade fouling an organism’s ability to adhere to surfaces. Herein we report on the synthesis and characterization of a novel cross-linkable copolymer grafted a semifluorinated aromatic side chain which was prepared by copolymerization with methyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate. Bulk and surface properties were assessed through 1 H NMR and 19 F NMR spectra, contact angle measurement. The cross-linkable copolymer was rationally designed for use as coating to prevent marine bioufouling. Apart from the use of methyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate which contained epoxide ring serving as a cross-linked group, the other important monomer―a semifluorinated group substituted styrene monomer was selected to construct a low surface energy material.

40|$|<b>Tributyltin</b> <b>compounds</b> (<b>TBT)</b> {{are highly}} toxic pollutants, mainly {{introduced}} to the environment as a marine antifouling agent. The main aim of this work was to evaluate the present methods for the measurement of TBT and its breakdown products dibutyltin and monobutyltin in environmental sediments and waters and to improve upon their measurement. For the analysis of sediments, a triple hexane/acetic acid extraction was employed of tropolone complexes of the organotin compounds. Grignard reagent derivatization and measurements by gas chromatography with pulsed flame photometric detection were then employed. The TBT detection limit of 5 ?g Sn/ kg in sediment was below the UK environmental quality target (EQS) value for TBT in sediment (1 - 2 mg Sn/kg). A pilot investigation was carried out on a small dockyard in Southampton to evaluate if {{the total amount of}} tin could be used to predict the presence of TBT. Due to different sources of tin contamination in the studied area no clear overall correlation of TBT with total tin was found. As part of the investigation into the determination of butyltin in sediment, the extraction of TBT from paint particles deposited in sediment during boat refurbishment and the removal of sulphur interferences were investigated. For the extraction of TBT in paint, a pre-treatment procedure was developed based on pre-treatment with dichloromethane (DCM). This treatment improved the extraction of TBT from the paint, but TBT losses can occur during DCM removal by evaporation. Sulphur interferences were successfully removed from the sediment extract by improving the clean-up procedure. This procedure was based on treatment of the hexane extract with activated copper and then passing the hexane extract through a C 18 solid phase extraction column. For the determination of butyltins in water a doubly functionalized mesoporous silica was synthesized and used to extract butyltin compounds from water based on a solid phase dispersion technique. Butyltin chlorides were collected from the water {{on the surface of the}} HOC 18 -nanoscavenger, hexylated using a Grignard reagent and quantified by GC-PFPD. Another approach was based on ethylation of tributylin chloride using NaEt 4 B followed by extraction of the ethylated species on the HOC 18 -nanoscavenger. TBT detection limits of 1. 5 and 3 ng Sn/ L were achieved using the Grignard and NaEt 4 B approaches respectively and were regarded satisfactory, as they were below or near to the UK EQS for water (2 ng/ L). The Grignard approach was more efficient than the NaEt 4 B approach, but the latter was more precis...|$|E

The isolation of TBT-degrading bacteria from TBT polluted sediment leads to the indication of specific potential TBT degraders. Two new strains of bacteria designated as B 2 and B 3 were successfully isolated using glycerol medium containing tributyltin chloride (TBTC) at 130 μM from contaminated sediment collected from Bowling Basin in Glasgow. The observed degradation after 14 days of the microcosm from the sediment and the isolated bacteria were investigated at an initial concentration of 1 μM TBTC. It was found that TBT was degraded by the bacterial strains B 2 and B 3 at 8. 3 and 16. 9 %, respectively. The results indicate that B 2 and B 3 are effective as TBT degraders. EC 50 of B 2 and B 3 in water were 88. 73 and 112. 53 μM TBTC, which {{were significantly higher than}} the concentration of TBT measured at the basin, suggesting a low effect of TBT on the growth and activity of bacteria.

These biocides are extremely toxic to marine life, particularly marine gastropod populations. The European Union therefore took measures to reduce the use of TBT-based antifouling paints on ships and ultimately banned these paints in 2003. Despite sufficient data on OT concentrations in marine gastropods, data are scarce for other species such as the North Sea brown shrimp (Crangon crangon), a dominant crustacean species in North Sea inshore benthic communities. The present study provides the first spatial overview of OT concentrations in North Sea brown shrimp.

Different techniques such as infrared (FTIR), elemental analysis, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) were used to confirm {{the production of the}} desired products.

This study aimed at clarifying effects of a 56 day exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and tributyltin (TBT) on the cellular energy allocation (CEA) in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor. Avoidance behaviour, survival and growth were also recorded. The CEA biomarker assay involves using colorimetric biochemical methods to quantify the energy reserves available (Ea) and the energy consumption (Ec). This information can then be integrated into a single value expressing an overall net-energy budget value. The assay was initially developed for use in short-term toxicity assays with Daphnia magna. The compounds spiked in the sediment had not been present in the concentrations intended during the exposure. PFOS was not detected in any of the sediment samples, and was probably washed out of the sediment when it was added to the aquaria. PFNA was detected in sediments not spiked with the compound, probably because it already was present in the sediment to some extent. The compound perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was also found in the sediment samples. There was not observed any significant differences in cellular energy allocation or any other parameters measured between the control group and the treatments.

40|$|Summary Emergent aquatic insects can {{represent}} an important subsidy to terrestrial ecosystems {{but may also}} transport accumulated contaminants across ecosystem boundaries when larvae develop in contaminated sediments. We sampled tetragnathid spiders (terrestrial predators), larval chironomids (spider prey of aquatic origin) and terrestrial insects (terrestrial prey) from two contaminated and two control sites in the Norfolk Broads (U. K.) {{to determine whether the}} organotin <b>compound</b> <b>tributyltin</b> (<b>TBT)</b> is transferred by emergent aquatic insects. TBT, a biocide in antifoulant paints, was prohibited in the U. K. in 1987 and globally since 2008 but persists in sediments for decades. Combining stable-isotope analyses commonly used in ecology with ecotoxicological methods enabled us to test whether aquatic subsidies could transport organotin to terrestrial predators. Stable-isotope mixing models (δ 15 N and δ 13 C) indicated that chironomids contributed 31 – 98 % to spider biomass. Subsequent organotin analyses revealed consistent, low-level butyltin (dibutyltin; DBT) contamination of chironomids from the most contaminated site but not from the other three sites. Spiders from the most contaminated site had DBT concentrations similar to those of their chironomid prey. To assess bioaccumulation, we used δ 15 N values as a proxy for trophic position of sediments, chironomids and spiders, and correlated these values with the respective DBT concentrations. Notwithstanding indications of 15 N-enrichment along this short food chain, chironomid DBT concentrations were significantly greater than those of their spider predators. Biota sediment accumulation factors (sediments to chironomids) and biomagnification factors (chironomids to spiders) were below the thresholds defining the occurrence of bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Although biomagnification was not detected, it is of concern that butyltins are still present in freshwater food webs c. 25 years since last known TBT use in the U.

40|$|Background: The organotin <b>compound</b> <b>tributyltin</b> (<b>TBT),</b> {{used as an}} {{antifouling}} agent in ship hull paint, is known to cause imposex in several species of marine gastropods. Imposex is the imposition of male sexual characteristics on females, {{and can lead to}} female sterility. The common whelk, Buccinum undatum, is a common species in Norway and has received attention for its export potential. Because B. undatum varies geographically in reproduction and morphology it is important to study the species before exploiting the populations. No work has been done to assess imposex in the common whelk in Norway, and {{little is known about the}} species in Norway altogether. Methods: Buccinum undatum was caught at Berg and Balsnes in Balsfjord, Troms county, Northern Norway, for comparative studies of imposex and morphology. Shell length and male penis length were measured, and females were checked for imposex. Age was read by counting striae on the backside of the operculum. Sediment samples were taken at each location for analysis of TBT contents, and snails with and without imposex were also analyzed for TBT. Results: There was a significant difference in shell length between Berg and Balsnes. The whelks at Berg seemed to be longer than at Balsnes. There were no differences in incidence of imposex between the localities, nor between length groups within each locality. There seemed to be an increase in percentage of imposex with increasing age at Balsnes. No female whelks had imposex severe enough to cause sterility. TBT consentration was below detection limit in the sediments at both locations, while it was detected at low concentrations in females both with and without imposex. Conclusions: Buccinum undatum display morphological differences between close localities. TBT contamination at Berg and Balsnes is low and has low impacts on the whelk populations with respect to imposex. Imposex has no impact on reproductive abilities of the common whelk at Berg and Balsnes...|$|R

Typical antifouling coatings are not biomimetic but are based on synthetic chemical compounds that can have deleterious effects on the environment. Prime examples are <b>tributyltin</b> <b>compounds,</b> which are components in paints to prevent biofouling of ship hulls. Although highly effective at combatting the accumulation of barnacles and other problematic organisms, organotin-containing paints are damaging to many organisms and {{have been shown to}} interrupt marine food chains.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of single-drop microextraction (SDME), coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, was assessed for {{the determination of}} <b>tributyltin</b> <b>compounds</b> in water and solid samples. Experimental parameters impacting the {{performance of}} SDME, such as microextraction solvent and sampling and stirring time, were investigated. Analytical results obtained by SDME were compared with those generated by conventional solid phase microextraction (SPME) and liquid 2 ̆ 013 liquid extraction (LLE) for the determination of TBT in PACS- 2 sediment certified reference material (CRM).

40|$|A simple chromatographic {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed for the sensitive determination of dioctyltin and <b>tributyltin</b> <b>compounds</b> in water and beverages. Dioctyltin and tributyltin react with NaBH 4 at pH 5 to produce volatile hydrides which can be quantitatively extracted into CH 2 Cl 2. The corresponding dioctyltin hydride derivative is identified by HPLC-ES-MS and measured by flame photometric detection using the quartz surface-induced tin emission. Detection limits of less than 0. 7 pg of tributyltin and 10 pg of dioctyltin were achieved. Results showed that up to 9. 5 ng/mL levels of dioctyltin were present in beverages...|$|R
40|$|In nine {{batches of}} sea {{bivalves}} collected from Chinese coastal cities {{during the year}} of 2000 to 2002, it special sample named Mya arenaria {{was found to have}} strong ability of butyltin accumulation compared with the other sampled bivalves in the corresponding batches. <b>Tributyltin</b> <b>compound</b> was the predominant pollutant with the detection rate high up to 100 %. Special high levels of mug Sn/g were detected in some Mya arenaria samples. The results obtained showed that Mya arenaria was potentially a biomarker to indicate organotin pollution in coastal aquatic environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tributyltin</b> <b>compounds</b> {{have been}} shown to induce {{apoptosis}} by causing extracellular $Ca^{ 2 +}$ influx and generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several organotin compounds were reported to have differential cytotoxicity on various human cell lines depending on the length of the alkyl chain. In this report, the cytotoxic effects of three tri-n-butylstannyl (halo) benzoate compounds-tri-n-butylstannyl benzoate (TBSB), tri-n-butylstannyl 2, 6 -difluorobenzoate (TBSDFB) and tri-n-butylstannyl- 2 -iodobenzoate (TBSIB) -were studied on lymphocytic cells of human leukemic K 562 lineage and epithelial cells of human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells lineage. K 562 cells were found to be more sensitive to these compounds than MCF- 7 cells. Although the induction of apoptosis by the above compounds in K 562 cells resulted from the extracellular $Ca^{ 2 +}$ influx and the generation of ROS, the initial amount of extracellular $Ca^{ 2 +}$ influx was greater in TBSB-treated K 562 cells than the cells treated with either TBSDFB or TBSIB. Similarly, DNA fragmentation by endonucleases was observed as an early event in TBSB-treated K 562 cells, which might be correlated with the initially greater extracellular $Ca^{ 2 +}$ influx. In contrast, MCF- 7 cells were found to undergo apoptosis mainly because of the generation of ROS. The present results suggest that the differential effects of <b>tributyltin</b> <b>compounds</b> on induction of apoptosis in K 562 and MCF- 7 cells are largely attributable to the extent of extracellular $Ca^{ 2 +}$ influx...|$|R
40|$|The acute (12 h) {{and chronic}} (7 or 14 d) effects of {{tributyltin}} chloride (TBT) {{on a new}} type of test fish, the Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus), have been studied. High accumulation of the pollutant in the fish muscle and obvious changes in hepatosomatic index and gonad somatic index were observed after exposure. The ultrastructural findings show a series of pathological changes existing in the exposed gill cells and hepatocytes, which demonstrates the toxicity effects of <b>tributyltin</b> <b>compounds</b> on aquatic organisms. The results clearly show that the Chinese rare minnow is a new sensitive test fish material, whose exposure system is suitable for the extensive organometallic toxicity studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{role and}} importance of molluscs {{as one of the}} most species-rich phyla of the animal kingdom are briefly summarised with special emphasis on certain characteristics, which make them especially suited for monitoring programmes in the field. The advantages, perspectives and limitations for the use of terrestrial and aquatic molluscs for the monitoring of chemical stressors in their specific environment are compared. Furthermore, examples of bioaccumulation and biological effect monitoring surveys are given with a differentiation of sub-organism, organism and community level effects for the latter. Finally, the possibilities for monitoring of <b>tributyltin</b> <b>compounds</b> in coastal and freshwater ecosystem are demonstrated as a case study...|$|R
