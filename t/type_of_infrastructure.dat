40|$|In recent years, {{economic}} growth {{and the development of}} social programs have contributed significantly to poverty reduction in Peru. In this process, the development <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> has been very important in reducing the long term vulnerability of households. This paper examines the role <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in reducing poverty in households in Peru within a dynamic perspective of poverty and under an asset-based approach. To do this, we estimate Logit models to reflect the impact <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> on the likelihood of being poor in Peru. We also estimate static panel data models (fixed and random effects) to reflect the impact <b>of</b> the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> on the spending ofPeruvian households. Both groups of models are based on information at the household level for the years 2007 - 2010 from the Peruvian official household survey provided by INEI. These impacts are estimated considering the sex of the household head and the area of residence(urban or rural). For static panel data models, we estimate the impact <b>of</b> the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> on household spending distinguishing whether they are transient poor or chronically poor. Given the data constraints at the household level in Peru, we only analyze the following infrastructures throughout the document: water, sewage, electricity and telecommunications. From the results, we verify a significant and different impact <b>of</b> the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> on poverty according to the area of residence and the gender of the household head. Similarly, we verify a significant and different impact <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> on the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> poverty (transient and chronic poverty).

5000|$|The {{economy in}} Pax {{was based on}} the mining of five commodities, and the {{taxation}} of the population. Taxation only occurred on territories that were not colonies; the conversion from colony to taxable [...] "home planet" [...] occurred when the user built a spaceship port in the territory. Each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> required a minimum population to be operated - ports required 5,000 people for instance. Adding infrastructure thus increased the maximum population in the territory, and the tax base. The [...] "city" [...] infrastructure was used solely to build up the population, adding 5,000 people to the maximum.|$|E
50|$|This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> can be {{decentralized}} (with {{no central}} server) or centrally managed (with a central server). Both are relatively inexpensive, {{and can be}} very reliable and resilient, as each node needs only transmit {{as far as the}} next node. Nodes act as routers to transmit data from nearby nodes to peers that are too far away to reach in a single hop, resulting in a network that can span larger distances. The topology of a mesh network has to be relatively stable, i.e., not too much mobility. If one node drops out of the network, due to hardware failure or any other reason, its neighbors can quickly find another route using a routing protocol.|$|E
5000|$|Cost {{reductions}} are {{claimed by}} cloud providers. A public-cloud delivery model converts capital expenditures (e.g., buying servers) to operational expenditure. This purportedly lowers barriers to entry, as infrastructure is typically {{provided by a}} third party and need not be purchased for one-time or infrequent intensive computing tasks. Pricing on a utility computing basis is [...] "fine-grained", with usage-based billing options. As well, less in-house IT skills are required for implementation of projects that use cloud computing. The e-FISCAL project's state-of-the-art repository contains several articles looking into cost aspects in more detail, most of them concluding that costs savings depend {{on the type of}} activities supported and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> available in-house.|$|E

50|$|Both the First Nations and Europeans {{considered}} these outport communities temporary facilities of {{the fish}} trade. European populated outports initially depended upon the good will of the local First Nation; and historians often consider the outports as First Nations settlements until well after colonization authorized by European monarchs. The pattern of small isolated settlements was reinforced by actions of the Parliament of England to make permanent settlement of Newfoundland illegal. Seventeenth century English fishermen and fish merchants wished to avoid competition from a local population gaining control of the most productive fishing locations as the New England colonies had done in the Gulf of Maine. The questionable legal status of Newfoundland's clandestine settlements discouraged the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> investments found in the Maritime Provinces.|$|E
5000|$|Safe-houses, {{sometimes}} referred to as ‘guest-houses,’ facilitate an individual’s ability to discreetly (sic) transit from one location to another by providing them with a place to spend the night, acquire resources, obtain false documentation or secure modes of transportation.

5000|$|NGOs play a {{major role}} in {{providing}} water supply and sanitation in rural areas of Afghanistan. In 2003, through its Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), the Government began to play a role in rural water supply. It developed a [...] "Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Policy/Strategy" [...] for Afghanistan. The strategy emphasizes the integration of health and hygiene education with water supply and sanitation and gives local communities a key role. They are supposed to decide about the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure</b> to be installed, finance part of its investment costs, and to operate and maintain it. This is to be done through democratically elected Community Development Councils (CDCs) that have been created throughout Afghanistan since 2003 as part of the National Solidarity Programme. The councils receive so-called block grants and are themselves in charge of choosing what to do with the block grants and selecting the companies that install the infrastructure. About 22,000 Councils have been created in all of Afghanistan's provinces as of 2010. About one quarter of the projects financed through the National Solidarity Programme are for water supply, sanitation and flood control, amounting to 11,700 projects with a value of US$157m financed between 2003 and 2010.|$|E

Armadale tells Max that whatever happened before the Plutonian's rampage {{does not matter}} {{if they are to}} survive, commending Max for not sliding back into old habits as Armadale did with alcohol. A gathering of villains contemplate what to do, bored of their unchallenged crimes. The villain St. Lucifer appears over Coalville in his ship and captures the villainous gang. Armadale attempts to gather his police force, only to find they have all abandoned their jobs. Max ignores Lucifer's ship and continues to build. [...] Lucifer offers the villains, including Jailbait, the opportunity to serve him when he conquers Coalville, the last city with any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Max finds and incarcerates Charlie in the building he has created; a jail. St. Lucifer sends his minions to kill Max, hoping to present his head to the Plutonian as a peace offering, but before he can act, Plutonian arrives and attacks Max, demanding to know Alana's location. [...] Max proves a match for Plutonian as their battle is broadcast on the news. Plutonian demands to know where Alana is, unable to hear or see her, but Max claims that she is smart enough to hide from Plutonian. Max thanks Plutonian for inspiring him to become a better person, and then requests that Plutonian leave Coalville. Max says something to the Plutonian which causes him to agree to the request and leave. The news covers Max's victory as Coalville cheers him. [...] With Coalville now considered the only safe place thanks to Max, the combined U.S./Chinese forces move in to turn the city into a high-security, military complex, and enlist Max to their cause. St. Lucifer's villain gang attacks the nuclear plant to seize control of Coalville's power. Max decides {{that the only way to}} get what he wants - the freedom to protect Coalville independently in his own way - is to ally with Lucifer and evict the military.|$|E
