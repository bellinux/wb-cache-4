40|$|The {{dimensionality}} of {{a reading}} comprehension assessment with non-stem equivalent multiple-choice (MC) items and open-ended (OE) items was analyzed with German test data of 8523 9 th-graders. We {{found that a}} two-dimensional IRT model with within-item multidimensionality, where MC and OE items load on a general latent dimension and OE items additionally load on a nested latent dimension, had a superior fit compared to an unidimensional model (p ≤. 05). Correlations between general cognitive abilities, orthography and vocabulary and <b>the</b> general <b>latent</b> dimension {{were significantly higher than}} with <b>the</b> nested <b>latent</b> dimension (p ≤. 05). Drawing back on experimental studies on the effect of item format on reading processes, we suppose that <b>the</b> general <b>latent</b> dimension measures abilities necessary to master basic reading processes and <b>the</b> nested <b>latent</b> dimension captures abilities necessary to master higher reading processes. Including gender, language spoken at home, and school track as predictors in latent regression models showed that the well known advantage of girls and mother-tongue students is found only for <b>the</b> nested <b>latent</b> dimension...|$|R

5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed <b>the</b> <b>latent</b> state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is {{not exactly the same}} as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of <b>the</b> <b>latent</b> state.|$|E
5|$|Other {{approaches}} {{have been suggested}} over time, including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans. Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation, dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development (so that <b>the</b> <b>latent</b> heat is absorbed by the ice, instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop), or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons. Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone. These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived {{for any of the}} weakening techniques to be practical.|$|E

40|$|Model-based {{clustering}} {{methods for}} continuous data are well established and {{commonly used in}} a wide range of applications. However, model-based clustering methods for categorical data are less standard. Latent class analysis is a commonly used method for model-based clustering of binary data and/or categorical data, but due to an assumed local independence structure there may not be a correspondence between <b>the</b> estimated <b>latent</b> classes and groups in the population of interest. <b>The</b> mixture of <b>latent</b> trait analyzers model extends latent class analysis by assuming a model for the categorical response variables that depends on both a categorical latent class and a continuous <b>latent</b> trait variable; <b>the</b> discrete <b>latent</b> class accommodates group structure and <b>the</b> continuous <b>latent</b> trait accommodates dependence within these groups. Fitting <b>the</b> mixture of <b>latent</b> trait analyzers model is potentially difficult because the likelihood function involves an integral that cannot be evaluated analytically. We develop a variational approach for fitting <b>the</b> mixture of <b>latent</b> trait models and this provides an efficient model fitting strategy. <b>The</b> mixture of <b>latent</b> trait analyzers model is demonstrated on the analysis of data from the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) and voting in the U. S. Congress. The model is shown to yield intuitive clustering results and it gives a much better fit than either latent class analysis or latent trait analysis alone. ...|$|R

Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous system failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8mg/kg of body weight). On average, individuals affected consumed 20kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 million cases.|$|E
5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. <b>The</b> <b>latent</b> karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. <b>The</b> <b>latent</b> heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E
