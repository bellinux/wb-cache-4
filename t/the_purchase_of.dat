40|$|Title: <b>Purchasing</b> Process <b>of</b> Services: A Study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Purchasing</b> Process <b>of</b> HumanResource (HR) {{services}} Background: The rise {{in competition}} among organizations continues to increase. The rise in globalization, outsourcing and continuous pressure from customers {{have been the}} source for the increase in competition. Additionally, the instability in various industries is leading to high competition among firms. <b>The</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> professional services is vital to organizations. Contemporary organizations spend a huge portion of their resources on <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> professional services. <b>The</b> proper <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> professional services can lead to cost saving and competitive advantage for companies or organizations. Research Questions:  How can <b>the</b> various <b>purchasing</b> models be used to develop a process for professional HR service <b>purchasing?</b> What are <b>the</b> factors involved in developing a process for <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> professional HR services Purpose: The purpose of this thesis {{is to develop a}} <b>purchasing</b> process for <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> professional HR services. It takes into consideration the various classifications models <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> and <b>the</b> factors involved in <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> services in order to develop a purchasing process for professional HR services. Method: Through a qualitative case study, the thesis gathered empirical data and used the deductive scientific approach to building a foundation of theory. Additionally, pattern matching was used to analyze both the theory and empirical data. Conclusion: The thesis developed a new classification model for HR services which resulted in the development <b>of</b> a new <b>purchasing</b> process that takes into consideration the classification of services and integrates the effects of the classification in <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process. Additionally, <b>the</b> thesis discovered that personal relationship, clarity of problem and solution, specification of supplier’s inputs, specification of supplier’s throughputs or processes, specification of supplier’s output and specification of supplier’s outcome and the characteristics of service are factors involved in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a <b>purchasing</b> process forHR Services.
