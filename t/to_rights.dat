5|$|On 29 January the {{fourteen}} began a one-week hunger strike which was joined, according <b>to</b> <b>rights</b> activist Mohamed al-Maskati, by another 150 prisoners. The {{object of the}} hunger strike was to demand {{an end to the}} political crackdown, protest against their trials and demand the release of prisoners of conscience. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja subsequently went on a new 110-day hunger strike. He was transferred to hospital in April as he kept reducing the amount of his glucose intake. On 30 April 2012, the Court of Cassation reduced Al-Hur Yousef al-Somaikh's sentence from two years to six months and he was released as he had already served his sentence. The court also announced that the thirteen other defendants would be retried by a (civilian) criminal court of appeal, but they were not released from prison, leading to criticism from the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|While early {{efforts to}} legalize {{same-sex}} marriage failed, the legislature approved two bills in 2008 that granted all unmarried couples certain domestic partnership rights, including {{the ability to}} make hospital and nursing home visits, end-of-life choices and other medical decisions, in addition <b>to</b> <b>rights</b> to joint property ownership. Domestic partners must be at least 18 years old and be able to provide an affidavit attesting to their relationship along with two documents, such as joint checking accounts, mortgages or car leases; coverage on health insurance policies or the designation as a primary beneficiary in a will. The laws went into effect on July 1, 2008.|$|E
