500|$|Salinger's {{writing has}} {{influenced}} several prominent writers, prompting Harold Brodkey (himself an O. Henry Award-winning author) to state in 1991: [...] "His {{is the most}} influential body of work in English prose by anyone since Hemingway." [...] Of the writers in Salinger's generation, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist John Updike attested that [...] "the short stories of J. D. Salinger really opened my eyes as <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> can weave fiction out {{of a set of}} events that seem almost unconnected, or very lightly connected... stick in my mind as really having moved me a step up, as it were, toward knowing how to handle my own material." [...] The critic Louis Menand has observed that the early stories of Pulitzer Prize-winner Philip Roth were affected by [...] "Salinger's voice and comic timing".|$|E
500|$|Richard Armitage plays series protagonist John Porter. Porter {{served with}} the SAS until he was {{discharged}} after he spared {{the life of a}} boy who was believed to have subsequently killed two soldiers in his unit following a rescue operation the night before the Iraq invasion. He is brought back into service by Section 20 seven years later. He is married to Diane, and has a daughter, Alexandra. Armitage described Porter as a [...] "damaged hero", and [...] "sort of like Lucas North, only on some kind of go-faster drug." [...] In order to fit into the role, Armitage had to [...] "bulk up for the role," [...] and performed a lot of training for about ten weeks in the UK, and then flew to Johannesburg the day after filming the eighth series of Spooks wrapped up, where he proceeded with more training. He was trained from [...] "how to hold a gun <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> can run through a door without getting your head blown off." [...] Armitage had not trained as hard as in the past; the intensity of such training almost made him pass out after the first workout, stating [...] "filming Spooks is demanding, but nowhere near as physical as this." [...] Armitage performed most of his own stunts.|$|E

2500|$|His {{films are}} usually imaginative fantasies. His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown commented, [...] "the theme of imagination, and the {{importance}} of imagination, <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> live and how you think and so on... that's very much a Terry theme." [...] Most of Gilliam's movies include plotlines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters' imaginations, raising questions about the definition of identity and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes [...] "higher" [...] and [...] "lower" [...] layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made idol, or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, paranoid atmosphere and unusual characters who used to be normal members of society. His scripts feature black comedy and often end with a dark tragicomic twist.|$|E
2500|$|Director Terry Gilliam and screenwriter Charles McKeown {{wrote the}} script for The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, their first {{collaboration}} since The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). When he was approached with the basic concept by Gilliam, McKeown thought of the central character of Parnassus [...] "as a semi-eastern medicine man evolved", and in retrospect he further said about the script's sensibilities, [...] "t is about the theme of imagination, {{and the importance of}} imagination, <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> live and how you think and so on. And that's very much a Terry theme. [...] I like the idea of storytelling being the thing that sustains the universe." [...] Gilliam described the premise as a [...] "fun and humorous story about the consequences of our personal choices in life", and explained his goal for the film: [...] "It's autobiographical. I'm trying to bring a bit of fantasticality to London, an antidote to modern lives. I loved this idea of an ancient travelling show offering the kind of storytelling and wonder that we used to get, to people who are just into shoot-em-up action films." [...] Gilliam and McKeown based the character of Tony on former British prime minister Tony Blair, who [...] "would say the most insane things and probably he'd believe them himself".|$|E
