40|$|We {{are getting}} {{familiar}} with mobile devices; they begin to pervade our daily life {{in a way that}} we won’t notice them anymore as something remarkable. The amazing fact that there are more registered mobile phones than inhabitants in Germany and Austria makes it easy to claim that mobile phones have already reached the state of a ubiquitous device. One often unsatisfying user experience in deal-ing with the mobile device addresses the entry of data. Instead of typing data key-by-key one of the most promising technologies towards mobile technologies are Barcodes. 2 D Barcodes or “mobile tags” can be used to exchange information very easily and quickly. By scanning a data matrix access to addi-tional materials can be simply provided. Such codes are able to combine and connect two different media: Print and Internet. Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) has been started about half a year ago a master thesis and research work with <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> experiences about the practicability of two-dimensional barcodes in general as well as for teaching purposes.

It can be summarized that by using two-dimensional barcodes the print and online media will get closer and enhance our mobile lives...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of how we make, and how we should make judgments and decisions has occupied thinkers for many centuries. This thesis has the aim to add new evidences to clarify the brain’s mechanisms for decisions. The cognitive and the emotional processes of social actions and decisions are investigated with the aim to understand which brain areas are mostly involved. Four experimental studies are presented. A specific kind of population {{is involved in the}} first study (as well as in study III) concerning patients with lesion of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). This region is collocated in the ventral surface of frontal lobe, and it seems have an important role in social and moral decision in forecasting the negative emotional consequences of choice. In study I, it is examined whether emotions, specifically social emotions subserved by the vmPFC, affect people’s willingness to trust others. In study II is observed how incidental emotions could encourage trusting behaviour, especially when individuals are not aware of emotive stimulation. Study III has <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> a direct psychophysiological evidence, both in healthy and neurologically impaired individuals, that emotions are crucially involved in shaping moral judgment, by preventing moral violations. Study IV explores how the moral meaning of a decision and its subsequent action can modulate the basic component of action such as sense of agency...|$|E

40|$|Guidance and {{security}} in large public buildings such as airports, museums and shopping malls requires much more information that traditional 2 D methods offer. Therefore 3 D semantically-reach models have been actively investigated with <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> knowledge about availability and accessibility of spaces. Spaces can be unavailable to specific users because of plenty of reasons: the 3 D geometry of spaces (too low, too narrow), {{the properties of the}} objects to be guided to a specific part of the building (walking, driving, flying), the status of the indoor environment (e. g. crowded, limited light, under reconstruction), property regulations (private areas), security considerations and so on. However, such information is not explicitly avaible in the existing 3 D semantically-reach models. IFC and CityGML are restricted to architectural building components and provide little to no means to describe such properties. IndoorGML has been designed to establish a generic approach for space identification allowing a space subdivision and automatic creation of a network for route computation. But currently it also represents only spaces as they are defined by the architectural layout of the building. The Land Administration Domain Model is currently the only available model to specify spaces on the basis of ownership and rights for use. In this paper we compare the principles of IndoorGML and LADM, investigate the approaches to define spaces and suggest options to the linking of the two types of spaces. We argue that LADM space subdivision on basis of properties and rights of use can be used to define to semantically and geometrically available and accessible spaces and therefore can enrich the IndoorGML concept. 3 D Geo-InformationDepartment of GIS Technolog...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} prevalence, {{risk factors}} and hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype distribution in different population groups in Croatia {{in the context of}} HCV epidemiology in Europe, with <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> all existing information on HCV infection in Croatia which will be used to advise upon preventive measures. It is estimated that 35000 - 45000 of the Croatian population is chronically infected with HCV. Like in other European countries, there have been changes in the HCV epidemiology in Croatia over the past few decades. In some risk groups (polytransfused and hemodialysis patients), a significant decrease in the HCV prevalence was observed after the introduction of routine HCV screening of blood/blood products in 1992. Injecting drug users (IDUs) still represent a group with the highest risk for HCV infection with prevalence ranging from 29 % to 65 %. Compared to the prevalence in the Croatian general population (0. 9 %), higher prevalence rates were found in prison populations (8. 3 %- 44 %), human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients (15 %), persons with high-risk sexual behavior (4. 6 %) and alcohol abusers (2. 4 %). Low/very low prevalence was reported in children and adolescents (0. 3 %) as well as in blood donors (0 %- 0. 009 %). In addition, distribution of HCV genotypes has changed due to different routes of transmission. In the general population, genotypes 1 and 3 are most widely distributed (60. 4 %- 79. 8 % and 12. 9 %- 47. 9 %, respectively). The similar genotype distribution is found in groups with high-risk sexual behavior. Genotype 3 is predominant in Croatian IDUs (60. 5 %- 83. 9 %) while in the prison population genotypes 3 and 1 are equally distributed (52. 4 % and 47. 6 %). Data on HCV prevalence and risk factors for transmission are useful for implementation of preventive measures and HCV screening...|$|E
