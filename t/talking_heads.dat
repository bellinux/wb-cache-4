30|$|A <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> can {{be driven}} by text or speech. The text-driven <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> {{consists}} of TTS and <b>talking</b> <b>head.</b> The TTS synthesizes the audio with phoneme information from the input text. Then the phoneme information drives the <b>talking</b> <b>head.</b> The speech-driven <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> uses phoneme information from original sounds. Text-driven <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> is flexible {{and can be used}} in many applications, but the quality of speech is not so good as that of a speech-driven <b>talking</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} for an informative, {{unbiased}} and quantitative perceptual method for the development and evaluation of a <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> we are developing, we propose a new test based on the "McGurk Effect". Our approach helps to identify strengths and weaknesses in underlying <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> algorithms, and uses this insight to guide further development. The test also evaluates the realism of <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> behavior in comparison to real speaker footage, painting an overall picture of a <b>talking</b> <b>head's</b> performance. By distracting a participant's attention away from {{the true nature of the}} test, we also obtain an unbiased view on <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> performance - since the participant's prior concerning what is synthetic animation and what is real footage is not encouraged to develop...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Fear of Music in 1979, <b>Talking</b> <b>Heads</b> and Eno sought to make an album that would dispel notions of {{the group as a}} mere vehicle for {{frontman}} and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing on the influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.|$|E
5|$|Byrne {{initially}} {{struggled with}} writer's block, but soon adopted a scattered stream-of-consciousness lyrical style inspired by early rap and academic literature on Africa. The artwork for Remain in Light was conceived by bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, and was crafted {{with the help}} of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computers and design company M. <b>Talking</b> <b>Heads</b> expanded to nine members for a promotional tour, and following its completion the band went on hiatus for several years, leaving the individual members to pursue a variety of side-projects. The album was the last of the band's collaborations with Eno, though Eno and Byrne's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts would be released the following year.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{was a form}} of rebellious {{rock that}} began in the 1970s, and was loud, aggressive, and often very simple. Punk began as a {{reaction}} against the popular music of the period, especially disco and arena rock. American bands in the field included, most famously, The Ramones and <b>Talking</b> <b>Heads,</b> the latter playing a more avant-garde style that was closely associated with punk before evolving into mainstream new wave. Other major acts include Blondie, Patti Smith, and Television. In the 1980s some punk fans and bands became disillusioned with the growing popularity of the style, resulting in an even more aggressive style called hardcore punk. Hardcore {{was a form of}} sparse punk, consisting of short, fast, intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth, with such influential bands as Bad Religion, Bad Brains, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, and Minor Threat. Hardcore began in metropolises like Washington, D.C., though most major American cities had their own local scenes in the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an image-based <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> system, which includes two parts: analysis and synthesis. The analysis {{is to create}} a database containing a large number of mouth images and their associated facial and speech features. The synthesis is to generate realistic facial animations from phonetic transcripts of text. The facial animation is produced by selecting and concatenating appropriate mouth images that match the spoken words of the <b>talking</b> <b>head.</b> Subjective tests show that 60 % of the animations are indistinguishable from real recordings.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the optimization of parameters of <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> for web-based applications with a <b>talking</b> <b>head,</b> such as Newsreader and E-commerce, {{in which the}} realistic <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> initiates a conversation with users. Our <b>talking</b> <b>head</b> system includes two parts: analysis and synthesis. The audiovisual analysis part creates a face model of a recorded human subject, which is composed of a personalized 3 D mask {{as well as a}} large database of mouth images and their related information. The synthesis part generates facial animation by concatenating appropriate mouth images from the database. A critical issue of the synthesis is the unit selection which selects these appropriate mouth images from the database such that they match the spoken words of the <b>talking</b> <b>head.</b> In order to achieve a realistic facial animation, the unit selection has to be optimized. Objective criteria are proposed in this paper and the Pareto optimization is used to train the unit selection. Subjective tests are carried out in our web-based evaluation system. Experimental results show that most people cannot distinguish our facial animations from real videos...|$|R
