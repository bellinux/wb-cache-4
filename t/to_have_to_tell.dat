40|$|Centuries of {{experience}} with acoustic instruments means there is a body of knowledge about and under-standing {{of what can be}} done with a physical instru-ment, and this corpus of knowledge is refined and prop-agated through the interactions of teachers and pupils through the ages. That experience seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> noth-ing <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us about computer-created instruments and the one-off sounds for which such instruments are often designed, nor about the instrument’s sonic character, which itself is rarely explored, and certainly the intu-itive phrasing and shaping applied by a human player is not even attempted. We advocate in this paper a new research direction, linking computer science and mu-sical research, building on current activities in agent research and in performance knowledge, which could lead us to a new kind of electro-acoustic music, both in public performance and private listening. ...|$|R

500|$|Reviewer Molly O'Donnell {{states that}} the book is [...] "broad in scope yet {{exercises}} a meticulous attention to detail". [...] O'Donnell views Davis as balanced in his account because although Davis praises Sesame Street, he describes the public criticism the show has received and relates the personality flaws {{of the people who}} helped create it. [...] Even with the book's lulls, which O'Donnell attributes to the large amount of personal histories Davis <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>to</b> give a complete picture of the show's creation, she says that the book is interesting. [...] The reviewer from Publishers Weekly agrees, praising Street Gang as continuously interesting, honest, and well-researched.

40|$|At times, {{traumatic}} incidents occur thatinvolve a {{large number}} of people whocould benefit from debriefing in small groups of eight to ten participants, but situations only allow for meeting in larger numbers of twen-ty to thirty plus participants at one time. Obviously, the debriefing process must be adjusted to accom-modate the larger numbers. Trauma specialists may only be provided with one opportunity to meet with this large group. It is our belief that you cannot properly debrief more than eight people in a group setting, as it takes close to two hours for all participants <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> their stories. Also, we do not encourage debriefing to go past two hours because of the risk of participants becoming overwhelmed and too exhausted to protect their emotional “self. ...|$|R

However, Randall never informed Wilkins of his decision to give Franklin sole responsibility for the DNA effort and Wilkins only learned of the letter years after Franklin's death.

40|$|Various {{approaches}} {{exist for}} supporting {{children and young}} people (CYP) in self‐caring for their mental health, but little is known about how different models are experienced when applied in practice. Six case‐study sites in England and Wales were sampled as exemplars of different models of mental health self‐care support for CYP. Semi‐structured interviews were used to explore the perceptions and experiences of CYP (aged 5 ‐ 17), families and staff (various professionals and support workers) at the sites. Fifty‐two participants took part in interviews and the verbatim transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis. CYP, families and staff agreed that building self‐ care skills, using practical techniques, was important; support could be gained through structured games and activities, or informal sharing of tips and ideas. Peer support was facilitated through groups and online forums and at these sites, the emotional benefits of shared experiences, particularly in reducing feelings of isolation, were appreciated. Staff emphasised the importance of ensuring the support was accessible and acceptable and of gaining the trust of CYP and families. The value of a welcoming, non‐judgemental ambience was mentioned repeatedly; CYP and families in particular ascribed this to the manner and qualities of the staff, who they trusted and felt comfortable with. For CYP, being listened <b>to,</b> <b>having</b> time <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> their own stories and being treated with empathy and compassion were particularly important. These findings bring together multiple perspectives on models of self‐care support for CYP’s mental health which have salience for research and practice in these fields...|$|R
500|$|During {{the siege}} of Bulawayo, these two men rode many times into the Matopos Hills on patrol, {{and it was in}} these hills that Burnham first {{introduced}} Baden-Powell to the ways and methods of the Native Americans, and taught him [...] "woodcraft" [...] (better known today as Scoutcraft). Baden-Powell had written at length about reconnaissance and tracking, but from Burnham he learned many new dimensions such as how to travel in wild country without either a compass or map, how to discover nearby dangers by observing animals, and the many techniques for finding potable water. So impressed was Baden-Powell by Burnham's Scouting spirit that he closely listened <b>to</b> all he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> It was also here that Baden-Powell began to wear his signature Stetson campaign hat and neckerchief, like those worn by Burnham, for the first time. Both men recognized that wars were changing markedly and that the British Army needed to adapt. During their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training program in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. In Africa, no scout embodied these traits more than Burnham.|$|R
40|$|When a {{business}} starts out, as a sole proprietor ship or a partnership, data integration is pretty simple. A sole proprietor does all his data integration {{in his own}} head. Partners achieve data integration by talking a lot. As the firm grows, data integration becomes more difficult, but no less important. If we hire a Sales Manager, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remember <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him, that he met a prospect on the airplane and promised someone would call. Conversely, our Sales manager <b>has</b> <b>to</b> remember to enter data into the Customer Relations Management (CRM) software so everyone else knows how the call went. In the beginning, financial data is easy to track. We read our checkbook balance. Integration of financial data with sales and production data was similarly easy. If we had gotten paid, we had money in the checkbook to buy supplies our needed for production. However, the bigger the organization gets, the more data there is and the more data needs integration. As we create additional organizational units and open more offices we disperse the data further. The key to the success and profitability of our company depends on how quickly and how well we achieve data integration...|$|R
