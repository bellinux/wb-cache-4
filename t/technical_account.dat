40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the nature of {{accounting}} have led to an increasing amount of importance being placed on generic and <b>technical</b> <b>accounting</b> skills within the accounting workforce. However, universities providing training to accounting students do not always adequately teach these skills, such as communication skills, decision making skills and teamwork skills. Very few studies to date have focussed on the generic skills perceived as being important by accountants and accounting students in the Middle East and in Saudi Arabia in particular. This study aimed to research the generic and <b>technical</b> <b>accounting</b> skills perceived as being important by accounting students studying this subject at the major universities in Saudi Arabia and by accountants working at nine major companies in Saudi Arabia. The study employed a survey questionnaire that followed a mixed methods research protocol. Survey respondents were asked about the skills that they perceived as being important, how well the skills were taught and to what extent the skills were used during their degree course, their current level of skill the level of skills they currently held and the level of skill required to get a job in the accounting workforce, and the comparative importance of generic skills compared to <b>technical</b> <b>accounting</b> skills. Survey respondents were also asked to rank a selection of generic skills (communication skills, interpersonal skills, problem solving skills, capacity for analysis and presentation skills) and <b>technical</b> <b>accounting</b> skills in order of importance, and were asked whether there were other generic and <b>technical</b> <b>accounting</b> skills that were important in the workplace. The study explored the differences and similarities between the views of accounting students and accountants, and also the similarities and differences between different subgroups as follows:  Undergraduate students vs. postgraduate accounting students,  Male students vs. female accounting students,  Accountants working for government organisations vs. those working at non-government organisations,  Male vs. female accountants, Overall, the study found that the responses of the accountants and the accounting students matched quite closely. One major {{difference between the two groups}} was that accounting students were much more likely to be unsure as to the level of skill needed in order to get a job. Accountants were also more likely than accounting students to rate the <b>technical</b> <b>accounting</b> skills above the generic skills. Another very striking finding was that presentation skills were consistently rated as the least important skill by all groups and that it was the skill area that was least likely to have been covered by the accounting degree course. The reasons for this may be cultural or may arise from uncertainty about the definition of “presentation skills”. The findings of this study differed from others in that the accountants in our survey were more likely to consider <b>technical</b> <b>accounting</b> skills as being more important than generic skills. This may be a result of culture and the Saudi Arabian context. These findings suggest that further work in the Saudi Arabian context is necessary...|$|R

60|$|Beaton {{went away}} with the {{smile on his face}} which he had kept in {{listening}} to Fulkerson, and carried it with him to the reception. He believed that Alma was vexed with him for more personal reasons than she had implied; it flattered him that she should have resented what he told her of the Dryfooses. She had scolded him in their behalf apparently; but really because he had made her jealous by his interest, of whatever kind, in some one else. What followed, had followed naturally. Unless she had been quite a simpleton she could not have met his provisional love-making on any other terms; and the reason why Beaton chiefly liked Alma Leighton was that she was not a simpleton. Even up in the country, when she was overawed by his acquaintance, at first, she was not very deeply overawed, and at times she was not overawed at all. At such times she astonished him by taking his most solemn histrionics with flippant incredulity, and even burlesquing them. But he could see, all the same, that he had caught her fancy, and he admired the skill with which she punished his neglect when they met in New York. He had really come very near forgetting the Leightons; the intangible obligations of mutual kindness which hold some men so fast, hung loosely upon him; it would not have hurt him to break from them altogether; but when he recognized them at last, he found that it strengthened them indefinitely to have Alma ignore them so completely. If she had been sentimental, or softly reproachful, {{that would have been the}} end; he could not have stood it; he would have had to drop her. But when she met him on his own ground, and obliged him to be sentimental, the game was in her hands. Beaton laughed, now, when he thought of that, and he said to himself that the girl had grown immensely since she had come to New York; nothing seemed to have been lost upon her; she must have kept her eyes uncommonly wide open. He noticed that especially in their talks over her work; she had profited by everything she had seen and heard; she had all of Wetmore's ideas pat; it amused Beaton to see how she seized every useful word that he dropped, too, and turned him to <b>technical</b> <b>account</b> whenever she could. He liked that; she had a great deal of talent; there was no question of that; if she were a man there could be no question of her future. He began to construct a future for her; it included provision for himself, too; it was a common future, in which their lives and work were united.|$|E

They demonstrate the usefulness of the approach in tracing the technicisation of policy by deploying it to qualitative studies of like-school comparisons in the two unexpectedly linked locations—New York City and Australia. The authors reveal how <b>technical</b> <b>accounts</b> are precarious and need constant maintenance to endure, even as they increasingly becoming routine, curtailing the policy imagination and limiting the spaces of contestation.

40|$|Firms often {{attempt to}} control {{fluctuations}} in reported earnings and steer them to levels they consider desirable. Either managing reported figures to increase earnings when management thinks its initially planned term-end settlement targets (smoothing level figures) cannot be achieved or managing reported figures to decrease earnings when achievement of earnings higher than planned is certain may be implemented during a given fiscal period. This type of management accounting behavior is called income smoothing or income smoothing behavior. Provided that other conditions are identical, managers prefer smoothed income to income that fluctuates greatly. Smoothed income enables a firm to avoid discounting in the capital market owing to business performance fluctuation and simultaneously brings about desirable consequences with respect to institutional contracts the firm has entered into with stakeholders (financial covenants, delisting requirements, management compensation contracts, etc.). Although there are various forms of earnings management, broadly speaking they {{can be divided into}} 1) <b>technical</b> <b>accounting</b> policy and 2) real discretion. <b>Technical</b> <b>accounting</b> policy refers to the practice by which management achieves its targete...|$|R

These books provide insights into peopleś storytelling in the everyday situations of the home, courtrooms, hospitals, and so on. Nevertheless, Tillyś faith in the prevalence of <b>technical</b> <b>accounts</b> as modes of explanation in intra and inter organisational settings, and superior stories as mode of communication between expert givers and non-specialized receivers, seems to ignore informational uncertainties, intra and inter organisational hierarchies and conflicts pertinent to organisations.

40|$|An {{enduring}} {{feature of}} new public management (NPM) {{in many countries}} has been the move to create more autonomous, ?complete? organisations such as universities, hospitals and social service agencies. Often referred to as ?corporatisation?, this process {{is assumed to be}} leading to the emergence of new organisational forms with dedicated management functions and a greater focus on strategy. However, these assumptions remain largely untested and rely heavily on ?<b>technical?</b> <b>accounts</b> of organisational restructuring, ignoring the potential influence of institutional pressures and internal political dynamics. In this paper, we address this concern focusing on the case of acute care public hospitals that have undergone corporatisation (to become Foundation Trusts) in the English National Health Service. Using administrative data spanning six years (2007 - 2012), the analysis shows that corporatisation is having mixed effects. While it is associated with a shift in the focus of managers to strategic concerns, it has not led to an expansion of management functions overall. Both tendencies are found to be mediated by institutional pressures, in the form of media scrutiny, and, indirectly, by the involvement of clinical professions in management. These results advance ongoing debates about the emergence of new organisational forms in the public sector, highlighting the limitations of <b>technical</b> <b>accounts</b> of change and raising the possibility that corporatisation is leading to organisations that are both more managed and undermanagered at the same time...|$|R
