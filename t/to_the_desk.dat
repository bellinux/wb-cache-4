5|$|The {{most common}} type is the live bootleg, or {{audience}} recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be soundboard recordings taken directly from a multi-track mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this, which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified and sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E

By using these, there was nothing on the desktop except the keyboard.|$|E
25|$|The person {{called up}} to read from the Torah – the summons is called an aliyah and the person so honored is called an oleh – hastens from his seat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> going {{directly}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> without any interruptions. Although around the world, including North America, many congregations will have a trained scroll reader for the actual recitation, the very considerable honor of the reading is attributed to the oleh. If there was a previous portion read, the previous oleh then steps aside from the desk. The oleh takes his place at the desk facing the open scroll, the verse where his portion begins is pointed out for him, he may kiss the scroll (usually by kissing {{the corner of his}} prayer shawl or the Torah wrapping and then touching that to the margin – not the writing – of the scroll), and then he may close his eyes, or avert his face, or otherwise indicate that the blessing he is about to recite is not being read from the text of the Torah. While reciting the blessings he holds both handles of the scroll, and if the actual scroll reading is done by someone else, the oleh steps to the side but continues to hold with one hand one of the scroll's handles.|$|E

In the first 50-second clip, Jim welcomes Pam to her new sales desk with a gift of a model of an island with figures representing Jim, Pam and Dwight, who share the office pod together. Dwight insists he did not {{have anything to do with}} the gift and does not welcome Pam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> because she [...] "obscures my view of the shredder." [...] In the second 50-second clip, Dwight tells Andy, Stanley and Phyllis that they should [...] "put our balls in the guillotine, as they say," [...] by threatening to quit if Michael does not give their clients back. The others express doubt and wonder if they should keep quiet in order to protect their jobs.|$|E
500|$|General Gage had {{anticipated}} that Lt. Col. Smith's expedition might require reinforcement, so Gage drafted orders for reinforcing units to assemble in Boston at 4 a.m. [...] But in his obsession for secrecy, Gage had sent only one {{copy of the}} orders to the adjutant of the 1st Brigade, whose servant then left the envelope on a table. [...] Also at about 4 a.m., the British column was within three miles of Lexington, and Lt. Col. Smith now had clear indication that all element of surprise had been lost and that alarm was spreading throughout the countryside. [...] So he sent a rider back to Boston with a request for reinforcements. [...] At about 5 a.m., the rider reached Boston, and the 1st Brigade was ordered to assemble: the line infantry companies of the 4th, 23rd, and 47th Regiments, and a battalion of Royal Marines, {{under the command of}} Earl Percy. Unfortunately for the British, once again only one copy of the orders were sent to each commander, and the order for the Royal Marines was delivered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> of Major John Pitcairn, who was already on the Lexington Common with Smith's column at that hour. [...] After these delays, Percy's brigade, about 1,000 strong, left Boston at about 8:45 a.m., headed toward Lexington. [...] Along the way, the story is told, they marched to the tune of [...] "Yankee Doodle" [...] to taunt the inhabitants of the area. [...] By the Battle of Bunker Hill less than two months later, the song would become a popular anthem for the colonial forces.|$|E

La Font led a Spanish police lieutenant to the shop and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> of Apolonio, where they [...] "found Katipunan paraphernalia such as a rubber stamp, a little book, ledgers, membership oaths signed in blood, and a membership roster of the Maghiganti chapter of the Katipunan." ...|$|E

2500|$|A longstanding {{game show}} segment, [...] "Chook Lotto" [...] (or Chooklotto) {{involved}} a large barrel of numbered frozen chickens, or [...] "chooks", {{and was a}} parody of Tattslotto, one of the National Lottery Draws of Australia. [...] This segment ran from 1984, was rested in 1985, then returned in 1986 and went {{till the end of}} 1988. Daryl and Jackie McDonald would draw out 4 chickens numbered from 10 to 19. The home viewer would send in their entry and have to circle one of those numbers as a [...] "Super 69" [...] number. Then another cast member would enter the numbers into a computer (Originally an Atari 800XL, later an Olivetti Model) and whoever had those numbers would be the winner. Then Daryl would return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> and use the Super 69 number on ten paper eggs which had the same numbers as the chickens drawn out. Each of them [...] held a prize. The main prize was a car from Ken Morgan Toyota or if the prize card had stars on it they would win every prize inside the other eggs. This segment was eventually replaced by Plucka Duck (Pluck-a-duck), however returned in the 2010 revival of the show, with viewers invited to go to the shows website and select 4 numbers as well as a supplementary number. [...] Due to gambling laws in Australia, when [...] "Hey Hey" [...] was revived in 2009, the game was called [...] "Fake Chook Lotto", and contestants played for no prize whatsoever, however, real prizes were offered in 2010.|$|E
