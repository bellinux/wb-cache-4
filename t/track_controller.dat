40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{converting}} a trajectory <b>tracking</b> <b>controller</b> to a path <b>tracking</b> <b>controller</b> for a nonlinear non-minimum phase longitudinal aircraft model. The solution of the trajectory tracking problem {{is based on the}} requirement that the aircraft follows a given time parameterized trajectory in inertial frame. In this paper we introduce an alternative nonlinear control design approach called path tracking control. The path tracking approach is based on designing a nonlinear state feedback controller that maintains a desired speed along a desired path with closed loop stability. This design approach is different from the trajectory tracking approach where aircraft speed and position are regulated along the desired path. The path <b>tracking</b> <b>controller</b> regulates the position errors transverse to the desired path but it does not regulate the position error along the desired path. First, a trajectory <b>tracking</b> <b>controller,</b> consisting of feedforward and static state feedback, is designed to guarantee uniform asymptotic trajectory tracking. The feedforward is determined by solving a stable noncausal inversion problem. Constant feedback gains are determined based on LQR with singular perturbation approach.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a novel method for designing step <b>tracking</b> <b>controllers</b> for systems with saturating actuators. The approach {{is based on}} the theory of Quasi-linear Control (QLC), which offers methods for designing random reference <b>tracking</b> <b>controllers</b> for systems with nonlinear actuators and sensors. In the current paper, a QLC approach to designing step <b>tracking</b> <b>controllers</b> is presented. The development is based on two ideas: introducing a precompensator, which observes given step tracking specifica-tions, and recasting the output of the precompensator into a ran-dom reference bandwidth requirement, with subsequent utilization of QLC. Unlike other techniques, the method developed here takes the saturation into account directly at the initial stage of the design and does not require subsequent augmentations (e. g., anti-windup). Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, a comparison with the anti-windup approach is provided. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4024562...|$|R

A virtual controller and some command references {{are introduced to}} asymptotically stabilise {{the system of the}} tracking error dynamics.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a solution to}} the general parking problem of nonholonomic mobile robots based on motion planning and <b>tracking</b> <b>controller</b> design. A new global <b>tracking</b> <b>controller</b> is first proposed to achieve global uniformly asymptotic stability and local exponential convergence. The parking problem is then transformed into a tracking one by adding a redesigned virtual trajectory to the original trajectory, thus guaranteeing practical stability with exponential convergence. Further improvement in parking performance is obtained through linearization and pole-placement methods. One feature of our approach is that fast convergence in parking and tracking can be treated at the same time without switching between two controllers. Moreover, a tuning function is used to enhance parking performance. With the proposed framework, various <b>tracking</b> <b>controllers</b> given in the literature can be adopted to handle parking problems.
