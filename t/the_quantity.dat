40|$|Physicochemical {{simulation}} (pH, electrolytes and temperature) {{of three}} physiological media {{was carried out}} in order to follow the release of trace elements contained in seven edible clays (mainly kaolinite, illite, muscovite and quartz) collected from the West African countries of Cote d'Ivoire, Guinee and Senegal. These clays are ingested by pregnant women for diverse reasons that are related to their condition. Simulated oral (6. 5 pH 7), stomach (pH approximately 1. 8) and intestinal (pH approximately 8. 3) media were prepared separately in order to compare <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> of <b>the</b> trace elements released. Samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry and spectrophotometry for the evaluation of copper, iron ((Fe(II) and Fe(III)), lead, manganese, nickel and zinc, since some of these elements can palliate deficiency problems and others can induce toxic effects. <b>The</b> <b>quantities</b> of <b>the</b> chemical elements released were pH dependent. The lower the pH, <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> of copper, Fe(III) and zinc. <b>The</b> <b>quantities</b> of Fe(II) were similar at both lower (stomach) and higher (intestinal) pH values. However, <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> of manganese, nickel and lead were lower than quantification limits. Heating (110 C) of the clays increased <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> of trace elements released and could also participate in the microbiological 'decontamination' of raw materials. Microbiological analysis shows that all samples tested were in compliance with the recommendations of the European Pharmacopoeia. To verify the existence of possible beneficial and hazardous effects on human health, <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> of copper, iron and zinc were compared with the recommended allowances for trace elements in France.

5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> of prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained}} by taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E
