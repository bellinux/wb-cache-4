5|$|Adam {{was created}} during {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies original pitch to the BBC {{as part of}} his plans to revive Doctor Who for the channel. Though established early in the series' planning, Adam was always intended to be a short-term character. Though reviewers generally reacted negatively to the character, Adam's role as a foil <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> companion figure has been praised alongside the moral lessons of his departure.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the company}} owns 13 active tracks which collectively hold 19 of the 36 {{events on the}} {{schedule}} of NASCAR's premier competition, the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. Twelve of the thirteen host a Sprint Cup race (the thirteenth being Route 66 Raceway, a dragstrip). In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> car racing that NASCAR is famous for, ISC tracks also host IRL IndyCar races, Grand-Am, IMSA GT and SCCA sports car races, WKA go-kart races and AMA motorcycle races. Besides NASCAR, other stock car series like IROC and ARCA use their tracks.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock.</b> The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E
25|$|The bracket and knuckle {{assemblies}} feature camming surfaces {{that allow}} the emergency unfolding of the stock by simply pulling the buttstock rearwards, however this should generally be avoided as it will wear down the mechanism rapidly over time, and lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> wobbling in both positions.|$|E

25|$|Human {{capital is}} a term popularized by Gary Becker, an {{economist}} from the University of Chicago, and Jacob Mincer that refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> of knowledge, habits, social and personality attributes, including creativity, embodied {{in the ability to}} perform labor so as to produce economic value.|$|E
25|$|During early 1963, Inchicore {{commenced}} {{construction of}} two new First Class coaches in a style similar to, but not connected with, the Craven contract. These coaches were built with an open plan format, double-glazing and air conditioning. Numbered 1145 and 1146, {{they were the only}} post-war all-first class coaches to be added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock,</b> their immediate predecessor, 1144, was built in 1935.|$|E
25|$|The {{commissary}} retail function {{developed and}} grew, roughly {{parallel to the}} development of the retail grocery industry. The commissaries’ 82-item stock list of 1868 was comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> assortment in a typical civilian dry goods grocery store at that time. Commissaries kept pace with developments in civilian supermarkets, and the average commissary today has more than 12,000 line items; the largest stores have several thousand more.|$|E

5000|$|Short sellers borrow, or make {{arrangements}} <b>to</b> borrow, <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> of a company, which they then sell at current prices. If prices later drop, they repurchase {{shares of the}} company, now at a cheaper price, <b>to</b> replace <b>the</b> borrowed <b>stock.</b> <b>The</b> difference is the profit of the short seller. Heinze's plan was to move aggressively <b>to</b> purchase <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> of United Copper. The price would soar high. Then, with prices high, and Heinze controlling most of <b>the</b> <b>stock,</b> he would force <b>the</b> short-sellers <b>to</b> repay <b>the</b> borrowed <b>stock,</b> a move called a [...] "short squeeze." [...] The short-sellers would have {{no option but to}} settle with Heinze for high prices.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of lycra <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocking</b> yarn was possibly the biggest break-through in hosiery manufacturing, the result being thigh highs that combine elasticity with <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> cling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leg.|$|R
25|$|Hallgarten & Company {{claimed to}} be the first New York Stock Exchange firm to open an office in London. This {{occurred}} in 1912. In 1968, it was the first US firm to request membership of the London Stock Exchange. In a controversial (and close) vote by the Admissions Committee it was turned down due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stock</b> Exchange wishing to restrict US competitors from that market.|$|E
25|$|From the issuer's perspective, the {{key benefit}} of raising money by selling {{convertible}} bonds is a reduced cash interest payment. The advantage for companies of issuing convertible bonds is that, if the bonds are converted to stocks, companies' debt vanishes. However, {{in exchange for}} the benefit of reduced interest payments, the value of shareholder's equity is reduced due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> dilution expected when bondholders convert their bonds into new shares.|$|E
25|$|The chart at {{the right}} shows the year-to-year {{portfolio}} balances after taking $35,000 (and adjusting for inflation) from a $750,000 portfolio every year for 30 years, starting in 1973 (red line), 1974 (blue line), or 1975 (green line). While the overall market conditions and inflation affected all three about the same (since all three experienced exactly the same conditions between 1975 and 2003), the chance of making the funds last for 30 years depended heavily on what happened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market {{in the first few}} years.|$|E
50|$|The SFC {{models are}} solved in {{different}} ways depending on the aspect of research but in general initial values are assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> and then <b>the</b> model is calibrated or estimated.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{other way}} <b>stocks</b> are valued {{is based on}} supply and demand. The more people that want <b>to</b> buy <b>the</b> <b>stock,</b> <b>the</b> higher its price will be. And conversely, the more people that want <b>to</b> sell <b>the</b> <b>stock,</b> <b>the</b> lower the price will be. This form of {{valuation}} {{is very hard to}} understand or predict, and it often drives <b>the</b> short-term <b>stock</b> market trends.|$|R
50|$|Strutt and his {{brother-in-law}} William Woollat developed an attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocking</b> frame {{that allowed the}} production of ribbed stockings. Their machine {{became known as the}} Derby Rib machine, and the stockings it produced quickly became popular.|$|R
25|$|During the 1920s, {{the nation}} enjoyed {{widespread}} prosperity, albeit with a weakness in agriculture. A financial bubble {{was fueled by}} an inflated stock market, which later led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stock</b> Market Crash on October 29, 1929. This, {{along with many other}} economic factors, triggered a worldwide depression known as the Great Depression. During this time, the United States experienced deflation as prices fell, unemployment soared from 3% in 1929 to 25% in 1933, farm prices fell by half, and manufacturing output plunged by one-third.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> delivery, an arm ball {{is delivered}} with rolling the fingers {{down the back}} of the ball on release. This means the ball has backspin on it, and it does not turn appreciably off the pitch. Instead, it travels straight on {{in the direction of the}} arm, from which it derives its name. However, by keeping the seam upright, the bowler can also hope to obtain some outswing away from the right-handed batsman, thereby confusing the batsman who expects the ball to turn.|$|E
25|$|When {{the theatre}} opened, in 1929, {{it was one}} of many {{so-called}} Egyptian Theatres across the United States. Of those Egyptian theatres, the DeKalb theatre {{is one of a handful}} still standing as of 2004. In the original design, additional buildings were supposed to be attached to the existing building, but they were never built due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market crash in late 1929. For instance, there was to be a hotel attached to the north side of the building. In its earliest days, the theatre specialized in silent films and live vaudevillian performances.|$|E
50|$|The ASX 200 is capitalization-weighted, {{meaning a}} company's {{contribution}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> index is relative to its total market value i.e. share price {{multiplied by the}} number of tradeable shares. The ASX 200 is also float adjusted, meaning the absolute numerical contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> index is relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock's</b> value at <b>the</b> float of <b>the</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|R

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the company's collapse, it was alleged that Paul and a corporate officer named Stephan Gordon had illegally tried <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> <b>stock's</b> price by using nominee accounts to buy 1.6 million shares of <b>the</b> company's <b>stock,</b> attempting <b>to</b> pay for <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> with bad checks.|$|R
25|$|DePaul's Loop {{campus is}} located in {{downtown}} Chicago's Loop along Jackson Boulevard from State Street to Michigan Avenue. It is close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> exchanges, financial district, and the Art Institute of Chicago. The DePaul Center (DPC), an 11-story building fully renovated in 1993 to include modern classrooms, high-tech student services and a business library, {{is located in}} the building that formerly housed the A. M. Rothschild & Company Store and the Goldblatt's Department Store. It is home to the College of Commerce. In November 2000, the Urban Land Institute presented DPC with its Award for Excellence for Rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|The SP1900 EMU / SP1950 EMU or IKK Train (formerly KCR EMU SP1900 / SP1950 EMU; , {{also known}} as the Millennium Train during the public promotion) is the second model of {{electric}} multiple unit rolling stock of Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC), preceded by the Metro Cammell EMU. The trains of this model are currently in service on the East Rail Line, West Rail Line and Ma On Shan Line in Hong Kong. After the MTR Corporation merger, all SP1900 trains replaced their KCR logos with the MTR logos and added a revised route map in the interior without other major alteration <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
25|$|A deeper {{investigation}} by the new board found additional problems. Georgine's profits from the stock trade {{were found to be}} far higher than anyone had guessed—nearly $8.8 million. Georgine and other Ullico executives also received millions of dollars in special bonuses and deferred compensation never approved by the board. O'Sullivan also disclosed that Ullico officers had loaned Georgine $2.2 million to purchase 40,000 shares of low-priced Ullico stock prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> trading scheme, further enlarging his profits, and that Georgine's salary had risen from $900,000 in 1996 to $5.4 million in 2000. Ullico's compensation committee lacked the authority to approve both the loan and the salary increases but did so anyway. O'Sullivan then issued letters to Georgine and the other officers demanding that they refund this money.|$|E

50|$|The pillory was {{a device}} {{made of a}} wooden or metal {{framework}} erected on a post, with holes for securing the head and hands, formerly used for punishment by public humiliation and often further physical abuse. The pillory is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks.</b>|$|R
