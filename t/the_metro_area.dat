In eastern New Orleans, levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway failed in several places because they were built with sand and erodible materials instead of clay, an obvious construction flaw.|$|E
5|$|I-96 crosses into Ingham County and {{continues}} {{along the southern}} edges of the Lansing metro area.

5|$|Apollo Hall opened {{soon after}} the city's {{founding}} in 1859 and staged many plays for eager settlers. In the 1880s Horace Tabor built Denver's first opera house. After {{the start of the}} 20th century, city leaders embarked on a city beautification program that created many of the city's parks, parkways, museums, and the Municipal Auditorium, which was home to the 1908 Democratic National Convention and is now known as the Ellie Caulkins Opera House. Denver and the metropolitan areas around it continued to support culture. In 1988, voters in the Denver Metropolitan Area approved the Scientific and Cultural Facilities Tax (commonly known as SCFD), a 0.1% (1 cent per $10) sales tax that contributes money to various cultural and scientific facilities and organizations throughout <b>the</b> <b>Metro</b> <b>area.</b> The tax was renewed by voters in 1994 and 2004 and allows the SCFD to operate until 2018.|$|E

5|$|The Omaha Traction Company, which {{operated}} as the Street Railway Company, {{changed its}} name to the Omaha Transit Company when streetcar service ended in the city in 1952. After World War II Omahans preferred their automobiles and new highways. When the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964 was passed, Omaha's private transit companies were not able to apply for federal subsidies available to public transit operators. The Omaha Transit Company ceased operations on June 30, 1972, when the City of Omaha assumed authority for public transportation in the city. City Transit Lines, another private company in Omaha, went out of business on that day as well. <b>The</b> <b>Metro</b> <b>Area</b> Transit Authority was created by the Nebraska Legislature, consisting of a five-member board appointed by the mayor and confirmed by Omaha's City Council and the Douglas County Commissioners. It acquired the assets of the Omaha Transit Company and selected assets of the City Transit Lines of Council Bluffs, along with more than $3,000,000 in federal funding. The Authority operates today as Metro Area Transit, or MAT.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} half of I-35E in <b>the</b> <b>metro</b> <b>area</b> took a {{lot longer}} to build. Its first section—a short stretch from MN110 north to State Highway 5, including the Lexington Bridge over the Mississippi River—opened in the mid-1960s. Even though the connecting piece of I-35W and I-35 at the southern terminus of I-35E in Burnsville opened in the mid-1960s, {{it was not until}} the mid-1980s that I-35E was completed south of MN110 at Mendota Heights and southbound through Eagan and Apple Valley, where there had been a missing link of I-35E for 20years. Construction was delayed by opposition from nearby residents in Burnsville and from environmentalists over the proposed alignment across Blackhawk Lake. The final plan involved a new alignment avoiding the lake, as well as a less complicated interchange at I-494 in Mendota Heights, eliminating access to MN55 that was part of the earlier plans.|$|E
