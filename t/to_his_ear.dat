5|$|On 30 March 2017, Édouard was {{suspected}} of having shot at a passer-by with an airsoft gun on 11 February, injuring him in the head. As {{a result of the}} incident, he was interrogated by police and his loan was prematurely terminated by Toulouse. At the time of his loan being cancelled, Edouard had made 17 appearances and scored one goal for Toulouse. It was later revealed that his teammate, Mathieu Cafaro, had confessed to being the one who had fired the gun. Cafaro later recanted, however, and on 13 June the Toulouse Prosecutor asked that Édouard be charged with a four months suspended prison sentence and a €6,000 fine for his involvement in the incident. Édouard alleged that Cafaro fired the shot while Cafaro claimed not to have been in the car {{at the time of the}} shooting. On 4 July, Édouard was sentenced to a suspended four months' prison sentence by the Correctional Court of Toulouse. He was also ordered to pay a fine of €6,000 as well as damages of €2,600 to the victim for the wounds suffered <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the Armenians {{were known}} to history much earlier (for example, they were {{mentioned}} in the 6th century BC Behistun Inscription and in Xenophon's 4th century BC history, The Anabasis), the oldest surviving Armenian-language text is the 5th century AD Bible translation of Mesrop Mashtots, who created the Armenian alphabet in 405 AD, at which time it had 36 letters. He is also credited by some {{with the creation of}} the Caucasian Albanian alphabet. In The Anabasis, Xenophon describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC. He relates that the Armenian people spoke a language that <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> sounded like the language of the Persians.|$|E

25|$|The {{firearms}} officers {{boarded the}} train and it was initially claimed they challenged the suspect, though later reports indicate he was not challenged. According to Hotel 3, Menezes then stood up and advanced towards the officers and Hotel 3, at which point Hotel 3 grabbed him, pinned his arms against his torso, and pushed {{him back into the}} seat. Although Menezes was being restrained, his body was straight and not in a natural sitting position. Hotel 3 heard a shot close <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> and was dragged away onto the floor of the carriage. He shouted 'Police!' and with hands raised was dragged out of the carriage by one of the armed officers who had boarded the train. Hotel 3 then heard several gunshots while being dragged out.|$|E
25|$|Magee fled to England, {{where he}} was part of an IRA active service unit. On 7 June 1992 Magee and another IRA member, Michael O'Brien, were {{travelling}} in a car on the A64 road between York and Tadcaster, when they were stopped by the police. Magee and O'Brien were questioned by the unarmed police officers, who became suspicious and called for back-up. Magee shot Special Constable Glenn Goodman - who died later in hospital - and then shot the other officer, PC Kelly, four times. PC Kelly escaped death when a fifth bullet ricocheted off the radio he was holding <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> and the IRA members drove away. Another police car began to follow the pair, and came under fire near Burton Salmon. The lives of the officers in the car were in danger, but Magee and O'Brien fled the scene after a member of the public arrived. A manhunt was launched, and hundreds of police officers, many of them armed, searched woods and farmland. Magee and O'Brien evaded capture for four days by hiding in a culvert, before they were both arrested in separate police operations in the town of Pontefract.|$|E
500|$|As the voiture {{rolled through}} the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of Oscar Wilde was in part {{repeated}} to me... Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me {{as best he could}} while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave Extreme Unction to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in my presence. When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the Last Sacraments... And when I repeated close <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.|$|E

500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I {{looked up at the}} sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came through my head. I started to write it down, right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> and the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E
