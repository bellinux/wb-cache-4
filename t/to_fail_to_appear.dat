5000|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in November 1972. Stephen Holden's contemporary review in Rolling Stone commentated that he felt the Bees Gees occupied [...] "a very limited territory of pop music", dealing mainly in ballads of [...] "momentary pathos", and that the album was [...] "headphone mood music that makes no demands beyond a superficial emotional surrender to its perfumed atmosphere of pink frosting and glitter", and that the Gibbs vocal style had developed {{to the point where}} [...] "they sound more like reed instruments than singers". Bruce Eder in a retrospective review for AllMusic feels the album makes for pleasant and satisfying listening, and is [...] "one of their most fully realized works". To Whom It May Concern only reached No. 35 in the US; it was their third consecutive studio album <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> in the UK album charts. It performed better in other European countries. In Italy reached No. 10, and peaked at No. 6 in Spain. The subsequent single [...] "Alive" [...] was a modest sized hit in the US, reaching the Top 40, and a major hit in Australia, reaching No. 4. In the 2010 documentary In Our Own Time, Maurice was shown explaining (in archival footage) that by 1972 they didn't really know who their audience was, hence the title To Whom It May Concern. The original album cover was a gatefold with pictures of business associates and family members on a drawing of the Bee Gees and a band. The band shows Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb (Maurice is playing Rickenbacker 4001) Alan Kendall and tour-only drummer Chris Karan, with Bill Shepherd conducting the orchestra.|$|E
40|$|Failure {{to appear}} (FTA) in court is an understudied and {{ubiquitous}} problem throughout {{the justice system}} and spans across all forms of pretrial release, whether financially or nonfinancially secured. Most offenders are released prior to the disposition of their case and many via government-funded pretrial services agencies. Few studies, however, have explored the factors associated with court appearance specific to race and gender groups. Relying on data culled from Dallas County, Texas, the present study assessed the predictors of FTA for defendants released via the county’s pretrial services agency and across various strata, including race and gender. Results of this exploratory analysis suggest that pretrial services defendants reporting indigence were more likely <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> for all demographic groups, and felony defendants tended to appear at higher rates for most groups. Other predictors associated with failure to appear varied across gender and race including celerity, criminal history, marital status, and length of criminal involvement...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} {{risk factors}} to help predict which patients are likely <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> for an endoscopic procedure. METHODS: This was a retrospective, chart review, cohort study in a Canadian, tertiary care, academic, hospital-based endoscopy clinic. Patients included were: those undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy and patients {{who failed to}} appear were compared to a control group. The main outcome measure was a multivariate analysis of factors associated with truancy from scheduled endoscopic procedures. Factors analyzed included gender, age, waiting time, type of procedure, referring physician, distance to hospital, first or subsequent endoscopic procedure or encounter with gastroenterologist, and urgency of the procedure. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-four patients {{did not show up}} for their scheduled appointment. Compared to a control group, factors statistically significantly associated with truancy in the multivariate analysis were: non-urgent vs urgent procedure (OR 1. 62, 95 % CI 1. 06, 2. 450), referred by a specialist vs a family doctor (OR 2. 76, 95 % CI 1. 31, 5. 52) and office-based consult prior to endoscopy vs consult and endoscopic procedure during the same appointment (OR 2. 24, 95 % CI 1. 33, 3. 78). CONCLUSION: Identifying patients who are not scheduled for same-day consult and endoscopy, those referred by a specialist, and those with non-urgent referrals may help reduce patient truancy...|$|E

She had previously attempted to represent Romania at the 1996 Contest with [...] "Rugă pentru pacea lumii", but {{had been unable to}} enter the main Contest due to the rules in place at the time. She thus became the first artist <b>to</b> have <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> at the main Contest in 1996 to make an appearance later. The second was Kaliopi who represented Macedonia in 2012 Contest after also failing in 1996.|$|R

40|$|Three {{strains of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa were {{directly}} exposed {{on the surface}} of membrane filters to hyperoxic atmospheres.

Colonies <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> during 18 hr of incubation in pure oxygen at 1 atm, but about 40 % of the bacteria recovered to produce colonies upon reincubation in air. Similar killing was produced by 10 hr of oxygen exposure. No inhibition or killing was observed with two other strains. Streptomycin (1 μg/ml) and kanamycin (5 μg/ml) were more effective in killing the oxygen-sensitive strain in the presence of 60 to 70 % oxygen than in air, but polymyxin B (5 μg/ml) did not show a synergistic effect under such conditions...|$|R
