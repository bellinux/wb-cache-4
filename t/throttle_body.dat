25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s accelerator pedal is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the pedal to the engine’s <b>throttle</b> <b>body.</b> In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its rate of travel.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} engine weighs {{less than}} the O-235 and incorporates a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> injector system with a tuned intake manifold and dual electronic ignition, or optionally a carburetor {{in place of the}} <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> injector to save further cost and weight. The engine has a 2400-hour time between overhauls. Additional features include a lightweight 14 volt alternator, an optimized oil sump, a streamlined accessory housing, a lightweight starter and roller tappets.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} {{chambers}} in the fuel regulator {{portion of the}} carburetor. They are referred to by letters A, B, C, and D, with the A chamber closest to the <b>throttle</b> <b>body.</b> The fuel metering servo valve responds to pressure differentials across the diaphragms separating the chambers. The resulting diaphragm movement controls fuel flow into the engine under all flight conditions.|$|E
25|$|A further {{refinement}} to the facelift {{range was}} via the two GX models, with a 3mm wider bore in the <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> (increased from 60mm to 63mm and mated to the plenum bore), helping {{to provide the}} additional 10PS over the earlier GR model engine. Whilst the GR model only continued to offer 4-speed auto and 5-speed manual into the 'facelift' era, the GX Sport and GX Sport Aero upgrade came either as 5-speed manual or 5-speed auto. On the GS and GR models aircon operation became manual from Feb 1997.|$|E
25|$|The <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> is {{the main}} portion of the carburetor. This portion {{contains}} one or more bores through which all of the air flows into the engine. Each bore contains a number of throttle plates which are used by the pilot to control the air flow into the engine. A venturi is also installed in each bore. The impact tubes are mounted in each venturi, placing them directly {{in the path of}} the incoming air. All of the remaining main portions are attached to the body, and are interconnected with internal passages or external tubes or hoses.|$|E

25|$|Most modern road use {{diesel engines}} are {{provided}} with an FRP valve in the intake manifold (usually mistaken {{by some as a}} petrol engine <b>throttle</b> <b>body).</b> In most basic applications this valve will close a flow of air mixture to the engine when the vehicle is switched off, preventing diesel engine runaway by starving the engine of oxygen; this will also make standard shutdown much smoother by eliminating compression and decompression rattle by making the pistons effectively work in vacuum. In more advanced control systems this FRP valve can be shut by an electronic control unit when it senses runaway scenario.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Aston {{introduced}} an aftermarket dealer approved upgrade path {{for power and}} handling of the 4.3-litre variants that maintained the warranty with Aston. The power upgrade was The V8 Vantage Power Upgrade, creating a more potent version of the Aston Martin 4.3-litre engine {{with an increase in}} Peak power of 20bhp to 400bhp while peak torque is increased by 10Nm to 420Nm. This consists of the fitting of the following revised components; manifold assembly (painted Crackle Black), valved air box, right and left hand side vacuum hose assemblies, engine bay fuse box link lead (ECU to fuse box), <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> to manifold gasket, intake manifold gasket, fuel injector to manifold seal, and a manifold badge.|$|E

2500|$|The fuel {{regulator}} portion takes input signals {{from various sources}} to automatically control fuel flow into the engine.

The outer end of the rod connects to the fuel metering servo valve that moves away from the <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> to open, allowing more fuel flow or toward the <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> to close, reducing the amount of fuel to flow. [...] The rod is moved by the forces measured within the four pressure chambers.|$|E
2500|$|The later City Turbo II's engine {{featured}} an intercooler, {{a revised}} intake plenum, a slightly larger <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> a modified inlet manifold, a higher AR turbo compressor, exhaust housings, {{and a slightly}} raised (7.6:1) compression ratio.

2500|$|Several Japanese models {{included}} an All Wheel Drive version (ATTESA). The engines {{used in the}} Japanese models ranged greatly in capacity and type. The SSS Attesa LTD model used a [...] "redtop" [...] SR20DET (154kW/206hp). This was a similar engine/drivetrain package to the Pulsar GTi-R (169kW). It had only a single <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> as opposed the GTi-R multiple <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> smaller bearings, hydraulic rather than solid lifters, and a smaller turbo. The GTi-R had a large top mount intercooler, while the SSS ATTESA LTD had a smaller front mount intercooler. The Bluebird SSS was set apart from the North American Altima in that not only having the SR20DET and AWD Attesa as an option, it also had power folding retracting mirrors (some heated) and a rear wiper if equipped with a spoiler.|$|E

2500|$|... 1989 {{marked the}} first year of a fuel-injected V8 engine. The 305cuin V8 was updated with <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> {{electronic}} fuel-injection (RPO LO3), first introduced in 1987 on Chevrolet/GMC pickups and vans. This engine was rated at [...] and , which was only a slight increase in torque over the carbureted engine. However, the cold weather starts, drivability, fuel economy and emissions were all improved as a result of fuel injection. The 4.3L V6 was no longer the base engine, and was now only available in taxi and police optioned Caprices. The 307 engine remained unchanged for station wagons. Rear-seat passengers received shoulder belts for the outboard positions and air conditioning was standard on all models.|$|E
2500|$|The engine line-up saw {{major changes}} for 1985. The 4.3L V6 engine (262cuin) with <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel {{injection}} (RPO LB4) replaced both 3.8L V6s in 1985 {{as the base}} engine for sedans and coupes. The 4.3L engine was rated at [...] and , producing [...] more than the 229cuin V6. The 4.3L V6 shared its bore and stroke with the 350cuin Chevrolet V8. This engine came standard with a three-speed automatic but was available with the four-speed automatic overdrive transmission. The 5.0L 305cuin V8 engine received an electronic spark control and compression was increased from 8.6:1 to 9.5:1. This caused the 305's output to jump to [...] The 350cuin diesel engine remained unchanged, as it was dropped in January.|$|E
2500|$|The Turbo-A was Toyota's {{evolution}} {{model for}} [...] Japanese Touring Car Championships (JTCC) {{all over the}} world which required a minimum homologation run of 500 units which were only sold in Japan and was produced between August and September 1988. Thus the term 88 Spec A. Some noted differences between the standard Supra 3.0 GT and the Turbo-A model are both cosmetic and mechanical. The stock CT-26 turbo had a slightly larger inducer and can be identified by a stamped [...] "E" [...] on the raised casting on the compressor housing. The turbo-A had a [...] <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> and accompanied larger diameter crossover pipe, instead of the standard 7M-GTE [...] and [...] "3000" [...] cast original unit.
