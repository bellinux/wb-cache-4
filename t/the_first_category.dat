The right to choose <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>category</b> had been determined by a draw won by Rutter. Watson, represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice, responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>category,</b> a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible. Watson's guess at the Daily Double location was correct. At {{the end of the}} first round, Watson was tied with Rutter at $5,000; Jennings had $2,000.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 15, the JTWC {{reported}} that Typhoon Choi-wan had intensified further {{and had become}} a Category 4-equivalent Super Typhoon whilst passing over the island of Alamagan. Later that day the JMA {{reported that}} Typhoon Choi-wan had reached its 10-minute peak wind speeds of 195km/h (120mph) and a pressure of 915hPa (mbar). Typhoon Choi-wan then intensified further and reached its peak 1-minute wind speeds of 260km/h (160mph) which made it <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Category</b> 5-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale {{anywhere in the world}} in 2009.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of riders, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées.

5|$|As in 1905, the cyclists {{were divided}} in two categories, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur {{machines}} poinçonnées, where the riders in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>category</b> {{were allowed to}} change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. In 1905, sponsors {{had not been so}} enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned that it had a commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poinçonnées category, because the average French citizen could identify more with them. In 1906, {{more than half of the}} cyclists started in the poinçonnées category, including Lucien Petit-Breton, one of the pre-favourites.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carol in 1953 was {{the strongest}} storm of the 1953 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Category</b> 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since the 1938 New England hurricane. Carol is also the first named storm to attain Category 5 status. Carol developed on August28 off {{the west coast of}} Africa, although the Weather Bureau did not initiate advisories until five days later. On September2, Carol attained hurricane status, based on a ship report. It moved northwestward, attaining peak winds of 160mph (260km/h), based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters. After weakening, it brushed Bermuda and turned northeastward near New England, passing west of Nova Scotia before making landfall near Saint John, New Brunswick on September7. While crossing Atlantic Canada, Carol became an extratropical cyclone, which dissipated on September9 southwest of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins {{that have been found}} in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>category</b> consists of punch-marked coins from Magadha (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up of coins from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category of coins, however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Gonzalo was {{the second}} {{tropical}} cyclone, after Hurricane Fay, to directly strike the island of Bermuda in a one-week time frame in October 2014, and was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Category</b> 4 Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Ophelia in 2011. At the time, it was the strongest hurricane in the Atlantic since Igor in 2010. Gonzalo struck Bermuda {{less than a week}} after the surprisingly fierce Fay; 2014 was the first season in recorded history to feature two hurricane landfalls in Bermuda. A powerful Atlantic tropical cyclone that wrought destruction in the Leeward Islands and Bermuda, Gonzalo was the seventh named storm, sixth and final hurricane and only the second major hurricane of the below-average 2014 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed from a tropical wave on October 12, while located east of the Lesser Antilles. It made landfall on Antigua, Saint Martin, and Anguilla as a Category1 hurricane, causing damage on those and nearby islands. Antigua and Barbuda sustained US$40 million in losses, and boats were abundantly damaged or destroyed throughout the northern Leeward Islands. The storm killed three people on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy. Gonzalo tracked northwestward as it intensified into a major hurricane. Eyewall replacement cycles led to fluctuations in the hurricane's structure and intensity, but on October 16, Gonzalo peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145mph (230km/h).|$|E
5|$|Since 1949, a more {{detailed}} classification system has been put into use based on thematic content and the historical period of a play's creation. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>category</b> in this system is chuantongxi, traditional plays that were in performance before 1949. The second category is xinbian de lishixi, historical plays written after 1949. This type of play was not produced at all during the Cultural Revolution, but is a major focus today. The final category is xiandaixi, contemporary plays. The subject matter of these plays is taken from the 20th century and beyond. Contemporary productions are also frequently experimental in nature, and may incorporate Western influences. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century, Western works have increasingly been adapted for Peking opera. The works of Shakespeare have been especially popular. The movement to adapt Shakespeare to the stage has encompassed all forms of Chinese theatre. Peking opera in particular has seen versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream and King Lear, among others.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Choi-wan was a {{powerful}} typhoon that became <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Category</b> 5 equivalent-super typhoon to form during the 2009 Pacific typhoon season. Forming on September 11, 2009, about 1100km (700mi) {{to the east of}} Guam, the initial disturbance rapidly organized into a tropical depression. By September12, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Choi-wan. The following day, rapid intensification took place through September14. Choi-wan attained its peak intensity on September15, as it moved through the Northern Mariana Islands with the Japan Meteorological Agency reporting peak windspeeds of 195km/h (120mph 10-minute sustained). Additionally, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported the storm to have attained winds of 260km/h (160mph 1-minute sustained). The typhoon remained very powerful until September17 when the storm's outflow weakened. The typhoon underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, leading to intensity fluctuations. By September 19, Choi-wan rapidly weakened as strong wind shear caused convection to diminish. The following day, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated several hours later over open waters.|$|E
