5000|$|A {{facelift}} in {{the autumn}} of 1992 saw the Cavalier's 1.4 L engine dropped and the [...] 2.5 L V6 added to the range. At this time the GSi 2000 was replaced by a new four wheel drive version badged simply [...] "Cavalier Turbo", with a turbocharged version of the sixteen valve engine producing over [...] Most of the range now had airbags and anti-lock brakes as standard (the first car in its class to do so) and all models were fitted with a <b>toughened</b> <b>safety</b> cage, side impact beams (providing additional longitudinal load paths) and front seatbelt pretensioners.|$|E
50|$|The H-class {{cars were}} {{progressively}} updated during the 1970s, {{again in the}} late 1980s and most recently (on five trams) in 2000. These included <b>toughened</b> <b>safety</b> glass in windows, replacing wooden panels with fibreglass, upgrading bogies, fluorescent lights inside the cars, and sealed-beam headlights and brake/hazard lamp clusters outside. In 1986 the trams were converted from trolley pole to pantograph operation. Despite the various refurbishments and upgrades, the overall character of the H-class trams has stayed very much as they were built. The interiors are still varnished wood and glass etched with MTT logos, and with no heating or air conditioning. Any remaining services are crew operated, with a driver and conductor on single cars, or a driver and two conductors on two-car sets.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} other car manufacturers, the early 1990s saw Vauxhall {{featuring}} safety as a selling point, {{and beginning to}} incorporate many new safety features into cheaper family cars that were previously only found on expensive luxury saloons. The Mark 3 Astra {{was one of the}} first such cars, being introduced ahead of the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Mondeo, two other cars with a similar new-found focus on safety. So, the Mark 3 saw the introduction of twin side impact bars, a <b>toughened</b> <b>safety</b> cage, a safely-designed steering wheel (with collapsible columns) and 'body-lock' mechanical front seat-belt pre-tensioners. After the first face-lift full-size drivers air bags became optional or standard (depending on the model). Crash tests by consumers association (as featured by BBC's Watchdog show in 1992) and also by ADAC and Auto Express showed that the Mark 3 Astra protected better in crashes than most rivals of its time.|$|E
5000|$|Witnessing {{the success}} of privately owned public {{transportation}} led to some reaction from the society. Local authorities responded by <b>toughening</b> <b>safety</b> and licensing requirements—like mandatory free transportation of {{a certain number of}} disabled passengers upon request and [...] "package deals" [...] in route licensing—tying the privilege to drive on a lucrative route to the chore of driving several not-so-profitable ones. The market became dominated either by large companies or by unions of owner-operators of individual minibuses. Some of municipal public transportation companies entered the business, and prices dropped due to increased competition.|$|R
500|$|On August 12, 2006 {{a granite}} {{monument}} memorial was built at Eastbrook Mobile Home Park, {{along with a}} new playground dedicated to the children lost in the tornado. It {{was part of a}} campaign launched by two parents that lost children in the tornado. In addition, Rep. Phil Hoy introduced a bill called [...] "CJ's law" [...] which mandates that manufacturers of mobile homes install an operating weather radio with a separate power outlet in order to alert residents. It was named after victim C.J. Martin, who was two years old. Vanderburgh County also passed legislation <b>toughening</b> <b>safety</b> standards for their 3,100 mobile homes, requiring them to be more securely anchored with additional straps and braces, to try to prevent another tornado disaster.|$|R
50|$|Pilkington, {{with its}} {{subsidiary}} Triplex Safety Glass, {{in which it}} gradually acquired a controlling interest, also became a major world supplier of <b>toughened</b> and laminated <b>safety</b> glass to the automotive, aerospace and building industries.|$|R
50|$|Glass sex {{toys are}} {{commonly}} made from clear medical grade borosilicate glass ("hard glass"). This {{particular type of}} <b>safety</b> <b>toughened</b> glass is non-toxic and will withstand extreme temperatures, {{as well as physical}} shock without compromising its structural integrity.|$|R
