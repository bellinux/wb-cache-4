5|$|As {{second in}} command of the SS and then Reichsführer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler was not {{involved}} with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> power. From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.|$|E

The Department of Justice also publicly issued an indictment against the Russian hacker Evgeniy Bogachev for his alleged involvement in the botnet. It was estimated that at least US$3 million was extorted with the malware before the shutdown.|$|E

5|$|Hitler was {{released}} on parole on 20 December 1924 and Hess ten days later. The ban on the NSDAP and SA was lifted in February 1925, and the party grew to 100,000 members in 1928 and 150,000 in 1929.

He also directed naval resources into threatening postures against mainland Spain to encourage the Spanish recall of a fleet destined for the Philippines.|$|E

On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine no-fly zone patrol in his F-16. While on patrol, O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near Mrkonjić Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many US officials, he may have been deliberately targeted so that the Serbs could take an American hostage.|$|E

5|$|All six ships served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of their careers, primarily in Africa and the south Pacific, where they assissted in the suppression of uprisings such as the Boxer Rebellion in China and the Sokehs Rebellion in the Caroline Islands. Cormoran participated in <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> the Kiautschou Bay concession in China in 1897, and Falke was involved in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03. Bussard and Falke were broken up for scrap in 1912, but the remaining four ships were still in service following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.|$|E
5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the Italian fleet {{for the first}} decade of their careers. They saw action in the Italo-Turkish War of 19111912, where they participated in <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> Cyrenaica in North Africa and operations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They were reduced to training ships by World War I, and both ships were lost with heavy death tolls during the conflict. Benedetto Brin exploded in Brindisi in September 1915, and Regina Margherita struck a mine and sank in December 1916.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the East Asia station with the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{played a major role}} in <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> the Kiautschou Bay {{concession}} in November 1897. Both ships returned to Germany at the turn of the 20th century, and remained in European waters until 1914, when they were removed from active service. They were reduced to secondary roles then, and continued to serve until the early 1920s, when they were sold for scrap.|$|E

Ziskin was convicted of smuggling 700 pounds of ecstasy into Southern California via FedEx and other various shipping companies, the largest-ever United States government <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug and subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment.|$|R
5|$|Both ships {{took part}} in the Italo-Turkish War in 1911–1912 in the 3rd Division with the two s. Emanuele Filiberto {{took part in}} the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, though Ammiraglio di Saint Bon did not see action in the first months of the war. Both ships participated in <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> the island of Rhodes, where Ammiraglio di Saint Bon {{provided}} gunfire support to the soldiers ashore.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} von Spee withdrew his ships, large {{portions}} of the town had been destroyed. Two entire blocks of Papeete had burnt to the ground before the fires were finally put out. A copra store, a market, and several other buildings and residences were among those destroyed by the shellfire and resulting inferno. While the majority of Papeete's civilians fled to {{the interior of the}} island as soon as the fighting began, a Japanese civilian and a Polynesian boy were both killed by German shellfire. Although the two French vessels in the harbor had been sunk, there were no military casualties on either side and the German vessels took no damage. Overall, the bombardment was estimated in 1915 to have caused over 2million francs' worth of property damage, some of which was recouped through <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> a German store on the island. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> their property, several local Germans were interned and forced to repair the damage von Spee's squadron had caused. Perhaps the most lasting effect of the bombardment on the French was the dramatic fall of copra prices in the region, as local suppliers had previously sold a majority of their produce to German merchants in the area who were now interned. Further havoc and distress spread throughout the island 18 days after von Spee's squadron had left, when rumors started to spread that a second German bombardment was about to begin.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl {{was also}} {{deployed}} to Spain during an insurrection in 1873, {{during which she}} assisted in <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> three rebel vessels in two engagements.

She was renamed Neptun in 1902 and used as a harbor ship until June 1905, when she {{was removed from the}} naval register. The following year, she was sold to ship breakers in the Netherlands and dismantled for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{inherited}} a vast fortune and a prosperous economy {{from his father}} Henry VII, who had been frugal and careful with money. This fortune was estimated to £1,250,000 (£375million by today's standards). By comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms. Although he further augmented his royal treasury through <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> church lands, Henry's heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy.|$|E
