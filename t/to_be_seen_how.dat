Unlike Initiative 502, Amendment 64 allows personal cultivation (of up to 6 plants). Both provide for commercial cultivation and sales, subject to regulation and taxes.

500|$|In Eric Shanower's graphic novel Age of Bronze, {{currently}} {{still being}} serialised, Troilus is youthful {{but not the}} youngest son of Priam and Hecuba. In the first two collected volumes of {{this version of the}} Trojan War, Shanower provides a total of six pages of sources covering the story elements of his work alone. These include most of the fictional works discussed above from Guido and Boccaccio down to Morley and Walton. Shanower begins Troilus' love story with the youth making fun of Polyxena's love for Hector and in the process accidentally knocking aside Cressida's veil. He follows the latter into the temple of Athena to gawp at her. Pandarus is the widow Cressida's uncle encouraging him. Cressida rejects Troilus' initial advances not because of wanting to act in a seemly manner, as in Chaucer or Shakespeare, but because she thinks of him as just a boy. However, her uncle persuades her to encourage his affection, in the hope that being close to a son of Priam will protect against the hostility of the Trojans to the family of the traitor Calchas. Troilus' unrequited love is used as comic relief in an otherwise serious retelling of the Trojan War cycle. The character is portrayed as often indecisive and ineffectual as on the second page of this episode sample at the official site [...] It remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> Shanower will further develop the story.|$|E

In March 2012 Stephen Pritchard echoed the BBC Micro successor sentiment in ITPRO. Alex Hope, co-author of the Next Gen report, is hopeful that the computer will engage children with the excitement of programming.

2500|$|The Quantification Settlement Agreement and the Salton Sea {{restoration}} {{have increasingly}} been discussed {{within the larger}} framework of the California water crisis in 2015. The use of water for agricultural purposes has been discussed and debated, as approximately 80% of all California water use {{can be attributed to}} agricultural needs, most notably in the Central Valley and the rural areas of Imperial County. However, there are indications that Californians are aware of this crisis, and Los Angeles Times reporter Jay Famligietti noted that [...] "A recent Field Poll showed that 94% of Californians surveyed believe that the drought is serious, and that one-third support mandatory rationing." [...] Reflecting these concerns, California Governor Jerry Brown announced new restrictions on water use in the state in 2015. These restrictions, delivered in an executive order, [...] "directed the State Water Resources Control Board to impose a 25% reduction on the state's 400 local water supply agencies, which serve 90% of all California residents, over the coming year." [...] It remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> this will affect the Quantification Settlement Agreement, as well as the environmental future of the Salton Sea.|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack also {{received}} positive critical responses.

Chennai online stated that [...] "The entire album gives an upbeat electro sense and wings to our imaginations. The music is convinced to grow on you, if not an instant hit." [...] A review by Music Aloud said, [...] "While the soundtrack of Enthiran has enough fodder to delight a connoisseur, it remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> much its sophistication will appeal to the masses, who are after all Rajinikanth's primary target." [...] Behindwoods reviewed the music saying, [...] "Yes, it exasperates you when you listen for the first time. But as you listen again, you realize that though Rahman gives this album a crisp metallic touch {{in keeping with the}} theme of the story, he still remains faithful to his Carnatic roots in a touching way. Watch how cleverly he varies the feel of the normal duets and robo-based duets. The lyrics are interesting too. If the listener shakes off his conditioned thinking while listening to this album, he is in for a treat." [...] Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff commented that, [...] "Enthiran is, in fact, a perfect superstar album. Where the collection does manage to veer from the usual, Rahman has managed to add his own quirky, creative notes to the songs." ...|$|E
