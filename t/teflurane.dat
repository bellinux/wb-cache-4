50|$|Halopropane (synonym FHD-3, {{trade name}} Tebron) is a {{halocarbon}} drug which was investigated as an inhalational anesthetic but was never marketed. Its clinical development was terminated {{due to a}} high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients, similarly to the cases of <b>teflurane</b> and norflurane.|$|E
40|$|<b>Teflurane,</b> a {{halogenated}} hydrocarbon anaesthetic, was compared with approximately equipotent concentrations of cyclopropane and halothane in studies made in cats. It induced spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias {{in a higher}} proportion of animals than halothane, these irregularities being abolished by the intravenous injection of pro-pranolol. <b>Teflurane</b> caused a profound lowering of arterial blood pressure in all the animals studied. As with halothane there was no significant increase in plasma cate-cholamine level when <b>teflurane</b> was inhaled. Respiratory and metabolic acidosis contributed to a lowering of plasma pH during <b>teflurane</b> anaesthesia. The inhalation of cyclopropane was accompanied by similar changes, whereas halothane caused some respiratory but only slight metabolic acidosis when high concentrations were given to the spontaneously breathing cat. <b>Teflurane,</b> 1, 1, 1, 2, tetrafluoro- 2 -bromethane, is a non-inflammable and non-explosive inhalational anaesthetic, the chemical structure of which bears a close resemblance to halothane (fig. 1). The compound has a low boiling point (8 Â°C) and since it is stored under pressure in liquefied form in metal cylinders, a vaporizer is not re-quired for its use. On this account and because the inhaled anaesthetic concentrations of the two agents are roughly comparable, <b>teflurane</b> has been referred to as "non-explosive cyclopropane". The new agent has a blood/gas partition coefficient of 0. 6 and produces rapid induction and allows rapid recovery from anaesthesia. In an early clinical study Artusio and Van Poznak (1961) found that a 50 per cent mixture of <b>teflurane</b> with oxygen was suitable for in-duction of anaesthesia, and a 25 per cent mixtur...|$|E
40|$|In {{the search}} for new {{volatile}} anaesthetics to supersede trichloroethylene and halothane, a number of agents have been introduced into clinical anaesthesia and {{after a period of}} use have been found wanting. Methoxyflurane, after a slow and uncertain start, has found a limited use, mainly in obstetric analgesia. Fluioxene, <b>teflurane</b> and halopropane are virtually unknown in Europe. Two fluorinated methyl ethyl ethers, enflurane and its structural isomer isoflurane, have been studied widely in experimental animals and man, and show considerable promise as alternatives to halothane and trichloroethylene. Eleven years after the reports of its first clinical trials in the U. S. A. (Virtue et al., 1966) and nearly 5 years after its introduction as a clinical anaesthetic in North America, Australasia and the rest of Europe, there is now a possibilit...|$|E
40|$|Sympathetic {{activity}} was recorded {{before and during}} administration of various anaes-thetic drugs, in animals of various species ventilated mechanically and given chloralose. Intravenously injected sodium bicarbonate solutions raised the discharge level transiently. Thiopentone and pentobarbitone depressed the discharge, as did methoxyflurane and Ethrane; hypotension with Ethrane was not directly attributable to central sympathetic inhibition. The {{activity was}} increased markedly by diethyl ether and chloroform, {{to a lesser extent}} by trichloroethylene, and erratically by <b>teflurane.</b> An increase in sym-pathetic discharge usually occurred on the addition of nitrous oxide to those agents which lowered activity. Ether caused significant preganglionic sympathetic excitation in cats subsequent to cervical cord transection. In recent laboratory studies, we have described central sympathetic excitation by cyclopropane (Price et al., 1969), and a lack of correlation be-tween preganglionic discharge and arterial pres-sure during halothane administration (Millar e...|$|E
