40|$|Abstract: Base on {{analyzing}} the design demand of the <b>return</b> <b>system</b> in the ball screws, combining the sine curve and the quintic parabola curve, this paper introduces {{a new type}} of curve for steel balls used in heavy load bearings. By computing and programming in Matlab, this paper gets the sine-quintic parabola curve and conducts the kinematic simulation based on it. The results show that the balls can {{get in and out of}} the <b>return</b> <b>system</b> continuously and cause low impulse force on the <b>return</b> <b>system.</b> The highest impulse force happens when the balls access the <b>return</b> <b>system.</b> All this results can contribute for the later design and research of the internal circulation <b>return</b> <b>system.</b> The internal circulation is widely used in the ball screw pairs under aerospace systems with a compact structure. In this circumstance, the ball screw pairs are in motion in short time and overload, so the <b>return</b> <b>system</b> is a key part in the whole <b>system.</b> Whether the <b>return</b> <b>system</b> is designed logically and manufactured well directly determines the reliability of the ball screw pairs, and its failure will cause serious results. 1. The design demand of the <b>return</b> <b>system</b> Under the aerospace circumstance of short time and overload, server impact and impulse may occur between the steel balls and the screw groove while the steel balls get in and out of the retur...|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} have made various {{efforts to reduce}} tax non-compliance and the related compliance costs. These efforts include a pre-filled <b>return</b> <b>system</b> that no longer requires taxpayers to fill-up their tax return form. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine the viability of a pre-filled <b>return</b> <b>system</b> for Malaysia. Specifically, five critical success factors suggested by the Organisation for Economic and Co-operation Development are examined in the Malaysian context. It is found that the pre-filled <b>return</b> <b>system</b> could prove viable due to the existing accurate withholding system, high integrity taxpayer identifiers and effective use of technology. The biggest challenge is posed by the need for comprehensive systems of third-party reporting to the revenue body and compatible legislative framework. The paper concludes that under the current Malaysian tax structure, a partially pre-filled <b>return</b> <b>system</b> is a more viable choice; a fully pre-filled <b>return</b> <b>system</b> is possible for higher detection of non-compliance...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} goods like {{seasonal}} fashion apparel is uncertain but {{the lead time}} needed for production is long, {{and so it is}} necessary to set the production quantity before the demand is fully known. Once sale begins, if demand is less than anticipated, the price will be low. In a futile attempt to avoid losses themselves, a competitive retail industry selling such merchandise will order too little, which will diminish the producer profit. A <b>returns</b> <b>system</b> is one response but it has problems also. Under a <b>returns</b> <b>system</b> in which retailers are fully reimbursed by the producer for any unsold merchandise, retailers will set their order quantities at the highest level allowed, which is also sub-optimal. So what to do? A slightly more sophisticated <b>returns</b> <b>system</b> is the answer. We show that a <b>returns</b> <b>system</b> with rebates implements the optimal production and sales strategy, attaining maximum expected profit in the channel. ...|$|R

Freehand Ultrasound technique is widely used in intraoperative biopsy procedures for detecting the volumes of interest. Freehand ultrasound probe is faster and flexible with 6 degrees of freedom. Thats why the imaging system must be calibrated in 3 D space before integrating it with Robotics Biopsy System. In this paper we present a 3 D space calibration method using a multipoint cross-wire phantom. The Ultrasound probe is attached to a robotic manipulator arm which moves it over the phantom in precise steps of distances and angles. The position and orientation of the probe is tracked by an optical tracking system. Optical markers are placed on the probe, phantom tank and the validation needle. The optical <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> <b>returns</b> the position and orientation of the reference frames attached to these optical markers. The location of threads with reference to the frame of Ultrasound probe is found using this information. These values and the values returned by a mathematical model of the calibration box are used to construct the calibration matrix. The whole system is automated so it can process high number of frames which makes it rapid and more accurate. This process is used to calibrate the space for an automated needle insertion biopsy robot. The accuracy of the system was checked by a validation needle in 3 D space. RMS error of the experiment groups on average was 1. 67 mm. TÜBİTA...|$|R
