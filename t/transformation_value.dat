The basic {{principle of the}} frequency domain method is to use some algorithms in the image frequency domain to perform some operations on the image <b>transformation</b> <b>value</b> and then change {{it back to the}} spatial domain.

Antioxidant assay was based on the measurement of 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) absorbance at 517 nm caused by the reaction of DPPH with the test sample, and also on the measurement of 2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid (ABTS) absorbance at 734 nm caused by the reaction of ABTS with the test sample. Results: Spectrophotometric analysis indicates that the content of total phenol compounds in the extracts varied from 90. 26 to 118. 84 mg GAE/ 100 g of fresh mulberry fruit.
