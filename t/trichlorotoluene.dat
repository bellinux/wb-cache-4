50|$|Benzotrichloride, {{also known}} as <b>trichlorotoluene</b> is an organic {{compound}} with the formula C6H5CCl3. It is principally used as an intermediate {{in the preparation of}} other chemical products such as dyes.|$|E
40|$|The tecB gene, located {{downstream}} of tecA and encoding tetrachlorobenzene dioxygenase, in Ralstonia sp. strain PS 12 was cloned into Escherichia coli DH 5 Î± {{together with}} the tecA gene. The identity of the tecB gene product as a chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase was verified by transformation into the respective catechols of chlorobenzene, the three isomeric dichlorobenzenes, as well as 1, 2, 3 - and 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzenes, {{all of which are}} transformed by TecA into the respective dihydrodihydroxy derivatives. Di- and <b>trichlorotoluenes</b> were either subject to TecA-mediated dioxygenation (the major or sole reaction observed for the 1, 2, 4 -substituted 2, 4 -, 2, 5 -, and 3, 4 -dichlorotoluenes), resulting {{in the formation of the}} dihydrodihydroxy derivatives, or to monooxygenation of the methyl substituent (the major or sole reaction observed for 2, 3 -, 2, 6 -, and 3, 5 -dichloro- and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorotoluenes), resulting in formation of the respective benzyl alcohols. All of the chlorotoluenes subject to dioxygenation by TecA were transformed, without intermediate accumulation of dihydrodihydroxy derivatives, into the respective catechols by TecAB, indicating that dehydrogenation is no bottleneck for chlorobenzene or chlorotoluene degradation. However, only those chlorotoluenes subject to a predominant dioxygenation were growth substrates for PS 12, confirming that monooxygenation is an unproductive pathway in PS 12...|$|R
