5|$|Periyar {{felt that}} {{a small number of}} cunning people created caste distinctions to {{dominate}} over society, so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that caste system had been stifling self-respect and therefore he or she would strive <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> menace.|$|E

25|$|The {{first part}} of the closing of the line was the attempt {{to get rid of the}} {{requirement}} to operate passenger trains. The original permit to operate the line included a requirement to operate passenger transport on the line, but as early as in the 1930s the company tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> obligation. But it was not until 1963 that the passenger traffic was terminated. By then the company had managed to convince the authorities that a bus route would be more suitable on the stretch between Orkanger and Løkken.|$|E

500|$|Rosenblat {{was given}} the storyline that ties up the second season. The scenes feature Miss Rosa being told that {{she is going to}} die from her cancer. Fellow inmate and prison van driver Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) feels sorry for her and exits the van urging Miss Rosa to escape. The final scene {{features}} Miss Rosa driving away when she notices Vee also making an escape from prison. Recalling an earlier altercation with Vee, Miss Rosa careens the vehicle at Vee killing her instantly. Rosenblat told Silman that she joyfully screamed in the bathroom for five minutes when she learned of her character's actions. She added [...] "After all this effort <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> woman, just evil incarnate, you know, and then I stroll along in my van. [...] 'So rude, that one.' Amazing. That final scene was really great." [...] During the scene Miss Rosa morphs into her younger incarnation as she becomes free once again. Rosenblat recalled the logistics of filming having to swap backwards and forth with Andujar to create the same position behind the wheel.|$|E
500|$|The UK {{announced}} {{a test of}} opinion in Rhodesia to be undertaken by a four-man commission headed by the veteran judge Lord Pearce. All four population groups—black, white, coloured (mixed) and Asian—would have to approve the terms for Britain to proceed. ZANU and ZAPU supporters quickly formed the African National Council (later the United African National Council, or UANC) to organise and co-ordinate black opposition to the deal. Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the first black man to have been ordained as such in Rhodesia, was installed as the movement's leader. The Pearce Commission finished its work on 12 March 1972 and published its report two months later—it described white, coloured and Asian Rhodesians as in favour of the terms by 98%, 97% and 96% respectively, and black citizens as against them by an unspecified large majority. This came as a great shock to the white community [...] "and a deep disappointment to those in Britain who hoped <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tiresome albatross", Blake records. Smith condemned the Pearce Commissioners as [...] "naive and inept". The UK withdrew from negotiations, but neither government abandoned the accord entirely. [...] "I would ask them [...] to look again very carefully at what they rejected," [...] Douglas-Home told the House of Commons; [...] "the proposals are still available because Mr Smith has not withdrawn or modified them." ...|$|E

It is true; he took no part in the political contest, but contented himself with the performance of his duties as a citizen and an officer. But he was an offensive member of the service, and the quacks determined to amputate him." ...|$|E

Although the wound had healed, he would {{experience}} pain in the bone whenever there was a heavy downpour. A physician told him, [...] "The arrowhead had poison on it and the poison had seeped into the bone. The way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> problem is to cut open your arm and scrape away the poison in your bone." [...] Guan Yu then stretched out his arm and asked the physician to heal him. He then invited his subordinates to dine with him while the surgery was being performed. Blood flowed from his arm into a container below. Throughout the operation, Guan Yu feasted and drank wine and chatted with his men as though nothing had happened.|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Semyon Vengerov {{quoted a}} source who knew Pisemsky closely as having called Yekaterina Pavlovna [...] "a perfect {{literary}} wife who took {{very close to}} her heart all the literary anxieties and troubles of her husband, all the jigsaws of his creative career, cherishing his talent and doing whatever was possible {{to keep him in}} conditions favourable to the development of his talent. Add to all this a rare leniency, of which she had to have a great deal of, to put up with Aleksey, who occasionally demonstrated qualities not congenial with being a family man." [...] Ivan Turgenev, in one of his letters, imploring Pisemsky <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> spleen of his, wrote: [...] "I think I've told you this once, but I might as well repeat it.

2500|$|After the War, in 1856, {{on the day}} of his Coronation, Alexander II {{appointed}} Tolstoy as one of {{his personal}} aide-de-camp. It was only three years later that Tolstoy managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tiresome privilege which implied regular duties in the Palace, interfering with his now burgeoning literary career. [...] "You cannot imagine what a storm of rhymes rages in me, what waves of poetry are sweeping through me, longing to break free," [...] he {{wrote in a letter to}} Sophia Miller. Two thirds of Tolstoy's poetic legacy was created in the late 1850s. 1857 saw the publication of a large poem called The Sinner. It was followed by the more significant Ioann Damaskin, first published in Russkaya Beseda January 1859 issue. The poem, dealing with the nature of poetry and the poet's position in society, but also hinting at the author's personal plight, caused scandal. The head of the 3rd Department Prince Vasily Dolgorukov ordered the printing of the magazine to be stopped and for the poem to be removed. The Minister of Education Evgraf Kovalevsky personally permitted the publication, his rather daring decision causing a serious rift between the two departments.|$|E
