40|$|BACKGROUND: Technical and {{conceptual}} shortcomings of cuffed pediatric tracheal tubes have {{been pointed out}} in the past, all representing a potential risk for mucosal damage of the pediatric airway. In this study, cuffed pediatric tracheal tubes from different manufacturers were investigated with regard to the cuff shoulder design using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). METHODS: Cuffed pediatric tracheal tubes with the smallest internal diameter available were ordered from five manufacturers. SEM scans were performed from the <b>tube</b> <b>shaft</b> - cuff shoulder - tube cuff assembly and from the cuff shoulder alone. Each investigation was repeated in four samples of each tube brand. In addition, thickness of cuff membrane was measured. RESULTS: Major differences were found among the cuff shoulders investigated ranging from smooth transitions, softened borders to very sharp steps. There was also considerable difference in the thickness among the cuff membranes between the different tube brands ranging from 18 microm in polyurethane cuffs up to 90 microm in polyvinylchloride cuffs. CONCLUSIONS: Because the gap between the outer tracheal tube and the internal mucosal layer of the pediatric airway is often very narrow, some of the observed irregularities have the potential to injure the airway mucosa in pediatric patients, particularly during long-term use and firm fit of the tracheal tube in the airway. As cuffed tubes are increasingly used in small children, the observed irregularities in some tracheal tube brands may need to be improved and their safety should be proved by the manufacturers...|$|E

40|$|Microelectrodes, {{made from}} a Cl?-selective liquid ion {{exchanger}} previously used to measure putative Cl- fluxes in Lilium longiflorum pollen tubes, were characterized. The electrodes were poorly selective, possessing only about 10 -fold selectivity for Cl? over other anions tested. They had only 2. 4 -fold selectivity for Cl? over the anionic form of the H+ buffer, MES, indicating that the electrode can indirectly detect H+ gradients. Apparent anion influx was detected along the pollen <b>tube</b> <b>shafts</b> and at the grains while apparent anion efflux was detected near {{the tip of the}} tube. During oscillating growth, the peak of the oscillating apparent anion efflux at the tip occurred, on average, 7. 9 sec after the peak of the growth oscillations. Consideration of the previously characterized H+ fluxes in lily pollen grains and tubes, as well as the poor anion selectivity of the Cl? electrodes, indicates that the putative Cl? fluxes are in fact changes in the anionic concentration of the buffer resulting from H+ gradients and not changes in Cl? concentration. The claim of a central role for Cl? in lily pollen tube growth is further undermined by the fact that these tubes grow at the same rate if the Cl? content of the growth medium is reduced to trace levels (? 31 ?m), and that the grains have only small reserves of Cl?. These results lead to the conclusion that Cl? fluxes are not a significant component of pollen tube growth and Cl? itself is not required for growt...|$|R

40|$|Sediments offer {{microorganisms}} an unexplored {{numbers of}} niches {{with the opportunity}} to evolve specialized microbial communities. The small size of microbial niches in biogeochemical gradients in sediments called for a high resolution study of the populations. We applied a genetic fingerprint method, the terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP), to characterize the diversity of the 16 S rRNA gene present in thin sediment layers at which one TRF represents one operational taxonomic unit (OTU). A partial gene amplification and restriction enzyme digestion of the amplicon allows the detection of about 150 different fragments in an intensity range of 100 to 10000 relative fluorescence units as a picture of the richness and evenness of the bacterial community. The T-RFLP method was established for intertidal soft sediments from the Wadden Sea, the North Sea. The variations in the results were correlated to variations in individual steps of the method protocol. Restriction enzyme digest and digest analysis on a capillary sequencer correlated with a dissimilarity of about 20 % and 10 % in the obtained replicate datasets describing one pooled amplicon from one DNA sample after binning with a fixed window size of 0. 5 and 1 base pair, respectively. The biases in individual PCR reactions did not increase the dissimilarity after performing independent T-RFLP analyses from one DNA sample. The dissimilarity was partly caused by an imperfect binning. Working with a high resolution window size of 0. 5 bp, no starting point (50. 25, 50. 20, 50. 30 and 50. 65 bp) gave a perfect binning result. Some of identical TRFs were always binned into two different TRFs, thus creating an additional OTU. A window size of 1 bp with starting point 50. 50 bp gave similar dissimilarities. Although our results may require an improved binning technique to utilize the full biodiversity information in the profiles, the current T-RFLP technique clearly detected the biological variation in adjacent small sediment layers and can be used to characterize the microbial community in individual sediment layers. Eukaryotes offer and create a number of niches. The lugworm Arenicola marina is a bioturbator in marine intertidal sediments. The T-RFLP method was applied to investigate the bacterial community in the burrow of the lugworm A. marina. The U-shaped burrow is divided into three compartments: the vertical head <b>shaft</b> <b>tube</b> through which the surface sediment is sinking down and ingested by the lugworm, the horizontal gallery tube at where the lugworm relatively stays permanent inside the sediment and the vertical tail <b>shaft</b> <b>tube</b> through which the lugworm does defecation by moving backward until the tail reaches sediment surface and ejects characteristic fecal cast on the sediment surface. In the bulk sediment surrounding the U-shaped burrow, the sediment contained a number of different bacterial communities changing with depth. On the basis of an aerobic layer, a redox potential discontinuity (RDP) layer and an anoxic layer, the decreasing and the increasing TRFs over depth may represent surface and subsurface layer bacteria respectively at 0 - 2 cm and 2 - 10 cm depth. T-RFLP data suggested that the RDP layer is at 3 - 5 cm sediment depth, because the unique TRFs of the surface layer and subsurface layers were not found at this depth and the change of abundance of TRFs was fast. The T-RFLP analyses clearly grouped the microbial population in the head <b>shaft</b> <b>tube</b> with sediment surface populations. The tail <b>shaft</b> <b>tube</b> was populated by different populations; close to the surface dominated by the surface bacteria and below 3 cm dominated by the subsurface bacteria. The populations in the gallery tube were similar to those in the head and tail <b>shaft</b> <b>tube.</b> The richness in the gallery tube was the lowest but had the highest evenness. T-RFLP analyses of two mm-thick sediment layers from areas with A. marina and without A. marina also revealed a strong depth-dependence of the surface bacterial community composition. According to the T-RFLP analyses, {{the presence or absence of}} A. marina had no clear detectable influence on the microbial populations in the top two centimeter of sediment. Most likely, the increase presence of other burrowing animals in the A. marina exclusion areas seems to form highly similar biogeochemical environments for the development of bacterial communities...|$|R

The hazardous phenomena {{depend on the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>tube</b> structure {{and the extent of}} mining activity in the vicinity and, on the other hand, the dynamic processes which occur within rock strata. Among the processes which affect the rock mass structure is the rainfall water migration and erosion. The amount and rate of water flow within soil and bedrock in the specific area depend on time. The water saturation in rock formation is the main factor which determines the electric properties of geological environment. These phenomena can be used for monitoring erosion processes by electroresistivity or conductometric measurements. In the paper, experimental results of the tests car-ried out in an abandoned shaft site are described. The tests were performed in three series of measurements conducted using vertical electroresistivity sounding method (VES) in autumn, winter and spring. The results indicate significant changes of rock formation resistivity values due to change in seasonal condi-tions.

50|$|About 1834 {{he started}} the study and the {{geological}} investigation of his region - Sarthe and Mayenne. He never stopped working on them until his death. These investigations, and discussions with Louis Cordier, drove him to Anjou (Maine-et-Loire)where coal was craft mined.

METHODS: The authors analysed repair figures and possible causes of damage to 35 instruments sent for repair to a leading UK supplier over a 1 -year period, and calculated cost figures for maintenance of the instruments as opposed to repair and replacement costs. RESULTS: All damages were handling-induced and therefore did not fall under the manufacturer's warranty: 28 % were damaged by misfiring of the laser inside the instrument; 72 %, mainly crushing and stripping of the ureteroscope <b>shaft</b> <b>tube,</b> were likely to have occurred during out-of-surgery handling, washing and disinfection. Seventeen (4 %) instruments were not repaired and consequently taken out of service due to the extensive costs involved. Eighteen (51 %) ureteroscopes were repaired at an average cost of 10 833 USD. CONCLUSION: Damages to flexible ureteroscopes bear considerable costs. Most damages occur during handling between surgical procedures. Thorough adherence to handling procedures, and courses for theater staff and surgeons on handling flexible instruments may help to reduce these damages and prove a cost-saving investment.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, test and deliver a final {{manufactured}} manual wheelchair brake that would {{not interfere with the}} propulsion path of the user or injure the hand of the user in any way. Existing brakes often interfere with the individual’s propulsion stroke and require frequent adjustments. Some brakes also cause injuries to the hands that could potentially be avoided with a tuck-away brake system. The MQP team first studied the forces involved in wheelchair propulsion and the stroke patterns of an individual using the wheelchair to create a set of functional requirements for the final design. Then, twelve conceptual designs were generated that addressed the gears, the spokes, the grips, the toggle bar, the mount, and the locking mechanism of the brake system. A design matrix was applied to determine the final three brake designs and engineering drawings were produced to assist with manufacturing process. The brakes that were manufactured were the Modified Quadra, the Bicycle Brake, and the Sliding Toggle Brake. The Modified Quadra was made up of five parts including the <b>tube,</b> the <b>shaft,</b> the handle, the brass cap, and the knurl brake. The Bicycle brake was composed of the support tube, the brake arm, and the mounting bracket. The components of the Sliding Toggle brake were the base tubes, the telescoping link, the brass-bearing link, the mount, and the modified handle for a four-bar toggle brake. Each manufactured brake was tested and evaluated according to the design specifications and recommendations were made according to analysis of the results and consultation with students and caregivers at the Massachusetts Hospital School. The recommendations made for the Modified Quandra indicated that the angle of the brake should be minimized in order to decrease the amount of friction to allow smoother motion of the braking mechanism. Recommendations for the bicycle brake involved the use of a larger brake caliper to allow for better gripping of the brake, as well as easier adjustment by the user.
