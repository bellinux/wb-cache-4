[...] Roberts described the game as [...] "sick", adding [...] "I only recommend Soft & Cuddly to <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> cut your toenails with a carving knife!" [...] Douglas was critical of the game's themes; he described playing Soft & Cuddly as [...] "watching very large and unpleasant graphics jigging {{up and down like}} a box of offal". Tony Lee of Your Sinclair was more positive, stating, [...] "This is a very sick game indeed, but fortunately I have a very sick sense of humour." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's {{position}} in the Norwegian metal scene was controversial from the beginning. Bryzak writes that [...] "standing up for their faith in Life and Hope, Antestor received serious death threats during this time {{from some of the}} major bands and key players of the scene." [...] When asked if the band ever played with other groups in the black metal scene, Antestor said in a 2000 interview with Tcu zine: [...] "We played with some early form of the band Old Man's Child once. Apparently they expressed their opinion of us with their legs {{and walked out of the}} venue during our set. It was their way of saying 'screw you Christians.'" [...] In the liner notes of Martyrium, Antestor corresponds in a slightly bitter tone: [...] "For <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> despised us, disbelieved in us and misplaced your anger upon us, may God have mercy on your poor souls!" ...|$|E

[...] Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign, Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week (two weeks for TotalFark users) prior to June 1, to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on where things were broken. The primary reason for the redesigned site is {{to make it easier to}} use and more intuitive. The site's tagline was changed from [...] "It's not news, it's FARK" [...] to [...] "We don't make news. We mock it." [...] The music tab was also dropped, due to low usage – content was rolled into the Showbiz or Video tab, where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway. An overhaul to the Fark Mobile Web site was not done at this time, but Curtis did say that small changes would be implemented over time to make the mobile site more consistent with the overall design of the new site.|$|E

It is finally discovered that the hurler is in Africa, and Seagoon and Bluebottle travel there on a ship disguised as a train, done up like a boat and painted to appear like a tram. After the ship is destroyed by a mine which Eccles considers {{not to be a}} problem because [...] "it's one of ours", Neddie and Bloodnok are left adrift in a lifeboat.

2500|$|PlayStation Official Magazine {{gave the}} game an above-average 7 out of 10, complimenting the core {{shooting}} and production values, but criticizing its repetitive nature: [...] "A Star Wars-themed 3D shooter with some optional bounty hunting. Good fun, but it promised more." [...] IGN awarded the GameCube {{version of the}} game 8.3 out of 10, and the PS2 version 8.2. Praising the graphics, sound, length and level designs, they criticized {{the implementation of the}} bounty hunting system; [...] "The whole process is pretty clunky, and there should have been a way to streamline this to make it more fluid - especially in the heat of a battle when your mark is mixed in with four or five other opponents. It works the way it is for sure, but it certainly could have been fixed to be more intuitive than it currently is." [...] In the end, however, they found the game {{to be one of the}} better Star Wars tie-in games; [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter is a solid, if not technically challenged third-person action/adventure. Successfully combining our favorite aspects of the Star Wars universe with a clever stage design and a fantastic presentation, LucasArts has done a great job in suppressing the myth that games based on the Skywalker universe aren't any fun. A definite recommendation for Star Wars fans, Bounty Hunter isn't necessarily built for everyone, but for <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> out there <b>who</b> just can't get enough of this stuff, it's one of your better choices for this or any holiday season." ...|$|R
60|$|Again, {{in other}} of your classes, in Chemistry, in Astronomy, in Natural History, besides {{acquiring}} groups of facts, {{the student has}} {{a glimpse of the}} method by which they were discovered, of the type of inference to which the discovery conforms, so that the discovery of a new comet, the detection of a new species, the invention of a new chemical compound, each becomes a lesson of the most beautiful and impressive kind in the art of reasoning. And it would be superfluous and impertinent for me here to point out how valuable such lessons are in the way of mental discipline, apart from the fruit they bear in other ways. But here again the relation to the judgments we have to form in the moral, political, practical sphere, is too remote and too indirect. The judgments, in this region, of the most brilliant and successful explorers in physical science, seem to be exactly as liable to every kind <b>of</b> fallacy as <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other people. The application of scientific method and conception to society is yet in its infancy, and the Novum Organum or the Principia of moral and social phenomena will perhaps not be wholly disclosed to any of us now alive. In any case it is clear that for the purposes of such an institution as this, if the rules of evidence and proof and all the other safeguards for making your propositions true and relevant, are to be taught at all, they must be taught not only in an elementary form, but with illustrations that shall convey their own direct reference and application to practical life. If everybody could find time to master Mill's Logic or so instructive and interesting a book as Professor Jevons's Principles of Science, a certain number at any rate of the bad mental habits of people would be cured; and for <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> here <b>who</b> have leisure enough, and want to find a worthy keystone of your culture, {{it would be hard to}} find a better thing to do for the next six months than to work through one or both of the books I have just named--pen in hand. The ordinary text-books of formal logic do not seem to meet the special aim which I am now trying to impress as desirable--namely, the habit of valuing, not merely speculative nor scientific truth, but the truth of practical life; a practising of the intellect in forming and expressing the opinions and judgments that form the staple of our daily discourse.|$|R

The {{impartiality}} {{with which}} I have stated the acts, {{so far as}} known to me, and impulses, so far as discernible by me, of the contending Church and Empire, cannot but give offence, or provoke suspicion, in the minds <b>of</b> <b>those</b> among <b>you</b> <b>who</b> are accustomed to hear the cause of Religion supported by eager disciples, or attacked by confessed enemies. My confession of hostility would be open, if I were an enemy indeed; but I have never possessed the knowledge, and have long ago been cured of the pride, which makes men fervent in witness for the Church's virtue, or insolent in declamation against her errors. The will of Heaven, which grants the grace and ordains the diversities of Religion, needs no defence, and sustains no defeat, by the humours of men; and our first business in relation to it is to silence our wishes, and to calm our fears. If, in such modest and disciplined temper, you arrange your increasing knowledge of the history <b>of</b> mankind, <b>you</b> will have no final difficulty in distinguishing {{the operation of the}} Master's law from the consequences of the disobedience to it which He permits; nor will you respect the law less, because, accepting only the obedience of love, it neither hastily punishes, nor pompously rewards, with what men think reward or chastisement.

Loos and company realized that Douglas Fairbanks' acrobatics were an extension of his effervescent personality and parlayed his natural athletic ability into swashbuckling adventure roles. His Picture in the Papers (1916) was noted for its wry style of discursive and witty subtitles: [...] "My most popular subtitle introduced {{the name of a}} new character. The name was something like this: 'Count Xxerkzsxxv.' Then there was a note, 'To <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> read titles aloud, you can't pronounce the Count's name.

2500|$|The {{increased}} attention {{for the film}} has also led to some news outlets to reconsider the mixed original reception of the film; Joe Queenan of The Guardian argued that [...] "No, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not breathtakingly self-indulgent and just plain awful; it is actually jaw-droppingly great. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> do not share this opinion are idiots."

The studio has brought Halos mechanics kicking and screaming into the modern era, while providing the most bombastic, co-op-driven campaign in Halo history." [...] GameSpots Mike Mahardy agreed that 343 had produced some of the best iterations of the game series' facets with Halo 5. IGN's Brian Albert opined that 343 Industries had created an even bigger game than previous entries, with [...] "the strongest combat Halo has ever seen". Destructoids Chris Carter felt that Halo 5 failed to grab him {{in the same way as}} previous games had, [...] "but <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> are still content with Master Chief and his wacky adventures across the galaxy will likely walk away satisfied."
