5|$|After {{moving to}} London, Stearn {{produced}} a steady output of publications {{during his years}} at the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library (1933–1952).

Within two years of joining the Library in 1933, he had produced his first major monograph, Lilies (1935), in collaboration with Drysdale Woodcock and John Coutts. This text, in an expanded and revised edition, as Woodcock and Stearn's Lilies of the World (1950) became a standard work on the Liliaceae sensu lato. While at the Library he also continued his collaboration with his Cambridge colleagues, publishing catalogues of the Herbarium collections, including the Catalogue of the Collections of the Herbarium of the University Botany School, Cambridge (1935).

5|$|Between late 2005–2006 Hwang {{was accused}} {{of a series of}} misconducts. The first {{allegations}} related to his work prior to Snuppy; the claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo. The charges alleged Hwang had paid for egg donations and that some of eggs came from his employees, which constitute serious breaches of <b>the</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> bioethics. It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem-cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all. This brought serious doubts onto the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed {{on the grounds that they}} were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his fabrications in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound. As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university.|$|E

5|$|In March 1896, the Matabele again rose {{up against}} the British South Africa Company {{administration}} in what became called the Second Matabele War or the First Chimurenga (liberation war).

The colonists' defenses in Matabeleland were undermanned due to the ill-fated Jameson Raid into the South African Republic (or Transvaal), and in {{the first few months of}} the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Selous. The Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the Matopos Hills near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting between Matabele warriors and settler patrols. It was also during this war that two scouts of very different backgrounds, Burnham and Baden-Powell, would first meet and discuss ideas for training youth that would eventually become the plan for the program and <b>the</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> honor for the Boy Scouts.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: In modern speech {{communication}} at low bit rate, speech <b>coding</b> deteriorates <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coded</b> speech significantly. Considering the dialects in Thai, <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> quality <b>of</b> {{four main}} dialects spoken by Thai people residing in four core region including central, north, northeast and south regions {{has not been}} studied. Approach: This study presents a comparative study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> quality <b>of</b> four main Thai dialects by using different low-bit-rate speech coders including the Conjugate Structure Algebraic Code Excited Linear Predictive (CS-ACELP) coder and <b>the</b> Multi-Pulse based <b>Code</b> Excited Linear Predictive (MP-CELP) coder. The objective and subjective tests have been conducted to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> quality <b>of</b> four main dialects. Results: From the experimental results, both tests show that <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> quality <b>of</b> North dialect is highest, meanwhile <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> quality <b>of</b> Northeast dialect is lowest. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> quality <b>of</b> male speech is mostly {{higher than that of}} female speech. Conclusion: From the study, it can be obviously seen that <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> quality <b>of</b> all Thai dialects are different...|$|R
