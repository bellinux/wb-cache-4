U.S. Navy submarines attempt to torpedo Y'ha-nthlei, but are stopped by a magical barrier protecting the city.

Jack finds another way in through ancient tunnels feared by the Deep Ones {{at the bottom of the}} city's foundations. Apparently, this passage, which leads to the temple, is an ancient prison for flying polyps, the enemy of the Great Race of Yith. Jack manages to defeat them with the help of a Yithian energy weapon. Jack then enters the Temple of Dagon and kills Mother Hydra - whose song is generating <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> - by deafening himself to her song, allowing him to take control of Deep Ones. With <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> down, the submarines attack the city, while Jack escapes through a portal leading back to the Order's headquarters and collapses in front of Hoover and Mackey.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> in <b>the</b> innovation process in Turkey’s conditions, investigate the interrelations among them and develop a model that can measure the interacting effects of <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> on <b>the</b> other <b>barriers</b> and in <b>the</b> innovation system. Since there has not been a research in the relevant literature, which has identified <b>the</b> innovation <b>barriers</b> in Turkey, a detailed review related with innovation barriers has been conducted. After identifying 32 internal and 29 external <b>barriers</b> from <b>the</b> literature review, the second step was to determine <b>the</b> valid <b>barriers</b> for Turkey. This validation was performed by means of a DELPHI study. After identification of 12 valid barriers for Turkey’s conditions, interrelations between 12 barriers were established by using ISM (Interpretive Structural Modelling). The research was conducted based on the opinions of the experts about innovation barriers. It was found that “finance of innovation” barrier affected all of <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> in Turkey. In order to increase innovation performance of Turkey, “finance of innovation” barrier should be settled.

To analyze the respondents 2 ̆ 7 personal and professional characteristics, cross tabulations were conducted on the demographic information and on the strategies.
