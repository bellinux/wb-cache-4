He took Philip into a large room next door to his own. There was a big desk in it, {{and a couple of}} big arm-chairs; a Turkey carpet adorned the floor, and the walls were {{decorated}} with sporting prints. Mr. Carter was sitting at the desk and got up to shake hands with Philip. He was dressed in a long frock coat. He looked like a military man; his moustache was waxed, his gray hair was short and neat, he held himself upright, he talked in a breezy way, he lived at Enfield. He was very keen on games and the good of the country. He was an officer in the Hertfordshire Yeomanry and chairman of the Conservative Association. When he was told that a local magnate had said no one would take him for a City man, he felt that he had not lived in vain. He talked to Philip in a pleasant, off-hand fashion. Mr. Goodworthy would look after him. Watson was a nice fellow, perfect gentleman, good sportsman--did Philip hunt? Pity, THE sport for gentlemen. Didn't have much chance of hunting now, had to leave that to his son.

5000|$|The American actor William Marshall {{performed}} {{the title role}} in at least six productions. His Othello was called by Harold Hobson of the London Sunday Times [...] "the best Othello of our time," [...] continuing: [...] "...nobler than Tearle, more martial than Gielgud, more poetic than Valk. From his first entry, slender and magnificently tall, framed in a high Byzantine arch, clad in white samite, mystic, wonderful, a figure of Arabian romance and grace, to his last plunging of the knife into his stomach, Mr Marshall rode without faltering the play's enormous rhetoric, {{and at the end}} the house rose to him." [...] Marshall also played Othello in a jazz musical version, Catch My Soul, with Jerry Lee Lewis as Iago, in Los Angeles in 1968. His Othello was captured on record in 1964 with Jay Robinson as Iago and on video in 1981 with Ron Moody as Iago. The 1982 Broadway staging starred James Earl Jones as Othello and Christopher Plummer as Iago, who became the only actor to receive a Tony Award nomination for a performance in the play.When Laurence Olivier gave his acclaimed performance of Othello at the Royal National Theatre in 1964, he had developed a case of stage fright that was so profound that when he was alone onstage, Frank Finlay (who was playing Iago) would have to stand offstage where Olivier could see him to settle his nerves. This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard to get). The film version still holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film - Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) and Joyce Redman (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for Academy Awards. Olivier was among the last white actors to be greatly acclaimed as Othello, although the role continued to be played by such performers as Donald Sinden at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1979-1980, Paul Scofield at the Royal National Theatre in 1980, Anthony Hopkins in the BBC Television Shakespeare production (1981), and Michael Gambon in a stage production at Scarborough directed by Alan Ayckbourn in 1990. Gambon had been in Olivier's earlier production. In an interview Gambon commented [...] "I wasn't even the second gentleman in that. I didn't have any lines at all. I was at the back like that, standing for an hour. It's what I used to do - I had a metal helmet, I had an earplug, and we used to listen to The Archers. No one knew. All the line used to listen to The Archers. And then I went and played Othello myself at Birmingham Rep I was 27. Olivier sent me a telegram on the first night. He said, [...] "Copy me." [...] He said, [...] "Do what I used to do." [...] Olivier used to lower his voice for Othello so I did mine. He used to paint the big negro lips on. You couldn't do it today, you'd get shot. He had the complete negro face. And the hips. I did all that. I copied him exactly. Except I had a pony tail. I played him as an Arab. I stuck a pony tail on with a bell on the end of it. I thought <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice.</b> Every time I moved my hair went wild." [...] British blacking-up for Othello ended with Gambon in 1990, however the Royal Shakespeare Company didn't run the play at all on the main Stratford stage until 1999, when Ray Fearon became the first black British actor to take the part, the first black man to play Othello with the RSC since Robeson.|$|E

40|$|Imagine {{that you}} are a Grade 4 {{mathematics}} teacher. It is the first day back after the Christmas holiday, and you are talking with your class before getting down to work. You ask if anyone had any 'mathematical ' presents. One boy says that he had been given a mathematical game from his uncle's country. He says it is very interesting, it has many variations, and he asks if he can show the class how it is played. What would you do? Would you let him show the class and see what develops? Would you say something like: "Well <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice,</b> but we don't have time now to do it, maybe later " or maybe: "Excellent, show me after the class, and I'll decide then if we can play it. " Are mathematical games a part of your teaching ideas? Would this game fit within your curriculum? Does that matter? In any case, you would probably make your choice in the way that you normally do, and not think much more about it. But the fact remains that you must make a choice, and that choice depends on your values. Here is another example. This happened to me many years ago, and I remember it well.

40|$|Transcription begins]:Wednesday Dearest Judson, Honey, I {{really should}} be {{addressing}} my Christmas cards now but you’re {{much more important than}} any old cards. Well, honey, first of all I have a lot to tell you. To begin at the beginning—I woke up at some ungodly hour of the morning. Oh, I just remembered something—censored [word crossed out underneath] Had the funniest dream last night. The only thing I can remember is that you and I were sailing someplace. It was a huge boat and we were having a marvelous time. Can’t remember any more. Well, that’s beside the point. Anyhoo—I got up this morning and slid to the doctors. Golly, it was so cold and slippery. I’ll bet you’re freezing to pieces up there. Stewart is so cold. They have the nicest tropical breezes blowing gently up there all the time—like at the Air Show. Well, first of all I had to wait half an hour to see the doctor. Some little boy had bashed his finger in the car and he was screaming {{at the top of his}} lungs. Well, the doctor gave my ankle a treatment. That took ages because the phone kept ringing and he had to run and answer it every few seconds. Then he started the examination—He scared me half to death because he kept frowning about everything. Well, you now are engaged to “death warmed over”—I might as well just give up trying to live. Wait til you hear all the things that I have wrong with me. Well, first of all I have low blood pressure. He said that wasn’t too bad because what may be low for one person may be quite all right for someone else. And guess what. Have you ever seen those ads where a girl is sitting looking very unhappy while another couple are laughing gaily in the background (not a Mum ad). Well, the girl it seems has borderline anemia. Well, guess who else has it—me. Can you imagine me anemic? Is that spelled right? Anyway he said it wasn’t bad. Something about hemogoblin [sic] in the blood. I’m 75 or something like that and normal is supposed to be 80. Borderline is between 70 and 80. Oh, well, that’s not all. This I knew about. I also have infected tonsils. He wants them out almost immediately. Probably after the first of the year. Before this epidemic of infantile it was considered best to be operated on in the warm weather but now cold weather is the best. The only danger is catching cold but that is much less a danger than getting infantile. So, probably as soon as you leave for advanced I’ll go and have them taken out. Well, hone, that’s about it. Have to gargle three times a day because my throat is red 2 ̆ 6 inflamed and they can’t operate until that goes away. Then I have to take care of my ankle and take those old iron pills and vitamins every day, too. Lord, I’m a walking drug store. Can you imagine me being anemic? That really struck me funny. It really isn’t a laughing matter but it did seem ridiculous. Honestly, I’m really a wreck. Well, outside of all those things I’m perfectly healthy. He didn’t give me a complete examination but he’s going to complete it when his nurse comes back. Lord, I started this two hours ago 2 ̆ 6 in the past two hours I’ve been talking to your Mom 2 ̆ 6 Woody. Golly, I haven’t told you that I love you at at [sic] in this letter. Setting a new record. Well, honey, it’s about time—I love you so. And miss you terribly. Honey, I’d better get started addressing Christmas cards now or they’ll never get there before Christmas. Woody is sorta mad because Steve hasn’t written yet. You should hear the excuses I’ve been making up for Steve. He should appreciate me more. Woody doesn’t understand why he hasn’t written 2 ̆ 6 I’m trying to explain how busy he probably is 2 ̆ 6 that he probably has already written 2 ̆ 6 that she’ll get a letter from him tomorrow. Write more later. This turned out to be quite a book, huh? Gee, honey, I got your letter before and it was marvelous to hear from you. I miss you so much and a letter from you is so wonderful. You can’t imagine how good your letters make me feel. Now that I practically have one foot in the grave you’d better keep writing a lot. Well, my darling, I really have to address those cards now or people will never get them before Christmas. I love you, hon. So far I’ve only addressed a third of them 2 ̆ 6 there are still millions more to go. This is really sad. Think that I just should give up. Can’t find anyone’s address. Honestly, honey, I never get around to doing anything that I plan. There were a million and one things that I should have gotten done today but didn’t do one thing except get Daddy’s presents for mother. I’ll have to get a job real soon. Been spending money like crazy lately. Just addressed a few more cards. It’s getting worse. Can’t remember who I should send cards to 2 ̆ 6 where they live. More fun. Gee, honey, it’s Wednesday and maybe you’ll be home day after tomorrow. I sure hope so anyway. It will be wonderful to be able to spend a few days with you. I hope we will be together for a couple of days but you never can tell about the Army. Honey, I love you so. Wish you were here now. It’s sorta cold now 2 ̆ 6 you’d be so nice to get warm with. You’re always so nice 2 ̆ 6 warm. My feet are awfully cold. If the old ankle doesn’t get any better by next Tuesday or Wednesday I have to have an exray [sic]. Hope it does. He doesn’t think it’s too bad because it doesn’t hurt me at all—oh, well. That’s nothing to worry about. Golly, this is some letter. Well, I enjoy writing when it’s to you, honey. I’d much rather see you but that’s beside the point. Honey, you just called. Golly, when the operator said Newburgh calling I was so scared. I was sure something was wrong. It was so wonderful to hear your voice, honey. Gee, I love you so. You sounded so happy, darling. Gee, I’m so excited about your getting that delay. That’s really wonderful. I sure am glad to hear that you’ll be home. Golly, honey, it’s so long since I’ve seen you really. Poor Woody—what a situation. I’m so glad that you 2 ̆ 6 I are all engaged and not wondering what’s going to happen next. Honey, the darned telephone has been ringing all evening. Every time I begin to write you it ring[s] 2 ̆ 6 I still haven’t finished addressing those cards. Gee, honey, I love you so. You’re so wonderful and sweet and thoughtful. I love you. Honey, I just couldn’t miss you any more or love you any more. Yet every weekend I love you more 2 ̆ 6 more. Steve told Woody that he might get off on Thursday or all day Friday. I sure wish you’d have all day Friday off. Golly, honey, I hope that we have a white Christmas too. That would just about make it complete. Oh, well, I’ll be happy, honey, if you’re with me. Don’t care what it does. Gee, I hope that wherever you go it won’t be too far away. How long does it take for anyone to go from here to Georgia? Honey, I’d love to go horseback riding. No matter how cold it is. I love riding. I’m afraid that they haven’t any two seaters with radio 2 ̆ 6 heaters. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice.</b> Yes, darling, I am going to wait until after Christmas to get my job. If you’re home do you think I’d be working any place while there was a chance to see you, honey[?] Don’t be silly. No, I’ll wait until you leave and have my tonsils taken out and then get a job after that. Darling, I love you so. Gee, I hate to be away from you. Have to go to New York again tomorrow and I’m certainly not looking forward toward it. Gee, I love you so much. My darling, I’ll be so happy when you 2 ̆ 6 I can be together and not have to be separated. I love you so. Thanks loads for giving Ruth the 2. 00 that she gave me. I’ll give it to you this weekend. Darling, I’d better stop writing because it’s getting awfully late. This sure turned out to be a real letter, didn’t it? Hope that you can read it—The way I’m scribbling, you probably can’t. Well, honey, please write as often as you can. Just a few more days—Two, I hope, and we’ll be together. Gee, that will be wonderful. I love you so. I told you that Ace may be home Saturday. Oh, well, I suppose we can walk. It’s about time. This certainly wasn’t a good time for me to hurt my ankle was it. Well, honey, I love you so. Please get home as soon as you can. Guess you will. Can’t find an envelope to match. Hope you don’t get color blind from this combination. I love you so. All my love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E
