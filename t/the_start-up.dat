While the Kodiaks ended operations in 1990, a new Junior A team was proposed in 2006 by Global Spectrum, the contracted management company responsible for operating the city's new South Peace Community Multiplex which included the EnCana Events Centre, capable of hosting ice hockey events with a seating capacity of 4,500 people. The objective was to create an anchor tenant which could help fill the Multiplex's schedule with several dozen home games per year.

30|$|This section {{analyzes}} the data provided from the 10 incubator firms. First, {{we describe the}} external networks of <b>the</b> <b>start-ups</b> that go beyond the incubator and stem from the tenants’ “private” path-dependent trajectory of personal or professional relations. Then, we explain the internal networking within the incubator; finally, we focus on extended network resources facilitated by the incubator management. In the analyses, we emphasize the general experience of <b>the</b> <b>start-ups,</b> and we attempt to reveal their network opportunities both within and beyond the incubator.|$|R
30|$|One {{possible}} {{reason is that}} the venture idea typically had its origins in previous work or R&D experience before the firms entered the incubator. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>start-ups</b> had extensive networks to draw on when establishing the venture, and searched their preexisting, path-dependent networks, which led to a path-dependent form of evolution that according to Hite and Hesterly (2001) is quite common for entrepreneurs. At the early stage of establishing an entrepreneurial team, <b>the</b> <b>start-ups</b> mainly drew upon identity-based networks, such as fellow students, researchers, or job colleagues. In the technology development phase, the firms relied on a mix of networks, both identity-based and more calculative and intentionally managed networks. During the late technology development phase, they needed other resources that were not available in previous networks, and they proactively and calculatedly searched for pilot customers and investors. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>start-ups</b> were able to shift to more calculative networks and to balance identity-based and calculative networks, in the manner emphasized by Hite and Hesterly (2001). Other studies of incubators and networking (e.g., Sá and Lee 2012) support our findings, noting that <b>the</b> <b>start-ups</b> “claimed that most of their strategic relations were established before locating at MaRS [the incubator] or through their own effort” (p. 248).|$|R

5|$|Waters {{attempted}} {{to subvert the}} Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name.

Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained {{the right to use}} the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} to lease two Boeing 737-300 aircraft from 1994 {{was made with}} International Lease Finance Corporation in May. Maintenance was outsourced to a British company, after Braathens, which also operated 737 Classic aircraft, had denied Color Air the use of its simulators and technical workshops. For <b>the</b> <b>start-up,</b> Color Air hired 18 pilots, 40 flight attendants and 40 ground employees, {{in addition to the}} administration. The company was criticized for only hiring women flight attendants. Braathens operated with an internal pension age of 58 years for its pilots, while SAS had a 60-year age limit. Due to EEA rules, the judicial age limit was 65 years, so Color Air was able to hire retired SAS and Braathens pilots. These could be paid only NOK500,000 in annual wage, since they received a full pension from their old employers on top of it. The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association stated that this was morally reprehensible, but Color Air was supported by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, medical experts, and SAS, who all claimed that there were no medical reasons to not let people in their 60s operate aircraft.|$|E

30|$|Access to {{financial}} resources was critical {{for most of}} the firms in the technology development phase. In addition to pilot customers, most entrepreneurs obtained grants from Innovation Norway. Generally, it was difficult to obtain financial resources from private investors, because early phase ventures were typically perceived as high-risk projects. Nevertheless, four of <b>the</b> <b>start-ups</b> had succeeded in attracting bank or industry investors, albeit for a limited period, while others {{were in the process of}} searching for investors. However, a number of <b>the</b> <b>start-ups</b> were skeptical of investors who anticipated a major influence over the venture’s future course. Some therefore preferred to maintain ownership control of their venture at this early stage as they perceived that “selling out” would also mean “losing control.” Research-based technology projects were often funded by research programs, while other complex technology projects without a research base typically struggled to obtain financial resources. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>start-ups</b> relied on various sources to finance the ventures’ early development and growth, such as public organizations (e.g., grants from Innovation Norway), the Research Council of Norway, regional banks, and other industrial investors.|$|R
