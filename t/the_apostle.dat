Use of the {{familiar}} iconography of his martyrdom, showing <b>the</b> <b>apostle</b> bound to an X-shaped cross, first appears in the Kingdom of Scotland in 1180 during the reign of William I. It was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century, including on one used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286.|$|E
5|$|Although the Gospel of John is anonymous, Christian {{tradition}} {{historically has}} attributed it to John <b>the</b> <b>Apostle,</b> son of Zebedee {{and one of}} Jesus' Twelve Apostles.

Before being called as a missionary he had married Harriet ("Hattie") Hatch and they were expecting their first child. His mission ended earlier than expected when he caught malaria and had to return home for his health. Once he had sufficiently recovered he was again called to help the church, but this time as a printer in Connecticut working alongside <b>the</b> <b>apostle</b> William Smith. While waiting in Connecticut {{to meet up with}} Smith, Brannan fell in love with Ann Eliza Corwin whose mother took care of the visitors in the local boarding house.

5000|$|Nunc, Sancte, nobis Spiritus is a Christian hymn {{which has}} {{traditionally}} been attributed to the fourth century St. Ambrose of Milan. However the earliest manuscript tradition for the hymn seems to only {{go back to the}} ninth century. [...] The hymn {{has traditionally been}} a core part of the prayers at Terce in the Liturgy of the Hours. The {{reason for this is that}} the Acts of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles</b> records an event at Pentecost where <b>the</b> <b>apostles</b> are filled with the Holy Spirit. The experience clearly causes <b>the</b> <b>apostles</b> to behave in an unusual way and in chapter 2 verse 15 the Acts of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles</b> states explicitly that <b>the</b> <b>apostles</b> were not drunk because it was only the third hour of the day (ie 9am). As the Acts of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles</b> was so explicit in linking the Pentecost experience of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles</b> to <b>the</b> third hour of the day, Christian hymns and prayers intended to be used at that time of the day, have traditionally made reference to the coming of the Holy Spirit.|$|R

5|$|Baptism in the Holy Spirit occurs {{elsewhere}} in Acts. The gospel had been proclaimed in Samaria and the apostles Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem. The new believers had been baptized in water, but the Holy Spirit {{had not yet}} fallen on them.

Numerous buildings in Georgetown, the Sussex County seat, were evacuated while crews checked for damage; the Emergency Operations Center there reported 200 calls to 9-1-1.

5|$|King St Stephen {{has been}} a popular theme in Hungarian poetry {{since the end of}} the 13th century. The {{earliest}} poems were religious hymns which portrayed the holy king as <b>the</b> <b>apostle</b> of the Hungarians. Secular poetry, especially poems written for his feast day, followed a similar pattern, emphasizing Stephen's role as the first king of Hungary. Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of the ability of the Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the Communist regime between 1949 and 1989.|$|E
5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile.

While <b>the</b> <b>apostle</b> Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E
5|$|Legend {{from the}} {{apocryphal}} Gospel of Thomas and other ancient documents suggests that Saint Thomas <b>the</b> <b>Apostle</b> preached in Bactria, which is today northern Afghanistan. The Nestorians planted Christianity in the area, {{and there have}} been nine bishops and dioceses in the region, including Herat (424-1310), Farah (544-1057), Kandahar, and Balkh. This early establishment of Christianity was overcome by Muslim invasions in the 7th century, though the territory was not substantially controlled by Muslims until the 9th and 10th centuries. In 1581 and 1582 respectively, the Jesuits Montesserat of Spain and Bento de Góis of Portugal were warmly welcomed by the Islamic Emperor Akbar, but there was no lasting Jesuit presence in the country.|$|E
