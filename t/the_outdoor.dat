40|$|Safety-compromising {{accidents}} occur {{regularly in}} <b>the</b> led <b>outdoor</b> activity domain. Formal accident analysis is an accepted means of understanding such events and improving safety.

This article presents {{an application of}} Rasmussen’s risk management framework {{to the analysis of}} the Lyme Bay sea canoeing incident. This involved the development of an Accimap, the outputs of which were used to evaluate seven predictions made by the framework. The Accimap output was also compared to an analysis using an existing model from <b>the</b> led <b>outdoor</b> activity domain. In conclusion, the Accimap output was found to be more comprehensive and supported all seven of the risk management framework’s predictions, suggesting that it shows promise as a theoretically underpinned approach for analysing, and learning from, accidents in <b>the</b> led <b>outdoor</b> activity domain. Statement of Relevance: Accidents represent a significant problem within <b>the</b> led <b>outdoor</b> activity domain.
