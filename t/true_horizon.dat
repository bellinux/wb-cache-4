40|$|Sharpe's, Treynor's and Jensen's {{measures}} have been extensively used for the performance evaluation of mutual funds or portfolios. These three widely used performance {{measures have}} been found to be highly correlated with their corresponding risk measures by a number of empirical studies. This paper focuses the investigation on the possible sources of the bias associated with the empirical relationship between the estimated Sharpe's measure and its estimated risk measure. In general, the sample size, the investment horizon and the market conditions are three important factors in determining the strong relationship between the ex-post Sharpe's measure and its estimated risk surrogate. The interesting findings of this study are as follows: (1) the estimated Sharpe's measure is uncorrelated with the estimated risk measure either when the risk free rate of interest equals the expected return on the market portfolio over the sample period or when the sample size is infinite, (2) the estimated Sharpe's measure is positively (or negatively) correlated with the estimated risk measure if the risk-free rate of interest is greater than (or less than) the expected return on the market portfolio, (3) an observation horizon shorter than the <b>true</b> investment <b>horizon</b> can reduce the dependence of the estimated Sharpe's measure on its estimated risk measure, and (4) an observation horizon longer than the <b>true</b> investment <b>horizon</b> will magnify the dependence.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} shown (Mitra,- astro-ph/ 9910408, astro-ph/ 0207056) that the timelike spherical {{collapse of a}} radiating, physical fluid in General Relativity, as seen by an interior co-moving observer at rest in the physical fluid, does not permit formation of ``trapped surfaces''. This followed {{from the fact that}} the formation of a trapped surface in a physical fluid would cause the timelike world lines of the collapsing fluid to become null at the would be trapped surface, thus violating the Principle of Equivalence in General Theory of Relativity. In this paper we generalize and extend this result by studying the problem from the point of view of the exterior Vaidya metric of a collapsing radiating fluid as seen by an exterior stationary observer, and find that the "no trapped surface condition" becomes g 00 > 0 consistent with that obtained for the interior co-moving metric.

On the other hand, the path integral over all topologically non-trivial metrics is asymptotically independent of the initial state.

40|$|Survey and {{experimental}} evidence suggest that most stockholders believe high past market returns predict high future market returns, {{even though the}} opposite is <b>true</b> over <b>horizons</b> longer than a few months. I argue {{that the presence of}} these extrapolative investors, combined with an elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) greater than unity, can resolve the equity premium and volatility puzzles. Extrapolators overreact to dividend news, generating high return volatility and countercyclical expected returns. Sophisticated investors with rational expectations respond by making their consumption growth more procyclical, justifying the high observed equity premium. Aggregate consumption growth, however, has low covariance with stock returns because it includes the consumption growth of extrapolators, who raise their savings rates in response to positive returns. Extrapolators further increase the equity premium because they do not realize that stocks are a hedge against lower future returns; thus, they have excessive demand for the riskfree asset. A general equilibrium model yields a high countercyclical Sharpe ratio and a low, stable riskfree rate that match U.

40|$|We use {{the general}} {{solution}} to the trace of the 4 -dimensional Einstein equations for static, spherically symmetric configurations {{as a basis for}} finding a general class of black hole (BH) metrics, containing one arbitrary function $g_{tt} = A(r) $ which vanishes at some $r = r_h > 0 $, the horizon radius. Under certain reasonable restrictions, BH metrics are found with or without matter and, depending on the boundary conditions, can be asymptotically flat or have any other prescribed large $r$ behaviour. It is shown that this procedure generically leads to families of solutions unifying non-extremal globally regular BHs with a Kerr-like global structure, extremal BHs and symmetric wormholes. Horizons in space-times with zero scalar curvature are shown to be either simple or double. The same is generically <b>true</b> for <b>horizons</b> inside a matter distribution, but in special cases there can be horizons of any order. A few simple examples are discussed.

This, certainly, refers to very large-mass systems that are to be described in the framework of classical (non-quantum) field theory (General Relativity or other classical theories of gravitation). Quantum properties of the black holes (BH in the following) were addressed some 30 years ago [2] with a conclusion that quantum effects lead to the thermal radiation from the BH with an effective “temperature ” inversely proportional to the BH mass. Quick evaporation of the BH with small masses caused some hopes that the “mini-BH ” may be relevant in the high-energy collisions of subnuclear particles, and the corresponding events could be observable due to the characteristic event shapes.
