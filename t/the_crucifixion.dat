50|$|Asher {{begins to}} go to art museums where he studies paintings. He becomes very {{interested}} in the paintings, especially the ones of <b>the</b> <b>crucifixions.</b> He starts copying the paintings of <b>the</b> <b>crucifixions</b> and nudes, but this would only get him into trouble. Asher’s father returned home one night after a long trip to Russia for the Rebbe. He then sees Asher’s paintings of the crucifix and nudes and is furious. Asher’s father thinks that his gift is foolish and from the Sitra Achra, or Other Side. Asher’s mother doesn’t know whether to support her son or her husband. She is torn between the two of them.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to estimate the year of <b>the</b> <b>crucifixion</b> of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD. The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be 33–36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of <b>the</b> <b>Crucifixion</b> by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both Julian).|$|E
50|$|In some cases, leftist and {{mainstream}} forums made no pretense {{of their traditional}} antisemitic sentiments. The standoff at the Church of the Nativity and the Greek Orthodox Easter season generated many analogies between the role of Jews (Israelis) in <b>the</b> <b>Crucifixions</b> of Christ (Arafat) and the Prophets (Palestinians).|$|R

5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to <b>the</b> <b>crucifixion</b> theme until his 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion. That {{depiction}} is a far more oblique and less literal utilisation of the iconography of the biblical scene, but a more direct invocation of imagery of the slaughterhouse and slabs of meat.|$|E
5|$|In the synoptics, the {{ministry}} of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. Events are not {{all in the same}} order: the date of <b>the</b> <b>crucifixion</b> is different, as is the time of Jesus' anointing in Bethany, and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.|$|E
5|$|Some {{writers have}} {{explained}} <b>the</b> <b>crucifixion</b> darkness {{in terms of}} sunstorms, heavy cloud cover, {{the aftermath of a}} volcanic eruption, or a khamsin dust storm that tends to occur from March to May. A popular work of the nineteenth century described it as an 'oppressive gloom' and suggested this was a typical phenomenon related to earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|The {{triptych}} summarises themes {{explored in}} Bacon's previous work, including his examination of Picasso's biomorphs and his interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>Crucifixion</b> and the Greek Furies.

5|$|A few sculptures, {{including}} Epimetheus and Pandora, {{have been}} attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, <b>The</b> <b>Crucifixion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{scientific}} fame, Newton's {{studies of the}} Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed <b>the</b> <b>crucifixion</b> of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the theme of <b>the</b> <b>crucifixion</b> for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E

5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling <b>the</b> <b>Crucifixion</b> of Jesus, {{he placed his}} hands to his temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E
5|$|Carter was {{interested}} in the possibility that extraterrestrials were involved in ancient mass extinctions on Earth and used these themes in the episode. Much of the episode was also inspired by Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ, and a scene showing an operation on Mulder has been thematically compared to <b>the</b> <b>Crucifixion</b> of Jesus. For the dream sequences, casting director Rick Millikan brought back many actors and actresses who had been absent from the show for several years, including Jerry Hardin as Deep Throat, Rebecca Toolan as Teena Mulder, and Megan Leitch as Samantha Mulder.|$|E
