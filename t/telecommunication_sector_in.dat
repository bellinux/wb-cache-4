40|$|During the 1990 s, the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>sectors</b> <b>in</b> most Latin American {{countries}} were privatized, liberalized and deregulated. In the literature, this shift has been {{accounted for by}} pointing to technological transformations, changing political coalitions or the pressure from international financial institutions (IFIs). This article argues that a centerpiece in the explanation of the general shift towards opening the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>sector,</b> and of the specific forms that this took in the different countries, is the ideas and strategies of local economic groups. The article traces the processes of attempted and implemented tele-communication reforms in three Central American countries – Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras – and argues {{that it was the}} local private <b>sectors</b> <b>in</b> shifting alliances with trans-national corporations that were the main forces behind reforms. The IFIs had primarily an indirect role, through squeezing the budgets of the state owned telecommunication companies contributing to their deteriorating quality, and through supporting the political organization of the local private sector.

A fourth component is added, made up of confounding factors that can explain differences in the figures between countries and over time that have little to do with changes in the regulatory arrangement of a particular sector (see figure 2). This is designated as the confounding component. Each component groups a number of indicators, which differ by sector. The exact hypotheses for each of the indicators are explained in the parts specific to each sector, but overall we assume a beneficiary effect of a liberalized regulatory scheme on each of the indicators and test this hypothesis in a general way. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the strategic}} role of liberalization and competition of the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> transforming economies and shows that network externalities cause special {{problems in the}} stage of early network expansion. Introducing competition in the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> post-socialist East European economies could not only contribute to rapid network expansion but also stimulate economic efficiency through backward linkages and forward linkages. Falling marginal costs during network expansion and improving quality of services - due to network competition - could generate high productivity gains and stimulate demand across the economy. Improved information networks will also have market-enhancing effects. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the major {{developments}} recorded in <b>telecommunication</b> <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> Morocco and assess the impact of regulating the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> Morocco along the European Union lines. The basic assumption underlying this work is the following. Further liberalization of various market segments of the telecommunication sector would benefit communications intensive industries that provide key “backbone services” to the economy, such as transport, distribution and finance. It would also improve competitiveness of exporting industries by reducing their costs and facilitating their integration to transnational production networks. The quality and price of telecommunication services directly affect business costs, but also affects the capacity of firms to network and compete in foreign and domestic markets. Finally, development of telecommunication services sector would create more investment opportunities for the domestic private sector, and help attract more FDI and portfolio investment. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the business needs of faster, cheaper, and more varied modes of communication, the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> many countries has been undergoing rapid technological and structural changes {{over the past few}} years.

Private participation in the manufacture of end user equipment and services, reorganization of the monolithic Department of Telecommunication, and raising finances from the public for investment in the state owned factories and organizations have been some of the policy initiatives of the government. In a scenario where the features of the Indian telecom sector such as under-investment, amalgamation of regulatory and operational functions, ill-defined sector policies, and lack of financial and administrative autonomy are common to many other developing countries, the consequences of sectoral changes have implications both for decision makers at the national level as well as in other developing countries.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{deregulation}} of the Nigerian <b>Telecommunication</b> <b>Sector</b> within the precinct of Imperialism and development. This is premised {{on the fact that}} Nigeria’s <b>Telecommunication</b> <b>sector</b> has not only been moribund over the years but has more importantly been dominated by foreign and local bourgeoisies after its deregulation in 1999. In view of this, the study borrows from Structural Imperialism which argues that the elites in the Centre and Periphery states connive, indeed conspire to undermine development in the latter. It relies heavily on the use of secondary data, by virtue {{of the nature of the}} work, thus probing the dynamics of these Centre/Periphery trajectories. Findings reveal that certain levels of development have been recorded <b>in</b> the <b>Telecommunication</b> <b>sector</b> particularly <b>in</b> terms of contribution to the Nigerian economy through the ubiquitous provision of telecommunication lines, especially the mobile phones. Similarly, jobs have been created within this <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> terms of its contribution to Nigeria’s GDP profile. However, beneath these efforts, the predatory and materialistic character of the foreign and local bourgeoisie, a permanent feature of the post-colonial Nigerian state remains the greatest bane of the growth of this sector. The study concludes that until this “unholy alliance ” between the foreign and local bourgeoisies is demolished, the deregulation effort of the federal government will remain a mirage. To this end, it recommend...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the development of}} the Brazilian <b>telecommunication</b> services <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> the neo-Schumpeterian Evolutionary Theory perspective. We sought to determine whether the Brazilian technological regime characteristics fits into the international scene; to map the innovation environment in which telecommunication services operate; and to consider whether the state post-privatization of the sector encouraged the construction of a technological regime and innovation environment capable of promoting the development of Brazil. The research was developed based on documental analysis and on the Technological Innovation Research (PINTEC) data for 2005 and 2008. The technological regime was established according to Marsili’s (2001) taxonomy. The paper concludes that the technological regime of Brazilian telecommunication services has similarities with the U. S. standard and tends to be a supplier dominated sector. The innovation environment showed that the legal-organizational structure specific to the <b>telecommunication</b> services <b>sector</b> does not accompany the innovative dynamism of the sector.

40|$|Critical {{infrastructure}} (CI) {{services are}} constantly {{consumed by the}} society and {{are not expected to}} fail. A common definition states that CIs are so vital to our society that a disruption would have a severe impact on both the society and the economy. CI sectors include, amongst others, electricity, telecommunication and transport. CIs can be mutually dependent on each others services and a failure in one of these elements can cascade to another (inter) dependent CI. CI security modelling was introduced in previous work to enable on-line risk monitoring in CIs that depend on each other by exchanging risk alerts expressed in terms of a breach of Confidentiality, a breach of Integrity and degrading Availability (C,I,A). While generally providing a solid basis for risk monitoring, {{there is no way of}} evaluating if a risk alert received from an external CI is accurate. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem by adding a trust based component to the CI security model in order to improve its accuracy and resilience to inconsistent or inaccurate risk alerts provided by (inter) dependent CIs, allowing to evaluate the correctness of the received alerts. The proposed approach is validated on a realistic scenario by evaluating a dependency between the computing and the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>sectors</b> <b>in</b> the context of the Grid' 5000 platform...|$|R
