5|$|In word learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E
500|$|Post-release, {{community}} and critics criticized {{the game for}} missing key features, being unstable and unfinished, for which Cawthon later apologized, stating, [...] "I got too eager to show {{the things that were}} finished, that I neglected to pay attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> weren't." [...] The game was subsequently removed by Steam per Cawthon's decision, and he stated that the game would be improved upon and re-released for no charge at a later date. Cawthon also announced that he asked Valve to refund everyone's money who bought the game.|$|E

500|$|The album {{itself was}} {{described}} as [...] "one of the hip hop albums of the century" [...] by the British newspaper The Observer and was successful on European music charts. Other reviews have been positive; Matthew Pollesel of Splendid Magazine praised the album for its lyrical content: [...] "...as Daara J show throughout Boomerang, it's possible to get the meaning of those words just by listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> surround them—the intensity of the rappers' delivery, {{the quality of the}} beats, and how well all those other factors coalesce around the words. And on that score, Daara J's message comes through loud and clear." [...] However, Katharina Lobeck of BBC Music noted that one of the tracks, the R-influenced [...] "Hip Hop Civilization" [...] is [...] "too generically soppy for even the most hardened R fans", but {{went on to say that}} the album is [...] "a successful sonic adventure which thrives on its defiance of the margins of established sales categories".|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{spent the}} winter of 1804–1805 encamped {{near the site of}} Bismarck, North Dakota. [...] They left there on April 7, 1805 and came within view of the Pacific Ocean, near Astoria, Oregon, on November 7. [...] After exploring the area, they departed eastward on March 23, 1806 and arrived in St. Louis six months to the day later. [...] Only one of the expedition members died en route, most likely of appendicitis. While they did not find the mammoths or salt mountains reputed to be in the American West, [...] "these were a small loss compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were gained". In addition to knowledge of the territories purchased by the US, these included the establishment of relations with Native Americans and increased public interest in the West once their diaries were published. [...] Further, the exploration of the Oregon Country later aided American claims to that area. In gratitude for their service to the nation, Congress gave Lewis and Clark land grants and they were appointed to government offices in the West.|$|E
500|$|The European {{sovereign}} debt crisis was another important {{issue in the}} election, even more so after Portugal applied for an EU bailout on 6 April, {{the first day of}} advance voting. According to an opinion poll nearly 60% of Finns were against Finland's participation in bailing out the crisis-ridden countries. All four parties of the governing coalition (Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Green League and the Swedish People's Party) support Finland's participation in the bailout and all four opposition parties (Social Democrats, Left Alliance, Christian Democrats and the True Finns) oppose such measures. The issue helped Soini become the most visible opposition leader. Soini then also stated that his party would not join in any coalition that supports guarantees to the crisis-ridden EU countries. He said that their crises are a consequence of the EU's failure. Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen had commented that a bailout for Portugal should only happen if the Portuguese parliament passed even tougher austerity measures than the failed programme that led to an early Portuguese election: [...] "The package must be really strict because otherwise it doesn't make any sense. The package must be harder and more comprehensive than the one the parliament voted against." [...] Despite his comments, the National Coalition Party believed the bailout to be in Finland's interests. It, along with the Centre Party, supported the bailout under the EU's auspices, while the True Finns and the Social Democrats were opposed to it. The True Finns said that Finnish taxpayers were being unjustly burdened by [...] "squanderers" [...] within the eurozone and pointed out that no one aided Finland during its own financial crisis in the 1990s. Helsingin Sanomat read the affair as having added [...] "confusion" [...] and complexity to the electoral race. The effect of the Finnish election on a possible EU bailout caused concern amongst to international investors as [...] "it is a very distinct possibility that the next government and parliament of Finland will not want to agree <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> the current government has signed up for, namely supporting Portugal and agreeing to the permanent and temporary crisis mechanisms," [...] as there was said to be an [...] "even chance" [...] of Finland blocking a bailout for Portugal as its support was crucial because it would need the unanimous support of all national governments to pass. Finland's participation was further thrown in doubt as it was the only eurozone country to require parliamentary approval of any such measure. Should a new Finnish administration opt out of the bailout, this could throw into doubt the eurozone's capacity to maintain financial stability.|$|E

2500|$|For Maykov, {{who took}} his {{historical}} poems and plays seriously, authenticity was the main objective. In his Old Believers drama The Wanderer (1867), he used the hand-written literature of raskolniks and, [...] "having discovered those poetic gems, tried to re-mold them into... modern poetic forms," [...] as he explained in the preface. In his historical works Maykov often had contemporary Russian issues in mind. [...] "While writing of ancient history I was looking for parallels <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I had to live through. Our times provide so many examples of {{the rise and fall}} of the human spirit that an attentive eye looking for analogies can spot a lot," [...] he wrote.|$|E

We should dedicate all our energies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are important to the people of Hong Kong, especially the livelihood issues," [...] Tsang said. Tsang denied Norman Chan had shown favouritism during the selection process, saying [...] "It was unfair to those appointees who were identified as Chan's people. Chan knows people from various sectors." [...] After his speech, Tsang refused to take questions; his speech was followed by those by the Chief Secretary and the Secretary for Justice.|$|E

60|$|There is, I fear, so much malice in {{the hearts}} of most men, that they are chiefly jealous of that praise which can give the {{greatest}} pleasure, and are then most liberal of eulogium when it can no longer be enjoyed. They grudge not the whiteness of the sepulchre, because by no honor they can bestow upon it can the senseless corpse be rendered an object of envy; but they are niggardly of the reputation which contributes to happiness, or advances to fortune. They are glad to obtain credit for generosity and humility by exalting those who are beyond the reach of praise, and thus to escape the more painful necessity of doing homage to a living rival. They are rejoiced to set up a standard of imaginary excellence, which may enable them, by insisting on the inferiority of a contemporary work <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have been, to withdraw the attention from its superiority <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are. The same undercurrent of jealousy operates in our reception of animadversion. Men have commonly more pleasure in the criticism which hurts than in that which is innocuous, and are more tolerant of the severity which breaks hearts and ruins fortunes, than of that which falls impotently on the grave.|$|E
