In order to further explore its use, palm oil and olive oil with saw dust ash as the source of alkali (lye) were used in the production of soap and the choice of traditional and modern laboratory methods was adapted. The characteristics of the soap products were determined and the average results compared. Blending of these oils with other oils to further study improvements or order wise in the quality of the soaps was also done. Parameters assessed were Moisture Content, Hardness of Soap, Total Fatty Matter, <b>Total</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Alkali,</b> Lathering Power,Free Caustic Alkali, Carbonate Alkali, pH and Cleansing Power. Comparative results show that Total Fatty Matter was 69 and 82 % for palm oil and olive oil respectively while the <b>Total</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Alkali</b> %, Free Caustic Alkali % and Free Carbonate Alkali % were 7. 8 and 6. 9, 3. 71 and 2. 6, 4. 09 and 4. 3 % respectively.

Results showed that identification of the Diels-Alder adduct of abietic acid and maleic anhydride using Mass spectrometry produced a mixture of endo-maleopimaric acid methyl ester with endo-maleopimaric acid tri methyl ester, as indicated by a fragment ion at m/z = 146 with a molecular weight of 414 and fragment ions at m/z = 121, 187, 316 and 386, denoting an endo-maleopimaric acid methyl ester. A fragment ion at m/z = 146 with a molecular weight of 460 and other fragment ions at m/z = 187, 121, 400 and 428 indicated endo-maleopimaric tri methyl ester. Using a large amount of rosin as a raw material to produce MPA, the equation Y = - 0. 8475 X 2 + 10. 448 X - 9. 7125, at a reaction temperature of 200 Â°C is still relevant as it denoted that a molar ratio of 1 : 6. 2 (rosin and MA) is the best.
