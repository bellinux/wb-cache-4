5000|$|In his 2011 book, Killing Giants: 10 Strategies to Topple the Goliath in Your Industry, Stephen Denny {{published}} {{an interview with}} former Coca-Cola Chief Marketing Officer Sergio Zyman that stated the formation and subsequent failure of <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was a deliberate move to destroy Crystal Pepsi, capitalizing on the public's {{lack of understanding of}} Pepsi's heavily-marketed product. <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was marketed as a diet drink, which were less popular than traditional colas, and the Tab brand in general was seen as an inferior product to flagships like Coca-Cola or Pepsi. With <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> being placed in such close proximity to Crystal Pepsi, the image of both brands would be damaged in what Zyman called a [...] "kamikaze" [...] strategy. [...] "This is like a cola," [...] Zyman explained, [...] "but it doesn't have any color. It has all this great taste. And we said, 'No, Crystal Pepsi is actually a diet drink.' Even though it wasn't. Because Tab had the attributes of diet, which was its demise. That was its problem. It was perceived to be a medicinal drink. Within three or five months, <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was dead. And so was Crystal Pepsi." ...|$|R

50|$|Tab (stylized as TaB) is a diet cola {{soft drink}} {{produced}} by The Coca-Cola Company, introduced in 1963. The soda was popular throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and several variations were made, including <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> {{as well as}} caffeine-free versions.|$|R

5000|$|According to Coca-Cola Chief Marketing Officer Sergio Zyman, <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> was an {{intentionally}} [...] "suicidal," [...] "kamikaze" [...] {{effort to}} create an unpopular beverage that was positioned as an analogue of Crystal Pepsi in order to [...] "kill both in the process." [...] The [...] "born to die" [...] strategy included using the poor-performing Tab brand rather than Coke, labeling the product as a [...] "sugar free" [...] diet drink to confuse consumers into thinking Crystal Pepsi had no sugar, and marketing the product {{as if it were}} [...] "medicinal." [...] Zyman said [...] "Pepsi spent an enormous amount of money on the brand and, regardless, we killed it. Both of them were dead within six months." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> went {{international}} {{only two}} weeks after its introduction in the United States. The clear cola with [...] "a mouthful of flavor" [...] was introduced {{at a news conference}} in London on January 18, 1993. The product was made available to the British public from early February that year with a trial price of 23 pence, initially in 330 ml cans and later in 1.5 and 2 litre plastic bottles. The drink was referred to as [...] "a completely new idea in soft drinks and is unlike any other product available". This made Coca-Cola the first of the two rival US soft drink global corporations (Coke and Pepsi) to launch a clear cola into Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Initially tab stops {{were set}} by adding and {{removing}} clips from the tab rack, but Edward Hess {{working for the}} Royal Typewriter Company filed for a patent in 1904 covering a system where the tab stops were permanently mounted on the tab bar. To set or reset a tab for a particular column, the tab stop for that column was simply rotated {{in or out of}} engagement. [...] In 1940, James Koca filed for a patent on a mechanism allowing the tab stops for each column to be set and cleared from the keyboard, eliminating the need for the typist to bend {{over the back of the}} machine to directly manipulate the tab rack. [...] These keys, if present, are typically labeled tab set and <b>tab</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, PepsiCo {{introduced}} Crystal Pepsi to test {{markets in}} Denver, Sacramento, Dallas, Providence, and Grand Rapids, {{and the product}} generated a positive response. Pleased with the results, PepsiCo launched the cola on April 12, 1992, and began to sell it nationwide in 1993. A large marketing campaign was launched, for which the company invented the world's first photo-realistic, computer-generated bus wrap printing. A series of television advertisements featuring Van Halen's hit song [...] "Right Now" [...] premiered on national television on January 31, 1993, during Super Bowl XXVII. Another marketing ploy was to give out full sized sample bottles with the Sunday paper deliveries such as the Boston Globe in Massachusetts. In its first year, Crystal Pepsi captured a full percentage point of U.S. soft drink sales, approximately $474 million. Coca-Cola followed suit by launching <b>Tab</b> <b>Clear</b> on December 14, 1992.|$|R

40|$|Acute ST-segment {{elevation}} {{myocardial infarction}} (STEMI) is a dynamic, thrombus-driven event. As {{understanding of its}} pathophysiology has improved, {{the central role of}} platelets in initiation and orchestration of this process has become <b>clear.</b> <b>Key</b> components of STEMI include formation of occlusive thrombus, mediation and ultimately amplification of the local vascular inflammatory response resulting in increased vasoreactivity, oedema formation, and microvascular obstruction. Activation, degranulation, and aggregation of platelets are the platforms from which these components develop. Therefore, prompt, potent, and predictable antithrombotic therapy is needed to optimise clinical outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention.
