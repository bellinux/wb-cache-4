40|$|What the Middle Neolithic Alvastra pile {{dwelling}} in Östergötland, Sweden, {{was used}} for has been discussed since the site was discovered in early 20 th century. <b>The</b> <b>interpretation</b> by Mats Malmer of the pile dwelling as a ceremonial settlement is until today the most widely accepted.

Hence, from definitions of the word 'settlement' this essay aims to investigate different researchers’ <b>interpretation</b> in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> Alvastra pile dwelling.
