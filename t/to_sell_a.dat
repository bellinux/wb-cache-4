5|$|Production of the No. 20 resumed around 1947, {{at which}} time the company began to license the Oliver name to several European {{manufacturing}} companies. The standard desktop machine was eventually discontinued in favor of portable models; the company began <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>a</b> German design, the Siemag Standard, as the Oliver standard. In 1958, Oliver purchased the Byron Typewriter Company, previously the Barlock Typewriter Company, of Nottingham. The licensing ventures were ultimately unsuccessful, and the company's machine tools were transferred to a factory in Germany. Production of all Oliver typewriters ended in May 1959.|$|E

5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he would be left with a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>a</b> million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E
5|$|Although superficially {{the market}} {{remained}} little {{changed in the}} decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold running water and refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, {{and many of the}} stalls were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between the stalls. Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of market gardening meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed the market <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>a</b> range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E
5|$|For its 7 June 2005 American release, Anniemal was {{distributed}} by Big Beat Records.

5|$|In {{mainland}} China, officials used {{helicopters to}} airdrop relief goods to Guangdong. By {{three days after}} the storm, workers distributed 2,000tents and 1,000beds. Once the floodwaters dropped, residents returned their homes to clean up the mud and damage. Farm officials in Guangdong used 50tons of disinfectant {{to prevent the spread of}} disease, while the provincial government allocated ¥240million (CNY, US$35million) for rebuilding. About 1,000soldiers worked to clean debris and animal carcasses from the reservoir providing drinking water to Maoming. The collapsed dam in Guangdong was later torn down due to being structurally deficient. Zijin Mining, the owner of the dam, had <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>a</b> mine to pay for compensation and fines related to the incident, which ultimately totaled ¥245million (CNY, US$38.7million). After the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided ¥1million (CNY, US$148,000) to localities affected hardest by the storm, as well as distributing mosquito nets, water purifiers, food, and clothing.|$|E
5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} two on Japan's Oricon albums chart {{underneath}} South Korean boyband TVXQ's Tone, selling 46,000 copies. Rival sales tracking agency SoundScan Japan {{found that the}} majority of copies sold in the first week were of the limited CD/DVD edition of the album, which accounted for 40,000 of the sold copies. The limited CD-only edition of the album accounted for 6,000 copies, while the standard edition did not sell enough copies to chart in the top 20 albums released that week. In its first month, the album was certified by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for over 100,000 copies of the album shipped to music stores across Japan. The album spent an additional five weeks in the top fifty, and continued to chart in the top 300 until February 2012. The album re-entered the top 300 from April to October 2012, and for a third chart-run from January to May 2013. In January 2014, the album re-entered the top 300 for a single week, bringing the total weeks on the chart to 62. In the album's chart run, it managed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>a</b> total of 103,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|Various {{delays in}} the arrival of planes and {{equipment}} meant that Baker's squadron was unable {{to participate in the}} final major offensives of the war. In September, Baker became engaged to Scott. He asked Pyne <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>a</b> bond to pay for an engagement ring, and the newspapers in the United States carried headlines that announced the engagement. Early in October, Baker was promoted again and given the rank of captain. The planes and equipment arrived for his squadron soon after. Baker had the planes painted in Princeton's black and orange and adopted a tiger for the squadron insignia. He recorded two more kills on October 28 and November 5, the last of his career (despite reports {{at the time of his}} death, Baker was not an ace, as that required five confirmed kills).|$|E
