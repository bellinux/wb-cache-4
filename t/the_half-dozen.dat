The {{congregation}} {{was made up of}} various theatrical colleagues; J.Pitt Hardacre was his best man, and composer Leslie Stuart was the organist. Robey and Ethel resided briefly in Circus Road, St John's Wood, until the birth of their first child Edward in 1900. They then moved to 83 Finchley Road in Swiss Cottage, Hampstead.

25|$|Buss {{invested}} in a small business with his best friend, but the friend {{died in a car}} accident in 1981. The death left Buss devastated and lost, and the business was left to fade. In 1985, Buss became president of his father's indoor soccer team, the Los Angeles Lazers, after his brother Johnny had quit. Buss brought annual losses down from $1 million to $500,000, but the team folded in 1989. He next became a horse trainer, receiving from his father <b>the</b> <b>half-dozen</b> thoroughbreds he owned. In 1997, Jerry divested himself of his horse racing stock that was increasingly unprofitable.

500|$|By 1910 the Diary was {{beginning}} to achieve a reputation in London's literary and political circles. In his essay [...] "On People in Books", published earlier that year, the writer and humourist Hilaire Belloc hailed the Diary as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>half-dozen</b> immortal achievements of our time... a glory for us all". Among others who recorded their appreciation of the work were Lord Rosebery, {{the former prime minister}} who told Arrowsmiths that he thought he had [...] "purchased and given away more copies than any living man... I regard any bedroom I occupy as unfurnished without a copy of it". Another essayist-cum-politician who added his tribute was Augustine Birrell, who in 1910 occupied the cabinet post of Chief Secretary for Ireland. Birrell wrote that he ranked Charles Pooter alongside Don Quixote as a comic literary figure, and added a note of personal pride that one of the characters in the book—"an illiterate charwoman, it is true"—carried his name. Arrowsmiths printed these appreciations as prefaces in the 1910 and subsequent issues. The 1910 edition [...] proved immediately popular with the reading public, and was followed by numerous reprintings. In its review of this edition The Bookman s critic wrote of Charles Pooter: [...] "You laugh at him—at his small absurdities, his droll mishaps, his well-meaning fussiness; but he wins upon you and obtains your affection, and even your admiration, he is so transparently honest, so delightfully and ridiculously human".|$|E
2500|$|Arguably, Victor Hugo's 1862 work Les Misérables was {{the most}} {{significant}} social protest novel of the 19th Century in Europe.

2500|$|Conductor Sir Thomas Beecham remarked of him: 'Coates {{was among}} <b>the</b> <b>half-dozen</b> most {{interesting}} artistic personalities {{of the time}} in England [...] scrupulous, fastidious and conscientious in all that he attempted. His appearance on the stage was noble and animated, and his voice, although of moderate power, was flexible and expressive.

[...] In 1924 Eaglefield Hull wrote: 'He unites to a fine tenor voice, wide culture, perfection of vocal declamation and high dramatic attainments.' ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the early}} Spanish missionaries {{undertook}} {{the task of}} teaching indigenous peoples (the nobility in particular) {{to read and write}} using the Latin alphabet. Through the efforts of the missionaries and, perhaps more so, of the Hispanicized natives, certain works of indigenous literature were able to survive to the modern day. [...] Of <b>the</b> <b>half-dozen</b> varieties of Mixtec recognized in the 16th century, two in particular were preferred for writing, those of Teposcolula/Tilantongo and Achiutla/Tlaxiaco in Mixteca Alta. [...] Over the five centuries that followed the Conquest, Mixtec literature was restricted to the popular sphere. Through music or the way in which certain rituals are carried out, popular Mixtec literature has survived as did for millennia: by means of oral transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{production}} of oil from the Athabasca oil sands began in 1967, {{with the opening of}} the Great Canadian Oil Sands (GCOS) plant in Fort McMurray.

When the US$240million plant officially opened with a capacity of , it marked the beginning of commercial development of the Athabasca oil sands. In 2013 McKenzie-Brown listed industrialist J.

2500|$|Hazlitt never mellowed in his {{attitude}} toward Gifford {{as he did}} toward his [...] "apostate" [...] former friends, {{but as a result}} he created a sketch that has come to be recognized as a [...] "masterpiece of invective". Some have thought of Hazlitt as merely [...] "getting even" [...] in this essay. But, increasingly, his treatment of Gifford has come to be seen as understandable as it is accurate, in view of the savage nature of the politically motivated criticism of that age as well as the damage inflicted by Gifford and his cronies on Hazlitt and other liberal-minded literary figures. To the critic Walter Jackson Bate, who named the attack on Gifford in the Letter to William Gifford as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>half-dozen</b> most sustained pieces of invective in English", the sketch of Gifford in The Spirit of the Age is [...] "even more effective".|$|E
2500|$|Like {{other groups}} on the Northwest Coast, the Haida defended {{themselves}} with fortifications, including palisades, trapdoors and platforms. They took to water in large ocean-going canoes, big enough to accommodate as many as 60 paddlers, each created from a single Western red cedar tree. The aggressive tribe were particularly feared in sea battles, although they did respect rules of engagement in their conflicts. The Haida developed effective weapons for boat-based battle, including a special system of stone rings weighing [...] which could destroy an enemy's dugout canoe and be reused after the attacker pulled it back with the attached cedar bark rope. The Haida took captives from defeated enemies. Between 1780 and 1830, the Haida turned their aggression towards European and American traders. Among <b>the</b> <b>half-dozen</b> ships the tribe captured were the Eleanor and the Susan Sturgis. The tribe made use of the weapons they so acquired, using cannons and canoe-mounted swivel guns.|$|E

[...] Albert Jay Nock wrote that anyone who rediscovers Henry George will find that [...] "George {{was one of the first}} half-dozen [...] minds of the nineteenth century, in all the world.” [...] The anti-war activist John Haynes Holmes echoed that sentiment by commenting that George was [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>half-dozen</b> great Americans of the nineteenth century, and one of the outstanding social reformers of all time."
