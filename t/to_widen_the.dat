50|$|Plans <b>to</b> <b>widen</b> Friendship Road (SR 347) {{began to}} appear in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

5|$|The freeway {{that would}} become I-8 was {{constructed}} in the mid-20th century through the San Diego area. The section west of I-5 was originally part of SR109, and was added to I-8 in 1972.

5|$|There are {{long-term}} {{plans to}} add express toll lanes to I-695 to ease traffic congestion along the route. In addition, there are also plans <b>to</b> <b>widen</b> <b>the</b> portion of I-695 between I-83 and I-95 {{to the north of}} Baltimore. This road, which is to be widened to eight lanes, is currently in the design phase.|$|E

5|$|A plan <b>to</b> <b>widen</b> <b>the</b> Narrows Bridge was {{announced}} on 13 April 1998 by the Court Liberal State Government. The $70 million plan would involve {{the addition of}} four extra traffic lanes, and {{was part of a}} $230 million package upgrading and extending {{the southern end of the}} Kwinana Freeway. Alannah McTiernan, then the Opposition Transport spokesperson, attacked the plan, saying that the government should instead build a railway to Rockingham.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Thơ was the Secretary of State for the National Economy.

The move was widely seen as an attempt to use Thơ's Mekong Delta roots to increase the government's popular appeal among southern peasants, because Diệm's regime was dominated by family members, Catholics from central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{proposals}} <b>to</b> <b>widen</b> <b>the</b> {{highway to}} six lanes between Downingtown and Valley Forge were made. In 2007, the western terminus of the widening project was scaled back from Downingtown {{to the proposed}} PA 29 slip ramp. Plans for the widening were presented {{to the public in}} 2009. Later that year, the widening was put on hold because of engineering problems. The widening plans resumed in 2010. Work was due to begin in 2013, with completion in 2015. In October 2012, the project was postponed a year because of delays in the approval of permits.|$|E

5|$|In September 2017, Governor Larry Hogan {{announced}} a plan <b>to</b> <b>widen</b> <b>the</b> Baltimore-Washington Parkway by four lanes, adding express toll lanes to the median, {{as part of}} a $9 billion proposal to widen roads in Maryland.

As part of the proposal, the portion of the parkway owned by the National Park Service would be transferred to the Maryland Transportation Authority.|$|E
5|$|Since {{completion}} of construction, the road has retained its original designation from I-25 to I-70. The portion from I-25 to SH83/ Parker Road was rebuilt {{as part of}} the T-REX Project completed in 2006.

In the early 2000s, a large development was completed in the downtown area, as well as several hotels.
