Other recent studies have examined the effects of population age on other economic variables such as growth, savings, and investment but none till now have considered age related effects on international trade. I use a simple linear empirical model to capture any age related effects on trade along with two different model specifications in this paper; one is a simple OLS and the other is a fixed effects linear trend adjusted OLS specification. The estimated results are then adjusted for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation via the use of the Newey-West HAC estimator to account for problems common to cross-county panel data sets. I conclude that there is indeed, a positive and statistically significant (though not very robust relationship) between a country's population age and its export to GDP ratio.

40|$|Emerging economies, {{particularly}} those dependent on commodity exports, {{are prone to}} highly disruptive economic cycles. This paper proposes a small open economy model for a net commodity exporter to quantitatively study the triggers of these cycles. The economy consists of two sectors, one of which produces commodities with prices subject to exogenous international fluctuations. These fluctuations affect both the competitiveness {{of the economy and}} its borrowing terms, as higher commodity prices are associated with lower spreads between the country’s borrowing rate and world interest rates. Both effects jointly result in strongly positive effects of commodity price increases on GDP, consumption and investment, and a negative effect on the <b>total</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> Furthermore, they generate excess volatility of consumption over output and a large volatility of investment. The model structure nests various candidate sources of shocks proposed in previous work on emerging economy business cycles. Estimating the model on Argentine data, we find that the contribution of commodity price shocks to fluctuations in post- 1950 output growth is in the order of 38...|$|E

This study provides the short-run and long-run, relationship of trade balance and real exchange rates, and the potential existence of a “J-curve” using quarterly time series data in that period. The minimum Lagrange Multiplier unit root tests (Lee and Strazicich: 2003, 2004) have been applied to determine endogenously potential structural break(s) for each series of data. Then, using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, the cointegration is estimated. Recently the relationship of Australian bilateral <b>total</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> and exchange rates with Japan in the same period was investigated (Meloche 2009), and the results showed that there is a stable long run relationship among the trade balance, national income of both countries and real exchange rates. However, the existence of J-curve in that period was not detected. A failure to detect a J-curve could be due to an aggregation bias. This study disaggregated trade balances into 10 trade sections (Standard International Trade Classification 1 -digit level) and then analysis was carried out. The empirical results showed that there is a stable long run relationship among trade balance, national incomes and real exchange rates in three trade sections. Those trade sections are beverages and tobacco (TB 1), crude materials, inedible, except fuels (TB 2) and animal and vegetable oils, fats and waxes (TB 4).

We identify a set of leading indicators of banking distress and currency pressure and investigate the causal and contemporaneous linkages between them by using separate panel probit models and a simultaneous probit equation system. Asset-price misalignments, default risk of commercial banks and the non-financial corporate sector, and growth of real credit {{to the private sector}} are found to be significant leading indicators for both banking distress and currency pressure. Economic growth, inflation and the ratio of short-term external debt to international reserves are found to be important determinants of banking distress, whereas growth of M 2 relative to international reserves, <b>total</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> over GDP, real effective exchange rate over-valuation and trade integration with China are identified to be crucial indicators of currency pressure. Currency market pressure is shown to have strong leading and contemporaneous impacts on banking distress for the EMEAP economies but not vice versa. These findings imply that the policy measures aimed at sustaining exchange rate stability will have the additional benefit of lowering the likelihood of banking distress in the region. Lastly, China is found to play a stabilising role in the region, i. e. the greater the trade with China, the lower the chance of experiencing currency pressure.

We employ three second-generation heterogeneous linear panel models and one recently developed non-linear panel estimation technique that allows for cross-sectional dependence. With respect to 28 major oil exporting countries, an increase in oil prices leads to an improved real oil trade balance, although it is detrimental to non-oil and total trade balances. This finding {{might be due to}} the expenditure effect arising from increases in proceeds from oil exports. A decrease in oil prices is found to be beneficial for both total and oil trade balances in these oil exporting countries. Forty major oil importers seem to be increasingly shielded from positive oil shocks over the 1970 s and 1980 s; however, they must worry about oil price declines. A decline in oil prices has a negative impact on both total and real oil trade balances resulting from increased oil imports in emerging economies. Hence, a decline in oil prices is beneficial to oil exporters due to the quantity effect outweighing the price effect, while for oil importers a stable oil price is more desirable than a price decline. These results are important to take into account if we are to gain a full understanding on the magnitude of the trade and macroeconomic effects of oil price changes and what the policy responses should be...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} ecologically unequal {{exchange}} (EUE) posits that international trade is structurally organized {{in a manner}} that allows a net transfer of resources from peripheral developing to core industrialized countries. The consequence, it is argued, is under-development in the periphery and augmented productive capacity in the core. EUE thus challenges the neoliberal free-market argument that exchange at market prices is symmetric and fair. An LCA-based methodology for estimating EUE that holds constant the variable market price is introduced and tested on contemporary trade of Dutch cheese and Kenyan coffee and roses. Specifically, the exchange of embodied land, water, energy, global warming potential, and labor is assessed. The results confirm the theory's hypothesis. At a fixed market price, more embodied Kenyan resources are exchanged for less Dutch resources. However, Kenyan roses give different results from coffee. EUE between countries can only be conclusively determined by considering the <b>total</b> biophysical <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> but by calculating quantities of embodied resources per unit of exchange value, it is possible to detect unequal exchange even at the level of individual commodities.

There exist two groups of studies that have investigated in the short-run and long run effects of real effective exchange rate on trade balance. The first group has employed at aggregate level between Algeria and the rest of world. The second group has used the trade at the bilateral level between Algeria and her two major trading partners, US (as a largest export partner of Algeria) and France (as a largest import partner of Algeria). Since a country’s trade balance behavior is directly depending on real effective exchange rate (REER), foreign income (Y*) and real domestic income (Y), so, we include all these variables in our model to test the general case (Algeria-world case) and specific case (Algeria-France and Algeria-UScase). This study uses unit root tests, co-integration techniques, Error Correction Model (ECM) and impulse response function with time series data covering the periods of 1981 Q 1 - 2009 Q 4.
