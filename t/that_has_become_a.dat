5|$|In 1991, Sid Meier {{released}} Civilization and popularized {{the level}} of detail <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> staple of the genre. Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A notable similarity between the Civilization computer game and board game {{is the importance of}} diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's Civilization was also influenced by personal computer games such as the city management game SimCity and the wargame Empire.

5|$|The Bassett {{years of}} the late-50s to early-70s were marked by mediocrity on the field but {{consistent}} success at the turnstiles. An issue <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> perennial concern in the city also emerged at this time: {{the possibility of a}} National Football League team in Toronto. Various machinations were entertained by Bassett including moving the Argos to the NFL, bringing an American expansion team to the city (e.g. the Toronto Northmen of the WFL), or expanding the CFL itself in the opposite direction. Other team owners steadfastly opposed Bassett's moves and almost rescinded his franchise in 1974; angered, he sold the team for $3.3 million to hotel magnate William R. Hodgson in the same year.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E
5|$|The University of Central Florida has {{a unique}} campus layout <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> model for other universities, {{reminiscent}} of the plans by Walt Disney for his Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, or EPCOT. The campus {{was designed to be}} a pedestrian oriented campus, with a series of concentric circles. The outermost circle is Gemini Blvd, which is also the main road for vehicular traffic on campus. Inside of Gemini, there is Apollo Circle, Mercury Circle, and finally Pegasus Circle as the innermost circle. Pegasus Circle contains the student union, which is the center of the campus, with the John C. Hitt Library located directly to the south of it. All academic buildings are located inside of Gemini, with the circle divided up into pie-shaped sections for each college. As there are very few roads inside of Gemini, many buildings' loading docks are accessible only by sidewalks and thus receive most deliveries at night. The University of Central Florida campus is one of only two in the nation with a concentric circle design, the other being the University of California, Irvine. Newsweek has ranked UCF as having the 20th most beautiful university campus in the country. Student housing is provided along the perimeter of the campus. Outside of Gemini, the campus is divided up into different themed sections. The northwest side of campus includes Greek communities, the north side contains Knights Plaza, an uptown style athletic village, the east side contains the Arboretum of the University of Central Florida, and the south side contains student recreation and wellness facilities.|$|E

25|$|Yashovijaya {{left behind}} a vast body of {{literature}} that exerted a vast influence on the Jain philosophy. After Acarya Haribhadra and Acarya Hemacandra, Upadhyaya Yashovijaya is the most high-profile Jain monk. Dundas notes that Yashovijaya enjoys a near talismanic figure for the contemporary Svetambara monastic community and is identified with madhyastha or principle of neutrality. Dundas further notes that Yashovijaya paints a superior picture of Jainism with his inclusivism {{and it is this}} image of Jainism <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> dominant one today. He had an influence on Srimad Rajcandra’s book Atmasiddhi wherein, he has provided six fundamental truths on soul and liberation following Yashovijaya's Adhyatmasara. A college called Jain Yashovijaya Pathashala has been established in Varanasi in his memory, under auspices of which the sacred Jain texts are being published in a series called Jain Yashovijaya Granthamala. The Jain community of Ahmedabad has honoured him by naming one block as Yashovijaya Chowk at the Relief Road end of Ratanpol where Yashovijaya lived for many years.|$|E
25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. <b>That</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E

500|$|With {{regard to}} the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, [...] "It is {{flawlessly}} crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding...

[...] He credited the [...] "technical difficulties" [...] with being [...] "so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" [...] and [...] "found [...] convinced by both the story and the sad saga". He named it his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received [...] "two thumbs up" [...] and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as [...] "a glorious Hollywood epic" [...] and [...] "well worth the wait," [...] and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio [...] "captivating". James Berardinelli stated, [...] "Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic {{is the kind of}} epic motion picture event <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it." [...] It was named his second best film of 1997. Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that [...] "the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy" [...] and that [...] "when you consider that [...] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron". Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, [...] "To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner {{is one of the most}} magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood." ...|$|E
