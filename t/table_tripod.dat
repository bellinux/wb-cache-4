40|$|Background The {{evaluation}} of the hand function is an essential element within the clinical practice. The usual assessments are focus {{on the ability to}} perform activities of daily life. The inclusion of instruments to measure kinematic variables provides a new approach to the assessment. Inertial sensors adapted to the hand {{could be used as a}} complementary instrument to the traditional assessment. Material: clinimetric assessment (Upper Limb Functional Index, Quick Dash), antrophometric variables (eight and weight), dynamometry (palm preasure) was taken. Functional analysis was made with Acceleglove system for the right hand and computer system. The glove has six acceleration sensor, one on each finger and another one on the reverse palm. Method Analytic, transversal approach. Ten healthy subject made six task on evaluation <b>table</b> (<b>tripod</b> pinch, lateral pinch and tip pinch, extension grip, spherical grip and power grip). Each task was made and measure three times, the second one was analyze for the results section. A Matlab script was created for the analysis of each movement and detection phase based on module vector. Results The module acceleration vector offers useful information of the hand function. The data analysis obtained during the performance of functional gestures allows to identify five different phases within the movement, three static phase and tow dynamic, each module vector was allied to one task. Conclusion Module vector variables could be used for the analysis of the different task made by the hand. Inertial sensor could be use as a complement for the traditional assessment system...|$|E

50|$|In Roman art, the libation {{is shown}} {{performed}} at an altar, mensa (sacrificial meal <b>table),</b> or <b>tripod.</b> It was the simplest form of sacrifice, {{and could be}} a sufficient offering by itself. The introductory rite (praefatio) to an animal sacrifice included an incense and wine libation onto a burning altar. Both emperors and divinities are frequently depicted, especially on coins, pouring libations. Scenes of libation commonly signify the quality of pietas, religious duty or reverence.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Sparsit's tea {{was just}} set {{for her on}} a pert little <b>table,</b> with its <b>tripod</b> of legs in an attitude, which she insinuated after office-hours, into {{the company of the}} stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that bestrode the middle of the room.

50|$|A {{fire screen}} sheet {{began as a}} form of {{furniture}} that acted as a shield between the occupants of a room and the fireplace, and its primary function was to reduce the discomfort of excessive heat from a log fire. Early firescreens were generally shaped as flat panels standing on attached feet, or as adjustable shield-shaped panels mounted on <b>tripod</b> <b>table</b> legs.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} World War II Japan {{produced}} simple, {{tiny and}} inexpensive Hit-type cameras designed for the war-torn and destitute home market (see image). The Petie camera was created under similar conditions in post-war Germany. These cameras used 16mm film, against the 17.5mm film of the Japanese cameras, but both used paper-backed film and created 14mm square images. The Petie had a 20mm (f9.0) fixed-focus lens and a shutter speed set at 1/50 sec. The 1955 model came with a meniscus lens, later replaced with an achromatic lens. It came with accessories such as a closeup lens, yellow filter, lens hood, <b>table</b> top <b>tripod,</b> and case. All subsequent Kunik models were based on this one.|$|R
60|$|Porus and his {{companion}} {{had spent the}} morning in gathering flowers. These the slaves had made into wreaths and had decorated the room, which was completely changed in appearance since Beric left it on the afternoon before. The roughly built walls were hidden by rich hangings. The floor was covered with matting, on which were placed thick rugs woven in the East. Two or three carved couches were placed against the walls, and as many small <b>tables</b> on <b>tripod</b> legs stood beside them. The farmer {{and his wife were}} called in, and in their presence and that of his three followers Beric performed the simple ceremony of a Roman marriage, consisting only of taking Aemilia's hand in his and declaring that, in conformity with the conditions of the pact before made and signed, and with the full consent and authorization of her father, he took her to be his wife.|$|R
40|$|Silk {{in ancient}} Africa? Most {{of us think}} of ancient Africans {{as members of a}} tribe, living by {{subsistence}} farming or herding, in villages of grass houses. But Nubia, the ancient Kush, located along the Nile in southern Egypt and {{the northern part of the}} Sudan, (Fig. l) was inhabited by an African people who, by 1800 BC, had developed their own high civilization. The Kushites were suppliers of ivory, ebony, gold, ostrich feathers, animal skins, and slaves to ancient Egypt and elsewhere in the Mediterranean world. In exchange they received a wide variety of manufactured goods. By the fourth century AD the center of Kushite power had moved from much farther 9 south to the northern part of Nubia. Although the Kushites at that time were illiterate, the economy of their kingdom was based largely on trade with Byzantine Egypt. Animal products, ebony, gold, and slaves were sent north, and in exchange, luxury manufactured goods were traded into Nubia. Among the bronzes, glass vessels, carpets, and wine imported into Nubia, we also find silk. Late Classical Period: 300 - 500 AD. The earliest silk specimens found so far in Nubia are dated between 300 - 500 AD. Two examples come from Qustul (Fig. 1), a royal cemetery whose barbaric splendor stunned the archaeological world when it was discovered in 1931. The many- chambered tombs were constructed like houses, with rooms full of furnishings. The most surprising finding was the large number of human and animal sacrifices, a practice abandoned in Egypt for 3000 years. The wealth and power of the royal family was evident from the amount and quality of jewelry, silver horse trappings, silver and bronze vessels, tools, games, bronze <b>tables,</b> <b>tripods</b> and folding chairs, lamps, leather work, glass, weighing instruments, and textiles. We have no structural descriptions of the two Qustul silks, only their colors. One was red and yellowish, the other was black and the same yellow color. However, the silk filaments were analyzed and were found to be from a wild moth, producing a silk similar to Tussah silk...|$|R

50|$|The {{imposing}} {{main entrance}} {{is set on}} a high basement of regular ashlar blocks, with a flat roof hidden by a shaped parapet. Dominating the facade is a projecting pavilion composed of four giant Ionic columns in antis supporting an architrave replete with Masonic symbols. A large cascade of steps {{leading up to the}} main entrance is flanked by metal <b>tripod</b> <b>tables</b> each on a base decorated with a griffin on a terracotta plaque. The main lobby is remarkable for its Egyptian styling, featuring battered entranceways, papyrus ornaments and sphinxes. This leads via two sets of doors to the large Main Lodge room, which is used for Rural Lodge meetings and other large events, and features neoclassical furniture and furnishings and a classical landscape fresco signed by the artist, Carroll Bill.|$|R
50|$|In 1709 {{the digging}} {{of a deep}} well {{revealed}} some exceptional statues at the lowest levels which was later {{found to be the}} site of the theatre. The Prince d'Elbeuf purchased the land and proceeded to tunnel out {{from the bottom of the}} well, collecting any statues they could find. Among the earliest statues recovered were the two superbly sculpted Herculaneum Women now in the Dresden Skulpturensammlung.Major excavation was resumed in 1738 by Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre. The elaborate publication of Le Antichità di Ercolano ("The Antiquities of Herculaneum") under the patronage of the King of the Two Sicilies had an effect on incipient European Neoclassicism out of all proportion to its limited circulation; in the later 18th century, motifs from Herculaneum began to appear on stylish furnishings, from decorative wall-paintings and <b>tripod</b> <b>tables</b> to perfume burners and teacups. However, excavation ceased once the nearby town of Pompeii was discovered, which was significantly easier to excavate because of the thinner layer of debris covering the site (4 m as opposed to Herculaneum's 20 m).|$|R
