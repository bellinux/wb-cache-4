5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee {{and the other to}} cross the Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had less to do with the shape of the bridge <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> arch was derived from arcus, meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E
5|$|The Daleks in London, {{commissioned}} on 25 May 1971, {{was to be}} {{the final}} story of Season 9 in 1972, re-introducing the Daleks after a five-year absence. Little is known about the exact storyline of the six-part Robert Sloman serial, other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it would have had some similarities to The Dalek Invasion of Earth, except set in contemporary London. This similarity caused the production team some concern, and producer Barry Letts eventually decided that he would rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead of ending it with one. An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale.|$|E

This line of aircraft were regarded highly commercially before World War II, and they were influential in the establishment of the Dewoitine Company.|$|E

25|$|Many of London's pubs {{are known}} to have been used by famous people, but in some cases, such as the {{association}} between Samuel Johnson and Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, this is speculative, based on little more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the person is known to have lived nearby. However, Charles Dickens is known to have visited the Cheshire Cheese, the Prospect of Whitby, Ye Olde Cock Tavern and many others. Samuel Pepys is also associated with the Prospect of Whitby and the Cock Tavern.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of baking Easter breads, {{also known as}} hot cross buns, have been documented to exist {{at least since the}} 1500s. Two cross-marked buns have also been found in the Roman city of Herculaneum in modern-day Italy dating back as early as 79 CE. The Irish in particular have been known to bake a key {{in the shape of a}} cross inside the bread during the Easter period. It is uncertain, however, how cross buns are similar to shlissel challah, other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> people have always made signs or symbols on their bread.|$|E

25|$|Besides the {{military}} Smith was elected treasurer in DeKalb County, {{little is known}} about him other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he designed his home in the 200 block of Sycamore's Somonauk Street. F.W. Partridge was an attorney who began his legal career in the DeKalb County city of Sandwich, Illinois. Later, when he moved to Sycamore, he achieved some notoriety in that profession. During the Civil War Partridge was a breveted Brigadier General. Toward {{the end of the war}} he served as DeKalb County Clerk and Recorder; from 1864-1867. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him as ambassador to Siam.|$|E
25|$|In 1888 Roberts {{moved to}} Chicago {{where he worked}} as a site {{superintendent}} for S.S. Beman at Pullman, {{on the south side of}} the city. Roberts remained at that job until 1893. Roberts moved to the Chicago suburb of Oak Park in 1893 and established his own practice which eventually grew to become the largest architecture firm in the village of Oak Park, rivaling even architecture giant Frank Lloyd Wright's practice. In Oak Park he designed over 200 homes which span a multitude of architectural styles. Wright and Roberts were not, themselves, professionally associated, other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they were competing architects.|$|E

In her hand she wielded a wand, the symbolic distaff (seiðstafr), which was adorned with brass and decked with gems on the knob. In the saga of Örvar-Oddr, the seiðkona also wears a blue or black cloak and carries a distaff (a wand which allegedly has the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it). The colour of the cloak may be less significant <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{it was intended to}} signify the otherness of the seiðkona.|$|E

25|$|On December 21, Vivendi {{announced}} a Game Boy Advance version of The Fellowship {{would also be}} released. Developed by Pocket Studios, the game was to be called Lord of the Rings, Part I, and was to feature the full plot of The Fellowship and roughly half of The Two Towers. This would be followed soon after by Lord of the Rings, Part II, featuring {{the second half of}} Two Towers and all of Return of the King. Vivendi revealed little about the games other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they were to be more RPG based than the Xbox Fellowship game, and would be played from an isometric three-quarter top-down view.|$|E
25|$|Doom’s honor code {{led him to}} save Captain America from {{drowning}} because Captain America {{had earlier}} saved his life, and on another occasion he thanked Spider-Man for saving him from terrorists attacking him in an airport by allowing him to leave alive despite Spider-Man subsequently insulting him. His code of honor also means {{that he will not}} attack a respected opponent who is weakened or at a severe disadvantage, as he regards any victory resulting from such circumstances as hollow and meaningless. He has even on several occasions battled opponents who were intent on killing the Fantastic Four, for no other reason <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he does not want the ultimate defeat of the Fantastic Four to come from anyone’s hands but his own.|$|E
25|$|Ties That Bind {{was first}} {{referred}} to in late 2004, when Midway Games released an earnings statement in which it spoke of the financial success of the first game. No other information was revealed at the time, other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a sequel was in development. On January 19, 2005, Midway revealed the game would be released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and was being developed by Surreal Software, the same team who had worked on the first game. They also announced the title, and revealed the game would begin moments {{after the end of}} the first game, but the intro sequence would depend on which ending the player received in the first game, assuming they still had a saved game file.|$|E
50|$|Bell uses {{italicized}} text liberally in Faces in the Moon. The italicized {{portions of}} the book are dedicated to times of intense emotion rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> make up <b>the</b> backbone of the story. It is important to notice when Bell utilizes italics. She uses it in the horrendous rape scene between Lucie and J.D {{as well as in}} Lucie’s dreams when she is running from the wild dogs. Changing from regular font to italicized font signals the reader {{to pay attention to the}} differences between the two. Bell uses italics to not only convey powerful feeling but also as an escape for Lucie. For example, when Lucie wants to hear her mother’s words, she “hears” them through the italicized text. However, she can also use the italicized words as a way to escape unpleasant feelings by dismissing them as dreams.|$|R
50|$|Dutch investigative {{reporter}} Rinke Verkerk {{reported that she}} was given an auditing session by an 11-year-old in the Netherlands.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the importance of Cerball in Icelandic writings stems from the popularity of the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland among the Norse-Gaels of eleventh century Ireland, who passed these accounts on to the Icelanders, who then attached this famous and warlike king to their ancestry. Whether Cerball was in fact an ancestor of many prominent settler families is, however, of rather less importance <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Icelanders considered it worth reporting their descent from Cerball mac Dúnlainge, whether real or contrived. As with the adoption of Norse names, sagas and other features, and the creation of the Norse-Gael culture, Cerball's adoption in Iceland {{is an example of the}} contacts between Norse and Gaelic society in the Viking Age.|$|E
25|$|In late 1929 Grierson and his cameraman, Basil Emmott, {{completed}} his first film, Drifters, which he wrote, produced and directed. The film, which follows the heroic work of North Sea herring fishermen, was {{a radical departure}} from anything being made by the British film industry or Hollywood. A large part of its innovation lie in the fierce boldness in bringing the camera to rugged locations such as a small boat {{in the middle of a}} gale, while leaving relatively less of the action staged. The choice of topic was chosen less from Grierson's curiosity <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he discovered that the Financial Secretary had made the herring industry his hobbyhorse. It premiered in a private film club in London in November 1929 on a double-bill with Eisenstein's then controversial film The Battleship Potemkin (which was banned from general release in Britain until 1954), and received high praise from both its sponsors and the press.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{among the}} Ghilji reveal strong links between tribal affiliation and {{membership in the}} larger ummah (Islamic community). Afghan historians believe that most Pashtuns are descendants of Qais Abdur Rashid, who is purported {{to have been an}} early convert to Islam and thus bequeathed the faith to the early Pashtun population. The legend says that after Qais heard of the new religion of Islam, he travelled to meet Muhammad in Medina and returned to Afghanistan as a Muslim. He purportedly had four children: Sarban, Batan, Ghourghusht and Karlan. Before the Islamization of their territory, the Pashtuns likely followed various religions. Some may have been Buddhists while others Zoroastians, worshippers of the sun, or worshippers of Nana, with some probably being animists, shamanists and Jews. However, there is no conclusive evidence to these theories other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> these were the religions practiced by the people in this region before the arrival of Islam in the 7th century.|$|E

50|$|Æthelwald Moll was deposed in 765 and Alhred became king.

60|$|Agassiz's {{long and}} {{elaborate}} researches upon fossil fishes, published between 1833 and 1842, {{led him to}} suggest the existence of another kind of relation between ancient and modern forms of life. He observed that the oldest fishes present many characters which recall the embryonic conditions of existing fishes; and that, not only among fishes, but in several groups of the invertebrata which have a long palaeontological history, the latest forms are more modified, more specialised, <b>than</b> <b>the</b> earlier. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dentition of the older tertiary ungulate and carnivorous mammals is always complete, noticed by Professor Owen, illustrated the same generalisation.|$|R
