Over 40structures were flooded, forcing 200people <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> One indirect death occurred from a traffic accident in Jasper County due to wet roads. During {{the height of the}} storm, 24,000customers were without power. In all, Hurricane Dennis caused $2.4million (2005USD) in damage across the state.|$|E
5|$|Farther {{north in}} Rhode Island, 10,000people fled from the coast. Despite {{evacuation}} orders, {{nearly half of}} the residents in Narragansett, Rhode Island, refused <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> and as a result martial law was implemented to get people to leave. The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{thousands}} of oil workers were evacuated from Gulf of Mexico oil rigs. In Del Rio, some highways and roads were closed after the initial flooding, in anticipation of more flooding as the system stalled over the area.

The flooding and mudslides damaged or destroyed thousands of houses, forcing many <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> A total of 58casualties were reported {{in association with the}} disturbance. In Australia, Inigo produced locally heavy rainfall, but little damage.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian Serb forces, the JNA and the paramilitaries {{established}} their {{control in the}} village, the Croat population was required to wear white armbands and mark their houses using white sheets. The church in Lovas was torched and 261 houses were looted and destroyed, while 1,341 civilians were forced <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The bodies {{of the victims were}} retrieved from a mass grave and ten individual graves in 1997.

British journalist Thomas de Waal has described Ring as the Soviet Union's first and only civil war. Some authors have also described {{the actions of the}} joint Soviet and Azerbaijani force as ethnic cleansing. The military operation was accompanied by systematic and gross human rights abuses.|$|E
5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> or the country.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{was concerned about}} the results of the March firebombing attacks as the raids had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive physical damage in the targeted cities, the attacks also caused increased absenteeism as civilians were afraid <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> to work in factories which might be bombed. Japanese air defenses were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.|$|E

5|$|Floyd's {{rainfall}} {{resulted in}} deadly and extensive flooding that killed {{two people in}} New York. Heavy flooding was reported along numerous creeks, including the Esopus, Catskill, and Schoharie. In the Albany area, the Normanskill rose to extremely high levels, and the resultant flood waters damaged nearby buildings. The Coeymans Creek in Selkirk overflowed and forced 20 families <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The main rivers typically remained within their banks. Many roads, including U.S. Route 20 in Guilderland, were flooded or washed out, and seven families had to be evacuated along NY 32 in Menands. Further south, the Saw Mill and Bronx rivers both overflowed, and caused urban flooding. A dam on a mill pond broke near Lake Placid, leading to flooding along the Chubb River.|$|E
5|$|In La Paz, the Municipal Direction of Civil defense {{informed}} that the first of 13temporary shelters would be opened and anticipated the evacuation of more than 2000people that lived in high-risk zones. In some areas, the local police recommended to the population, mostly those living in areas of high risk, that they should take care not <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> unless necessary and to find evacuation routes and temporary shelters. Both Manuel Márquez de León International Airport in La Paz and Los Cabos International Airport in San José del Cabo were shut down, stranding 7,500–8,500 tourists. Henriette also forced the ports in Los Cabos to close completely, and the port in La Paz to close to small craft.|$|E
5|$|On the {{offshore}} Socotra island, over 1,000families evacuated to schools {{set up as}} shelters. On 1November, Chapala became the first hurricane-force storm to impact Socotra since 1922, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. Residents reported rainfall {{to be the most}} severe in decades, and northeastern areas of the island were rendered inaccessible due to flooding, forcing residents to ride out the storm on their roofs. Chapala damaged Socotra's main port, and also caused an island-wide power outage. Chapala wrecked 237homes on the island and damaged at least 497homes, forcing about 18,000people <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> Initial reports indicated that three people were killed and at least 200others sustained injuries on the island; subsequently, the government reported that there were no deaths on the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} along the coastline, including {{a total of}} 19.1inches (486mm) measured in a 48‑hour period in Acapulco. Totals of over 2inches (50mm) spread across much of Guerrero and Oaxaca, causing flash flooding and mudslides. The storm partially flooded about 40houses, {{and a total of}} 72people were forced <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> In Acapulco, floodwaters washed trash from street corners onto the beaches. Elsewhere in Guerrero, the flooding and mudslides blocked several highways, which stranded dozens of vehicles. The wall of a prison collapsed due to the rainfall. Also in Acapulco, the rainfall downed trees and power lines, causing power outages and sparking a fire when a transformer exploded. No deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Two-E was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico. It {{was the only}} cyclone during the month in the eastern North Pacific Ocean, forming on June3 from a tropical wave. The depression initially moved northeastward, threatening the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero with a potential of it attaining tropical storm status. It remained a tropical depression, weakening due to land interaction and wind shear, and on June5 it dissipated just off the coast. Rainfall from the depression peaked at 19.1inches (486mm) in Acapulco, which resulted in mudslides and flooding. A total of 42houses were flooded, and 72people were forced <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> due to the storm; no deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{control of}} Nakhichevan {{passed to the}} Safavid dynasty of Persia. Because of its {{geographic}} position, it frequently suffered during the earlier wars between Persia and the Ottoman Empire in the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1604–1605, Shah Abbas I, concerned that the lands of Nakhichevan and the surrounding areas could potentially pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. He forced some 300,000 Armenians, including the Armenian population of Nakhichevan <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> {{and move to the}} Persian provinces south of the Aras River. After the last 1826-1828 Russo-Persian War, Nakhichevan became part of Russia per the Treaty of Turkmenchay after Persia's forced ceding. Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, reported that 1,228 Armenian families from Persia migrated to Nakhichevan, while prior to their migration there were 2,024 Muslim and 404 Armenian families living in the province.|$|E
