500|$|Since airing, [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed to negative reception from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented that the}} episode [...] "feels like an amalgamation of elements from prior holiday programs and never really elicits much humor. Christmas is commercialized and corporations use and abuse their customers? Those aren’t exactly rich insights, so [...] {{comes across as a}} below average episode." [...] In his review of the DVD Christmas With the Simpsons, Digitally Obsessed critic Joel Cunningham wrote that the episode [...] "comes from Season 11, well past the point when the series had sacrificed character for absurdist humor. Unless you don't think evil toy marketers, sentient Furbys, and Gary Coleman qualify. Anyway, after the school nearly goes bankrupt, Principal Skinner signs a contract with corporate backers who use the kids to conduct market research. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> gags, but the story doesn't hang together very well." [...] Adam Tyner of DVD Talk argued that the episode [...] "has a couple of good gags (Gary Coleman chatting on the phone being my favorite) but is quickly forgettable". Brian James of PopMatters described Coleman's cameo as [...] "hysterical" [...] in 2004, and Meghan Lewit of the same website listed [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] at number eight on her 2009 list of the [...] "10 best holiday themed TV episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club reviewed the episode positively, rating it a B. He considered the episode [...] "entertaining to watch" [...] with [...] "nifty direction from Tucker Gates", despite being formulaic {{and with the}} same problems he found in the previous episode penned by John Shiban, season three's [...] "Teso Dos Bichos". Handlen had much praise for the second half, which he noted was filled with dark humor, and featured a [...] "bizarre ending". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it a 2 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode is a disastrous combination of political commentary and stereotypical “Mexican soap opera” caricatures. Mulder and Scully {{have nothing to do}} with the resolution of the episode, and in fact, the writers fail to provide that resolution. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> character moments, but they are too far and few between." [...] Author Keith Topping criticized the episode in his book X-Treme Possibilities, calling it an [...] "awful episode with a heavy-handed, clod-hopping attempt at social comment that hardly sits well with the themes on display in the rest of the episode." [...] He called it the worst episode of the fourth season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five and wrote that it was [...] "trying very hard to be clever". Despite this the two explained that [...] "if cleverness were only about intent, then we could all be geniuses". Shearman and Pearson derided the episode's use of social criticism, referring to it as [...] "rubbish [...] only works if it isn't underlined each time it's made." [...] Furthermore, the two criticized the story's [...] "Mexican soap opera" [...] style, noting that it drowned out the themes in [...] "unengaging melodrama". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She wrote that [...] "'El Mundo Gira' is so overloaded with ideas that it falls over and can't get up".|$|E

A very gay {{cavalier}} {{with a broad}} bright battle-axe {{was pointed}} out to me as an eminent distiller, and another knight in the black coarse armour of a cuirassier of the 17th century stalked about as if he thought himself the very mirror of chivalry.

2500|$|Time observed, [...] "Porgy and Bess {{is only a}} {{moderate}} and intermittent success as a musical show; {{as an attempt to}} produce a great work of cinematic art, it is a sometimes ponderous failure [...] [...] [...] On the stage the show has an intimate, itch-and-scratch-it folksiness that makes even the dull spots endearing. On the colossal Todd-AO screen, Catfish Row covers a territory that looks almost as big as a football field, and the action often feels about as intimate as a line play seen from the second tier. What the actors are saying or singing comes blaring out of a dozen stereophonic loudspeakers in such volume that the spectator almost continually feels trapped {{in the middle of a}} cheering section. The worst thing about Goldwyn's Porgy, though, is its cinematic monotony. The film is not so much a motion picture as a photographed opera [...] [...] [...] Still, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> things about the show. Sammy Davis Jr., looking like an absurd Harlemization of Chico Marx, makes a wonderfully silly stinker out of Sportin' Life. The singing is generally good — particularly the comic bits by Pearl Bailey and the ballads by Adele Addison [...] [...] [...] And the color photography gains a remarkable lushness through the use of filters, though in time [...] [...] [...] the spectator may get tired of the sensation that he is watching the picture through amber-colored sunglasses." ...|$|E

60|$|On the forenoon of {{the fourth}} of November last, Doctor Richard Price, a Non-Conforming {{minister}} of eminence, preached at the Dissenting meeting-house of the Old Jewry, to his club or society, a very extraordinary miscellaneous sermon, in which <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> moral and religious sentiments, and not ill expressed, mixed up {{with a sort of}} porridge of various political opinions and reflections: but the Revolution in France is the grand ingredient in the caldron. I consider the address transmitted by the Revolution Society to the National Assembly, through Earl Stanhope, as originating in the principles of the sermon, and as a corollary from them. It was moved by the preacher of that discourse. It was passed by those who came reeking from the effect of the sermon, without any censure or qualification, expressed or implied. If, however, any of the gentlemen concerned shall wish to separate the sermon from the resolution, they know how to acknowledge the one and to disavow the other. They may do it: I cannot.|$|E

Perhaps you are a reader of the old books.
