The Postura MotergoTM which {{was developed by the}} Motorcycle Engineering Technology Lab (METAL) of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) is an example of such motorcycle test rigs/simulators. However, the Postura MotergoTM could only replicate one type of motorcycle cockpit design (where the human operator is seated to operate the motorcycle), whereas, from the field survey, it was found that motorcycles come with variable cockpit designs. Hence, the Postura MotergoTM was in need for a design enhancement in order to accurately replicate the variable motorcycles’ cockpit designs. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a novel adjustable motorcycle <b>tank</b> <b>cover</b> for the Postura MotergoTM. Literature assessment, field survey, computer aided design (CAD) and design fabrication were the research methods. Upon the fabrication of the new motorcycle <b>tank</b> <b>cover</b> (as proof-of-concept), a patent specification document was proposed. As of April 2015, the new tank design is being filed for an intellectual property (IP) protection. Conclusively, the integration of this new motorcycle <b>tank</b> <b>cover</b> on the Postura MotergoTM further enhances the capability of the motorcycle test rig to better replicate various motorcycles cockpit designs.

40|$|Abstract. Fuel cell {{bus with}} {{hydrogen}} tanks on its roof {{is different from}} traditional one. Its mass is greater than traditional one and its centre of gravity is higher, which makes its rollover more easy and dangerous. During the rollover, the great deformation of the body structure will menace the occupants ’ safety, and in addition, the hydrogen leaking will threaten {{the lives of the}} occupants. So measures should be taken to ensure the deformation of body structure would not hurt the occupants, and the hydrogen pipelines would not have gas leakage. In the light of this objective, the finite element models of fuel cell bus, survive region and anti-intruding region are established, and the simulation of the bus rollover is carried out according to ECER 66. The rollover results indicate that the bus is good at resisting the deformation of the rollover, {{and at the same time}} it provides data reference for improving the design of fuel cell bus. Furthermore, the pillar intruding coefficient and the clearance between anti-intruding region and <b>tank</b> <b>cover</b> are introduced in the paper to measure the safety abundance ratio of the survival region and the hydrogen pipeline of the fuel cell bus. According to these data, the description of safety of fuel cell bus can be quantified...|$|E

40|$|Rotation and {{translation}} of the Earth subject the living organisms to cyclic changes of environmental factors. This study evaluated the effects of photoperiod on growth and gonadal development in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In a completely randomized design experiment, juvenile males were distributed into nine tanks (10 fish per tank) and maintained for 60 days under three different light treatments with three repetitions each. The treatments were: T 1 - 0 h photoperiod (<b>tanks</b> <b>covered</b> with lids and black plastic); T 2 - 12 hours photoperiod (tanks uncovered during photoperiod to provide natural light); and T 3 - 24 hours photoperiod (<b>tanks</b> <b>covered</b> with lids equipped with lamps). No {{significant differences were found}} between treatments for body length, gonad weight or gonadosomatic index, but body weight was higher in fish subjected to T 3 compared with other treatments. Furthermore, significant increases in tubular lumen and germinal epithelium were observed in fish exposed to T 1 and T 3, respectively. Thus, the manipulation of photoperiod in Nile tilapia culture systems can improve production and consequently increase the economic return on investment. ...|$|R
