Becoming a KC was a risk; he would go from competing with other junior barristers to coming up against the finest minds in the profession. Despite this he decided to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk,</b> and he was accepted later that year.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was {{made between the}} ministry, the tunnel company and the county municipality on 6 January 1994 to build the tunnel. The company {{had the right to}} collect tolls for up to 15 years on fees dictated by the county municipality, and would have to pay NOK27 million for the tunnel, with the county paying {{for the rest of the}} costs. The construction would be the responsibility of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, with the tunnel company only responsible for their part of the financing and the collection of tolls. An {{agreement was}} made with Selmer, whereby they would charge NOK59,422,500 and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of the project, including any expenditures for unknown geological conditions or similar costs increases. They were also responsible for an insurance to reclaim the investments should it be proven impossible to build the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Tara {{finds her}} {{strength}} in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start {{spending most of}} their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat {{would not want to}} <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk,</b> and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts that she is a realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his own sake.|$|E

He advised South Melbourne that, if they would continue to pay him the usual rate of £3 a week and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of his breaking down, he would not consider any other offer. If, on the other hand, South Melbourne was reluctant, he announced that he would transfer to Preston and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of his leg keeping him out of the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{raising of}} capital in Rotterdam did not go so smoothly. A {{considerable}} part originated from inhabitants of Dordrecht. Although it did not raise as much capital as Amsterdam or Middelburg-Zeeland, Enkhuizen had the largest input in the share capital of the VOC. Under the first 358 shareholders, there were many small entrepreneurs, who dared to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk.</b> The minimum investment in the VOC was 3,000 guilders, which priced the Company's stock within the means of many merchants.|$|E
25|$|This {{election}} {{was the first}} since 1995 in which no independent candidates were elected, mostly because the HDP decided to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of running as a party. Former footballer and AKP MP Hakan Şükür, who resigned from his party following the 2013 government corruption scandal, came the closest to being elected with around 32,000 votes, running in İstanbul's 3rd electoral district. Osman Pamukoğlu, {{the leader of the}} Rights and Equality Party, ran as an independent to bypass the election threshold and won around 15,000 votes, submitting a complaint to the Electoral Council over the results.|$|E
50|$|A {{grand jury}} convened on January 30, 2004 to {{investigate}} the shooting; {{this was also the}} day of Stansbury's emotional funeral. Meanwhile, the controversy over NYPD Commissioner Kelly's initial statements on the shooting grew, with Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (the NYPD's union) stating: Commissioner Kelly gave a message to the 23,000 New York City police officers that said basically this: <b>Take</b> all <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> of doing your job, go up on all those roofs, patrol all those subway platforms, walk the streets day and night, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> to yourself, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> to your family, but then when the worst happens, when there's a tragedy, that you will not have the backing of the New York police commissioner.|$|R

25|$|Although the Archers {{claimed they}} were a normal, happily-married couple, by this time, {{according}} to the journalist Adam Raphael, Jeffrey and Mary Archer were living largely separate lives. The editor of the Daily Star, Lloyd Turner, was sacked six weeks after the trial by the paper's owner Lord Stevens of Ludgate. Adam Raphael soon afterwards found proof that Archer had perjured himself at the trial, but his superiors were unwilling to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of a potentially costly libel case. The News of the World later settled out-of-court with Archer, acknowledging they, too, had libelled him.|$|E
25|$|Although the 6600 and 7600 {{had been}} huge successes in the end, both {{projects}} had almost bankrupted the company {{while they were}} being designed. The 8600 was running into similar difficulties and Cray eventually decided that the only solution was to start over fresh. This time Norris {{was not willing to}} <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk,</b> and another project within the company, the CDC STAR-100 seemed to be progressing more smoothly. Norris said he was willing to keep the project alive at a low level until the STAR was delivered, at which point full funding could be put into the 8600. Cray was unwilling to work under these conditions and left the company.|$|E
25|$|Another of Ybor’s {{modifications}} to the company town model was that his community was not a one-(or even two-) company town. To {{increase the number of}} jobs (and thus the pool of available workers), Ybor encouraged other cigar manufacturers to move to his new colony by offering cheap land and a free factory building if they agreed to meet certain job-creation quotas. Even with these inducements, cigar workers and other cigar manufacturers were slow in coming to what was still a primitive settlement - few were willing to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of moving to and buying a home in a new place that might not last.|$|E

25|$|Schätzl {{could not}} remove her still intact PIP breast {{implants}} {{as a precaution}} (as recommended by Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices) because she announced in January 2012 that she was five months pregnant and therefore {{did not want to}} <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of a general anaesthetic in fear of harming her unborn child. Schätzl raised awareness about the problems women with the toxic implants faced; however, she never sold her interviews about this issue or her pregnancy for money to the press but helped with her media partners several women, who couldn't afford the operation, to have their implants replaced for free.|$|E
25|$|At {{this stage}} it was {{discovered}} that three of the men from 'H' Troop, No. 3 Commando could not swim and had to be left on the beach with additional French currency. Although Durnford-Slater requested that a submarine be sent back for these men, the Admiralty decided that it could not <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> and as a result the men later surrendered. During the extraction, a dinghy was used to ferry weapons to the boats, but on the fifth excursion it was dashed against a rock and overturned. One of the boat's two occupants, a soldier, was presumed drowned at the time, although later it was reported that he actually managed to get ashore and was subsequently captured.|$|E
25|$|A team {{of federal}} agents and {{officers}} from police forces {{from outside of}} Chicago was formed, along with {{a very small number}} of Chicago police officers. Among them was Sergeant Martin Zarkovich, the officer to whom Sage had acted as an informant. At the time, federal officials felt that the Chicago police had been compromised and therefore could not be trusted; Hoover and Purvis also wanted more of the credit. Not wanting to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of another embarrassing escape of Dillinger, the police were split into two groups.

25|$|The last {{missing in}} {{this list of}} saints is St. John Sarkander (Czech Jan Sarkander), whose statue (holding a lily {{as a symbol of}} purity) is on the second stage. John Sarkander was a priest who was {{tortured}} to death in Olomouc prison {{in the beginning of the}} Thirty Years' War, because he, as the legend says, refused to break the seal of confession. The decision to place him here violated the tradition, since Sarkander had not been canonized and not even beatified in that time yet, which could have resulted in problems with the Holy See. However, his following was so strong here that the craftsmen decided to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk.</b> Sarkander was beatified in 1859 and canonized in 1995 on the occasion of the visit of Pope John Paul II in Olomouc.|$|E
25|$|Capturing {{them would}} deal a deathblow to the Egyptian's {{strategic}} {{operation in the}} entire Peninsula. The capture of these four objectives were hoped to be {{the means by which}} the entire Egyptian Army would rout and fall back into Egypt proper, which British and French forces would then be able to push up against an Israeli advance, and crush in a decisive encounter. On 24 October, Dayan ordered a partial mobilization. When this led to a state of confusion, Dayan ordered full mobilization, and chose to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that he might alert the Egyptians. As {{part of an effort to}} maintain surprise, Dayan ordered Israeli troops that were to go to the Sinai to be ostentatiously concentrated near the border with Jordan first, which was intended to fool the Egyptians into thinking that it was Jordan that the main Israeli blow was to fall on.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{misfeasance}} provision reflects {{causes of}} action vested in the company, any money recovered under it is held {{so that it}} will go to pay off creditors in their ordinary order of priority. In Re Anglo-Austrian Printing & Publishing Union this meant that a liquidator who had successfully sued directors for £7000 had to give up the funds to a group of debenture holders, who had not yet been paid in full, so there is no discretion to apply the assets in favour of unsecured creditors. A potential benefit is that because the causes of action are vested in the company, they may be assigned to third parties, who may prefer to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> and reward of pursuing litigation over the liquidator or administrator. These features are the reverse for money recovered through the statutory based causes of action of fraudulent and wrongful trading.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the end of}} Indonesian {{confrontation}} in 1966, Tunku Abdul Rahman and his colleagues decided to Malaysianise the top posts in the navy and air force. They offered these posts to two senior Malaysian army generals, who declined for two main reasons. First they {{felt that they were}} not professionally qualified and second because {{they did not want to}} jeopardise their own careers in the army. Tunku and his colleagues then decided that they would select two officers, one from the navy and one from the air force, and appoint them chiefs of their respective services. They were fully aware of Rear Admiral Datuk K. Thanabalasingam's age but decided, nevertheless, to appoint him and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk.</b> This exercise created history not only because Malaysians for the first time were appointed to these two top posts but also because of his age—he was 31 years old and a bachelor. Under Thanabalasingam and with Tunku Abdul Rahman's foresight and will, they were responsible for initiating the gradual transformation of the navy from a coastal navy (brown water force) to an sea-going navy (green water navy).|$|E
25|$|We do {{not believe}} that Congress {{contemplated}} that such a taxpayer, without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore the duties imposed upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of invalidity to the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. See 26 U.S.C. 7422. Also, without paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the Tax Court, 6213, with the right to appeal to a higher court if unsuccessful. 7482(a)(1). Cheek took neither course in some years, and, when he did, was unwilling to accept the outcome. As we see it, he is in no position to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal prosecution under 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated, but, like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts who “willfully” refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being wrong.|$|E
25|$|Tatsuro Udo, battle {{programmer}} for Eternia, Rebirth and Graces, {{helped design}} the battle system. During {{the beginning of}} development, the team had to recreate the basic gameplay from the Xillia games to work off, which proved a difficult task for the team. The battle system was intended to combine familiar elements from previous installments with new ideas intended to refresh the series. Creating the seamless transition between exploration and combat, as well as implementing Armitization, proved to {{be difficult for the}} team. The idea of encountering and fighting enemies in the same space as exploration was designed to help evoke a fresh sense of adventure for players, as the team felt the previous method of transferring to a separate battle arena was limiting the series' development. Until the battle system's completion, development of other systems related to it was slow. As part of this development, a completely new engine had to be developed for the game, rather than just modified their old engine {{as they did in the}} past. Because of a staff shortage, developing the game was harder than previous titles and took a longer time. The PlayStation 3 was chosen as the original platform of release as the next generation of gaming hardware had yet to take off in Japan in terms of sales, and Bandai Namco was unwilling to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of releasing on platforms with low install bases.|$|E
