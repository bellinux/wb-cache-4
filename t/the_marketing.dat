40|$|In many industries, a {{regulator}} designs {{an auction}} to select ex-ante the firms that compete ex-post on <b>the</b> product <b>market.</b> This paper considers <b>the</b> optimal <b>market</b> structure when firms incur sunk costs before entering <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and when <b>the</b> {{government is not}} able to regulate firms in <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> We prove that a free entry equilibrium results in an excessive entry when the entry costs are private information. Then, we consider an auction mechanism selecting the firms allowed to serve <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and show that the optimal number of licences results in <b>the</b> socially optimal <b>market</b> structure. When all the potential candidates are actual bidders, the optimal number of firms in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> increases with <b>the</b> number of candidates and decreases with the social cost of public funds. When <b>the</b> <b>market</b> size is small, as the net profit in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> decreases with <b>the</b> number of selected firms, entry is endogenous. As increasing competition in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> reduces competition for <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> optimal structure is more concentrated than in the previous case.
