50|$|Another type of {{phenomenon}} {{that is important}} to analyze in this context is the existence of outliers that represent high values of the variable in a given location surrounded by low values in the neighboring locations. This functionality is available in GeoDa by means of Anselin's Moran scatter plot. Note however, that the fact that a value is high in comparison with the values in neighboring locations does not necessarily means that it is an outlier as we need to assess the statistical significance of that relationship. In other words, we may find areas where there seems to be clustering or where there may seem to be clusters but when the statistical procedures are conducted they turn to be non statistically significant clusters or outliers. The procedures employed <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>significance</b> consists on a Monte Carlo simulation of different arrangements of the data and the construction of an empirical distribution of simulated statistics. Afterwards the value obtained originally is compared to the distribution of simulated values and if the value exceeds the 95h percentile it is said that the relation found is significant at 5%.|$|E

40|$|Background: Causal graphs are an {{increasingly}} popular {{tool for the}} analysis of biological datasets. In particular, signed causal graphs–directed graphs whose edges additionally have a sign denoting upregulation or downregulation–can be used to model regulatory networks within a cell. Such models allow prediction of downstream effects of regulation of biological entities; conversely, they also enable inference of causative agents behind observed expression changes. However, due to their complex nature, signed causal graph models present special challenges with respect <b>to</b> <b>assessing</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>significance.</b> In this paper we frame and solve two fundamental computational problems that arise in practice when computing appropriate null distributions for hypothesis testing. Results: First, we show how to compute a p-value for agreement between observed and model-predicted classifications of gene transcripts as upregulated, downregulated, or neither. Specifically, how likely are the classifications to agree to the same extent under the null distribution of the observed classification being randomized?

30|$|Data are {{presented}} as median (interquartile range). Continuous variables were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests if they were non-normally distributed. Categorical variables were compared using the Pearson Chi-square or Fisher exact test. The urinary and plasma biomarker performance was ascertained using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The optimal cutoff values were acquired using the Youden index (sensitivity + specificity −  1), which is a common summary measure of the ROC curve representing the maximum potential effectiveness of a marker [31]. Comparisons of the ROC curves were performed as previously reported [30, 32]. All analyses were performed using a statistical analysis software (JMP ver. 11.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

The confidence levels decreased drastically as the weights increased. For instance, the result for the configuration with the highest MAP, i.e., Class weight = 2.0 (row E), had a confidence level of 73 % (p-value = 0.2707). As for Class weight = 3.0 (row F), not only the MAP dropped, but also the confidence level (32 %, p-value = 0.6783). The same was observed for Method weight = 3.0 (row C), which means 3.0 is a weight value beyond the threshold both for effectiveness and for significance.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to the HypTrails analysis, we use Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure (MRQAP) [54] <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>significance</b> of association between the concept co-editing network ties and various hypothesis. This method has a long established tradition in social network analysis {{as a way to}} sift out spuriously observed correlations [55], and is well-suited for analysing dyadic data where observations are autocorrelated if they are in the same row or column [3]. We treat the network of concept co-editing as a dependent variable matrix; the independent variable contains the set of hypotheses about the configuration of the network, expressed via hypotheses matrices. Formulation of hypotheses is given in Table  1. We normalise the matrices row-wise in order to standardise the values across matrices. MRQAP is a nonparametric test - it permutes the dependent variables to account for dyadic inter-dependencies. It is also robust against various underlying data distributions [56]. We used 1, 000 permutations, which usually suffices for the procedure [57].|$|E
