5|$|The Enterprise {{heads to}} Torona IV to open {{negotiations}} with <b>the</b> <b>Jarada,</b> an insect-like race that is unusually strict {{in matters of}} protocol. After practicing the complex greeting <b>the</b> <b>Jarada</b> require to open negotiations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes Cyrus Redblock (Lawrence Tierney) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen (David Selburg) {{to join him in}} the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary (Gary Armagnac) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the Enterprise is scanned from a distance by the Jaradan, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.|$|E
500|$|Outside, Wesley {{finds the}} glitch, however he cannot simply {{turn off the}} system for fear of losing {{everyone}} inside. Instead, Wesley resets the simulation, briefly placing Picard and {{the others in the}} middle of a snowstorm before finding themselves back in Dixon's office. With the reset successfully clearing the malfunction, the exit doors finally appear. Despite Picard's warnings, Redblock and Leech exit the holodeck, but dissipate as they move beyond the range of its holoemitters. As they leave the holodeck, Picard thanks McNary for his assistance, who now suspects that his world is artificial and asks whether Picard's departure is [...] "the big goodbye", to which Picard replies that he simply doesn't know. [...] Picard reaches the bridge in time to give the proper greeting to <b>the</b> <b>Jarada.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Jarada</b> accept the greeting, heralding the start of successful negotiations.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{idea for}} Picard's detective based holodeck program came from series creator Gene Roddenberry and other writing staff. Tracy Tormé {{received}} credit for writing the episode. Tormé said he added film noir elements, including references to The Maltese Falcon (1941). Redblock and Leech represent the characters played by Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. The production staff attempted {{to create the}} same layout of the detective office from the film. Dixon Hill was originally named Dixon Steele in reference to In a Lonely Place (1950), a film noir starring Humphrey Bogart. However, the name was changed due to similarities {{with the name of}} the title character in the [...] American television series, Remington Steele. Tormé expanded <b>the</b> <b>Jarada</b> a great deal, but because of budgetary restraints, they are only heard in the episode. [...] After the episode [...] "", [...] "The Big Goodbye" [...] is the second writing credit of the series for Tormé. Rob Bowman was originally scheduled to direct the episode, but following problems with [...] "Datalore", the filming order was switched, so Joe Scanlan directed [...] "The Big Goodbye" [...] instead.|$|E
