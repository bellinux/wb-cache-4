50|$|After {{the defeat}} of Napoleon the battery was abandoned. It was rebuilt in the mid-1840s, along with Coalhouse Fort. The second Shornemead Fort was {{constructed}} between 1848-52 to a polygonal plan inspired by {{the ideas of the}} French military engineer Montalembert, in a novel move away from the bastioned trace design used in other British forts of the time. It was an open battery like the first fort, but with much more numerous and powerful artillery - thirteen 32-pdr. guns on <b>traversing</b> <b>carriages,</b> each with a range of 2.7 km. The ramparts occupied three sides of the fort, facing the river. A barracks was constructed on the remaining two (landward) sides, along with bomb-proof magazines and defensive caponiers to flank the fort's ditch. The marshy ground caused major problems and the fort was not completed until 1853. Subsidence badly cracked the cookhouse and barracks, and one of the caponiers split away {{from the rest of the}} structure.|$|R
50|$|In 1936 the Red Army {{adopted the}} 122 mm gun M1931, {{also known as}} A-19. Unlike earlier {{ordnance}} pieces used by the Red Army, it had split trail carriage with suspension, and consequently improved mobility and <b>traverse.</b> The <b>carriage</b> of M1931 {{had a number of}} shortcomings though. The elevation mechanism was slow and unreliable; solid-tired wheels hindered mobility to some extent; there were technological problems in carriage production.|$|R
50|$|A variant on the Mougin turret is the Mougin casemate, {{which employs}} the 155mm Model 1877 gun on a {{hydraulic}} <b>traversing</b> <b>carriage</b> within an armored concrete casemate. The casemate has exceptionally low overhead clearance, {{resulting in a}} low profile above the ground. The gun can be traversed over a 60 degree arc, and can be elevated between -5 degrees and +20 degrees. This narrow range limits the gun to direct fire {{with a range of}} 7100 m, as most indirect fire requires greater elevation. The firing port measures 40 cm by 35 cm, and can be blocked with a thick counterweighted armored shield when not firing. An interlock prevents firing while the shield is in the way. The gun's muzzle remains behind the movable shield and is not visible from the outside.|$|E
50|$|In October 1779, {{during the}} Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-1783), the {{military}} {{operations at the}} recently constructed Green's Lodge Battery were so successful that the British decided to establish a battery even higher on the North Face, at the summit. The chosen site at Middle Hill was leveled and work was begun on a road to access the highest point of the North Face. However, the endeavour required some time, and the enthusiastic artillery gunners became impatient, not wanting to wait for completion of the new road. On their own initiative, they utilised a block and tackle system to drag a 24-pounder up {{the face of the}} Rock. After several days and much effort, they were successful. The platform for the gun was completed on 12 October 1779 and the gun was mounted on a <b>traversing</b> <b>carriage.</b> Firing from the battery began the following day. The emplacement was named Rock Gun Battery. From that elevated vantage point, the gunners were able to observe the operations of the enemy and fire upon the Spanish camp.The emplacement was rebuilt during the Second World War by the Black Watch, and a platform for anti-aircraft guns was constructed {{at the edge of the}} North Face. In the mid-twentieth century, the site shifted to one of radio transmission. In 1958, the Rock Gun radar and Middle Hill aerial transmitter site were refurbished and rebuilt. The work was undertaken by the GRISLY Squadron, more formally the Ground Radio Installation Squadron, of the Radio Engineering Unit of RAF Henlow. Rock Gun Battery was the site of 90-foot wooden towers with VHF and UHF aerials.|$|E
5000|$|These were {{designed}} for use aboard a ship or within a fortification and consisted of two large wooden slabs called [...] "cheeks" [...] held apart by bracing pieces called [...] "transoms". The trunnions of the gun barrel sat {{on the top of}} the cheeks; the rearward part of each cheek was stepped so that the breech could be lifted by iron levers called [...] "handspikes". Because these guns were not required to travel about, they were only provided with four small wheels called [...] "trucks", whose main function was to roll backwards with the recoil of the gun and then allow it to be moved forward into a firing position after reloading. Traversing the gun was achieved by levering the rear of the carriage sideways with handspikes. An improvement on this arrangement started at the end of the 18th century with the introduction of the <b>traversing</b> <b>carriage,</b> initially in fortifications but later on ships as well. This consisted of a stout wooden (and later iron) beam on which the entire gun carriage was mounted. The beam was fitted to a [...] at the centre, and to one or more trucks or [...] "racers" [...] at the front; the racers ran along a semi-circular iron track set in the floor called a [...] "race". This allowed the gun to be swung in an arc over a parapet. Alternatively, the pivot could be fitted to the front of the beam and the racers at the rear, allowing the gun to fire through an embrasure. The traversing beam sloped upwards towards the rear, allowing the gun and its carriage to recoil up the slope.|$|E
500|$|The new battery was {{constructed}} during 1799 on marshy ground {{a short distance}} south-east of St Catherine's Church. It took {{its name from the}} nearby Coalhouse Point, which was named for a coal wharf that once existed there to serve East Tilbury. The soft soil caused many problems but the work was completed by July of that year. It was equipped with four 24-pounder (pdr.) cannon mounted on <b>traversing</b> <b>carriages,</b> which enabled the gunners to track targets much more easily than had been the case with traditional garrison carriages. The battery faced the river with a semi-circular earthen rampart on which the guns were mounted. A walled-off area to the rear enclosed a barracks, magazine and shot kiln (for heating shot to set wooden ships on fire). The whole structure was surrounded by a polygonal water-filled ditch. It was modified in 1810 to raise the height of the rampart and to add a small expense magazine where ammunition was stored for immediate use. The French did not test the Thames defences, despite an invasion scare in 1804, and the battery was abandoned along with those at Lower Hope Point and Shornemead following Napoleon's final defeat in 1815.|$|R
500|$|On land {{a minimum}} crew of nine men (usually {{commanded}} by a non-commissioned officer) {{was required to}} fire the gun, which was normally mounted on a <b>traversing</b> gun <b>carriage.</b> On board a ship the gun crew could be doubled to 18 men who needed to <b>traverse</b> the gun <b>carriage</b> by hand, using hand spikes and rope tackles. The extra crew was {{on account of the}} fact that sailing ships usually only fired their cannon {{from one side of the}} deck. [...] In the unlikely event of both sides being in action at once, nine men would be detached to man the gun opposite. In both cases the gun was elevated using wooden wedges driven under the breech of the barrel by brute force. It was aimed using an advanced hexagonal sighting mechanism marked with the elevation on one face and the gun's range (according to different weights of cartridge charges) on the other five faces.|$|R
50|$|Krupp's K5 series were {{consistent}} in mounting a 21.5 m long gun barrel in a fixed mounting with only vertical {{elevation of the}} weapon. This gondola was then mounted {{on a pair of}} 12-wheel bogies designed to be operated on commercial and military rails built to German standards. This mounting permitted only two degrees of horizontal <b>traverse.</b> The <b>carriage</b> had to be aligned on the rails first, with only minimal fine leveling capable once halted. Hence the gun could only fire at targets tangential to an existing railway track.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} with World War I-era guns, the M1931 had split trail carriage, allowing for much wider <b>traverse</b> angle. The <b>carriage</b> was fitted with {{leaf spring suspension}} and ten-spoke metal wheels with solid rubber tires. Some late production pieces had ML-20-type wheels with pneumatic tires. The carriage also featured spring-type equlibrator. The shield gave the crew some protection from small arms and shell fragments.|$|R
25|$|The gun emplacements are symmetrical, {{single-storeyed}} {{structures of}} off-form concrete, waffle slab roof supported on three columns with earth fill on top, Australian-designed circular recoil pit with central pad and outlying rail for gun <b>carriage</b> <b>traverse,</b> side magazines {{of concrete and}} concrete block construction. Camouflage net pivot points are extant, and doors remain on the lower emplacement magazines. The robust off-form concrete construction is unlike the two-storeyed coastal battery gun emplacements of Moreton Bay, where timber as well as concrete was used structurally.|$|R
5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and <b>traverse</b> controls (<b>carriage</b> M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port muzzle brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the muzzle brake. Other sources mention the muzzle brake was intended to soften a recoil and they say that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|R
50|$|The barrel {{consisted}} of a loose liner and jacket which was screwed into the breech; the breechblock was of the interrupted screw type, borrowed from the 122 mm howitzer M1910/30. The variable length recoil system {{consisted of}} a hydraulic recoil buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator. The gun was fitted with segment-type elevation gear and screw-type <b>traverse</b> gear. The <b>carriage</b> was of the split trail type, with trolleybus-type wheels and rubber tires. To protect the crew from small arms fire and shell fragments, a shield was fitted.|$|R

500|$|Beneath the Henrician castle is {{a complex}} of {{artillery}} positions, {{cut out of the}} rock from around 1854 onwards, and collectively known as the Grand Sea Battery.

For many years the magazine was protected by an additional concrete fortification, but this was removed in 1970. There are two gun platforms along the west and east sides of the complex, [...] and [...] across respectively and known as the Lower Gun Battery. The current design of the western platform dates from the 1890s, with two raised concrete platforms for rotating guns and a brick-vaulted magazine just behind the battery.
