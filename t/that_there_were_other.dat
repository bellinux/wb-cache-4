5|$|In {{the years}} when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data. While his {{assertion}} was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept {{the idea that the}} mass extinctions {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.|$|E
5|$|The last review {{he wrote}} {{was for the}} film To the Wonder, which he gave 3.5 out of 4 stars in a review for the Chicago Sun-Times. It was {{published}} on April 6, 2013. In July 2013, a previously unpublished review of the film Computer Chess appeared on Ebert's website. The review had been written in March but had remained unpublished until the film's wide-release date. Matt Zoller Seitz, the editor for Ebert's website, confirmed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> unpublished reviews that would be eventually uploaded to the website. A second posthumously published review, for The Spectacular Now, was published in August 2013.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nothing is}} known of any other claimants to the throne, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> {{surviving}} descendants of Cerdic (the supposed progenitor of all the kings of Wessex) who might have contended for the kingdom. Ecgberht died in 839, and his will, according to the account of it found in the will of his grandson, Alfred the Great, left land only to male members of his family, so that the estates should not be lost to the royal house through marriage. Ecgberht's wealth, acquired through conquest, was no doubt one reason {{for his ability to}} purchase the support of the southeastern church establishment; the thriftiness of his will indicates he understood the importance of personal wealth to a king. The kingship of Wessex had been frequently contested among different branches of the royal line, and it is a noteworthy achievement of Ecgberht's {{that he was able to}} ensure Æthelwulf's untroubled succession. In addition, Æthelwulf's experience of kingship, in the subkingdom formed from Ecgberht's southeastern conquests, would have been valuable to him when he took the throne.|$|E

The duration of the K-T extinction event was less than 10 ky, and the time span is too short to be explained by Deccan volcanism. Geophysical models and high-precision radiometric dating suggest that the Chicxulub impact could have triggered some of the largest Deccan eruptions, and potentially, could have triggered eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on Earth.|$|E
5|$|On the Israeli side, several {{leaders of}} the Jewish city sent {{emergency}} telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate {{and that they could}} not hold out more than two weeks. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King Abdullah This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.|$|E
5|$|The lavish {{illumination}} programme is {{far greater}} than any other surviving Insular Gospel book. There are ten surviving full-page illuminations including two evangelist portraits, three pages with the four evangelist symbols, a carpet page, a miniature of the Virgin and Child, a miniature of Christ enthroned, and miniatures of the Arrest of Jesus and the Temptation of Christ. There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages {{for the first few}} words of each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages, there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text; in fact only two pages have no decoration.|$|E

30|$|The {{results from}} the {{sensitivity}} analyses depend on how we specify the sensitivity parameters. However, we observed that children who did not attend preschool were disadvantaged on basically all observed covariates. Although not entirely impossible, it seems unlikely <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> covariates where children who did not attend preschool are privileged. For this reason, we find it reasonable {{to rule out the}} possibility that our research design overestimates the treatment effect. Note <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> sensitivity-analysis techniques (see Liu et al. 2013 for an overview).|$|R

25|$|Fearing that juries {{would find}} it {{impossible}} to discount an implicating confession against a codefendant who stood alongside the confessor, the Court discounted such instructions. In a subsequent case, Parker, the Court was split on the same issue where each defendant had made his own confession. Writing in concurrence, Justice Blackmun argued that introduction of a codefendant's own interlocking confession could cause a harmless violation of the Confrontation Clause (he found such an example in that case), but <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> foreseeable cases in which {{it could lead to}} a more harmful violation.|$|E
25|$|Concerning the {{aforementioned}} fountain pen, this {{was said to}} be loaded with the poison Black Leaf 40 and passed to a Cuban asset in Paris the day of President Kennedy's assassination, November 22, 1963. Notably, the evidence also indicates that these two events occurred simultaneously, in the same moment. Rolando Cubela, the potential assassin, contests this account, saying Black Leaf 40 was not in the pen. U.S. Intelligence later responded to say that Black Leaf 40 was merely a suggestion but Cubela thought <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> poisons that would be much more effective. Overall he was unimpressed with the device. The inventor understood that Cubelo rejected the device altogether.|$|E
25|$|The defence in {{the case}} was handled by Mr. Thomas Campbell Foster, who argued during the trial that Charles had died from inhaling arsenic used as a dye in the green {{wallpaper}} of the Cotton home. The doctor testified that, in the chemist's shop, {{there was no other}} powder, only liquid, on the same shelf as the arsenic; the chemist himself, however, claimed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> powders. Campbell Foster argued that it was possible that the chemist had mistaken the arsenic powder for bismuth powder (used to treat diarrhoea), when preparing a bottle for Cotton, because he had been distracted by talking to other people. The jury retired for 90 minutes before returning a guilty verdict.|$|E

25|$|After Magical Ring, Clannad were {{commissioned}} to score the 26-episode drama series Robin of Sherwood, aired from 1984 to 1986.

25|$|The court first {{considered}} clause 2.1 in the Development Agreement. They noted that, {{while on}} its face it seemed to create in Burger King a right to terminate {{in the event of}} non-compliance by Hungry Jack's, it was actually subject to a number of qualifications, and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> procedures within the agreement for dealing with situations of non-compliance. The court disagreed with Burger King's broad reading of the consequences of a breach of clause 2.1, concluding that such an interpretation would mean that Hungry Jack's could not take advantage of the grace period, and that a narrower view should be preferred. Accordingly, they found that since Burger King had not allowed the 12-month grace period to expire, its termination was not effective.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} the Common Sayings Source relies {{a great deal on}} the {{acceptance}} of the two-source hypothesis or the three-source hypothesis and the existence of the Q source. In addition to the hypothetical material in the Q source, another important factor to the Common Sayings source is the information provided in the Gospel of Thomas. The Gospel of Thomas is a relatively recent discovery and it is possible <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> versions of the text, as can be said in the case of many other early Christian writings. A change in either the accepted Q document or another version of Thomas may prove to contain either more or less parallels. This could cause issues with the Common Sayings Source theory.|$|E
