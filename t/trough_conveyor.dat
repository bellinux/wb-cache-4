40|$|Pouch {{conveyor}} systems typically employ point-contact drives {{in order to}} generate traction. Differing from <b>troughed</b> <b>conveyors</b> which wrap the belt around a large drive pulley under high tension, point contact drives transmit force through load or indentation based contacts. This research focusses on quantifying the attainable drive traction for various surface configurations, including flat, concave and convex belts indented by cylindrical or spherical drive wheels. A viscoelastic contact under shear induces regions of stick and slip. Using this, the traction generated from each zone is superimposed to estimate the traction within the whole contact. These values are subsequently compared with experimental data indenting a cylindrical idler into a flat belt surface...|$|R
40|$|A <b>trough</b> chain <b>conveyor</b> has a <b>trough</b> (3) {{consisting}} of a base (16) and side walls (17, 18) and a conveyor chain (15) moving in said trough provided with scraper flights (29, 30). To increase the conveying capacity of such <b>trough</b> chain <b>conveyors,</b> {{it is intended to}} extend the cross-section of the trough (3) continuously upward so it can have a trapezoidal shape. At least the outer contour of the scraper flights (29, 30) are partially adapted to the base (16) and the side walls (17, 18) of the trough (3). If an intermediate base (4) is present, the inner contour of the scraper flights (29, 30) and the cross-section of the intermediate base (4) are adapted to each other...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{incorporation}} of conveyor systems throughout industry has seen {{an increase in}} demand for systems that exceed the specification of conventional conveyors. This coupled with the demand to convey bulk materials over larger distances, at higher speeds and efficiencies, requires {{the development of a}} versatile design approach. This thesis explores the design aspects associated with modern pouch conveying systems, and how they vary, and can be adapted from theories used with conventional <b>troughed</b> <b>conveyors.</b> In particular, the indentation rolling resistance (IRR) is explored in detail, as this can account for up to 60 % of the drag forces of a system. This is the drag force that arises due to an asymmetric pressure distribution as the idler roll shell indents the bottom cover of the belt. The potential idler roll arrangements for a generic pouch conveying system are analysed, and compared with experimental values. In addition to this, the drive traction attainable from suitable drive stations is analysed. <b>Troughed</b> <b>conveyors</b> typically wrap the conveyor belt around a large drive pulley, generating large amounts of traction. Given the layout of pouch conveying systems, a different approach is required, at multiple locations. As such, pouch conveyors are typically driven through simply supported drive stations, with small areas of contact with the belt. The useable traction from these point contact drives is considered. These theories are then united and applied to a dynamic package capable of handling multiple conveyor designs. This package utilises Finite Element Modelling (FEM) to model the viscoelastic nature of the system, based on the distributed drag forces, and inputs of the conveyor. Lastly, to qualify this theory, experimental analysis is conducted on an on-site installation, and compared with the theoretical results...|$|R

While conventional <b>troughed</b> belt <b>conveyors</b> have been used since the late 1800 's, a wide range of specialised belt conveyor systems have since been developed to meet the specific requirements of a diverse range of conveying applications. These requirements include; environmental limits and controls, topographical conditions, bulk material characteristics, and minimising energy intensity, to name but a few. The main characteristics of a number of specialised systems will be presented, highlighting the wide range of options currently available, in addition to their specific advantages and typical areas of application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This Screw {{conveyors}} {{are widely}} used for transporting and / or elevating particulates at controlled and steady rates. They are used in many bulk material applications in industries commonly agriculture, chemicals, plastics, cement, food processing. They are also used for metering (measuring the flow rates) from storage bins and adding small controlled amount of trace materials or powder. Many studies on screw conveyors were conducted to examine the performance and to develop new types. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the effect of percent trough load upon the horizontal screw conveyor power requirement and also gives the idea about selection of conveyor speed and diameter of screw. After considering previous papers it is noticed that percent trough load is a one parameter which is not considered effectively and it is discussed in this paper by taking examples.

40|$|Issue: One of {{the most}} common {{contaminants}} of recovered wood waste supplies is ferrous metal. One can find ferrous metal within crates, pallets, construction and demolition debris as nails, screws, staples and other hardware. Larger pieces such as scrap metal can also be found within the wood waste supply. Other sources of metal contaminant include damaged parts from the processing equipment (for example, sections of chain, bolts, and tools). Metal contaminants create problems for processing equipment. For example, chippers are sensitive to even the smallest pieces of metal. Even the sturdiest hog can receive serious damage from a piece of metal. Most importantly, to safeguard against damage to the equipment, detect ferrous metals at the in-feed of certain critical pieces of process equipment, like sizereduction equipment. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends wood waste processors install a metal detection system upstream of sensitive or critical process equipment. Generally, metal detection equipment is installed in a conveyor system. The basic equipment consists of a section of metal free <b>conveyor</b> <b>trough,</b> usually fiberglass, that contains a metal detecting coil. The detector is activated by the presence of magnetic or non-magnetic metal in the material flow. Any metal passing over the coil produces an electronic signal that activates an alarm system. The alarm usually sets off a warnin...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the energy {{management}} of belt conveyor systems (BCS) under various demandside management (DSM) programmes. The primary objective of this work is to model the energy consumption and energy related cost of operating <b>troughed</b> belt <b>conveyor</b> systems under different electricity pricing tariffs. This research is motivated by the increasing need for energy efficiency and energy cost reduction {{in the operation of}} BCS. This is as a result of technological improvements in BCS technology leading to increasingly longer belts being commissioned {{and as a result of}} rapidly rising electricity costs. An energy model derived from established industry standards is proposed for long conveyors. The newly proposed model uses a first-order partial differential equation (PDE) in order to capture the state of material on the belt. This new model describes the conveyor's power requirement using an equation with two parameters. A system identification set-up involving a recursive parameter estimating algorithm is simulated for measurements with varying degrees of noise. The results show that the proposed model estimates conveyor power and material delivered by long conveyors more accurately than the existing steady-state models. Downhill conveyors (DHCs) are important potential energy sources that can be tapped to improve the overall energy efficiency of BCSs. A generic optimisation model that is able to optimally schedule three configurations of BCS with DHC is proposed. The economic assessment of implementing dynamic braking and regenerative drives technology on downhill conveyors is undertaken with the help of the model. The assessment shows that combining regenerative drives and optimal operation of BCS with DHC generates energy savings that give attractive payback period of less than 5 years. A chance-constrained model predictive control (cc-MPC) algorithm is proposed for scheduling belt conveyor systems with uncertain material demand on the output storage. The chance-constraints are based on the modelling of material demand by a sum of known mean demand and, zero-mean and normally distributed random component. The cc-MPC algorithm is shown to produce schedules that give a smaller number and smaller magnitude of storage limit violations compared to normal MPC and chance-constrained optimal control algorithms. An equation that gives the amount of effective storage required to meet storage constraints for a given value of standard deviation is established. The optimal scheduling of BCS under the real-time pricing (RTP) tariff is considered. This study develops a methodology for establishing the economic value of price forecasting schemes for loads capable of load-shifting. This methodology is used to show that the economic benefit obtained from a forecast is highly dependent on the volatility of the electricity prices being predicted and not their mean value. The methodology is also used to illustrate why the commonly used indices mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are poor indicators of economic benefit. The proposed index using Kendall's rank correlation between the actual and predicted prices is shown to be a good indicator of economic benefit, performing far better than RSME and MAPE.
