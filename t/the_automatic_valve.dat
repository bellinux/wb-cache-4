40|$|Most furrow {{irrigation}} systems have low performance due to deep percolation at the upstream end and tailwater runoff at {{the downstream end}} of the field. To eliminate this problem improving {{furrow irrigation}} performance is necessary. Since the inflow discharge has high effect on infiltration along the furrow which consequently affects the application efficiency and water distribution uniformity, {{it would be important}} to apply different furrow inflow hydrograph shapes based on the field data such as field slope, soil texture and furrow length to save water. To produce different furrow inflow hydrograph shapes, an automatic valve which was connected to a stepper motor was designed to change the inflow discharge with time according to the desired inflow hydrograph shape. The experimental field was located at Isfahan University of Technology. A constant head water delivery system to the furrows including <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> was installed in the experimental field and the tests were conducted for different inflow hydrograph shapes.

40|$|Hermetic {{reciprocating}} compressors {{are widely}} used in small- and medium-size refrigeration systems based on the vapor-compression cycle. One of the main parts {{of this type of}} compressor is <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> system used to control the suction and discharge processes. As the suction and discharge losses represent a large amount of the total thermodynamic losses (47 %), a small improvement in the suction and discharge processes can produce expressive increases in the thermodynamic efficiency of the compressor. In this work, a new numerical methodology is applied to solve the flow through reed-type valves. The numerical results were experimentally validated through the pressure distribution acting on the frontal disk of a radial diffuser, which is a geometry usually used to model this type of valve. The numerical results for the velocity and pressure fields were comprehensively explored during the opening and closing movement imposed to the reed. The good quality of these results show that the numerical methodology is very promising in terms of solving the flow in the actual dynamics of reed-type valves...|$|E

One of the main parts {{of this type of}} compressor is <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> system used to control the suction and discharge processes. The experimental study of these processes in the compressor itself is very complex, mainly because the small size of the compressor. Thus, experimental analysis in laboratory valve models can be useful for improving the understanding of the flow characteristics. This work consists in an experimental investigation of the fluid-structure interaction problem in a model of reed suction valve with diameter ratio equal to 1. 3. The fluid-structure interaction problem was studied by measuring the instantaneous position of the reed by using a very accurate optical sensor. Results for Reynolds number based in the orifice inlet parameters varying from 2, 000 and 20, 000 were obtained. Due to hydrodynamic instabilities of the flow, the reed does not reach an equilibrium position, even for the constant mass flow rates prescribed for the flow. The results show that there is a well defined frequency for the reed movement for a given Reynolds number, which reduces slightly for increasing Reynolds numbers. Besides helping to improve the understanding of the flow characteristics in reed type valves, these results can also be used for validating computational codes used for the solution of general fluid-structure interaction problems, and specifically for reed type valves...|$|E

40|$|In situ upper-air {{measurements}} are often made with instruments attached to weather balloons launched {{at the surface}} and lifted into the stratosphere. Present day balloon-borne sensors allow near-continuous measurements from the Earth's surface to about 35 km (3 – 5 hPa), where the balloons burst and their instrument payloads descend with parachutes. It has been demonstrated that ascending weather balloons can perturb the air measured by very sensitive humidity and temperature sensors trailing behind them, particularly in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). The use of controlled balloon descent for such measurements has therefore been investigated and is described here. We distinguish between the one balloon technique that uses a simple automatic valve system to release helium from the balloon at a pre-set ambient pressure, and the double balloon technique that uses a carrier balloon to lift the payload and a parachute balloon to control the descent of instruments after the carrier balloon is released at pre-set altitude. <b>The</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> technique {{has been used for}} several decades for water vapor soundings with frost point hygrometers, whereas the double balloon technique has recently been re-established and deployed to measure radiation and temperature profiles through the atmosphere.

40|$|Hermetic {{reciprocating}} compressors {{are widely}} used in small and medium size vapor compression refrigeration systems. One of the main parts {{of this type of}} compressor is <b>the</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> system used to control the suction and discharge processes. As the opening and closing of the valves are caused by the forces produced by the refrigerant flow itself, the understanding of this fluid-structure interaction problem which characterizes the system dynamics is of fundamental importance in order to enhance the efficiency of the valve system. The numerical simulation of the flow has been used as an efficient method to perform this task. Most of the researchers simulated this problem by considering whether a geometric simplification for the valve (radial diffuser) or a simplification for the dynamics of the structure (one degree of freedom). In order to overcome these two drawbacks, in this work we simulate numerically the fluid structure interaction problem in a real geometry usually used in suction valves by considering a 3 D complete model for both the flow and the dynamics of the structure. The Ansys CFX CFD-Computational Fluid Dynamics software was used for the simulation of the flow coupled with the structure module available in the Ansys Mechanical. In addition, a 1 D model (one degree of freedom) was also implemented for simulating the dynamics of the structure for comparison reasons. The models were validated against experimental data for the aperture of the valve. We show that the 1 D model saves small computational time and provides good results for general characteristics of the problem as the force acting on the valve and the aperture of the valve, while the 3 D complete model allows us to predict the deformation of the structure. We suggest the use of the 3 D complete model because the computational time is not significantly increased...|$|E
