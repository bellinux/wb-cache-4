5|$|In 1977 {{the site}} was {{threatened}} with destruction as part of wider plans <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> the Klondike City site for gold. The land was instead purchased by the Government of Canada, and the site is now owned by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation. An archaeological investigation of the site took place in 1998, documenting {{the structure of the}} building and analysing the industrial remains.|$|E
5|$|In Fáfnismál, {{the dying}} wyrm Fafnir tells the hero Sigurd that, during {{the events of}} Ragnarok, bearing spears, gods will meet at Óskópnir. From there, the gods will cross Bilröst, which will break apart as they cross over it, causing their horses <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> through an immense river.|$|E
5|$|The current Causeway {{was built}} between 1947 and 1952, and {{designed}} by E. W. C. Godfrey. It {{is made up}} of two bridges, meeting at Heirisson Island. Considerable work was carried out <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> the river to provide much wider navigation channels. The Heirisson Islands were turned into a single island and a substantial portion of land beside Trinity College was reclaimed.|$|E

50|$|Dredging also {{releases}} {{plumes of}} suspended sediment, which can settle on coral reefs, damaging them by starving them {{of food and}} sunlight. Continued exposure <b>to</b> <b>dredging</b> spoil {{has been shown to}} increase rates of diseases such as white syndrome, bleaching and sediment necrosis among others. A study conducted in the Montebello and Barrow Islands showed that the number of coral colonies with signs of poor health more than doubled in transects with high exposure <b>to</b> <b>dredging</b> sediment plumes.|$|R
5|$|Annually, Manila is {{hit with}} 5 to 7 typhoons {{creating}} floods. In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) struck the Philippines. In its aftermath, {{the lack of}} infrastructure led {{to one of the}} worst floodings in the Philippines and creating a significant amount of pollution. Following the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana, the city began <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> its rivers and improve its drainage network. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission is in charge of cleaning up the Pasig River and tributaries for transportation, recreation and tourism purposes. Rehabilitation efforts have resulted in the creation of parks along the riverside, along with stricter pollution controls.|$|E
5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E

5|$|In December 1974, the Council bought Bridgwater Dock from British Railways. The {{concrete}} wall across the barge lock was removed, {{but there was}} no intention to restore the ship lock. By 1980, the Council had invested over £50,000 in the restoration, which included Kings and Standards locks, and the bottom gates of Newtown Lock. Some bridges had been raised, but only to , which allowed canoeing, but prevented bigger boats from using the waterway. Work on the deep cutting between West Street and Albert Street started in September 1978, jointly funded by the County Council and Sedgemoor District Council, using direct labour, while a Manpower Services Commission scheme <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> the canal from the dock to the cutting and to widen the towpath was funded by the District Council in 1981.|$|E
5|$|The agents later see Walter Chaco, Paula's {{grandfather}} and the plant's owner, who while shaken over Paula's death gives the agents permission {{to perform an}} autopsy. The agents find that while Paula's personnel file gives her age as 47, she appears no older than her mid-20's. They also discover that Paula suffered from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a rare and fatal illness that causes dementia. When the agents nearly collide with a Chaco Chicken truck, they learn that the driver also suffered from the disease. Noticing the plant's blood-red runoff in a nearby stream, Mulder orders a reluctant Sheriff Arens <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> it. They quickly find the bones of nine people, including Kearns. While inspecting the skeletal remains, the agents notice that the skeletons are all missing their skulls, and that the bones {{appear to have been}} boiled. Meanwhile, Randolph and Harold discuss the uncovered bones and increase of Creutzfeldt–Jakob cases. While Randolph complains about Chaco's inaction, Harold assures him that he will talk to Chaco.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, the Corps of Engineers {{transferred}} {{ownership of}} the Anacostia Flats and Kingman Lake to the National Park Service. As the Corps continued <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> fill, it expanded the flats {{on the eastern side}} of Kingman Lake, making it smaller than originally intended. Work on the lake stopped in 1941 due to budgetary and resource shortages associated with the advent of World War II.|$|E

25|$|The {{opening of}} the Monkland Canal and basin linking to the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port Dundas in 1795, {{facilitated}} access to the extensive iron-ore and coal mines in Lanarkshire. After extensive river engineering projects <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow, shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river, pioneered by industrialists such as Robert Napier, John Elder, George Thomson, Sir William Pearce and Sir Alfred Yarrow.|$|E

He planned <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> and drain the Everglades for development, as {{he did not understand}} the value of this unique area. Diston connected Lake Okeechobee with the Caloosahatchee River; this allowed steamboats to run from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Okeechobee and up the Kissimmee River.|$|E
25|$|Adam Brouwer, who {{had been}} a soldier {{in the service of the}} Dutch West India Company, built and {{operated}} the first gristmill patented in New York at Gowanus (on land patented July 8, 1645, to Jan Evertse Bout). The tide-water gristmill on the Gowanus was the first in the town of Breukelen and was the first mill ever operated in New Netherland (located north of Union Street, west of Nevins Street, and next to Bond Street). A second mill (Denton's Mill, also called Yellow mill) was built on Denton's mill pond, after being granted permission <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> from the creek to the mill pond once located between Fifth Ave and the present day canal at Carroll and Third Street. On May 26, 1664, several Breuckelen residents, headed by Brouwer, petitioned director general Peter Stuyvesant and his Council for permission <b>to</b> <b>dredge</b> a canal at their own expense through the land of Frederick Lubbertsen in order to supply water to run the mill. The petition was presented to the council on May 29, 1664, and the motion was granted. Another mill, Cole's Mill, was located just about at present day 9th Street, between Smith Street and the Canal. Cole's Mill Pond, located north of 9th street, occupied the present location of Public Place.|$|E
