5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. <b>The</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) {{he found that}} standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He {{found that there was}} only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, {{producer}} Robert H. Justman decided to prank Nimoy. He had partially convinced Nimoy that it would have been preferable to have permanent plastic surgery to point <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ears instead of requiring the hour and a half of makeup each day to apply them. It was only when Nimoy began to agree with Justman's suggestion that the producer let on that it was a joke, which Nimoy found amusing. Nimoy became unhappy with his pay during the course of the season, since Shatner was being paid more than he was. But he was asked by the producers to table the discussion until confirmation was received that the series was renewed.|$|E
25|$|According to Art O'Leary, {{as early}} as March 1934, Dillinger {{expressed}} an interest in plastic surgery and had asked O'Leary to check with Piquett on such matters. At the end of April, Piquett paid a visit to his old friend Dr. Wilhelm Loeser. Loeser had practiced in Chicago for 27 years before being convicted under the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1931. He was sentenced to three years at Leavenworth, but was paroled early on December 7, 1932, with Piquett's help. He later testified that he performed facial surgery on himself and obliterated the fingerprint impressions on <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fingers by the application of a caustic soda preparation. Piquett said Dillinger would have to pay $5,000 for the plastic surgery: $4,400 split between Piquett, Loeser and O'Leary, and $600 to Dr. Harold Cassidy, who would administer the anaesthetic. The procedure would take place at the home of Piquett's longtime friend, 67-year-old James Probasco, at the end of May.|$|E

25|$|Fogg {{had thought}} it was one day more than it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this simple fact. During his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. At the time, {{the concept of a}} de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware {{that it would be a}} day less than it used to be once he reached this line. Thus, the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line. But a de facto date line did exist since the UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times, and he should have noticed when he arrived to the US that the local date was not the same as in his diary (his servant Jean Passepartout kept his clock in London time, despite <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> surroundings).|$|E
25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|E
500|$|On April 9, 2005, Kris Lemche and Alexz Johnson {{were cast}} as the goth couple Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. Johnson, who was {{starring}} in the Canadian television series Instant Star (2004–2008), had auditioned to play Wendy's sister Julie; that role later went to Amanda Crew, who originally auditioned to play Erin. Johnson said that she wore a rocker jacket during her second reading and was in a bad mood. As she was leaving, the filmmakers called her back to read for Erin, with the dialogue in her scene being sarcastic. Johnson thought that her dry sense of humor, which the filmmakers caught, helped her land the role. Regarding his role, Lemche said that Ian [...] "spouts some interesting facts {{that seem to be}} just right there on <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fingers". Lemche researched most of Ian's information. During read-throughs, he often asked Morgan about Ian's facts; to help him, Morgan wrote Lemche notes and gave him URLs to research the information Ian gives out.|$|E
