5000|$|As Palda (2013, page 132) writes [...] "In his 1974 and 1986 {{articles}} Sherwin Rosen {{asked what}} would happen if you were limited in how you could move about through characteristics space. Rosen pointed out that sometimes when buying a product with several underlying characteristics you could not just go out and span characteristics space by buying a bit of another product with the same characteristics but in different proportions. The reason was that sometimes when you buy something, you are selling something {{at the same time and}} are able to sell uniquely to onepurchaser. Recombining goods to balance characteristics to suit your tastes is not possible. Rosen called such exchanges tied-sales."Rosen showed that <b>tied</b> <b>sales</b> could lead to the segregation of people by their types. He argued that the worst effects of segregation could be palliated by a market that resolved supply and demand of complicated <b>tied</b> <b>sales</b> situations through a monetary payment he called an “equalizing difference”. This work led to many unexpected insights on the effects of government policy. For example, the minimum wage might not decrease employment, as economists commonly believed, but it might induce employers to provide less on-the-job training to employees. In addition to implications for policy, Rosen's analysis of choice in characteristics space with <b>tied</b> <b>sales</b> specified the conditions under which the parameters of demand and supply function parameters for the underlying characteristics of goods could be deduced from so-called hedonic regressions.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Three related topics {{have been}} {{explored}} in this thesis. Those three topics {{deal with the}} pricing problems both {{in the market for}} access rights to fish and in the market for seafood. The {{purpose of this study is}} to contribute some insights into the global picture of fishery management and the market for seafood. As the consequence of the 200 -mile EEZs claims, many coastal nations and distant water fleets have been looking for cooperative fishing arrangements and the market for access rights is emerging. By using a linear control model, the study has demonstrated that the maximum present value of net revenue derived from the resource is negatively related with the discount rate under the sole owner assumption. This finding provides some help both in analyzing the coastal nations' and distant water fleets' competitive abilities and in examining how prices are determined in the market for access. Most seafood at the retail level is sold to consumers through supermarkets that are multiproduct sellers and have some monopoly power. This study has explored the Redacted for Privacy pricing strategy of a multiproduct monopolist, examined the difference in the comparative statics as between the single and multiproduct monopolist, and provided a conceptual explanation for a phenomenon in the seafood industry: purchase restrictions imposed by seafood processors on fishermen. Tying selling is a specific pricing strategy used by many multiproduct sellers. In the literature on <b>tying</b> <b>sales,</b> one issue that has received little attention is <b>tying</b> <b>sales</b> as a reaction to price controls. This study has demonstrated (a) how a competitively supplied good can be used as a tying good and how it works under price controls, (b) how <b>tying</b> <b>sales</b> arrangements under price controls can be used as a price discrimination tool to increase the monopolist's profits, in addition to be used in evasion of price controls, and (c) how the pure bundling pricing may dominate mixed bundling pricing in most circumstances under price controls...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In {{the last}} ten years the seed and {{pesticide}} industries have undergone a substantial number of structural changes. These changes are due to a number of factors, some of which are common to all industries and some of which are specifically tied to the biotechnology that is increasingly important in the seed and chemical industries. The focus of this paper is on these latter linkages. The horizontal mergers and acquisitions can be linked to R&D costs, economies of scale and scope created by intellectual property rights, and to regulatory costs, while the increased vertical linkages are connected to product complementarity and to the difficulty in enforcing certain types of intellectual property. In other cases, the rise of better defined intellectual property rights has been a factor in the joint ventures and strategic alliances that have occurred. The pricing behavior of the large firms in the seed and chemical industries appears to be strategic in nature, with pricing being influenced by competition from other products and the value created by their products. There is substantial evidence of price discrimination, whether it {{is in the form of}} TUAs, differential pricing, or <b>tied</b> <b>sales.</b> The major impact of this strategic pricing is not on the total economic surplus created as a result of R&D, but rather on the distribution of this surplus...|$|R

Civilizations have invented {{numerous}} ways to cope with uncertainty, statistics is one of those technologies. The rhetoric as the discourse of investment theory uncovers that the theory of statistics applied is a blind spot in the current conversation about investment theory and practice. Probability and prediction in investment theory look like a <b>tying</b> <b>sale,</b> since investment theory is founded on stochastical predictability. The proof of unpredictability, however, lies outside the paradigm of statistics, because statistics assumes that the substrate, that produces probability outcomes, is stable. The theory of objective probabilities founds the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) but does not stochastically predict, and neither do Markowitz’s subjective probabilities for his portfolio theory. Statistical models for investing have a function, despite that they cannot predict: in essence, the models try to quantify statistically the equity, the fairness of the distribution of risk and return between parties involved. In the dissertation, a lot of ideas to change finance have had attention: the alternative statistical theory of Mandelbrot, bubble theory, political finance, the analysis of rhetoric, the analysis of culture, innovative practices, ethics in the form of virtue and value ethics, and the history of finance. How to make the culture of finance more heterogeneous?

40|$|Credit life insurance, which repays {{some or all}} of a borrower's {{outstanding}} debt in the event of death, has been a controversial subject for many years. Critics assert that, despite regulations that limit <b>tied</b> <b>sales,</b> pressure on loan officers to generate fee income through cross selling creates an incentive for coercion of borrowers. Allegedly, some sales techniques leave the consumer with the false impression that the purchase of credit insurance was necessary to obtain the loan. This article measures the frequency with which creditor efforts to sell credit insurance transform the sales message from persuasive to coercive. A methodology is developed for measuring the impact of coercive selling pressure applied to borrowers at the point of sale. Data used to measure the effect of coercive pressure are taken from an extensive survey of borrowers conducted during 1993. Not only are public policy concerns about coercion in the selling of credit insurance addressed, but more generally the article offers a methodology to quantify the influence of the customer's point-of-sale experience on the decision to purchase any financial service. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

All eyes were on Salé and Pelletier to break the streak and win, overcoming the Russian pairs dominance that had lasted for 40 years. They skated a clean short program, only to trip and fall on their closing pose. Because the fall was not on an element, it did not receive a deduction. They placed second behind Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze. In the long program, Sale and Pelletier also placed second. A minor jump step out error from Sikharulidze and a clean program from the Canadians had many convinced that Salé and Pelletier had won the gold but when the judges' scores came up, Salé and Pelletier were placed second in the long program. Five judges had awarded the long program to Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, and only four to Salé and Pelletier. This result spurred an outcry from the North American media and booing from many audience members, but Salé and Pelletier accepted the silver medal. The next day, the French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne admitted she had been pressured into awarding the long program to the Russians {{in exchange for a}} first-place vote for the French ice dancing team of Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, and a judging controversy quickly blew up.

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1857 by George Ruder and Frank Wahle. In 1864, the company {{provided}} its beer to the troops during the American Civil War. The brewery was subsequently sold to Andrew and Jacob Lutz in 1867. The Lutz family continued operations until it was sold to Gustav Kuenzel in 1897. The company was then organized as the Gustav Kuenzel Brewing Company in 1901. The following year, it was renamed the Stevens Point Brewing Company. Ludwig Korfman purchased a controlling interest in the company in 1924 and reorganized the company as the Stevens Point Beverage Company. The company faced local competition from the mid-1860s through the Prohibition era of the 1920s, when the remaining competition went out of business. During the 1950s, the brewery began using cans in production. In 1973, Point Special brand beer was rated the top American beer in a taste test as reported by Mike Royko, a prominent columnist for the Chicago Daily News. By the 1970s the company was owned by Felix and Ken Shibilski. In 1990, the company first began selling its product outside Wisconsin, in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Minnesota. In 1992, the Shibilskis sold the company to Chicago-based Barton Beers Ltd. The new ownership was unique for Barton in that Point beer was its only domestic product line, {{with all of its}} other offerings being imports. The company planned to <b>tie</b> <b>sales</b> to its Mexican brand, Corona, but when that brand's sales exploded, the Point brand became a distraction. In 2002, the company was sold back to Wisconsin ownership by Milwaukee-based real estate developers Joe Martino and Jim Wiechmann. That same year, the company introduced gourmet sodas to its beverage list. In 2003, Point Special won the gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in the premium lager category. In 2005, the company bought four beer brands from the James Page Brewing Company. By 2008, the company's products were distributed to 18 different states. For nearly 20 years, the company brewed and bottled Karl Strauss Brewing Company brands until production was moved in January, 2009.|$|R
