40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore three {{important}} areas where deeper <b>trade</b> and financial <b>integration</b> in East Asia can influence: (1) business cycle co-movements in the region, (2) the extent of risk sharing across countries and (3) price co-movements across countries.

Especially the fact that <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> does not raise co-movements of consumption as much as that of output is interpreted as <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> does not improve the extent of risk sharing. Co-movements of price arise most significantly as <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> deepens, lowering the border effects and allowing better opportunities for resource reallocation across countries. In contrast, financial integration demonstrates much weaker evidence of enhancing co-movements across countries. Deeper financial integration improves price co-movements weakly but does not enhance output or consumption co-movements at all. However, since {{the current level of}} financial integration in East Asia is quite low, our evidence is too early to firmly determine the role of financial integration.
