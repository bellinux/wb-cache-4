40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the polynomial-time learnability of a {{language}} class in <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> from positive <b>data,</b> and discusses the learning problem of a subclass of deterministic finite automata (DFAs), called strictly deterministic automata (SDAs), {{in the framework of}} learning in <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> from positive <b>data.</b> We first discuss the difficulty of Pitt's definition in the framework of learning in <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> from positive <b>data,</b> by showing that any class of languages with an infinite descending chain property is not polynomial-time learnable in <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> from positive <b>data.</b> We then propose new definitions for polynomial-time learnability in <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> from positive <b>data.</b> We show in our new definitions that the class of SDAs is iteratively, consistently polynomial-time learnable in <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> from positive <b>data.</b> In particular, we present a learning algorithm that learns any SDA M in <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> from positive <b>data,</b> satisfying the properties that (i) the time for updating a conjecture is at most O(`m) [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In photoacoustic tomography, one is {{interested}} {{to recover the}} initial pressure distribution inside a tissue from the corresponding measurements of the induced acoustic wave on the boundary of a region enclosing the tissue. In <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> view problem, <b>the</b> wave boundary measurements are given {{on the part of}} the boundary, whereas in the full view problem, the measurements are known on the whole boundary. For the full view problem, there exist various fast and accurate reconstruction methods. These methods give severe reconstruction artifacts when they are applied directly to <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> view <b>data.</b> One approach for reducing such artefacts is trying to extend <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> view <b>data</b> to <b>the</b> whole region boundary, and then use existing fast reconstruction methods for the full view data. In this paper, we propose an operator learning approach for constructing an operator that gives an approximate extension of <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> view <b>data.</b> We then consider the behavior of a reconstruction formula on <b>the</b> extended <b>limited</b> view <b>data</b> that is given by our proposed approach. We analyze approximation errors of our approach. This analysis gives recommendations for the choice of the training functions in our operator learning procedure. We also present numerical results that demonstrate the use of the proposed extension of <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> view <b>data</b> in practice. The proposed operator learning approach can also be applied to <b>limited</b> <b>data</b> problems in other tomographic modalities...|$|R

25|$|Emulsion {{polymerisation}} is the commonest {{means of}} making {{a wide variety of}} industrial polymers, such as paints, adhesives and tyre rubber. It is a complex process involving many simultaneous and separate processes and where historically only a few types of data were available. The complexity and <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>data</b> types meant that conflicting assumptions could be forced to agree with experiment: there was no proper understanding of the process. Gilbert developed and applied mathematical and experimental tools whereby the effects resulting from individual processes could be isolated for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{discharge}} of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is via the five major ice streams (faster flowing ice) entering the Ross Ice Shelf, the Rutford Ice Stream entering Ronne-Filchner shelf of the Weddell Sea, and the Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier entering the Amundsen Ice Shelf. Opinions differ as to the present mass balance of these systems (Bentley 1983, 1985), principally because of <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>data.</b> The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is stable {{so long as the}} Ross Ice Shelf is constrained by drag along its lateral boundaries and pinned by local grounding.|$|E
25|$|An {{independently}} written {{narrative of}} Paul's life and ministry, {{found in the}} Acts of the Apostles, is {{used to determine the}} date, and possible authorship, of Pauline letters by locating their origin within the context of his life. For example, Paul mentions that he is a prisoner in his Epistle to Philemon 1:7; based on this statement, J. A. T. Robinson argued that this captivity was Paul's imprisonment in Caesarea, while W. M. Ramsay identified this as Paul’s captivity in Rome, while others have placed the captivity in Ephesus. One difficulty with this position is <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>data</b> available on Paul's historical setting, and this is especially true with the conclusion of the narrative of Acts prior to Paul's death. It also assumes that the book of Acts was written by an actual traveling companion of Paul's.|$|E

25|$|In early 2014, {{using data}} from the Herschel Space Observatory, it was {{discovered}} that there are several localized (not more than 60km in diameter) mid-latitude sources of water vapor on Ceres, which each give off about 1026 molecules (or 3kg) of water per second. Two potential source regions, designated Piazzi (123°E, 21°N) and Region A (231°E, 23°N), have been visualized in the near infrared as dark areas (Region A also has a bright center) by the W. M. Keck Observatory. Possible mechanisms for the vapor release are sublimation from about 0.6 km2 of exposed surface ice, or cryovolcanic eruptions resulting from radiogenic internal heat or from pressurization of a subsurface ocean due to growth of an overlying layer of ice. Surface sublimation would be expected to decline as Ceres recedes from the Sun in its eccentric orbit, whereas internally powered emissions should not be affected by orbital position. <b>The</b> <b>limited</b> <b>data</b> available are more consistent with cometary-style sublimation. The spacecraft Dawn is approaching Ceres at aphelion, which may constrain Dawn's ability to observe this phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|Also, some direct {{allusions to}} death, killing actions, and violent expressions, {{as well as}} {{offensive}} words {{have been replaced by}} softer expressions. For example, after Edgar, Locke and Terra flee on chocobos from Figaro Castle, Kefka orders two Magitek Armored soldiers to chase them by shouting [...] "Go! KILL THEM!", in the Japanese version. It was translated as [...] "Go! Get them!" [...] Also, when Imperial Troopers burn Figaro Castle, and Edgar claims Terra is not hidden inside the castle, Kefka replies [...] "then you can burn to death" [...] in the Japanese version, which was replaced in the English version by [...] "Then welcome to my barbecue!". Similarly, as Magitek soldiers watch Edgar and his guests escape on Chocobos, one swears in Japanese, [...] "Son of a bitch!", which was translated by Ted Woolsey as [...] "Son of a submariner!". The localization also featured changes to several names, such as [...] "Tina" [...] being changed to [...] "Terra". Finally, dialogue text files had to be shortened due to <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>data</b> storage space available on the game cartridge's read-only memory. As a result, additional changes were rendered to dialogue in order to compress it into the available space.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} be profitable, many {{alternatives}} to oil require {{the price of oil}} to remain above some level. Investors in these alternatives must gamble with <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>data</b> on oil reserves available. This imperfect information can lead to a market failure caused by a move by nature. [...] One explanation for this is Hotelling's rule for non-renewable resources. Even with perfect information the price of oil correlates with spare capacity and spare capacity does not warn of a peak. [...] For example, in the early 1960s (10 years before oil production peaked in the United States), there was enough spare capacity in US production that Hubbert's predicted peak of 1966-1971 was [...] "at the very least completely unrealistic to most people," [...] preventing the necessary steps being taken to mitigate the situation. [...] The absence of accurate information about spare production capacity exacerbates the current situation.|$|E
