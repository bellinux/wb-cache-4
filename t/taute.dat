In the earliest known art of the world, a reindeer hunt may be scratched in outline on the flat side of a clean-picked bone, and a reindeer's head carved out of the end of it; both these are flint-knife work, and, strictly speaking, sculpture: but the scratched outline is the beginning of drawing, and the carved head of sculpture proper.

40|$|Abstract. With {{the rise}} of chip-multiprocessors, the problem of parallelizing {{general-purpose}} programs has once again {{been placed on the}} research agenda. In the 1980 s and early 1990 s, great successes were obtained to extract parallelism from the inner loops of scientific computations. General-purpose programs, however, stayed out-of-reach due to the complexity of their control flow and data dependences. More recently, thread-level speculation (TLS) has been <b>tauted</b> as the definitive solution for general-purpose programs. TLS again targets inner loops. The program complexity issue is handled by checking and resolving dependences at runtime using complex hardware support. However, results so far have been disappointing and limit studies predict very low potential speedups, in one study just 18 %. In this paper we advocate a completely different approach. We show that signficant amounts of coarse-grain parallelism exists in the outer program loops, even in general-purpose programs. This coarse-grain parallelism can be exploited efficiently on CMPs without additional hardware support. This paper presents a technique to extract coarse-grain parallelism from the outer program loops. Application of this technique to the MiBench and SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks shows that significant amounts of outerloop parallelism exist. This leads to a speedup of 5. 18 for bzip 2 compression and 11. 8 for an MPEG 2 encoder on a Sun UltraSPARC T 1 CMP. The parallelization effort was limited to 10 to 20 person-hours per benchmark while we had no prior knowledge of the programs. ...|$|R

However, although hundreds of AMPs have been isolated, only a few have been investigated for their possible mode of action. The generally accepted mode of action for AMPs against Gram-negative bacteria is that the AMPs interact with the highly negatively charged surface of the membrane consisting of lipopolysaccharide. Then, the AMPs insert and translocate to the outer bilayer to bind the anionic inner membrane by a self-promoted uptake pathway (Hancock 2001; Mangoni et al. 2004). However, some studies discovered that rapid killing occurs due to serious reduction of membrane integrity at high concentrations. Membrane activity for the AMPs Os and Os-C may have intracellular targets such as DNA, similar to melittin at low concentrations (<b>Taute</b> et al. 2015). The killing mode of AMPs is complex and remains incompletely understood.|$|E

Background Changes of central and peripheral venous hemodynamics (PVH) are registered in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with right ventricular dysfunction (RVD). It can be assumed the change of PVH is detectable through spectral Doppler waveform analysis of the common femoral veins (CFV) and regular respiratory modulated (RM) flow is replaced as a function of the severity of the RVD by cardiac modulation (CM) of the velocity-time spectra. The aim of this study is to examine, through detection of CM at the CFV, whether indirect diagnostics of the RVD is possible in patients with acute PE. Methods Quantification of RVD was performed through an echocardiographic right heart score (RHS) in patients with acute PE.
