5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>information</b> as a manual paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E
5|$|The 52 {{incorporated}} municipalities in Lycoming County are {{the subject}} of the first list, which gives their names and etymologies, dates settled and incorporated, what they were formed from, area, population, and location within the county. Two other lists dealing with former parts of Lycoming County are included. The second list is of former incorporated townships and gives <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>information</b> as above on their current status. The third list gives information on the eighteen other Pennsylvania counties which were formed from or contain land originally in the county.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the MAR, {{which would}} be {{tracking}} targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with {{any or all of}} the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could reduce the number of faces and get <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>information</b> by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E
5|$|Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head {{of human}} resources, {{suggests}} to Vidya {{that her husband}} resembled former employee Milan Damji (Indraneil Sengupta), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>information.</b> Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have {{attracted the attention of}} two Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. (Dhritiman Chatterjee) and his deputy Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the scope}} of his work expanded. On the one hand, Phipps wished to avoid rehashing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>information</b> that was available, but the careers of the marshals {{required}} some duplication. The published works were often filled with inconsistencies, {{not only in the}} French sources, but from the French to the English sources. The French sources frequently misinterpreted the English sources, and vice versa. Phipps wrote both an introduction to his work and a summary of the histories of the armies of the Republic and the Consulate, from 1791 to 1804, and at certain points in his narrative, he paused to review the positions of the various future marshals and other well-known generals. He reflected on the development of their experience, the characteristics of their leadership, and the relationships to one another and to Napoleon. Critically, he posited that generals rarely improved with practice.|$|E

From these arrangements, we construct four other arrangements such {{that there is}} no orientation-preserving homeomorphism between them. Furthermore, some couples of arrangements among this 4 -tuplet form new arithmetic Zariski pairs, i. e. a couple of arrangements with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> combinatorial <b>information</b> but with different embedding in CP^ 2.

5|$|The {{traditional}} role of cavalry in war is scouting—gathering {{information about the}} enemy's location, strength, and movements—while denying the enemy <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>information</b> about one's own forces. Other tasks include raiding into enemy territory and damaging their infrastructure and economy while avoiding conflict with enemy forces. On the field of battle, cavalry were expected to charge into and break up enemy infantry and cavalry formations. The prestige gained by participating in a cavalry charge was such that additional officers would attempt to join one whenever possible. Notable examples of this include Louis Nolan of the 15th Hussars joining the Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War and Winston Churchill of the 4th Hussars joining the 21st Lancers for their charge during the Battle of Omdurman.|$|E

25|$|The term wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} {{is commonly}} applied to an optical carrier, which is typically described by its wavelength, whereas frequency-division multiplexing typically applies to a radio carrier {{which is more}} often described by frequency.

25|$|There are {{accounts}} that Swallow engaged in whaling in 1807 and 1809-10. Although {{there is no}} record of her in Lloyd's Register after 1805, she does appear in the Register of Shipping in 1809 with F.

25|$|Studies {{have also}} noticed that people {{demonstrate}} more optimistic bias when making comparisons {{when the other}} is a vague individual, but biases are reduced when {{the other is a}} familiar person, such as a friend or family member.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{the application of the}} owner-compute rule for the parallelization of HPF-style numerical programs and the use of Mome, a software DSM, as a base for the run-time system. Mome is a page-based relaxed consistency DSM which allows the parallel processors to make consistency requests on individual pages, for instance after synchronization operations. We show that, from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>informations</b> used for explicit message passing run-time systems, it is possible to control the behavior of our DSM and to obtain good performance...|$|R

25|$|After transcribing and {{proofreading}} {{each letter}} to ensure document accuracy, PJM staff members research and annotate the letters, identifying people, places, and events so readers have much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>information</b> Madison {{had when he}} received or wrote the correspondence.

40|$|Data were {{available}} for 12 poultry microsatellites and 29 poultry single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and for 34 cattle microsatellites and 36 cattle SNPs.
