50|$|After {{the fire}} in the Reichstag on February 27, Hindenburg could be persuaded that this, and not his {{appointment}} of Hitler, caused an emergency situation, and that he thus needed to decree the partial suspension of <b>the</b> <b>Reich's</b> constitution, which he did. After the Prussian Coup the Nazis in <b>the</b> <b>Reich's</b> government, with Hermann Göring holding simultaneously <b>the</b> <b>Reich's</b> and Prussian ministry of the interior, could command executive forces of Prussia's police. Thus the Nazis could start to arrest political opponents. Also Carlebach, the Familienblatt's editor, was arrested. He attributed his arrest to Goebbels, who resented Carlebach for unveiling facts from the times, when Goebbels was still studying.|$|R

5|$|As Germany's {{situation}} deteriorated, Hitler {{decided to}} form the Volkssturm, a Nazi Party local militia to defend communities within <b>the</b> <b>Reich.</b> On 24 September 1944, Hitler appointed his private secretary and head of <b>the</b> <b>Reich</b> Chancellery, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann {{to form the}} Volkssturm. Himmler was given responsibility for the military organisation and equipment of the new militia, which he delegated to Berger, who became one of two chiefs of staff for the organisation. Bormann resisted Berger's attempts {{to take over the}} Volkssturm, and it remained largely under Bormann's control, with local recruiting conducted by the Gauleiters.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, Berger reorganised the SS-HA {{to focus}} better on its main role of {{recruiting}} for the Waffen-SS, creating separate sections {{to deal with}} recruiting inside and outside <b>the</b> <b>Reich.</b> The section targeting recruits from outside of <b>the</b> <b>Reich</b> developed out of a briefing he received from the Chief of the SS-Führungshauptamt (SS Command Main Office, or SS-FHA) SS-Brigadeführer Hans Jüttner on Hitler's expectations of the Waffen-SS for the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, which included the raising of a fourth division {{and the expansion of}} the LSSAH to a motorised brigade. Berger realised that the Wehrmacht quotas for the Waffen-SS would fall short of its manpower needs by at least 6,000 per year.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1941, Hitler {{had agreed}} to the {{creation}} of the SS-Freiwilligenstandarte Nordwest (SS Volunteer Regiment Northwest), with an authorised strength of 2,500 men recruited from Flanders and the Netherlands. This formation capitalised on the push for an autonomous Flemish-Dutch region within <b>the</b> <b>Reich.</b> Significant proponents of such a union were Anton Mussert of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands and Staf De Clercq of the Flemish National League. In this, Berger was exploiting Mussert and De Clerq, because he was actually working towards Hitler's idea of incorporating Flanders and Wallonia into <b>the</b> <b>Reich</b> as two Gaue, not a unified autonomous entity.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April 1945, when Soviet {{troops were}} within {{a block or}} two of <b>the</b> <b>Reich</b> Chancellery, Hitler shot himself and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule.

5|$|Adolf Joseph Ferdinand Galland (19 March 1912 – 9 February 1996) was a German Luftwaffe {{general and}} flying ace who served {{throughout}} the Second World War in Europe.

5|$|Against his wishes, Kesselring was {{discharged}} from the army on 1 October 1933 and appointed head of the Department of Administration at <b>the</b> <b>Reich</b> Commissariat for Aviation (Reichskommissariat für die Luftfahrt), the forerunner of <b>the</b> <b>Reich</b> Air Ministry (Reichsluftfahrtministerium), with the rank of Oberst (colonel). Since the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany from establishing an air force, this was nominally a civilian agency. The Luftwaffe would formally be established on 26 February 1935. As chief of administration, he had to assemble his new staff from scratch. He {{was involved in the}} re-establishment of the aviation industry and the construction of secret factories, forging alliances with industrialists and aviation engineers. He was promoted to Generalmajor (major general) in 1934 and Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) in 1936. Like other generals of Nazi Germany, he received personal payments from Adolf Hitler; in Kesselring's case, RM 6,000, a considerable sum at the time.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, the Olympic close {{hunting season}} had ended. The Gestapo {{increased}} its suppression, undermining the readiness for compromises among the Confessing Church. Zoellner concluded that this made his reconciliatory work impossible and criticised the Gestapo activities. He resigned on 2 February 1937, paralysing <b>the</b> <b>Reich's</b> ecclesiastical committee, which thus lost all recognition among the opposition. Kerrl now subjected Ludwig Müller's chancery of the German Evangelical Church directly to his ministry and <b>the</b> <b>Reich's,</b> provincial and state ecclesiastical committees were soon after dissolved.|$|R

5|$|At 01:00 on 2 May, the Soviets {{picked up}} a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps {{requesting}} a cease-fire and stating that emissaries would come under a white flag to Potsdamer bridge.

5|$|Despite this success, Berger {{still had}} to {{negotiate}} with the Wehrmacht, which opposed his attempts to expand the Waffen-SS at almost every turn. In early 1940, Himmler and Berger were outmaneuvered by Generaloberst Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Wehrmacht High Command or OKW) {{on a number of issues}} around Waffen-SS recruiting, reflecting the strong influence the Wehrmacht still had with Hitler. On 20 April 1940, Berger was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer. According to Berger, Himmler never intended that the Waffen-SS would supplant the Army, and after the war he intended that it would be reduced to seven active and five reserve divisions. Berger created a recruiting structure throughout <b>the</b> <b>Reich,</b> mirroring that of the Army, but while the Wehrmacht, which controlled the draft, was willing to allow Berger enough recruits to maintain the three divisions and the LSSAH, it did not want to see any further expansion. To get around this, Berger had to look outside <b>the</b> <b>Reich.</b>|$|E
