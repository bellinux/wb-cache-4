These lands {{were recorded in}} the Domesday Book of 1086 as being held by the king, and when Chesney was granted <b>them</b> <b>they</b> were assessed at one knight's fee in feudal service. Besides Blythburgh, Chesney also acquired lands in Norfolk and Essex which he added to the family lands in Norfolk and Suffolk.|$|E
5|$|Continuing their attack, the squadrons on {{the left}} of the Household Brigade then {{destroyed}} Aulard's brigade. Despite attempts to recall <b>them,</b> <b>they</b> continued past La Haye Sainte and found themselves {{at the bottom of the}} hill on blown horses facing Schmitz's brigade formed in squares.|$|E

5|$|Finally, to keep Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{distracted from}} Danny's fanfare, TGS producer, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) sends {{them to the}} makeup {{department}} to have plaster face-prints made while NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) talks to them. Jenna and Tracy are plagued by erotic dreams involving Kenneth, and to stop having <b>them,</b> <b>they</b> decide to stay awake. This fails, so they decide {{to deal with it}} à la A Nightmare on Elm Street, by killing Kenneth in their dreams. They wake up (believing they are still dreaming) and attack Kenneth. Witnessing this, Pete tells <b>them</b> <b>they</b> are wide awake, and that it is morning, which prompts Jenna and Tracy to realize that they slept through the night without having any dreams of Kenneth. They apologize to Kenneth for attacking him, and he accepts their apology.|$|E
5|$|One {{ship was}} sent to the Mediterranean in 1944 while three others were {{transferred}} to the UK in preparation for Operation Overlord. Between <b>them</b> <b>they</b> sank five German submarines in 1944 with another in 1945. Worn-out and obsolete, the survivors were either broken up for scrap or sold off after the war.|$|E
5|$|The Germans rapidly {{realised}} that Pećanac's Chetniks, whose numbers {{had grown}} to 8,000, were inefficient and unreliable, and even the Nedić government had no confidence in <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> were completely disbanded by March 1943. Pećanac himself was interned by the Nedić regime for some time, and was killed by agents of Mihailović in May or June 1944.|$|E

I fined <b>them</b> if <b>they</b> didn't come to church, and I fined <b>them</b> if <b>they</b> danced. I fined <b>them</b> if <b>they</b> were {{improperly}} dressed. I had a tariff, and every sin had to be paid for either in money or work. And at last I made them understand." ...|$|R

5|$|The Romualdez clan {{was torn}} apart by the presidential campaign. To fix this, Imelda {{allegedly}} sent out invitations to family members, some of whom supported the opposing party, and told <b>them</b> <b>they</b> were all welcome at their house in Ortega.|$|E
5|$|The {{audiences that}} we built for those campaigns {{are having a}} {{different}} experience. They’re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip about <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn’t really have an analog that I’ve been able to think of in the arts.|$|E

6000|$|... "Peter {{thought a}} great deal about this, and when he went back to Moscow, which was then the capital, he inquired and found that there were some people from Holland there. He asked <b>them</b> if <b>they</b> knew how to build ships. Some of <b>them</b> said <b>they</b> did. Then he asked <b>them</b> if <b>they</b> could not build him some small vessels, just like the Dutch ships of war. They said they could. So he made a bargain with <b>them,</b> and <b>they</b> built him several.|$|R

5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and the plants often labelled. They were botanical gardens {{in the sense of}} building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although their collection policies were determined by those in day-to-day charge of <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.|$|E
5|$|After McCoy told <b>them</b> <b>they</b> {{were the}} Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked {{the band members}} for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about {{the success of their}} {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who appeared to have been the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|After many hardships - {{including}} {{being pursued}} by four Indios who try their best to leave them stranded or dead - Tintin, Haddock, and Zorrino reach the Temple of the Sun, finding {{it to be a}} surviving outpost of the Inca civilisation. They are brought before the Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells <b>them</b> <b>they</b> may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun god, will set alight the pyre on which they will be executed.|$|E

In addition they captured seven ships as prizes and damaged , a French dreadnought of 22,189 tons displacement. All three boats were sunk during the war, though U-5, the lead boat of the class, was raised and recommissioned after her sinking. After the war's end, U-5, the only survivor of the class, was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and was broken up in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles sent {{advertisements}} {{to groups}} in California and {{were invited to}} speak to New Age devotees there in April 1975. At this meeting, they persuaded {{about half of the}} 50 attendees to follow <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> also focused on college campuses, speaking at Cañada College in August. At a meeting in Oregon in September 1975, they saw further recruitment success—about 30 people left their homes to follow the pair, prompting interest from media outlets. The coverage was negative: commentators and some former members mocked the group and leveled accusations of brainwashing against Applewhite and Nettles. Balch and Taylor state that Applewhite and Nettles eschewed pressure tactics, seeking only devoted followers.|$|E
5|$|Archer {{requests}} {{the coordinates}} of Xindus, the Xindi homeworld, from Kessick. But the alien refuses to help unless Archer helps him escape. Archer declines, {{but he soon}} learns that the foreman had ulterior motives, since he has ordered three warships to overpower Enterprise and enslave his crew. Kessick claims {{to know how to}} escape the mine, but asks for Archer's help in return for guiding the Starfleet officers. Archer reluctantly agrees, and Kessick leads him and Tucker through the mine's sewage removal system. However, the group is soon detected in a conduit, and the foreman floods the system with plasma in an effort to kill <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> narrowly escape being killed, but quickly {{fall into the hands of}} the mine's security forces.|$|E
