5|$|With Portal's {{appointment}} came {{consideration of}} splitting Anderson's committee, which functioned as both an advisory and an interdepartmental body. In August 1946, a new standing committee was created, the Atomic Energy Official Committee, which assumed the interdepartmental function. In March 1947, Roger Makins became its chairman. Anderson's committee declined in influence, and was disbanded when he departed {{at the end}} of 1947. During the war, Christopher Hinton had been seconded from ICI to the Ministry of Supply and had become Deputy Director General of Filling Factories. He was due to return to ICI {{at the end of}} the year, but agreed to oversee the design, construction and operation of the new facilities at a salary far below that offered by ICI. He established his headquarters in a former Royal Ordnance Factory at Risley in Lancashire on 4 February 1946. Portal also created a position of Deputy Controller (<b>Technical</b> <b>Policy),</b> to which he appointed Michael Perrin. This created ill-feeling, as Perrin had been junior to Hinton at ICI. Portal also created a Technical Committee to replace the old Tube Alloys Technical Committee. To give the Ministry of Supply's control over atomic energy a legal form, a bill was introduced into the House of Commons on 1 May 1946 that became law as the Atomic Energy Act 1946 on 6 November 1946.|$|E

40|$|A {{descriptive}} study entitled "Health Manpower Policy in Indonesia" had been conducted from April 1993 to March 1994. The study {{was focused on}} analyzing health manpower policy documents such as National Acts, Presidential Decrees, Ministerial Decrees, etc. There were 273 documents which had been analyzed. The {{results of the study}} are the followings. Most of the policy documents (52 %) contain operational policies, while the rest 22 % contain <b>technical</b> <b>policies,</b> 20 % contain general policies, and 6 % contain national policies. Most of the operational policies (79 %) were made by Minister of Health, 4 % made jointly by Minister of Health and other, and 17 % by others. <b>Technical</b> <b>policies</b> which are supposed to be made by Echelon I or II officials, mostly (68 %) were made by Minister of Health. It reveals that delegation of authority in policy formulation in the Ministry of Health is not effective yet. There are 10 % of <b>technical</b> <b>policies</b> which were derived from other <b>technical</b> <b>policies,</b> and 55 % of operational policies which were derived from other operational policies. Around 54 % of the operational <b>policies</b> had no <b>technical</b> <b>policies.</b> Health manpower policy is highly concentrated on utilization (75 %). There are only 19. 5 % policies on education, 1 % on planning, 1. 5 % on information system, and 0. 5 % on research. It means that health manpower planning, including its research and information system supports are still neglected. There are 59 % policies on medical and nursing education and only 24 % on public health workers education. From utilization side, there are 58 % policies on the utilization of medical and nursing professionals and only 12 % policies on public health workers utilization. It reveals that policies on planning, education, as well as utilization of public health workers still need to be improved to reach a balance between public health services and medical services. </ol...|$|R
