It was directed by Marcos Siega, who is most notable for his work with Blink-182 and Papa Roach. In an interview with MTV, Wade talked about the idea behind the music video and said, [...] "This is the closest we'll probably ever come to being in a Tim Burton fantasy world. It was done in a real 'Jack and the Beanstalk' style. And Marcos used some camera tricks that make it look amazing. From far away, the stage set looked normal, {{but when you get}} closer you get smaller and it gets huge.

[...] Poniewozik was slightly critical of Pam and Jim's story, noting that in the grand scheme of the show it was successful, but that it makes slightly less sense when one examines it closely; however, he felt that even [...] "if the details don't add up, the emotions do". He concluded that the episode [...] "worked mostly as an epilogue" [...] and allowed the cast of the series to have their final moments.|$|E

500|$|Similar {{to other}} Sleater-Kinney albums, {{the lyrics of}} All Hands on the Bad One feature personal, political, and social themes. The first song, [...] "The Ballad of the Ladyman", is a {{deliberate}} attempt to mock those who misunderstand the band. Tucker said that the song is [...] "almost making fun of how people see us, how people see what you're supposed to be when you're a woman in rock." [...] The song was inspired when the band was invited to the Bowlie Weekender music festival in England in 1999. Tucker explained, [...] "We were all staying in little chalets or whatever and we had our own cabin and we were cabin 216. Someone wrote this message to us <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Cabin 216 ladymen.' And we were like, 'What?' It {{was meant to be}} a funny thing, but in this other way, it was really this naming of us. It was a subtle way of saying, 'Oh, you're different because you're a woman band and because you're in some ways political.' It's still seen as threatening to people. It's not like we had this weekend where we just relaxed with everyone and just hung out." [...] Kat Iudicello, writing for PopMatters, stated that the song [...] "sports sweet harmonies, a slow anger and soft, low bitterness, and driving steady guitars and drums." ...|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
500|$|However, {{the extent}} that Ignition were {{willing to go to}} control access to the album {{generated}} more hype than could normally have been expected, and served to alienate members of both the print and broadcast media, as well as most Creation staff members. When [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] was planned as the first single, Ignition decided on a late release to radio so as to avoid too much advance exposure. However, three stations broke the embargo, and Ignition panicked. According to Greengrass: [...] "we'd been in these bloody bunker meetings for six months or something, and our plot was blown. 'Shit, it's a nightmare'." [...] BBC Radio 1 received a CD containing three songs ten days before the album's release, on condition that disc jockey Steve Lamacq talked over the tracks to prevent illegal copies being made by listeners. The day after Lamacq previewed the album on his show, he {{received a phone call from}} Ignition informing him that he would not be able to preview further tracks because he didn't speak enough over the songs. Lamacq said, [...] "I had to go on the air the next night and say, 'Sorry, but we're not getting any more tracks.' It was just absurd." [...] According to Creation's head of marketing John Andrews, [...] " [...] made people despise Oasis within Creation. You had this Oasis camp <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> 'I'm sorry, you're not allowed come into the office between the following hours. You're not allowed mention the word Oasis.' It was like a fascist state." [...] One employee recalled an incident [...] "when somebody came round to check our phones because they thought The Sun had tapped them." ...|$|E

500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

The band's erratic artistic changes were a barrier to their retaining an audience – Ginn was so creatively restless that Black Flag's albums were often very dissimilar.
