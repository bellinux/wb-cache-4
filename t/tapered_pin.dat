Two pieces of AZ 31 alloy with thickness of 6 mm were friction stir welded by using conventional milling machine. The shoulder diameter used in this experiment is fixed at 18 mm. The <b>taper</b> <b>pin</b> ratio used are varied at 6 : 6, 6 : 5, 6 : 4, 6 : 3, 6 : 2 and 6 : 1. The rotational speeds that were used in this study were 500 rpm, 1000 rpm and 1500 rpm, respectively. The welding speeds used are 150 mm/min, 200 mm/min and 250 mm/min. Microstructure observation of welded area was studied by using optical microscope. Equiaxed grains were observed at the TMAZ and stir zone indicating fully plastic deformation. Tool pin diameter ratio 6 / 1 causes low heat input to the material because of small contact surface between tool surface and stirred materials compared to other tool pin diameter ratio. The grain size of stir zone increased with increasing of ratio of rotational speed to transverse speed due to higher heat input. It is observed that, worm hole is produced when excessive heat input is applied. To evaluate the mechanical properties of this specimen, tensile test was used in this study.

50|$|In {{engineering}} and machine design, a pin is a machine element that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other.

50|$|Though rare, a few {{land mine}} designs (both {{anti-tank}} and anti-personnel) contain no metal whatsoever. Such mines cannot be found using metal detectors {{because there is}} no metal to detect. Typically, 100% non-metallic landmines have a plastic case and a fuze which comprises a glass or plastic vial containing a mixture of friction-sensitive pyrotechnic composition and glass powder. Downward force on the pressure plate overcomes the breaking strain of a plastic shear pin which snaps, allowing the non-metallic firing pin assembly to move. The firing pin is pushed down through a flexible plastic forcing-cone, which abruptly releases it on the other side at much higher velocity. Concentrated pressure is thereby transferred directly onto the glass vial, crushing and fracturing it. Alternatively, when the shear pin breaks, pressure on the fuze is transferred onto a plastic belleville spring which flips downwards, stabbing a non-metallic <b>tapered</b> <b>pin</b> (sometimes made from a glass ceramic) through a thin plastic membrane covering the vial of friction-sensitive pyrotechnic mixture. Either way, this action causes a flash of flame that triggers the detonator and initiates the adjacent booster which in turn detonates the main explosive filling.|$|E

50|$|In {{the last}} few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be {{fastened}} together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt, of which, nowadays, the screw bolt, with its nut and washer, {{is by far the most}} common. The second type of bolt is the pin bolt or cotter bolt, which, instead of a thread, has a tapered hole forged through the end away from the head, into which a <b>tapered</b> <b>pin</b> or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a straight thread. In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a screw bolt. The third type of bolt is the clench bolt. It has some of the features of a rivet but was usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright's use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked through a hole bored through the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some may have used iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot motor cutters were fastened this way.|$|E

T-lap and T-butt joints configurations have been studied. Tunnel and kissing-bond type defects have been found in joints produced with a pyramidal pin tool, while welds produced with the <b>tapered</b> <b>pin</b> tool only show presence of oxide lines. Sound welds were produced with the progressive tool. No significant change in hardness has been observed in all combinations of tool and joint geometry.

40|$|A {{recognized}} way {{of improving}} the fatigue resistance of a fastener hole is to introduce compressive tangential residual stress around it. This {{can be achieved by}} using a cold expansion method in which an oversized pin or ball is forced through the hole to produce a local plastic region surrounded by an elastic one. Once the pin or ball is removed allowing the elastic region to spring back it results in compressive tangential residual stress around the hole. In practise, however, it is found that such a cold expansion method creates a nonuniform residual stress distribution through the plate thickness and even tensile residual stress can be created at the entrance and exit faces. In this paper a new method of cold expansion is proposed. It uses a <b>tapered</b> <b>pin</b> with a mating tapered split sleeve and creates an almost uniform compressive residual stress around the hole as shown by FE method. Also, fatigue tests were carried out to verify that the method does significantly improve fatigue life. Finally the tangential residual stress distribution and fatigue life improvement of this new method were compared with those of a well-established cold expansion method and it was shown that the new method is more efficient in improving fatigue life...|$|E

40|$|Many {{engineering}} {{parts in}} industries are assembled by rivets, bolts, pins etc. These joints {{are more vulnerable}} to fatigue loadings and a crack is emanated. As structure is in use crack starts propagating {{over a period of}} time. Crack propagation can be obstructed by inducing a compressive residual stress zone around the vulnerable parts. Cold expansion hole (CEH) is one of the techniques used to induce compressive stress zone, by inserting a <b>tapered</b> <b>pin</b> or a large diameter ball into an undersized hole. As the oversized object is inserted into the hole, the surrounding material is elastically deformed and when the object comes out from the other side, the expanded material springs back to form tangential compressive residual stress around the hole. In most of the cases the crack origins on the surface, a good surface finish is also an important parameter for increasing the strength at the surface and stop crack emanation. However, good surface finish is not achieved by CEH. A novel technique called rotating tool cold expansion (RTCE) technique is developed where a tapered mandrel is inserted into an undersized hole besides rotating it simultaneously. The tool rotation breaks down the coarse grains into fine grain structure achieving good surface finish. In this method, RTCE is performed with three undersized diameters, namely, 9. 2, 9. 5 and 9. 9 mm diameters to a maximum of 10 mm diameter. The tool material is high speed steel and the work piece material is commercial aluminium. The induced residual stresses are measured using X-ray diffraction method and compared for three different Cold expansion holes. Due to the rotation of the tool, heat is generated because of both friction at the interface and plastic deformation. A 3 -D thermo-mechanical analysis is performed in ANSYS FEA for different values of coefficient of friction and plastic deformation rate and validated with experimental results. Compared to the degree of cold expansion through conventional techniques (upto 4 %) the proposed technique is capable to produce good results up to 8. 69 % of cold expansion. Role of heat generated through friction and plastic deformation is critical to attain the best possible result, equal contributions of both are important...|$|E
