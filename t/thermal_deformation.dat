40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>thermal</b> <b>deformations</b> {{of the walls}} of a rectangular minichannel. The distribution of temperature on the walls and the local coefficients of heat transfer between the heated wall and the boiling fluid were determined {{on the basis of the}} experimental data. The <b>thermal</b> <b>deformations</b> were examined for two vertical walls: a heated Hastelloy X plate and an unheated stainless steel plate. The heat conduction and displacement equations were solved numerically using Ansys Workbench software. The distributions of temperature and the <b>thermal</b> <b>deformations</b> of the walls were obtained by appropriately combining the software modules with the mathematical description of the physical phenomena occurring in the minichannel and introducing the boundary conditions and the experimental data. It was found that, for the predetermined thermal conditions and the assumed thicknesses of the minichannel walls, <b>thermal</b> <b>deformations</b> can be omitted from further analysis. However, it is important to note that, if the geometrical dimensions of the minichannel had been different, the difference in the temperature along the minichannel length would have resulted in changes in the minichannel shape, i. e. its local narrowing, a reduction in the heat transfer efficiency, and, finally, a local change in the fluid flow rate...|$|R
40|$|Deformations during {{heating and}} cooling of three drifts in {{granitic}} rock were influenced {{by the presence of}} faults and shear zones. <b>Thermal</b> <b>deformations</b> were significantly larger in sheared and faulted zones than where the rock was jointed, but neither sheared nor faulted. Furthermore, <b>thermal</b> <b>deformations</b> in faulted or sheared rock were not significantly recovered during subsequent cooling, thus a permanent deformation remained. This inelastic response is in contrast with elastic behavior identified in unfaulted and unsheared rock segments. A companion paper indicates that deformations in unsheared or unfaulted rock were effectively modeled as an elastic response. We conclude that permanent deformations occurred in fractures with crushed minerals and fracture filling or gouge materials. Potential mechanisms for this permanent deformation are asperity readjustments during <b>thermal</b> <b>deformations,</b> micro-shearing, asperity crushing and crushing of the secondary fracture filling minerals. Additionally, modulus differences in sheared or faulted rock as compared to more intact rock would result in greater deformations in response to the same thermal loads...|$|R

This was instead of Qatar Airways due to rotor bow, or thermal bowing, due to asymmetrical cooling after shut-down on the previous flight. Differences in temperature across the shaft section supporting the rotor lead to different <b>thermal</b> <b>deformation</b> of the shaft material, causing the rotor axis to bend; this results in an offset between {{the center of gravity}} of the bowed rotor and the bearing axis, causing a slight imbalance and potentially reducing the tight clearance between the rotor blade tips and the compressor wall. All production standard engines now feature a damper on the third and fourth shaft bearings to help stiffen the shaft and data from engines in service and under accelerated testing is expected to gradually reduce engine start times.

5000|$|Due {{to their}} {{actuation}} properties, liquid crystalline elastomers are attractive {{candidates for the}} use as artificial muscles in microrobots. These were already predicted by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes in 1975 and first synthesized by Heino Finkelmann. In the temperature range of the liquid crystalline phase, the mesogen's orientation forces the polymer chains into a stretched conformation. By heating the sample above the clearing temperature this orientation is lost and the polymer backbone can relax into (the more favored) random coil conformation {{which can lead to}} a macroscopic deformation. In order to have a good actuation, it is necessary to have a good alignment of the domains' directors before cross-linking. This can for example be achieved by: stretching of the prepolymerized sample, photo-alignment layers, magnetic or electric fields and microfluidics. [...] Beside the <b>thermal</b> <b>deformation</b> of a sample, a light-responsive actuation can be obtained for samples with azobenzenes being incorporated in the liquid crystalline phase. The phase transition temperature of an azo-liquid crystalline elastomer can be reduced due to the trans-cis isomerization of the azobenzenes during UV-irradiation and thus the liquid crystalline phase can be destroyed isothermally. For liquid crystalline elastomers with a high azo-concentration, a light-responsive change of the sample's length of up to 40% could be observed.|$|E

The study shows that with increasing temperature, the signal due to water contained in the smallest C-S-H interlayer spaces decreases while that from the larger gel pores, {{and to a lesser}} extent from the capillary pores, increases. On cooling, the opposite behavior is observed with complete reversibility. The observed changes in water populations appear to be instantaneous compared to the rate of temperature change in the samples. These changes are postulated to be responsible for macroscopically observed changes of relative humidity in pores during heating/cooling and are therefore key in understanding <b>thermal</b> <b>deformations</b> of cement based materials. It is evident that the previous hypothesis of microstructural delayed water transport being responsible for macrostructural delayed <b>thermal</b> <b>deformations</b> can be rejected.
