5|$|Tudur and Goronwy {{were two}} of three men who {{witnessed}} the Madog's charter, known as the Penmachno Document, in 1294 which granted lands in Ardudwy and Llansannan to Bleddyn Fychan. After the revolt failed, Tudur was among those lords from North Wales who pledged <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Edward in person in 1296, and again to Edward of Caernarfon when he was invested as Prince of Wales in 1301.|$|E
5|$|Following {{requests}} by Singaporeans, {{guidelines for}} the use of the flag were further broadened in 2006 to give residents a variety of opportunities to express <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Singapore during National Day celebrations such as the National Day Parade. MICA permitted them to display the flag on vehicles and on themselves or belongings with minimal restrictions, from the middle of July to the end of August for a trial period. The period was extended in 2007 to three months from July to September.|$|E
5|$|In March 1553 Suleiman urged Isabella {{to return}} to Hungary. Péter Petrovics rose against Ferdinand, and an {{assembly}} of the Székely people declared <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> John Sigismund. However, both uprisings were crushed {{before the end of}} September. Deciding in April 1554 that Hungary should be restored to John Sigismund, Suleiman allowed Péter Petrovics to take control of two fortresses in Banat. Henry II of France, engaged in war against the Habsburgs, also urged Isabella {{to return to}} Hungary, promising one of his daughters in marriage to John Sigismund.|$|E
5000|$|Socialist groups, {{consisting}} of several small fragmented parties like NCP, SJD-S, JDS, Congress-S, are mainly pro-center left socialist parties having very limited influences in few pocket areas.

50|$|However, {{throughout}} the 1980s {{and until the}} Labour landslide victory of 1997, many voters in the area transferred <b>their</b> <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> the Conservative Party. The MP throughout that period was David Amess, who himself originated from east London (Plaistow), and now holds the safer seat of Southend West.|$|R
5000|$|North Korea {{is famous}} for its [...] "mass games". These are {{exhibitions}} where thousands of North Koreans perform highly choreographed dances, especially traditional dances and gymnastics, often engaging in simultaneous rhythms of movement.

5|$|Public {{opinion was}} sharply divided. Some {{communities}} supported the rebellion {{for a variety}} of reasons. Others, including Gonzales, declared <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna's centralist government. Local leaders began calling for a Consultation to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed militias to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past {{violations}} of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted {{to take steps to}} rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down somewhat on his hardline image and appeared to be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata in the west of modern Scotland is traditionally attributed {{to the work of}} St. Columba. However, given the close cultural and linguistic ties, and the short distance across the seas, between the region and Ireland, which had begun to be Christianised from at least the fifth century, it is likely that Christianity had already reached this part of modern Scotland before his arrival in the mid-sixth century. In this view, the role of clergy owing <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Iona and elsewhere was to consolidate the position of Christianity in the region and beyond and to provide pastoral care for the people there.|$|E
50|$|However, {{a portion}} of the Legitimists, still resentful of the revolutionary {{credentials}} of the House of Orléans, transferred <b>their</b> <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> the Carlist heirs of the Spanish Bourbons, who represented the most senior branch of the Capetians even though they had renounced their claim to the French throne to obtain Spain in 1713.|$|R

5|$|Abraham Lincoln's {{constitutional}} election {{reflected the}} nation’s sectional divide, though 82 {{percent of the}} electorate had split among the Unionists, Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas and John Bell. Even before Lincoln’s inauguration, the Deep South states that had cast Electoral College votes for John C. Breckinridge resolved to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The Virginia Assembly called a special convention {{for the sole purpose of}} considering secession from the United States. Virginia was deeply divided, returning a convention of delegates amounting to about one-third for secession and two thirds Unionist. But the Unionists would prove to be further divided between those who would be labelled Conditional Unionists who would favor Virginia in the Union only if Lincoln made no move at “coercion”, and those who would later be called Unconditional Unionists who would be unwavering in <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the constitutional government of the United States.|$|E
5|$|After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan {{fell to the}} Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hernán Cortés {{to declare}} their {{allegiance}} to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K'iche' Maya of Q'umarkaj may also have sent a delegation. In 1522 Cortés sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met new delegations from Iximche and Q'umarkaj at Tuxpán; both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the King of Spain. But Cortés' allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were harassing Spain's allies in the region. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.|$|E
5|$|By 69, however, Civilis, the Batavi regiments and the Batavi {{people had}} become utterly disaffected with Rome. After the Batavi regiments were {{withdrawn}} from Britain to Italy in 66, Civilis {{and his brother}} (also a prefect) were arrested by the governor of Germania Inferior on a fabricated accusation of sedition. The governor ordered his brother's execution, while Civilis, who as a Roman citizen {{had the right to}} appeal to the emperor, was sent to Rome in chains for judgement by Nero. He was released by Nero's overthrower and successor, Galba, but the latter also disbanded the imperial bodyguard unit for <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Nero. This alienated several hundred crack Batavi troops, and indeed the whole Batavi nation who regarded it as a grave insult. At the same time, relations collapsed between the Batavi cohorts and the legion to which they had been attached since the invasion of Britain 25 years earlier (XIV Gemina). Their mutual hatred erupted in open fighting on at least two occasions.|$|E

25|$|By December, rebel {{fighters were}} {{commonly}} looting for supplies; they switched <b>their</b> <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> groups that {{had more to}} share. This new approach led to the killing {{of at least one}} rebel commander following a dispute; fighters retreating with their loot caused the loss of a frontline position and the failure of an attack on a Kurdish neighborhood.

5|$|During their {{dealings}} with the Nausets over the release of John Billington, the Pilgrims learned of troubles that Massasoit was experiencing. Massasoit, Squanto, and several other Wampanoags had been captured by Corbitant, sachem of the Narragansett tribe. A party of ten men {{under the leadership of}} Myles Standish set out to find and execute Corbitant. While hunting for Corbitant, they learned that Squanto had escaped and Massasoit was back in power. Several Native Americans had been injured by Standish and his men and were offered medical attention in Plymouth. They had failed to capture Corbitant, but the show of force by Standish had garnered respect for the Pilgrims and, as a result, nine of the most powerful sachems in the area signed a treaty in September, including Massasoit and Corbitant, pledging <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> King James.|$|E
5|$|Strafford's {{fall from}} power {{weakened}} Charles's influence in Ireland. The {{dissolution of the}} Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Strafford's imprisonment, until Charles was eventually forced through lack of money to disband the army {{at the end of}} Strafford's trial. Disputes concerning the transfer of land ownership from native Catholic to settler Protestant, particularly in relation to the plantation of Ulster, coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England, sowed the seeds of rebellion. When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English, in late October 1641, the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the king.|$|E
5|$|The Normandy {{integrates}} the IFF {{into her}} systems while Shepard and the squad leave in a shuttle. During their absence, the Collectors attack and board the Normandy. Only Joker avoids capture and, with EDI's help, {{is able to}} extract the Normandy to safety. After Shepard's squad returns, the team uses the Omega-4 Relay to reach the Collector base, located in the Galactic Center. The team rescues any surviving Normandy crew members and fights {{their way to the}} central chamber. Squad members will either survive or perish depending on <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Shepard, the upgrades made to the Normandy, and the tasks they are assigned in battle. In the central chamber, Shepard discovers that the Collectors have been constructing a new Human-Reaper made from the genetic material of the abducted colonists.|$|E

In 971 the Buyid amir 'Adud al-Daula, who had {{recently}} conquered the bordering province of Kerman from the Banu Ilyas, compelled the Ma'danids to recognize Buyid suzerainty. Soon after this, however, the Ma'danids switched <b>their</b> <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> the Turkish ruler of Ghazni, Sebük Tigin, beginning nearly a century of allegiance to the Ghaznavid dynasty.|$|R

5|$|The Sultanates to {{the north}} of Vijayanagara united and {{attacked}} Aliya Rama Raya's army, in January 1565, in a war known as the Battle of Talikota. The Vijayanagara side was winning the war, state Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, but suddenly two Muslim generals of the Vijayanagara army switched sides and turned <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the Sultanates. The generals captured Aliya Rama Raya and beheaded him on the spot, with Sultan Hussain on the Sultanates side joining them for the execution and stuffing of severed head with straw for display. The beheading of Aliya Rama Raya created confusion and havoc in the still loyal portions of the Vijayanagara army, which were then completely routed. The Sultanates' army plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never re-occupied.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the clash between Gaddafi and Goukouni were both ethnic and political. The FROLINAT was divided between Arabs, like Acyl, and Toubous, like Goukouni and Habré. These ethnic {{divisions}} also reflected a different attitude towards Gaddafi and his Green Book. In particular, Goukouni and his men had shown themselves reluctant to follow Gaddafi's solicitations to make The Green Book the official policy of the FROLINAT, and had first tried to take time, postponing the question until the complete reunification of the movement. When the unification was accomplished, and Gaddafi pressed again for the adoption of The Green Book, the dissensions in the Revolution's Council became manifest, with many proclaiming <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the movement's original platform approved in 1966 when Ibrahim Abatcha was made first secretary-general, while others, including Acyl, fully embraced the Colonel's ideas.|$|E
5|$|With the {{invasion}} imminent, Henry mobilised his forces and fleet outside Pevensey, close to Robert's anticipated landing site, training {{some of them}} personally in how to counter cavalry charges. Despite English levies and knights owing military service to the Church arriving in considerable numbers, many of his barons did not appear. Anselm intervened {{with some of the}} doubters, emphasising the religious importance of <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Henry. Robert unexpectedly landed further up the coast at Portsmouth on 20 July with a modest force of a few hundred men, but these were quickly joined by many of the barons in England. However, instead of marching into nearby Winchester and seizing Henry's treasury, Robert paused, giving Henry time to march west and intercept {{the invasion}} force.|$|E

5|$|Zou Cou was {{selected}} to fill the role of Han proxy ruler {{because he was the}} only member of the Minyue royal family who refused to take part in the war against Nanyue. However, his efforts to exert control over the people of Minyue were not successful. The subjects of the kingdom pledged <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Zou Yushan instead. Yushan declared himself king of Minyue without the consent of the Emperor Wu, the Han ruler. The emperor was informed of Yushan's actions, and recognized him as king of Dongyue instead of ordering a second invasion. Emperor Wu considered it a reward to Yushan for killing Zou Ying and ending the war. The assassination had prevented the Han from wasting any more resources on the conflict. Dongyue had an uneasy relationship with the Han. In 112 BC, Han officials were killed in a military engagement with Dongyue.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Uprising, the Prussians rose {{a number}} of times against the Knights, but these uprisings were much smaller in scale and posed no real danger to the Teutonic Knights, who could {{concentrate}} on further conquests. The number of uprisings is variously considered to be two or three.. They were suppressed within a year or two and showed exhaustion and division of the Prussian tribes. The third uprising in 1276 was provoked by Skalmantas, leader of the Sudovians, who successfully raided Teutonic lands. The next year he, with help from the Lithuanians, led 4,000 men into the Culmerland (Chełmno Land). The uprising failed to spread after Theodoric, vogt of Sambia, convinced the Sambians not to join the insurrection; Natangians and Warmians had also accepted baptism and promised <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the Knights. The Pogesanians alone continued the fight and were crushed. Survivors with their Bartian chief escaped to Hrodna in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania where they joined some of the Bartians, Skalvians, and all of the Nadruvians, who fled there after the Great Uprising.|$|E
5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} develop that threatened {{the future of the}} new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared <b>their</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E

A new constitution was born under the Somoza regime in 1950; it was a negotiation between previous anticlerical measures and traditional church privileges.|$|R
