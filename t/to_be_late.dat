5|$|Frances is {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to impact the entire archipelago since 1866. On September 4, teams from the Ministry of Works, the Department of Environmental Health Services, the Royal Bahamas Defence Force and the Royal Bahamas Police Force were used to clear roadways of tree debris while utilities attempted to restore power and water in New Providence. The Family Islands were surveyed on September 5 and 6, when {{it was noted that}} major damage occurred within the island group. Telecommunications were restored to most of the island chain within 24 hours. As of September 21, electricity had been restored to half of the Bahamians who had lost power. Western sections of Grand Bahama Island remained without power into Hurricane Jeanne, which was the most significantly impacted island. The onion crop was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> in 2005 due to the loss of seedbeds and seedlings during the storm.|$|E
5|$|The Union's V Corps, {{commanded}} by Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, took up {{positions on the}} hill on June30. McClellan was not present for the initial exchanges of the battle, having boarded the ironclad USS Galena and sailed down the James River to inspect Harrison's Landing, where he intended to locate the base for his army. Confederate preparations were hindered by several mishaps. Bad maps and faulty guides caused Confederate Maj. Gen. John Magruder <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> for the battle, an excess of caution delayed Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger, and Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson had problems collecting the Confederate artillery.|$|E
5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that she did not want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E

25|$|This Gospel is {{considered}} {{by the majority of}} Christians <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> and pseudepigraphical; however, some academics suggest that it may contain some remnants of an earlier apocryphal work (perhaps Gnostic, Ebionite or Diatessaronic), redacted to bring it more in line with Islamic doctrine. Some Muslims consider the surviving versions as transmitting a suppressed apostolic original. Some Islamic organizations cite it in support of the Islamic view of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The {{supposed}} {{autonomy of}} Celtic civilization in Gaul suffered a further setback with Fernand Benoît's {{study of the}} funereal symbolism of the horseman with the serpent-tailed ("anguiforme") daemon, which he established as a theme of victory over death, and Epona; both he found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> manifestations of Mediterranean-influenced symbolism, which had reached Gaul through contacts with Etruria and Magna Graecia.

25|$|Also, {{since the}} late 1990s an {{undetermined}} number of rescue volunteers groups proliferate in Puerto Rico, especially in the San Juan Metro Area, and by that is the municipalities of San Juan, Bayamon, Guaynabo, Trujillo Alto, Carolina, Loiza, Canovanas, Cataño, Toa Baja, Toa Alta, Dorado and Caguas. Its primary mission is to assist the already overburdened emergency medical system in the evenings cases are duplicated by accident, case reports and critical cases. In 2009, the CEMPR began using Puerto Rico Fire Corps stations to place their EMT posts to better served the community. Now the CEMPR algong with the Puerto Rico Fire Corps can serve the towns of the mountain where ambulance services tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> due to {{the distance of the}} emergency medical stations where they were previously located.|$|E
25|$|The group put {{themselves}} through challenges that {{forced them to}} find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold. For example, {{no one in the}} group was permitted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing. During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out {{in order to make a}} jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{possibility}} is that the longphort was established on the gravel ridge overlooking the Black Pool – the most easily defended location in Dublin – and that its remains were subsequently buried or obliterated by the later 10th century settlement of Dyflinn, which {{was built in the}} same location (not to mention Dublin Castle, which presently occupies the site). The discovery of what are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> 9th-century earthen banks in Ross Road and Werburgh Street (immediately west of Dublin Castle) lends some support to this theory. The other {{possibility is that}} the longphort was situated on the eastern or southern side of the Black Pool, and that Norse settlement began here, expanding northwards and westwards across the Poddle in the late 9th century. Norse houses to the west of these banks all appear to date from the Second Viking Age (917–1170). It is also a possibility that the location of the longphort was changed after the destruction of the original settlement in 849.|$|E

25|$|Genie {{was born}} {{about five years}} after her brother, around the time that her father began to isolate {{himself and his family}} from others. At birth she was in the 50th {{percentile}} for weight. The following day she showed signs of Rh incompatibility and required a blood transfusion, but had no sequelae and was otherwise described as healthy. A medical appointment at three months showed that she was gaining weight normally, but found a congenital hip dislocation which required her to wear a highly restrictive Frejka splint from the age of 4½ to 11 months. The splint caused Genie <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> to walk, and researchers believed this led her father to start speculating that she was mentally retarded. As a result, he made a concerted effort not to talk to or pay attention to her, and strongly discouraged his wife and son from doing so.|$|E
500|$|In game {{three of}} the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, Rome sent Boston forward Nathan Horton to the ice with a late hit. Horton {{sustained}} a severe concussion and {{was taken off the}} ice on a stretcher. Rome was ejected from the game after being assessed a five-minute major penalty for interference and a game misconduct. After a disciplinary hearing the next morning, Rome was assessed a four-game suspension and missed the remainder of the 2011 playoffs. The NHL determined that Rome hit Horton over a second after Horton gave up the puck. The NHL considered a hit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> if it takes place more than half a second after a player loses possession. This proved to be a series-changing event, as the Canucks had already won games 1 and 2 at home before the hit took place. The Canucks went on to lose a momentum-swinging Game 3 and ended up losing the series four games to three. [...] The Canucks were outscored 23-8 in the 7-game series by the Boston Bruins.|$|E
500|$|However Frankfort did not himself {{make the}} {{identification}} of the figure with Lilith; rather he cites Emil Kraeling (1937) instead. Kraeling believes that the figure [...] "is a superhuman being of a lower order"; he does not explain exactly why. He then goes on to state [...] "Wings [...] regularly suggest a demon associated with the wind" [...] and [...] "owls may well indicate the nocturnal habits of this female demon". He excludes Lamashtu and Pazuzu as candidate demons and states: [...] "Perhaps we have here a third representation of a demon. If so, it must be Lilîtu [...] the demon of an evil wind", named ki-sikil-lil-la' wind; breath; infection; phantom; -la- is gen. case marker and -ke4 erg. case marker, both are required by the grammatical context (in this passage: [...] "kisikil built for herself") but the case markers {{are not part of the}} noun. (literally [...] "wind-maiden" [...] or [...] "phantom-maiden", not [...] "beautiful maiden", as Kraeling asserts (see below)). This ki-sikil-lil is an antagonist of Inanna (Ishtar) in a brief episode of the epic of Gilgamesh, which is cited by both Kraeling and Frankfort as further evidence for the identification as Lilith, though this appendix too is now disputed. In this episode, Inanna's holy Huluppu tree is invaded by malevolent spirits. Frankfort quotes a preliminary translation by Gadd (1933): [...] "in the midst Lilith had built a house, the shrieking maid, the joyful, the bright queen of Heaven". However modern translations have instead: [...] "In its trunk, the phantom maid built herself a dwelling, the maid who laughs with a joyful heart. But holy Inanna cried." [...] The earlier translation implies an association of the demon Lilith with a shrieking owl and at the same time asserts her god-like nature; the modern translation supports neither of these attributes. In fact, Cyril J. Gadd (1933), the first translator, writes: [...] "ardat lili (kisikil-lil) is never associated with owls in Babylonian mythology" [...] and [...] "the Jewish traditions concerning Lilith in this form seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> and of no great authority". This single line of evidence was taken as virtual proof of {{the identification of}} the Burney Relief with [...] "Lilith" [...] may have been motivated by later associations of [...] "Lilith" [...] in later Jewish sources.|$|E
