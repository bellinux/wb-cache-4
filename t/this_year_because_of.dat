50|$|This {{season will}} be the first season since the 2011-12 season where the Suns would no longer pay for the {{contract}} they first gave to Michael Beasley, since they officially paid the total amount needed to remove him on their roster on September 3, 2013, which was $2,333,333 total. While his situation was different from the amnesty of Josh Childress during the same season they first signed Beasley onto their team, much like Josh Childress' amnesty buyout, they would no longer have to pay him again since his value was fully paid off. However, by waiving Leandro Barbosa early, the Suns would still owe him about $500,000 of guaranteed money <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> Furthermore, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the sliding scale the newly implemented two-way contracts will have for the NBA (earning as little as $75,000 and about as much as $279,000 in a season, depending on where they play under a majority of their time), players like Mike James will ultimately not affect their salary cap, regardless of how much they get paid for throughout the season.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study {{the impact of the}} rise in prices of {{vegetables}} on vegetable producers, and to increase the revenue of vegetable producers, this paper does a survey by anonymous sampling questionnaire. Results shows that: most vegetable growers think that vegetable prices should rise and would continue to rise, and that vegetable prices would increase their revenue, thus in the coming year they would expand the planting scale of vegetable variety whose increase rate is the largest in <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> But <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the increase of logistics costs and production costs, some farmers benefit very little from the rising trend of vegetable prices. Most farmers expect too much in the trend estimation of the prices of vegetables and also lack of planning and forward-looking in production, thus the planting area of single variety is often decided by the market of previous year. According to analysis {{of the impact of the}} rise in vegetable prices on vegetable producer behavior, this paper gives the following suggestions to increase revenue of vegetable producers: change the mode of thinking, improve rural information platform, and increase capital investment for vegetable production base...|$|R

40|$|Aims: We aim {{to perform}} the first {{long-term}} analysis of the system HS Hya. Methods: We performed {{an analysis of the}} long-term evolution of the light curves of the detached eclipsing system HS Hya. Collecting all available photometric data since its discovery, the light curves were analyzed with a special focus on the evolution of system's inclination. Results: We find that the system undergoes a rapid change of inclination. Since its discovery until today the system's inclination changed by more than 15 deg. The shape of the light curve changes, and now the eclipses are almost undetectable. The third distant component of the system is causing the precession of the close orbit, and the nodal period is about 631 yr. Conclusions: New precise observations are desperately needed, preferably <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> <b>because</b> the amplitude <b>of</b> variations is decreasing rapidly every year.

Results: 95. 7 % of the teachers were aware of autism. Only 21 % had adequate knowledge. 71 teachers had prior training on ASD. Teachers with more experience and prior training performed better.
