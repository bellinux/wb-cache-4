5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by <b>the</b> <b>leaks</b> and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in <b>the</b> <b>leaks.</b> The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for <b>the</b> <b>leaks</b> and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E

5|$|Curing <b>the</b> <b>leaks</b> and {{cleaning}} up the contamination delayed the tunnel's completion by a year, and it was finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was further complicated by conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing <b>the</b> <b>leaks,</b> but the report claimed that this was to a large extent a waste of money, resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary additional costs for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>leak</b> before break (LBB) {{concept is}} widely used in {{designing}} pipe lines in nuclear power plants.

5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through <b>the</b> <b>leaks</b> is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E

5|$|In March 1989, {{the first}} buses {{were tested in}} the tunnel; University Street station was only 75 percent complete, and buses had to drive under {{scaffolding}} and construction equipment while passing through the station. Tunnel construction was completed in June 1990, and a soft opening for University Street station was held on August 9, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. All service on routes using the tunnel was operated by dual-mode buses, which operated as diesel buses outside the tunnel and electrically, as trolleybuses, when inside the tunnel. During its early months, University Street and other stations were affected by serious water leaks, which splashed water onto walkways during the tunnel's first winter in operation. <b>The</b> <b>leaks</b> were later fixed by Metro contractors.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{commanded}} Daedalus {{for less}} than a year. On 2 July 1813 the frigate ran aground on a shoal off Galle, Ceylon, causing serious damage to her keel. Although she was soon brought off, <b>the</b> <b>leaks</b> created in the grounding became so severe that Maxwell had no option but to order his crew to cease their desperate attempts to keep her afloat and abandon ship. He was the last to leave and shortly after he had been transported to a nearby East Indiaman, Daedalus rolled over and sank. Maxwell returned to Britain to face a court martial but was exonerated for the frigate's loss and reappointed to Alceste. In 1815 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his naval service, and although the war against France had ended, was retained for active duty at the special request of Lord Amherst.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop <b>the</b> <b>leaks,</b> it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures.

25|$|By 1978, the {{contractor}} and the municipality felt that <b>the</b> <b>leaks</b> were under control, and the municipality {{took over the}} station. On 20 February 1983, the station was closed for renovation to remove <b>the</b> <b>leaks.</b> At the time, {{it was expected that}} the station could reopen in 1984. The cause of <b>the</b> <b>leaks</b> was a combination of the wrong type of concrete being used and the wrong construction method.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of clean, drinkable {{water is a}} problem that has been addressed in all civilizations. The most common form of transportation today, is the use of pressurized pipelines to carry the water long distances, but damage to the pipes, such as leaks, can cause considerable losses. The difficulty in detecting these leaks prompted this work, which attempts to find a reliable method of recognizing a leak and suggest possible designs that could be implemented on a pipe-navigating robot. This design would use thin flaps, or "leaves," that would be forced outward by the rapid pressure drop formed in proximity to <b>the</b> <b>leak.</b> In order to determine the characteristic behavior of the system, several simulations, with a circular hole as <b>the</b> <b>leak,</b> were ran that showed that the significant pressure gradient existed only within distance on the order of the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>leak.</b> To validate these results, a high precision pressure sensor was used to try and measure the pressure gradient, but the pressure sensor was too large sense a pressure difference. Therefore, rubber strips were used to emulate the use of "leaves" to perceive <b>the</b> <b>leak.</b> This confirmed <b>the</b> simulation results, as the rubber strips had to be incredibly close to <b>the</b> <b>leak</b> in order to be affected. Furthermore, once the strip was pulled up against <b>the</b> <b>leak,</b> <b>the</b> friction created between the wall and the strip became strong enough that it could be utilized. Both the simulation and experimental results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>leak</b> detecting module should start near <b>the</b> <b>leak.</b> Next, instead of detecting <b>the</b> <b>leak</b> via a motion towards <b>the</b> <b>leak,</b> <b>the</b> module should instead take advantage of the large frictional force that occurs when the leaf has made contact with <b>the</b> <b>leak.</b> Further experiments could include testing the magnitude of the frictional force and creating a prototype. by James Torres.
