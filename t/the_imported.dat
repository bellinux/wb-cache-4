40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} duty drawbacks in {{the presence}} of domestic distortions. Introducing duty drawbacks is welfare enhancing in a small economy if <b>the</b> <b>import</b> competing sectors are subsidized, have uniform or escalating tariff structure and low intensity of <b>import</b> use, while <b>the</b> export-oriented sectors are taxed. Reducing full duty drawbacks is likely to be welfare reducing when <b>the</b> <b>import</b> competing sectors have escalating tariff structure and are protected by domestic output subsidies, while the exporting sectors are taxed. The higher <b>the</b> tariff on <b>imported</b> final goods, <b>the</b> lower <b>the</b> tariff on <b>imported</b> inputs, and <b>the</b> <b>import</b> intensity of <b>the</b> <b>import</b> competing sector, <b>the</b> more likely it is that the welfare effect will be negative. In general, the welfare effect of a change in the duty drawback regime is ambiguous.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model {{the case of}} an {{international}} non-renewable resource monopolist as a differential game between the monopolist and the governments of <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries, and we investigate whether a tariff on the resource importations can be advantageous for <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries. We find that the results depend crucially on the kind of strategies <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> country governments can play and on whether the monopolist chooses the price or the extraction rate. For a price-setting monopolist it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries cannot use a tariff to capture monopoly rents if they are constrained to use open-loop strategies, even if the governments sign a tariff agreement. This result is drastically modified if <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries in <b>the</b> tariff agreement use Markov (feedback) strategies. For a quantity-setting monopolist the nature of the game changes and an open-loop tariff is advantageous for <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries.

5|$|Ice {{houses were}} also {{built in the}} major ice {{consuming}} cities to hold <b>the</b> <b>imported</b> ice before final sale and consumption, where they were often termed depots. In London, the early ice depots were often circular and called wells or shades; the New Cattle Market depot built in 1871 was 42 feet (13 m) wide and 72 feet (22 m) deep, able to hold 3,000 short tons (three million kg) of ice. Later ice depots at Shadwell and Kings Cross in London were larger still, and, along with incoming barges, were used for storing Norwegian ice. The city of New York was unusual and did not build ice depots near the ports, instead using the incoming barges and, on occasion, ships that were delivering the ice as floating warehouses until the ice was needed.|$|E
5|$|In Hawaii, the planarian Endeavouria septemlineata {{has been}} used to control <b>the</b> <b>imported</b> giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was {{displacing}} native snails, and Platydemus manokwari, another planarian, {{has been used}} for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Guam. Although A. fulica has declined sharply in Hawaii, there are doubts about how much E. septemlineata contributed to this. However, P. manokwari is given credit for severely reducing, and in places exterminating, A. fulica – achieving much greater success than most biological pest control programs, which generally aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. The ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist starvation may account for their ability to decimate A. fulica. However, these abilities have raised concerns that planarians may themselves become a serious threat to native snails.|$|E

5|$|Norway is {{a country}} with {{abundance}} of hydroelectricity and NSB saw {{huge amounts of money}} burning up with <b>the</b> <b>imported</b> coal. Plans for electrification of the line is as old as the railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track, having seen the Thamshavn Line open with electric traction in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 30s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built with electric traction, but not the main line. Countersuggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or coal dust. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the breakout of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 50s was it again possible to afford such investments. Vossebanen took electric traction into use on 2 July 1954.|$|E
5|$|The {{price of}} <b>the</b> <b>imported</b> ice varied {{according}} {{to the amount of}} economic competition; in Havana, Tudor's ice sold for 25 cents ($3.70 in 2010 terms) per pound, while in Georgia it reached only six to eight cents ($0.90–$1.20 in 2010 terms). Where Tudor had a strong market share, he would respond to competition from passing traders by lowering his prices considerably, selling his ice at the unprofitable rate of one cent ($0.20) per pound (0.5kg); at this price, competitors would typically be unable to sell their own stock at a profit: they would either be driven into debt or if they declined to sell, their ice would melt away in the heat. Tudor, relying on his local storage depots, could then increase his prices once again. By the middle of the 1820s, around 3,000 tons (3 million kg) of ice was being shipped from Boston annually, two thirds by Tudor.|$|E

5|$|The {{worship of}} some Egyptian gods spread to {{neighboring}} lands, especially to Canaan and Nubia during the New Kingdom, when those regions were under pharaonic control. In Canaan, the exported deities, including Hathor, Amun, and Set, were often syncretized with native gods, {{who in turn}} spread to Egypt. The Egyptian deities {{may not have had}} permanent temples in Canaan, and their importance there waned after Egypt lost control of the region. In contrast, many temples to the major Egyptian gods and deified pharaohs were built in Nubia. After the end of Egyptian rule there, <b>the</b> <b>imported</b> gods, particularly Amun and Isis, were syncretized with local deities and remained part of the religion of Nubia's independent Kingdom of Kush. These gods were incorporated into the Nubian ideology of kingship much as they were in Egypt, so that Amun was considered the divine father of the king and Isis and other goddesses were linked with the Nubian queen, the kandake. Some deities reached farther. Taweret became a goddess in Minoan Crete, and Amun's oracle at Siwa Oasis was known to and consulted by people across the Mediterranean region.|$|E
