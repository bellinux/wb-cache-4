Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control.

5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an {{inflammatory}} lung disease of unknown cause. It is a severe, progressive form of bronchiolitis, {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} bronchioles (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles (<b>those</b> <b>involved</b> in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher JÃ¼rgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between <b>those</b> <b>involved,</b> in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
