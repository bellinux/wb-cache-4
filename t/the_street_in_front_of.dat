5|$|Local {{opinion was}} heavily against Thornton. Pamphlets were sold {{purporting}} to show Thornton's guilt, and poems were composed {{with the same}} theme.

On 8 August 1817, people filled <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. When the judge, Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available seating, and the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial. Because {{of the nature of the}} evidence, women were not permitted to witness the trial.|$|E

25|$|Edward’s {{interest}} in {{the well-being of the}} Seri people and in their rich culture and history was unflagging up until his sudden and unexpected death in 1976. At about that same time, a Mexican government-sponsored building project in Haxöl Iihom laid out the first streets, and <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Mosers’ home was called Calle Eduardo Moser, a name which it still bears today.|$|E
25|$|Although Parks' {{autobiography}} recounts early {{memories of}} the kindness of white strangers, she could not ignore the racism of her society.

The Montgomery Industrial School, founded and staffed by white northerners for black children, was burned twice by arsonists. Its faculty was ostracized by the white community.|$|E

60|$|One of {{them took}} me to their City Hall and Board of Trade works, and pointed it out with pride. It was very ugly, but very big, and <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of it were narrow and unclean.

25|$|A revised height law in 1910 did {{away with}} that fixed maximum. The newer legislation, still in effect today, states that no new {{building}} {{may be more than}} 20 feet taller than the width of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> it. The current law is codified as D.C. CODE ANN. § 6-601.05. Thus, Washington has a relatively modest skyline in comparison to the majority of American cities. However the District is ringed by high-rise buildings in many nearby suburbs like Arlington, Silver Spring, and Bethesda.|$|E
25|$|Mexican potters {{generally}} use local clays, digging it up {{themselves or}} paying someone {{to bring it}} by donkey or truck. The kind of temper used varies on location, from cattail fluff in Metepec, to sand in Acatlán or kapok in Ameyaltepec to give the clay the right consistency and it keep the final product from cracking. In some cases feldspar is used. The clay comes in chunks, which must be dried and then crushed, using a rolling stone or flail. Some potters in Metepec put the chunks on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> their house and let the cars drive over them. Another way to remove impurities and use the finest is to disperse the clay in water, with impurities and rougher sediment falling to the bottom.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Eugene Pfeifer III {{sued the}} city of Little Rock to {{challenge}} its use of eminent domain {{in the use of}} the land but the city's method of taking the land was upheld by the Arkansas Supreme Court in 2001. Pfeifer argued against the use of revenue bonds for the project because he believed that the city could not afford to repay them. In 2001, a rail depot dating from 1899 was discovered within a warehouse on the site. Preservationists lost a court battle to save the building, and the depot was destroyed. Protesters also picketed the city hall when the city tried to name <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the library [...] "President Clinton Avenue". The two groups later compromised and only half of the street was renamed.|$|E

The floors above the level of the Rows are used for commercial or domestic purposes, or for storage. [...] The Rows are present, to a greater or lesser degree, in all the streets radiating from Chester Cross, namely Watergate Street, Northgate Street, Eastgate Street and Upper Bridge Street. [...] They are continuous on both sides of Upper Bridge Street, along most of Watergate and Eastgate Street, but only for a short stretch along the east side of Northgate Street.
