2500|$|In June 2010, it was {{announced}} that Paul Reubens was working with Judd Apatow on a new Pee-wee Herman feature film set up at Universal Pictures, with Reubens and Paul Rust set to write the script. In an October 2014, interview with Rolling Stone, Reubens gave an update on the status of the film, saying: [...] "It's been months and months of being right {{on the verge of being}} announced…I thought something was going to go public yesterday, actually, and that you’d be the first person I’d be talking about this with. But I’m thinking there will be something made public very soon. It's going to get made shortly after the new year. I wish I could <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> right now, because…I mean, it's amazing. It's going to be amazing. It think it first got leaked four years ago or so that the movie was going to be made, and ever since then it's just been stalling and stalling. So I'm really ready for this to happen. But I’m not kidding: It's very imminent." ...|$|E

60|$|NORA. Oh, I'm {{no better}} than yourself. I may as well <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|I don't think I'm {{justified}} in <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> If Sir Arthur thinks {{you should know}} I daresay he'd rather <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is a long}} story," [...] {{answered}} the King, with a Winged laugh; [...] "but as {{we have a long}} journey before us, I will pass the time by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> if <b>you</b> wish." ...|$|R
60|$|ASHER. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it</b> later--when <b>you</b> feel better.|$|R
60|$|<b>Tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> Well, I guess I {{might as}} well. It ain't any breach of confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to-morrow," [...] he promised, [...] "or rather {{later on}} to-day. She's a little overwrought. Otherwise--there's nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No,” said Egbert, {{handing it}} across the table, “I thought I would <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> first. Heavens, what are you doing?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, mamma;--I do not prevaricate. It {{is unfair}} to say that to me. I do love him. There. I think it {{ought to have been}} enough for you to know that I should never give him {{encouragement}} without <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I do love him, and I shall never love any one else.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Next Generation listed it as number 66 {{on their}} [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time" [...] in 1996, commenting that [...] "This Steve Meretzky triumph {{is one of}} the few games ... to attempt {{something}} more deep in the interactive entertainment medium than killing or humor. It presents a grim view of a dark future not by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but rather by letting you experience it and do things for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes; I {{remember}} now. You have parted. The {{subject is}} too large {{for me to know}} all at once what I think of it, and you must give me time, Kit. Speaking of Ethelberta reminds me of what I have done. I just looked into the Academy this morning--I thought I would surprise <b>you</b> by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> And what do you think I saw? Ethelberta--in the picture painted by Mr. Ladywell.' ...|$|R
6000|$|KEEGAN [admonitorily]. Patsy: {{what did}} I {{tell you about}} callin me Father Keegan an your reverence? What did Father Dempsey <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He lunched with us one {{day when}} father had gout. Didn't he <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> He said {{he was coming to}} see you that afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you do," [...] said Jonathan Stubbs, [...] "and if you'll {{come and}} dance I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The Marchesa {{told me to}} take you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must come}} home with me first, Frank. I must {{introduce}} you to the count and countess, and to Stephanie. Then to-morrow morning you must come round early. I have heard nothing yet {{as to how the}} truth about that murder came out so rapidly. It seemed to me that the evidence was conclusive against me, and that even the letter that I wrote <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> was so improbable that no one but you and Aunt would credit, in the slightest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I {{believe there}} is {{something}} of the sort brewing again," [...] the woman said. [...] "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it</b> later on." ...|$|R

60|$|The waiter {{has just}} come to call us {{to go out and}} hear the echo, and so I must go. I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Devine, dryly, [...] "as we'll {{probably}} be here {{a day or}} two, I guess it is. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> when we get supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Monsieur de Talleyrand,' I answered, 'I {{regret to}} say that it is quite {{impossible}} for me to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I have promised the Emperor.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Three months since: but sit down, {{and let me}} {{take your}} hat, and I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Stop, <b>you</b> have had nothing to eat, have you?' ...|$|R
60|$|Won't {{you come}} and meet me after the show to-morrow night, and I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> I should like so much to see you again.|$|R
60|$|I was {{richer than}} any other person in the world, and now I am that pauper without peer. Some day I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> not now.|$|E
60|$|Mister, {{have you}} ever had a real shock--something that came out of nowhere and just knocked you flat? I have, and I'm going to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "On {{the floor}} of the boat-house. Oh, how shall I begin--how shall I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it!</b> She talked to me so strangely--she looked so fearfully ill--she left me so suddenly!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They do. Sit down, Philip, and hear. I {{wanted to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They know it. Poor Laura was so unhappy {{when you were}} ill, that mamma made it out from her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I don't mind <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now. When Mellish had me {{up after}} school today, I'd got my yarn all ready. There wasn't {{a flaw in}} it {{anywhere}} as far as I could see. My idea was this. I told him I'd been to Yorke's room {{the day before the}} exam, to ask him if he had any marks for us. That was all right. Yorke was doing the two Unseen papers, and it was just the sort of thing a fellow would do to go and ask him about the marks.' ...|$|R
