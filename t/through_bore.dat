25|$|The railway {{was built}} as single track {{but with a}} {{trackbed}} wide enough to allow upgrading to double track for expansion. Although the work was estimated to take approximately one year, delays including buying land for the line, a cow eating the plans near Oakworth and engineering problems meant the work took nearly two years to complete. In particular the southern tunnel to Ingrow West had quicksand oozing <b>through</b> <b>bore</b> holes that required additional piles to be driven down to the bedrock to support and stabilise the tunnel. Unfortunately the work damaged the foundation to the Wesley Place Methodist Church resulting in the church receiving £1,980 from the railway compnay.|$|E

40|$|Over {{exploitation}} of groundwater water resources is causing progressive decline in water {{table in the}} arid and semi arid parts of India. The socio-economic impacts of these phenomena range from increased cost of well irrigation to reduced returns from irrigated agriculture, to growing inequity in access to groundwater depending on the aquifer conditions and the overall socio-economic conditions of the communities. In hard rock areas, over exploitation is leading to decline in yield and drying up of open wells. This forces farmers to go for either well deepening or drilling new bore wells. But due to the poor success in hitting water <b>through</b> <b>bore</b> well drilling in hard rock areas and the consequent increase in costs of setting up a bore-well based irrigation scheme, small cultivators are the worse affected. This paper focus on the phenomenon of well failure in the hard rock areas of Dewas in Madhya Pradesh. It highlights the causes of well failure and related welfare impacts on the cultivators especially small landowners. The major impacts {{were found to be}} on the cropping pattern, extent of well irrigation, crop yields, net returns and food security in the surveyed region. In addition, discussion is centered on power subsidies in the state which have promoted indiscriminate use and further depletion of groundwater from the already low yielding aquifers. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis {{has been}} to design, and partly {{manufacture}} and evaluate, a highly miniaturized, on-chip conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensor system for deepwater analysis also including electrodes for pH and chloride ion concentration measurements. The microtechnology-based sensor system will be a vital instrument onboard the Deeper Access, Deeper Understanding submersible, which will be small enough for deployment <b>through</b> <b>bore</b> holes into the subglacial lakes of Antarctica. Design of the complete 15 x 30 mm chip, including variations of each sensor type (in total 39 sensors), is presented. Salinity (through conductivity), temperature, chloride ion concentration and pH sensors have been manufactured using conventional lithography, evaporation, wet etching and lift off techniques. Simulations of the pressure sensors (not manufactured) show how the set of four bossed membranes with integrated strain gauges combine to cover, yet withstand, pressures of 1 - 100 atm. Salinity is measured conductively with gold electrodes. The temperature sensor is a platinum thermoresistor. Chloride ion concentration and pH are measured potentiometrically with ion-selective microelectrodes of silver/silver chloride and iridium oxide, respectively. Tests of the conductivity sensor gave good results also on sea water samples of known salinity. The temperature sensor showed good linearity to a reference sensor in the tested range of 5 - 35 C. Issues with evaporation and lift off are discussed, and a process identification document is attached. DAD...|$|E

40|$|The Southern Ocean {{is one of}} {{the most}} diverse soundscapes of earth. The {{dynamics}} of the cryosphere i. e. sea ice, glaciers and icebergs create unique acoustic conditions. During polar winter the snow covered sea ice shields the ocean from atmospheric influences, suppresses the creation of waves and resembles an almost perfect acoustic absorber, thus creating one of the quietest environments of all oceans. On the other hand, large table icebergs calved from the enormous ice sheet of the Antarctic continent are the largest moving objects on earth and can accumulate kinetic energy in the terajoule range when driven by circumpolar currents. This energy is eventually released when these giants collide with the continental or ice shelves - events that create some of the loudest sounds in the sea which can be detected thousands of kilometers away. However, these are singular events which occur only few times per year. Typically the acoustic environment is dominated by the vocalizations of marine mammals. Most remarkable, the chorus of blue whales represents the spectral peak of the acoustic spectrum, audible almost during every single minute of the year despite the remaining population of blue whales in the Southern Ocean is just 2300 animals – compared to about 350. 000 in the pre whaling area 100 years ago. The second largest source of acoustic energy are Antarctic Minke whales - the main target of today’s scientific whaling. The relation between these animals and a sound of formerly unknown origin was just recently identified in 2013. Long term acoustic monitoring of this ecosystem thus can yield easy indicators for the population development of these animals. In 2005 we set up the autonomous PALAOA observatory on the Eckström ice shelf, an acoustic array deployed <b>through</b> <b>bore</b> holes into the ocean under a 100 m thick ice sheet. In 2009 we started to add long term deep water acoustic recorders to most of the oceanographic moorings that are deployed throughout the Weddell Sea, creating a basin wide acoustic array with 20 nodes at the moment. An international project will extend this to a circum- Antarctic installation during the next years, aiming to infer the complete spatio-temporal distribution of the Antarctic great whales. While the long term recorders are typically recovered every three years and their data are analyzed offline, the PALAOA data is streamed live via satellite to the lab and the public internet. This allows to direct field parties immediately to the seaside when interesting acoustic events are detected. Additional sensors provide related information that helps to interpret the acoustics. An AIS receiver monitors all ship traffic in the area to analyze human impacts. A CTD probe delivers oceanographic data. Meteorology and webcams make local weather and ice conditions accessible. Relating the acoustics to the medium and large scale ice situation is possible through high resolution ASAR images, provided by several satellites. All this data is collected in a database at the Alfred Wegener Institute and published in the PANGAEA data center. Live audio stream and historical data are available via www. awi. de/palaoa...|$|E
