5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. While {{the procedure is}} inexpensive and does not require surgical skills, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> regarding long-term side effects. Another substance, polidocanol, which functions {{in the same manner}} is being looked at. A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this general}} {{support for the}} concept of wind power in the public at large, local {{opposition}} often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects. For example, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> that some installations can negatively affect TV and radio reception and Doppler weather radar, as well as produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values. Potential broadcast-reception solutions include predictive interference modeling {{as a component of}} site selection. A study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected.|$|E
5|$|Products of volcano-ice {{interactions}} {{stand as}} various structures, whose shape {{is dependent on}} complex eruptive and environmental interactions. Glacial volcanism is a good indicator of past ice distribution, making it an important climatic marker. Since they are imbedded in ice, as ice retracts worldwide <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> that tuyas and other structures may destabalize, resulting in mass landslides. Evidence of volcanic-glacial interactions are evident in Iceland and parts of British Columbia, and it is even possible that they {{play a role in}} deglaciation.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>concern</b> that {{opportunities}} for public {{debate about the}} future of the island had become fewer, though attempts at bi-communal contacts <b>were</b> welcomed. Furthermore, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>concern</b> at demining progress in buffer zone and the Turkish Cypriot side was urged to resume demining activities.|$|R

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> as {{to whether}} {{breeding}} hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can {{be at risk for}} life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region like hind leg paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> {{raised about}} {{possible}} contribution from urban heat islands to global warming. Research on China indicates that urban heat island effect contributes to climate warming by about 30%. On the other hand, one 1999 comparison between {{urban and rural}} areas proposed that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends. Many studies reveal increases in the severity of the effect with the progress of climate change.|$|E
5|$|Two planarian {{species have}} been used {{successfully}} in the Philippines, Indonesia, Hawaii, New Guinea, and Guam to control populations of the imported giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was displacing native snails. However, there is now concern that these planarians may themselves become {{a serious threat to}} native snails. In northwest Europe, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> about the spread of the New Zealand planarian Arthurdendyus triangulatus, which preys on earthworms.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>concern</b> that an {{unresolved}} water crisis may {{impact the}} 2016 Olympic Games.|$|R
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerns</b> {{about the}} hospital's long term prospects, leading to protests in 2010.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>concern</b> at {{the human}} rights {{situation}} in Côte d'Ivoire and ongoing violence.|$|R
5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} recognised Croats as {{a minority}} native to Hungary; it has decided to implement the optional regulations of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages {{with respect to the}} Croatian language and establish a minority self-government for the Croatian minority in Hungary, guaranteeing cultural autonomy. The Croatian minority set up 127 local and 7 county self-governments in Hungary. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> that Croatian minority rights in Hungary are being diminished, but the president of Croatia has assessed that both Croatian and Hungarian minority policies were appropriate. The Croatian minority in Hungary is particularly active in Pécs, where the Scientific Institute of Croats in Hungary and the Croatian Theatre have been established.|$|E
5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E
25|$|Other regions {{appear to}} have {{experienced}} increased hurricane intensity as well, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> {{about the quality of}} data in these other regions.|$|E

25|$|Research {{into the}} {{effectiveness}} of traditional Chinese herbal therapy is of poor quality and often tainted by bias. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> {{over a number of}} potentially toxic Chinese herbs.|$|E
25|$|The {{potential}} {{consequences of}} ocean acidification {{are not fully}} understood, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> that structures made of calcium carbonate may become vulnerable to dissolution, affecting corals {{and the ability of}} shellfish to form shells.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> for the {{architectural}} heritage in the area. A sad loss of an Edwardian gem occurred in 2010 when Medway Council demolished the Aveling & Porter building {{to make way}} for a car park.|$|E
25|$|In addition, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> that provincial {{governments have}} enough {{autonomy}} to sometimes stall {{the implementation of}} central government-set guidelines and some officials say {{there has been a}} reluctance from many state-owned companies to get involved in AIDS programs.|$|E

25|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drugs such}} as aspirin or ibuprofen have been proposed {{as a treatment for}} the headaches associated with a hangover.

25|$|The {{conjoined}} pair of Gasholders No. 4 & 5 {{erected in}} 1874 and 1876 {{were designed by}} Sir Corbet Woodall and are locally listed.

25|$|Grapefruit {{can have}} a number of {{interactions}} with certain drugs, increasing the potency of many compounds, including warfarin (coumadin). Grapefruit has components that inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme in the intestine.
