50|$|By {{gathering}} turn {{cards from}} a number of players and processing them all at the same time, games can provide simultaneous actions for all players. However, for this same reason, co-ordination between players can be difficult to achieve. For example, player A might attempt <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> <b>player</b> B's current location to do something with (or <b>to)</b> <b>player</b> B, while player B might simultaneously attempt <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> <b>player</b> A's current location. As such, the output/results of the turn can differ significantly from the submitted plan. Whatever the results, they are mailed back <b>to</b> the <b>player</b> <b>to</b> be studied and used {{as the basis for the}} next turn (often along with a new blank turn card).|$|R

5|$|After leaving Cardiff in 1956, he {{released}} his autobiography I Lead the Attack {{in which he}} revealed {{that he was involved}} in an illegal-payments scandal while at Sunderland, with the club attempting to circumvent the maximum wage at the time by offering payments and other incentives <b>to</b> <b>players.</b> Ford detailed several ways that Sunderland's board of directors had attempted to add extra bonuses such as offering houses for free or at hugely reduced costs <b>to</b> <b>players</b> and the free installation of new kitchen appliances whenever needed. The revelations saw the club suffer heavy financial penalties and Ford was temporarily suspended from the game. However, he maintained that he never regretted releasing the book. Following his suspension, Ford initially announced his retirement from football at the age of 33 but decided to come out of retirement in 1957. With the suspension in place, he was forced to look overseas for a club, signing for Dutch club PSV Eindhoven who were managed by Englishman George Hardwick at the time. Despite averaging a goal nearly every other game, Ford was largely in the shadow of one of the PSV's all-time greats in Coen Dillen during his spell with the club and failed to win a trophy during his three-year stint in Holland. He eventually won his case for reinstatement, returning to The Football League with a brief spell at Newport County in the Third Division. He ended a long career playing his football at Romford. In 1955, Ford also guest appeared for Southern Premier League side Gloucester City.|$|E

5|$|Before {{implementing}} Steam, Valve Corporation {{had problems}} updating its online games, such as Counter-Strike; providing patches {{would result in}} most of the online user base disconnecting for several days.

Through user polls {{at the time of its}} announcement in 2002, Valve also recognized that at least 75% of their users had access to high-speed Internet connections, which would only grow with planned Internet expansion in the following years, and recognized that they could deliver game content faster <b>to</b> <b>players</b> than through retail channels. Valve approached several companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and RealNetworks to build a client with these features, but were declined.|$|E
