5000|$|In {{the fourth}} {{episode of the}} fifth series, there was {{controversy}} around the elimination of contestant Iain Watters.

However, unseen footage broadcast in the accompanying programme An Extra Slice shows Luis holding the large floor freezer that contained Iain's ice cream open as he piped the sides of his own baked Alaska, while Mel warns him to pipe quickly and close the freezer. Later in the episode, when Iain removes his ice cream to begin the next step of his dish, it is still quite soft, indicating it went into the freezer he shared with Diana without being completely frozen.

40|$|Objective: Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) {{suppresses}} {{the immune}} system. To decrease such sup-pressive {{effects on the}} immune system, {{a wide range of}} herbal medicines like garlic are utilized. Biological activities of garlic in vitro and in vivo have also been verified. Our previ-ous studies demonstrated that aged garlic (dry garlic bulbs preserved in <b>the</b> <b>freezer</b> <b>for</b> six months at- 20 ˚C) have increased immunostimulator fractions and reduced immuno-suppressor fractions. This study focuses on the immunosuppressor activity of AFB 1 and immunostimulator activity of aged garlic extract (AGE) through the evaluation of CD 4 + CD 25 + FoxP+ regulator cell (Treg) counts and the pattern of cytokine production in Balb/c normal mice. Materials and Methods: In this experimental research, AFB 1 was separated from As-pergillus flavus (PTCC 5004) by HPLC and AGE prepared using the Mantis method. The Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) test was carried out to determinate the effectiveness of different doses of AGE and AFB 1, which can both {{have an effect on the}} immune sys-tem.

40|$|Background: Medicated gums are {{intended}} to be chewed and act either locally, absorbed via the buccal mucosa or swallowed with saliva. We prepared the metformin gum to overcome its side effects including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdomen discomfort. Furthermore, {{it could be useful}} for those who have swallowing problems. Materials and Methods: Metformin hydrochloride (250 mg) with suitable sweeteners was mixed manually for 5 min. This mixture was spray dried, freeze dried, or directly mixed with chewing gum base. Glycerin, xylitol, and menthol were added and the produced paste was kept in <b>the</b> <b>freezer</b> <b>for</b> 2 h to be stable. As the metformin shows bitter taste, we tried to mask this unpleasant taste with using different methods explained. The releasing pattern was evaluated by using a mechanical chewing machine. The best formulation with the optimized releasing pattern, suitable physicochemical properties and pleasant taste were selected. Content uniformity, releasing percent, and other physicochemical properties were identified as well. Taste, flavor, and appearance characteristics were evaluated by using a self-made questionnaire based on the hedonic test method. Results: The chewing gum dosage content was about 86. 2 %. The release rate of metformin chewing gum was about 70 % after 5 min of mastication. Masking the bitter taste of drug was achieved by using acesulfame-isomalt as sweeteners and prepared it by freeze drying equipment. Conclusion: Metfornin chewing gum had suitable appearance and appropriate invitro characteristics that fallow the pharmacopeia suggestions. This chewable gum showed bitterness suppression with a suitable release rate...|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} a {{prevalent}} disease around the world. The prostatic specific Antigen (PSA) test has recently proved itself as a useful method for the diagnosis and examination of patients with prostatic cancer. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the stability of free PSA and total PSA in different storage settings. Samples were obtained from 12 men, within the range of 50 - 70 yr old, who referred to Hazrat-e-Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. The sera were separated via centrifuge and stored at room temperature (21 - 24 ºC) for 3, 6, and 9 hours; at 4 ºC for 24, 48, and 72 hours; and at- 20 ºC for 1, 2, and 3 months. Finally, the stability of PSA was compared to that of the control group. The data were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS and paired t-test and repeated measure. In comparison with the average of the control samples, after 3 hours of storage at room temperature, the free PSA concentration had a 30 % drop; and after 72 hours of storage in the refrigerator, the average of free PSA had a 34 % fall. In addition, the average of the free PSA concentration kept in <b>the</b> <b>freezer</b> <b>for</b> 3 months exhibited an 11 % drop.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{laboratory}} tests were obtained values of the coefficient thermal conductivity (Keff) of new snow for different types of the solid precipitation: plates, needles, stellars, graupels. Snow samples were collected during a snowfall and placed in <b>the</b> <b>freezer.</b> <b>For</b> all types of sediment thermal conductivity of snow is equal to 0. 03 – 0. 04 W/m·°C. Transformation of new snow occurs within 10 days at average temperature − 10 °C and the gradient temperature of 50 – 60 °C/m.  Under these conditions, the metamorphism leads to an increase the density of snow, size of grains and rounded snow particles.  At {{the beginning of the}} experiment, the thermal conductivity of snow is linearly increased in proportion to the density of the snow. However, after 3 – 5 days Keff stabilized at about 0. 08 – 0. 09 W/m·°C, although the density of the snow and size of grains continued to increase. This effect occurs with the appearance of faceted crystals and loosening of snow. In the future, while maintaining a negative temperature coefficient of thermal conductivity remained unchanged. Thus, the temperature gradient metamorphism affect to the thermal conductivity snow, which {{plays an important role in}} maintaining the thermal insulation properties of snow cover. The article describes the formula to calculate the thermal conductivity of the snow conditions in the temperature gradient metamorphism. Such conditions are characteristic of the vast expanses of the north and northeast of the European part of Russia. On the basis of long-term observations in Moscow shows the average minimum and maximum values for the density of the snow woods and fields on the basis of which can be calculated for the thermal properties of the snow. </p...|$|E
