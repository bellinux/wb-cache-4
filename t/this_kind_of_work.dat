A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church.

25|$|The most {{important}} later influence to Mexican and other painters in Latin America {{was the work}} of Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens, known through copies made from engravings and mezzotint techniques. His paintings were copied and reworked and became the standard for both religious and secular art. Later Baroque paintings moved from the confines of altarpieces to colossal freestanding canvases on church interiors. One of the best known Mexican painters of <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> was Cristóbal de Villalpando. His work {{can be seen in the}} sacristy of the Mexico City Cathedral, which was done between 1684 and 1686. These canvases were glued directly onto the walls with arched frames to stabilize them, and placed just under the vaults of the ceiling. Even the fresco work of the 16th century was not usually this large. Another one of Villalpando's works is the cupola of the Puebla Cathedral in 1688. He used Rubens’ brush techniques and the shape of the structure to create a composition of clouds with angels and saints, from which a dove descends to represent the Holy Spirit. The light from the cupola’s windows is meant to symbolize God’s grace. Juan Rodríguez Juárez (1675–1728) and mulatto artist Juan Correa (1646–1716) were also prominent painters of the baroque era. Correa's most famous student, José de Ibarra (1685–1756) was also mixed-race. One of Mexico's finest painters, Miguel Cabrera (1695–1768), was possibly mixed race.|$|E

[...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art.

2500|$|The {{question}} is, {{what are}} {{the ways in which}} peasant music is taken over and becomes transmuted into modern music?

Another method... is the following: the composer does not make use of a real peasant melody but invents his own imitation of such melodies. There is no true difference between this method and the one described above.... There is yet a third way... Neither peasant melodies nor imitations of peasant melodies can be found in his music, but it is pervaded by the atmosphere of peasant music. In this case we may say, he has completely absorbed the idiom of peasant music which has become his musical mother tongue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known Falklands settler was Carmelita Penny (Simon) who {{had arrived}} as a slave after 1826. Her sons José Simon, Manuel Coronel Jr. and Richard Penny Jr. were all native Falkland Islanders (born in 1831, 1834 and 1837 respectively), whose fathers had been resident in the islands since before 1833. [...] Among the prominent early Falkland Islanders of Buenos Ayrean origins were the gaucho Manuel Coronel Sr., Santiago Lopez (Darwin's ‘St Jago’), German-born Charles Kussler, Antonina Roxa, and another slave Gregoria Madrid. [...] Most popular among them was Antonina Roxa whose hard work in several occupations (she was a skillful gaucho, and worked as such at Hope Place - Saladero) made her {{the owner of a}} [...] farm and valuable real estate in Stanley. [...] The South American contribution to the Falklander ethnogenesis is further recorded by Commodore Augusto Lasserre of the Argentine Navy, who traveled extensively around the islands; according to his account there were up to 20 Argentine-born Islanders in 1869, [...] "working either as labourers or foremen in the ranches, because in <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> they are better than the majority of the foreigners".|$|E

The following year Vic Gammon commented that Fakesong was [...] "the beginning of critical work’" [...] {{on the first}} folk revival, and also that it had taken on [...] "the status of an orthodoxy in some quarters of the British left.". In the 1990 Folk Music Journal, Michael Pickering concluded that Fakesong was [...] "the best example of <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> to date... Harker has provided a firm foundation for future work." [...] Harker’s work had, indeed, become an orthodoxy and was being quoted {{by a number of}} prominent left-wing historians. In 1993 Georgina Boyes produced her book The Imagined Village - Culture, ideology and the English Folk Revival, which, following Harker, was also highly critical of Sharp. The writings of Harker, however, and by extension of Harker's followers in the US (such as David E. Whisnant, Benjamin Filene, and Robert Christgau, who have backgrounds in political science, American Studies, and journalism, not ethnography) have now themselves in turn come under scrutiny as overly harsh, exaggerated, distorted, and unjust. In his defense of Sharp, C. J. Bearman took scholars to task for their speedy and uncritical acceptance of Harker's views:To his credit, Harker has never concealed his political allegiances – he is or was a Trotskyist adherent of the Socialist Workers' Party (Harker 1985, 256-8) – but at the same time, it must be maintained that his is an extreme political position. To accept without question the opinion of a Trotskyist about Sharp and his work is rather like taking one's view of the Communist Manifesto from a member of the British National Party.|$|E
