30|$|As remarked in [1], {{in order}} {{to cope with the}} {{dramatic}} increase in demand of high-speed wireless connections, there is an urgent demand of flexible, efficient, and computationally affordable transceivers. The design of attractive wireless transceivers hinges on a range of contradictory factors. Given a certain wireless channel, it is always possible to design a transmission scheme capable of increasing <b>transmission</b> <b>integrity</b> at the cost of more sophisticated signal processing. Alternatively, <b>transmission</b> <b>integrity</b> may be increased without increasing system complexity, provided that, for example, channel coding/interleaving delay can be further extended. It is also realistic to increase the system integrity by invoking a more robust but lower throughput modulation scheme. In such a case, the integrity is increased without spending in terms of system complexity, just in terms of bandwidth expense. In this paper, we adopted a transmission scheme characterized by intrinsic robustness against multipath channel impairment (i.e., STBC MC-CDMA). <b>Transmission</b> <b>integrity</b> should be guaranteed without increasing too much system complexity, considering also that we have decided to exploit only transmit diversity {{in order to}} keep the mobile terminal cheaper. In order to solve the tradeoff between integrity and complexity, we design an innovative STBC MC-CDMA receiver architecture based on the integration of (a) Minimum-Conditioned BER linear MUD and (b) Genetic Algorithm-assisted channel estimation. In the following part of this section, we shall detail and motivate both the adopted linear MUD criterion and the channel estimation strategy based on evolutionary optimization.|$|E

This research work involves in increasing the capabilities of node cooperation and message authentication by eliminating the selfish nodes because the selfish nodes are very harmful to mobile ad hoc networks while having communication. Hence, encouraging the reliable cooperation among nodes becomes a very important concern in mobile ad hoc networks. For this purpose, two hop communications are used in MANETs with cooperative communication, message integrity, hop-by-hop authentication. This research work proposes a high secured cooperative trusted communication using Object Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) and Message Authentication among the nodes in mobile ad hoc network.

Among all mechanical failures in helicopter transmission, the main gearbox (MGB) failures occupy approximately 16 %. Great effort has been paid in early prevention and diagnosis of MGB failures.

40|$|Coding-based {{restoration}} {{techniques have}} proactive restoration {{which results in}} time savings over other state-of-the-art restoration techniques. Diversity coding is a coding-based recovery technique which offers near-hitless restoration with a competitive spare capacity requirement with respect to other techniques. In this paper, we show that diversity coding can achieve sub-ms restoration time. In addition, we develop two optimal algorithms for pre-provisioning of the static traffic {{and one for the}} dynamic provisioning of the traffic on-demand. There is one algorithm for systematic and one for non-systematic diversity coding in pre-provisioning. An MIP formulation and an ILP formulation are developed for systematic and non-systematic cases, respectively. The MIP formulation of the systematic diversity coding requires much fewer integer variables and constraints than similar optimal coding-based formulations. In dynamic provisioning, an ILP-based algorithm covers both of the systematic and non-systematic diversity coding. In all scenarios, diversity coding results in smaller restoration time, higher <b>transmission</b> <b>integrity,</b> and much reduced signaling complexity than the existing techniques in the literature. Simulation results indicate that diversity coding has significantly higher restoration speed than Shared Path Protection (SPP) and p-cycle techniques from the literature as well as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) rings, which are commonly deployed by service providers today. In terms of capacity efficiency, it outperforms SONET rings and 1 + 1 APS, whereas it may require more extra capacity than the p-cycle technique and SPP. Diversity coding offers a preferable tradeoff which offers two orders of magnitude increase in restoration speed at the expense of less than 26 % extra spare capacity. © 1972 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E

Finally, we will characterize the impact of imperfect Channel State Information (CSI) on the proposed iterative DL-SDMA and introduce sophisticated IrRegular Convolutional Codes (IRCC) for improving the integrity of the iterative DL-SDMA system. In order to reduce the complexity of the iterative receivers, in Chapter 4 we will introduce a novel detection algorithm, which is referred to as the Irregular Generic Detection (IrGD) algorithm.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} method for fast {{analysis}} of signal and power integrity based on a recently developed multilayered finite difference method (M-FDM). In order to accurately model multilayered planar structures, which are three dimensional, M-FDM combines two-dimensional models for power/ground planes using a multilayered unit cell approach. In this way, noise coupling can be considered {{not only in the}} transversal direction between two planes, but also vertically from one plane pair to another through the apertures and via holes. For a co-simulation of signal and power <b>integrity,</b> <b>transmission</b> line models also need to be included. The interaction between the signal transmission and power distribution modes is taken into account using a modal decomposition technique.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study the design of {{closed-loop}} multiple antenna aided wireless communications relying on limited feedback. Multiple antennas may be employed either/both at the transmitter or/and at the receiver, here the latter periodically feeds back some information about the time-varying wireless channel using {{a limited number of}} bits. Furthermore, the transmitter then pre-processes the signals to be transmitted according to the received feedback information. This closed-loop multiple antenna aided communication scheme is capable of significantly improving the attainable system performance in terms of increasing the transmission rate or enhancing the <b>transmission</b> <b>integrity.</b> The goal of our research is the efficient acquisition and exploitation of the Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT), with the aid of different transmit preprocessing algorithms. The transmission schemes investigated in this thesis include the Transmit Matched Filter (TxMF), the Transmit Eigen-Beamformer (TxEBF), the linear Multi-User Transmitter (MUT) and a recently proposed MIMO scheme called Spatial Modulation (SM). The entire process of CSIT acquisition is investigated in this thesis, which includes pilot assisted CSI estimation, CSI quantisation at the receiver, as well as CSI reconstruction at the transmitter. A number of novel designs are proposed in order to increase the CSI acquisition efficiency. A range of different CSI quantisers are detailed in Chapter 2, and their performances are evaluated throughout Chapter 3 to Chapter 6. Moreover, a pilot overhead reduction scheme is proposed for pilot assisted CSI estimation in Chapter 3 for rapidly fading channels. A pilot symbol assisted rateless code is also proposed in Chapter 3, which exploits the available pilot symbols not only for channel estimation but also for channel decoding. Furthermore, an Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) Chart optimised Channel Impulse Response (CIR) Quantizer is proposed in Chapter 5, which assists the system in maintaining the lowest possible CSI feedback overhead, while ensuring that an open EXIT-tunnel is still attainable for the sake of achieving an infinitesimally low BER. A soft decoding assisted MIMO CIR recovery scheme is proposed in Chapter 5, which minimises the CIRs’ reconstruction error at the transmitter for noise contaminated feedback. Last but not least, a CSI feedback scheme using channel prediction and predictive vector quantization is also proposed in Chapter 5 for delayed feedback channels. Given feedback CSIT, a number of algorithms are proposed in order to efficiently exploit it. In Chapter 4 a novel Linear Dispersion Code (LDC) aided TxEBF scheme is proposed, which is capable of striking the required trade-off between the maximum attainable diversity gain and the capacity for an arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas. In the same chapter, an application example using a novel scheme referred to as a TxEBF aided video transmission scheme is proposed, where the encoded video source bits are transmitted through different eigen-beams according to their error sensitivity, so as to improve the decoded video quality at the receiver by employing unequal error protection. Moreover, a feedback-aided phase rotation and a feedback-aided power allocation scheme are proposed in Chapter 6,which achieves beneficial transmit diversity and enhances the robustness of a SM aided MIMO system. By examining the various schemes investigated throughout Chapter 3 to Chapter 6, our five-step guidelines conceived for the design of closed-loop MIMO systems using limited feedback are summarised as follows. The first step is to design appropriate transmit preprocessing schemes under the assumption of having perfect CSIT. Then, the second step is to determine the specific type of the required feedback information, whose entropy has to be as low as possible. Next we design an efficient quantiser based on the statistical properties of the required feedback information. The distortion metric of the quantiser may be the conventional MSE metric, but the employment of a direct data-link-performance related metric is preferable. Moreover, the fourth step is to improve the efficiency and robustness of the quantiser by employing conventional source compression. Finally, the fifth step is the joint optimisation of the data transmission link and the CSI feedback link based on the ultimate target performance metric. This thesis is concentrated on a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) cellular communication scenario using digitalized feedback information, where theMobile Terminals (MTs) estimate the Down-Link (DL) channel, quantise and feed back the required information to the Base Station (BS) using a bandwidth-limited feedback link, and the BS reconstructs the received CSI feedback information for the sake of throughput or integrity improving the DL transmission. Moreover, the wireless channels are assumed to be slow frequency-flat/narrow-band Rayleigh fading channels. They are mostly assumed to be spatially independent. The scenario of having spatial correlation and Line Of Sight (LOS) transmissions are also considered. Furthermore, both the achievable capacity and the BER performance are evaluated. Iterative decoding is employed in conjunction with channel coding in order to approach the achievable capacity and improve the BER performance. <br/...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research is to realize a 10 -Gb/sec serial data link over band-limited channels, such as backplanes, multi-mode fiber, and copper-based cables that were originally designed for data rates less than 1 Gb/sec. This is achieved using electrical equalization implemented in an integrated circuit (IC). To successfully compensate for various band-limited channels at the targeted data rate with a single equalizer IC, a reconfigurable equalizer topology is proposed. In order to realize the proposed goal, various channels are characterized of their forward transmission frequency response. Based on the measured channel data, system simulations are performed to identify the required specifications for IC implementation. This provides information such as optimal number of taps, fractionally-spaced tap delay, and tap coefficients for the proposed IC. With the obtained system requirements, IC building blocks are designed and fabricated in a 0. 18 - and # 956;m CMOS technology.

The use of high toughness pipeline materials with good post yield characteristics has enabled the application of limit load estimation techniques based on net section collapse criterion for the evaluation of corroded pipelines. [...] This thesis discusses the application of an improved lower bound limit load estimation technique that is based on variational concepts in plasticity, obtained by invoking the concept of integral mean of yield criterion {{as it relates to the}} integrity assessment of corroded pipelines. Decay lengths derived using classical shell theory have been used to define the kinematically active reference volume. The reference volume approach overcomes the limitations posed by most of the current evaluation procedures with respect to the effect of circumferential extent of corrosion. The limit pressure and the remaining strength factor of pipelines, with both external and internal corrosion sites, subjected to internal pressure loading have been estimated. The results obtained have been found to be in good agreement with three-dimensional inelastic finite element analysis. The results of this study has shown that the variational method provides an improved assessment of the effect of corrosion damage on the integrity of the pipeline in terms of remaining strength factor (RSF). This method has also yielded a better understanding of the behavior and consequence of damage than the ASME B 31 G criterion. An improved estimation of the limit pressures have been obtained in most cases...|$|R

Efficient and accurate transmission line models {{are required for}} analysis and synthesis of such interconnects. In this paper, we first present {{an efficient model for}} the far-end response of a single transmission line considering ramp input and capacitive loading. Our model divides the time axis into a number of regions according to the time of flight and the input rising time, and then approximates the far-end response by piecewise linear (PWL) waveform in each region. We name the resulting model as the PWL model. Experiments show that the waveform from the PWL model differs from the SPICE simulation result with the average voltage difference less than 0. 9 %, and the PWL model is at least 1000 faster than SPICE simulation. We further apply the PWL model to calculate the delay, rising time, and oscillation amplitude of the coplanar waveguide structure, and achieve less than 10 % average error compared to SPICE simulation. Combining the PWL model and decoupling technique, we analyze the far-end response of bus structures and obtain waveform almost perfectly matching the SPICE simulation result.

40|$|An Internet-based virtual {{private network}} uses the open, {{distributed}} infrastructure of the Internet to transmit data between corporate sites. VPNs using the Internet {{have the potential to}} solve many of the business networking problems. Virtual Private Networks provide an economical yet secure way to connect sites together and to provide network access to remote users. Virtual Private Networks provide attractive solution. A VPN uses the Internet infrastructure to interconnect sites and provide connectivity for remote dial-up users. The nearly universal coverage of the Internet eliminates the need for private leased lines and modem pools, and it eliminates long distance telephone charges remote, dial-up users. VPNs are less costly than conventional wide area networks. A VPN operates by passing data over the Internet or corporate intranet through “tunnels” which are secure, encrypted virtual connections that use the Internet (or corporate intranet) as the connection medium. The VPN establishes tunnels between servers in a site-to-site VPN, and between clients and servers in a client-to site VPN. The VPN encrypts and encapsulates each IP (or IPX) packet before passing it through a tunnel. The encapsulated packet includes authentication information to ensure the authenticity of the data and its source. The VPN also uses the authentication information to check that the original data has not been corrupted during <b>transmission,</b> ensuring the <b>integrity</b> of the data...|$|R
