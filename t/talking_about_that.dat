500|$|In January 2015, Michael Doran of Newsarama and Graeme McMillian of The Hollywood Reporter had a [...] "point-counterpoint" [...] {{debate in}} {{response}} to the first Ant-Man trailer. Doran stated, [...] "Marvel has raised the bar [...] high that as opposed to just allowing another film to finish under the [...] bar, we're all overly and perhaps even eager to overreact to the first thing that doesn't clear it". McMillian responded, [...] "at this point, Marvel's brand is such that I'm not sure it can offer up something like [...] it seeming like a crushing disappointment ... part of Marvel's brand is that it [...] offer the kind of run-of-the-mill superhero movie that you're <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> it's ... at least different enough to tweak and play with the genre somehow ... The fact that there's such upset about this trailer being ... well, okay ... suggests to me that the audience [...] expecting something to knock their socks off." [...] Doran concluded, [...] "That does seem to be the point here—the expectations fans now have for everything Marvel Studios ... Marvel [...] going to eventually falter." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to its {{tone and}} subject matter, it is {{considered}} one of the band's darker songs, alongside [...] "Adam's Song", their 2000 single revolving around suicide. Hoppus told an interviewer at the time of the album's release that [...] "There's always a song or two where we really try to really push ourselves [...] On this new record I think we've done a lot of different stuff that people wouldn't ever expect from us. [...] On the new one, it's 'Stay Together for the Kids.'" [...] DeLonge later confirmed he had received emails from fans thanking him for the song's message. [...] "With [...] "Stay Together", we get emails—just kid after kid after kid—saying, 'I know exactly what you're <b>talking</b> <b>about!</b> <b>That</b> song is about my life!'" [...] In 2002, divorce statistics were four times higher than their average just over thirty years prior, with over 50 percent of marriages ending in divorce. [...] "You look at statistics that 50 percent of parents get divorced, and you’re going to get a pretty large group of kids who are pissed off and who don’t agree with what their parents have done," [...] said DeLonge. [...] "Stay Together" [...] was the final song completed during the recording sessions; it was created one day before the album was handed off to the mixing engineer.|$|E

500|$|The next day, Davidson found Haywood in his office, {{playing the}} {{keyboard}} part which was later revived for the song's riff. [...] "When we got {{done with the}} other song, I kept going back, saying, 'Man, there's something about what you were playing earlier ... let's mess with that before we leave.' So he started playing it again," [...] Davidson recalled. After the keyboard elements were completed, Scott and Kelley finished the song's music and lyrics at the studio. They discussed ideas for the song; Kelley put forward the basic melody and Scott followed up with her own contribution. After they wrote the lyrics, Davidson proposed that the song's title be [...] "Just a Kiss Goodnight". It was later changed to [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] after Scott felt that [...] "it's cool to have 'just a kiss' goodnight rather than going all the way." [...] Kelley told Country Weekly that the song {{was inspired by the}} band members' experiences: [...] "I remembered being out the first night with Cassie and thinking, 'This is different, and I don't want to give any wrong impression. I [...] don't want to make the wrong move because this feels like something [...] special.' We started <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and going back and forth with [...] different experiences when we wrote the song." [...] The song was recorded and mixed by Clarke Schleicher, with assistance from Joe Martino and Andrew Bazinet. The B-side track, [...] "Bottle Up Lightning", was written by Kelley, Haywood, Tony Martin and Wendell Lee Mobley.|$|E

2500|$|I wasn’t so {{interested}} in macro, but what struck me, and this is related to some of my later work, was the assumption that [...] made to solve for equilibrium, that the state variables were obvious.... Bob and I had some long discussions, and I would say, “Well Bob, why is this the actual state space in this model?” [...] That question came up ... after I came to Penn. [...] At some point Karl [...] and I started <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and we developed what we called the idea of sunspots.|$|E

2500|$|During a 2004 {{interview}} with Adrian Pannett for Comes with a Smile magazine, {{when asked how}} important faith was to his music, he responded, [...] "I don't like <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> stuff in the public forum because, I think, certain themes and convictions are meant for personal conversation." [...] In a 2006 interview, he said, [...] "It’s {{not so much that}} faith influences us as it lives in us. In every circumstance (giving a speech or tying my shoes), I am living and moving and being." [...] In a 2010 interview, Stevens acknowledged that he is a Christian.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{shooting}} of Help!, a piano was placed {{on one of the}} stages where filming was being conducted and McCartney took advantage of this opportunity to tinker with the song. Richard Lester, the director, was eventually greatly annoyed by this and lost his temper, telling McCartney to finish writing the song or he would have the piano removed. The patience of the other Beatles was also tested by McCartney's work in progress, George Harrison summed this up when he said: [...] "Blimey, he's always <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> song. You'd think he was Beethoven or somebody!" ...|$|E

[...] After Volkova had her second surgery for her ligaments, she officially confirmed that she and Katina are planning to reunite t.A.T.u. However, soon Volkova told an interviewer {{that they are not}} reuniting after all. Katina also stated that her solo career is the number one goal right now and that if t.A.T.u. is going to reunite, it would only be for small things like commercials and concerts.|$|E

[...] Davy was present when Harry received his Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan and also attended Prince Harry's graduation ceremony when he received his flying wings from his father. In early 2009, it was reported that the pair had parted ways after knowing each other for five years.|$|E

2500|$|As the taped {{conversation}} continued, {{the jury}} heard Saldívar's {{reaction to the}} news of Selena's death after her phone picked up a local radio station's signal. In an angry voice, Saldívar asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> when I took it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the door. I said 'Selena, close that door,' and when I did that gun went off." ...|$|E
