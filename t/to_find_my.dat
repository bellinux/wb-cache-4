But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E

I already knew that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi to give us the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E

So it crossed my mind to write a cautionary tale about Bond, to put the record straight in the minds particularly of younger readers... the experiment has obviously gone very much awry".|$|E

The CD release of the track included the B-side recording [...] "Trying <b>to</b> <b>Find</b> <b>My</b> Way". Musically, [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up" [...] is an R and pop song whose lyrics delve on themes of love and relationships, a common trait on its parent album.|$|E
500|$|Leto {{was largely}} an {{autodidact}} on drums; [...] "I've always wanted <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> {{way of doing}} things," [...] he explained, [...] "Discovering what I can contribute with my own voice. There were so many styles that I was into at a young age. I didn't want to get locked into just one thing." [...] During his youth, Leto had been a devoted fan of progressive rock and blues music, listening to artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Boz Scaggs. He is inspired by electronic music, including Depeche Mode and The Cure. His major influences also include jazz band Steely Dan, as well as heavy metal groups Mountain, Iron Maiden and Kiss. According to Leto, these artists were commercially viable but also respected for their statements and contributions. He explained that he [...] "never focused on the drummers," [...] saying that he felt more connected to music than a particular drummer.|$|E

[...] He drew his {{inspiration}} from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, and through the Zelda titles he always tries to impart to players some of the sense of exploration and limitless wonder he felt. [...] "When I was a child," [...] he said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] The memory of being lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family's home in Sonobe was recreated in Zeldas labyrinth dungeons.|$|E

Sacks (1985) described a patient who fell out of bed after pushing out what he perceived to be the severed leg of a cadaver that the staff had hidden under his blanket. Patients may say things like, [...] "I don't know whose hand that is, but they'd better get my ring off!" [...] or, [...] "This is a fake arm someone put on me.

Ophélie says Hamlet no longer loves her and begs permission to leave the court. [...] In the Queen's arioso, {{one of the finest}} numbers in the score, she rejects Ophélie's request, saying that the barrier between Ophélie and Hamlet comes from another source (The Queen: Dans sons regards plus sombre [...] "In his sombre expression"). She argues that Ophélie's presence may help cure Hamlet of his madness. Ophélie says she shall obey and leaves.|$|E

Mitchell had auditioned in Albury in April, aged 16, and moved through the selection process to the final six before being eliminated in mid-October. In June 2009 Mitchell reflected on her time on Australian Idol: [...] "I was uncomfortable with elements of the show and unhappy about the compromises sometimes. I didn’t know what I wanted with music but I did know that I loved it. I think {{that was what the}} experience cemented. It’s taken me a long time <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> own way.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2005 the Chicago Cubs signed Williamson to a minor league {{contract}} and added him to their 40-man roster, but he almost immediately went on the 60-day disabled list: in the end Williamson had undergone the second Tommy John surgery and was not yet recovered. Williamson returned to the team in August but struggled with his velocity. Sportswriters wondered at the wisdom of coming back in less than 12 months {{without the benefit of}} spring training. Williamson himself said that he was [...] "trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> rhythm and it's hard to do that at the big-league level." [...] Williamson eventually appeared in 17 games; his ERA, 8.68 in the beginning of September, dropped to 5.65 {{by the end of the}} season. Showing its confidence in Williamson, Chicago exercised its option to bring him back for another season.|$|E
2500|$|Amid {{the sudden}} {{cancellation}} of her UPN sitcom Moesha, Norwood suffered {{a nervous breakdown}} in November 1999 — the result of her then-hectic and unhealthy lifestyle and a failed relationship {{in which she had}} experienced verbal abuse. Frightened by the idea that a yet-to-be-made third album she {{would not be able to}} live up to the success of her previous albums, Norwood went on a lengthy hiatus to reflect and take some introspective looks. [...] "I needed to rejuvenate, get my creative juices flowing, balance my life with some privacy, <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> confidence, find my love of music again," [...] she told Jet magazine in 2002. In mid-2000, she started refocused herself on her musical career, contributing songs to albums such as Urban Renewal (2001) and the Osmosis Jones soundtrack (2001), which introduced a scratchy, evocative edge to Norwood's voice, now having a deeper and warmer tone with a textured lower register and notably stronger falsetto.|$|E

To do that, you will need people at the top, decision-makers who have got foresight, good minds, who are open to ideas, who can seize opportunities like we did... My job really was <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> successors. I found them, they are there; their job is to find their successors.

2500|$|Safina {{was born}} in Moscow, Russia to Tatar parents. Her mother, Rauza Islanova, was her trainer when she was younger; while her father is {{director}} of the Spartak tennis club in Moscow. Her brother Marat is a former world No. 1 on the ATP Tour. Speaking of growing up in such a successful tennis family, Safina stated: [...] "Being the little sister in such a big tennis family is not an easy situation. Maybe that's why it took me longer to develop. My father is very competitive, but my parents didn't put pressure on me. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> identity. I wanted to be something by myself, like being a big player by myself. So at the beginning I was putting too much pressure on myself. But then gradually I found myself, and I learned how to do better with that situation." [...] At age 8, Safina and her family moved to Valencia, Spain, and as a result Safina speaks fluent Spanish as well as Russian and English.|$|E
