Those shares can then be purchased and owned {{by more than one}} individual. The reasons for a [...] "mezzanine structure" [...] can vary.

40|$|The limited {{liability}} company is the most using form of company in the Czech Republic. The <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the {{limited liability}} company {{is the most important}} instrument of the company. The member of the {{limited liability company}} participates on a business of the company through the share. If the company is successful in business, the member can obtain not little amount of money from the <b>share</b> <b>of</b> a profit. That's why the <b>shares</b> are object <b>of</b> the business interests of natural persons and legal entities. This work is devoted to a contract for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>share</b> in the limited liability company and a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>share</b> in the limited liability company.

[...] However the commencement of winding up is deemed to relate back to the time when the petition was presented.

2500|$|While {{derivative}} claims mean suing in the company's name, {{a minority}} shareholder can sue {{in her own}} name in four ways. The first is to claim a [...] "personal right" [...] under the constitution or the general law is breached. If a shareholder brings a personal action to vindicate a personal right (such {{as the right to}} not be misled by company circulars) the principle against double recovery dictates that one cannot sue for damages if the loss an individual shareholder suffers is merely the same as will be reflected in the reduction of the share value. For losses reflective of the company's, only a derivative claim may be brought. The second is to show that a company's articles were amended in an objectively unjustifiably and directly discriminatory fashion. This residual protection for minorities was developed by the Court of Appeal in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd, where Sir Nathaniel Lindley MR held that shareholders may amend a constitution by the required majority so long as it is [...] "bona fide {{for the benefit of the}} company as a whole." [...] This constraint is not heavy, as it can mean that a constitutional amendment, while applying in a formally equal way to all shareholders, has a negative and disparate impact on only one shareholder. This was so in Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd, where the articles were changed to remove all shareholders' pre-emption rights, but only one shareholder (the claimant, Mr Greenhalgh, who lost) was interested in preventing share sales to outside parties. This slim set of protections for minority shareholders was, until 1985, complemented only by a third, and drastic right of a shareholder, now under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 122(1)(g), to show it is [...] "just and equitable" [...] for a company to be liquidated. In Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd, Lord Wilberforce held that a court would use its discretion to wind up a company if three criteria were fulfilled: that the company was a small [...] "quasi-partnership" [...] founded on mutual confidence of the corporators, that shareholders participate in the business, and there are restrictions in the constitution on free <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares.</b> Given these features, it may be just and equitable to wind up a company if the court sees an agreement just short of a contract, or some other [...] "equitable consideration", that one party has not fulfilled. So where Mr Ebrahmi, a minority shareholder, had been removed from the board, and the other two directors paid all company profits out as director salaries, rather than dividends to exclude him, the House of Lords regarded it as equitable to liquidate the company and distribute his share of the sale proceeds to Mr Ebrahimi.|$|E
