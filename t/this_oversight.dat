5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} an early start, it took all morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames <b>this</b> <b>oversight</b> on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
5|$|More specifically, for example, Nancy Folbre {{examines}} {{the role of}} children as public goods and how the non-market labor of parents contributes {{to the development of}} human capital as a public service. In this sense, children are positive externality which is under-invested according to traditional analysis. Folbre indicates that <b>this</b> <b>oversight</b> partially results from failing to properly examine non-market activities.|$|E
5|$|A small {{ministry}} of defence (which was renamed the Ministry of Defence and Security in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered <b>this</b> <b>oversight</b> largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited {{the extent to which the}} ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E

25|$|In later years, <b>this</b> <b>oversight</b> {{role was}} vested in the Native Land Court under the Native Land Court Act of 1862, and later renamed the Māori Land Court. It was through this court that much Māori land was alienated, {{and the way}} in which it functioned is much criticised today. Over the longer term, the land {{purchase}} aspect of the Treaty declined in importance, while the clauses of the Treaty which deal with sovereignty and Māori rights took on greater importance.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{the wrong}} lineup: This very rare bench minor penalty is called when the {{offending}} team fails {{to put the}} starting lineup on the ice {{at the beginning of}} the game. For this penalty to be called, the captain of the non-offending team must bring this breach of the rules to the referee's attention immediately at the first stoppage of play. Also the penalty may be given if a player is not put on the scoresheet {{at the beginning of the}} game and plays. The only way for this to be called is if the official scorer notifies the referee of <b>this</b> <b>oversight.</b>|$|E
25|$|For major mining {{companies}} and any company seeking international financing, {{there are a}} number of other mechanisms to enforce good environmental standards. These generally relate to financing standards such as the Equator Principles, IFC environmental standards, and criteria for Socially responsible investing. Mining companies have used <b>this</b> <b>oversight</b> from the financial sector to argue for some level of industry self-regulation. In 1992, a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the Rio Earth Summit by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations (UNCTC), but the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) together with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) argued successfully for self-regulation instead.|$|E

25|$|The Acting Governor {{soon found}} {{himself with a}} major problem. Under {{territorial}} law at the time, the legislature was empowered to apportion itself. In practice the apportionment had been delegated to the governor. In January 1869, Judge Henry T. Backus issued a ruling that this arrangement was unconstitutional. As a result, {{the legality of the}} territorial government was thrown into question, and some residents refused to pay their taxes. Carter called for the United States Congress, in its supervisory capacity, to pass legislation correcting the issue. While the needed legislation was passed, it did not come until after Carter left office. In the meantime, the Acting Governor failed to call for a meeting of the territorial legislature in 1869. <b>This</b> <b>oversight</b> may have been partially due to Carter experiencing another bout of health problems. He did commute the death sentence of Delore Moore who had been convicted of killing her husband.|$|E
500|$|Unlike silent-era sex {{and crime}} pictures, silent horror movies, despite being {{produced}} in the hundreds, were never a major concern for censors or civic leaders. When sound horror films were released however, they quickly caused controversy. Sound provided [...] "atmospheric music and sound effects, creepy-voiced macabre dialogue and a liberal dose of blood-curdling screams" [...] which intensified its effects on audiences, and consequently on moral crusaders. The Hays Code did not mention gruesomeness, and filmmakers took advantage of <b>this</b> <b>oversight.</b> However, state boards usually had no set guidelines and could object to any material they found indecent. Although films such as Frankenstein and Freaks caused controversy when they were released, they had already been re-cut to comply with censors.|$|E
500|$|Since his death, Paraná {{has been}} widely praised by historians and others for his {{political}} achievements, although the detrimental consequences of the electoral reform in his Conciliation cabinet were generally ignored by historians until recently. <b>This</b> <b>oversight</b> {{can be seen in}} the writings of many renowned writers and historians since the 19th-century cabinet. Conservative politician and writer José de Alencar called Paraná a [...] "distinguished statesman". Writer Joaquim Manuel de Macedo said that [...] "the marquis of Paraná was a politician well suited to the great State crises, and to a time of most difficult and contentious political strife." [...] Joaquim Nabuco, who viewed him a statesman, summarized his character as that of a man [...] "made not only to dominate, but also to lead." [...] José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco regarded him an [...] "illustrious statesman". Euclides da Cunha, who also called him a statesman, labeled him a [...] "great man" [...] who [...] "demarcates a decisive stretch in our [...] Constitutional History".|$|E

500|$|The Germans inflicted {{more damage}} on the RAF than the Luftwaffe received, but its {{influence}} on both sides' future strategy was profound. The battle forced the RAF to abandon daylight missions in favour of night bombing as casualties were too high. In the build-up to the war, the RAF had adopted the mantra that [...] "the bomber will always get through"; but in daylight the Heligoland battle had shown {{this was not the}} case and it forced a reappraisal of future bombing operations. The failure of the raid led the Luftwaffe to believe its base in Germany proper was invulnerable to enemy attack. This belief was reinforced with the Wehrmacht's success in 1939–1941, which meant that opposing air forces were then too far away for effective bombing attacks on the German homeland. Neglecting their day fighter force had serious strategic consequences in later years. By the time the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL; Luftwaffe High Command) had begun organising an air defence to combat the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) strategic bombing campaign, they were already engaged in a war of attrition for which they were not prepared. <b>This</b> <b>oversight</b> was one of the contributing factors in the defeat of the Luftwaffe in the Defence of the Reich campaign. The German official history called the battle [...] "amongst the most important actions of the entire war".|$|E

[...] However, the speaker fundamentally breaks the Third Commandment by taking the name of the Lord in vain; [...] "unorthodox monotheism is in Christian terms blasphemous."

2500|$|Despite {{mounting}} {{evidence to the}} contrary, bottom-up control remains the central dogma determining marsh management, conservation and restoration efforts. Salt marshes are currently managed {{as if they are}} exclusively regulated by physical factors. However, global and near shore top predator depletion leading to the release of cryptic or unappreciated herbivores may be the biggest current threat to salt marshes. Theory dependency (subconscious favoring of identifying and/or examining natural phenomena that tend to confirm rather than refute the current paradigm of a study system [...] ) and demonstration, rather than falsifying science, have been the leading culprits in <b>this</b> <b>oversight.</b> Consequently, threats to salt marshes that are governed by top down control are being overlooked, with potentially devastating consequences.|$|E

Congressional oversight {{of homeland security}} constantly receives harsh criticism from scholars and the media for being disjointed and overbearing. Critics often cite the numerous committees and members of Congress that have jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security.

This thesis conducts a historical case study analysis to demonstrate that congressional oversight of homeland security is rigorous, systematic, and effective.
