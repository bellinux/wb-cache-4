5|$|In the {{previous}} year, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center {{found out that}} 56% of Russians felt pride and admiration at the anthem, even though only 40% (up from 19% in 2004) knew <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of the anthem. It was also noted in the survey that the younger generation was the most familiar with the words.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E

5000|$|In some modern European languages, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word</b> in a {{sentence}} is capitalized, as is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word</b> in any quoted sentence.

25|$|The {{complete}} text comprises fifteen stanzas. The anthem is an acrostic: {{the first}} {{letters of the}} fifteen stanzas formed the name 'Willem van Nassov' (Nassov was a contemporary orthographic variant of Nassau).

25|$|On {{the episode}} {{broadcast}} on Monday, August 30, 2010, {{it was revealed}} that Nancy had died in her sleep; the next day's episode dealt with Nancy's memorial service. Nancy Hughes's memorial aired just two weeks before the series finale. The show's producers stated in interviews that they had to revise their plans for the final episode because of Wagner's death – they had hoped that Wagner would say the final lines of the last episode just as she had said <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of the first episode.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word</b> of <b>the</b> {{phrase is}} not a verb, then the verb is in the indicative. However, if <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word</b> is a verb, then {{sometimes}} the verb is in another form.|$|R

25|$|The {{couple had}} three {{children}} within the first three years: Vivien Brynhilda Carloine Foley (b. July 1895 – 1978), Arthur Percival Foley (b. 27 September 1897) and a second daughter, Nesta Foley (1900–1973). Unlike most parents of the Victorian era, the parents of Rhys-Davids {{spent a great deal}} of their time with their children, although they employed a child minder named Minna, a German woman. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of Arthur and his sister were German and the children often used German phrases. Nevertheless, Rhys-Davids's parents continued to be busy academics. In 1905 his father became a professor at the University of Manchester. His mother became a prolific author.|$|E

500|$|The final {{movement}} of the Gloria is a chorus on the words [...] "Cum Sancto Spiritu in Gloria Dei Patris." [...] (With the Holy Spirit in the Glory of God.) Amen". They are presented first as {{in the beginning of}} the Gloria, returning to the initial key. Then, marked Allegro a capella, they are expanded to long fugue with a display of counterpoint. Shortly before the end, the opening of the Gloria is repeated on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words,</b> unifying the movement further.|$|E
5000|$|If an irregularly-apocopated {{word with}} a {{stressed}} second-last syllable is placed before {{a word with}} stress on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> syllable, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word</b> loses its stress. If the second word does not have stress on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> syllable, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word</b> keeps <b>the</b> stressed syllable.|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that the}} proper {{terminology}} for this occurrence includes the letter 'd' {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word,</b> hence [...] "doubled die". The term [...] "double die" [...] without <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word</b> ending in 'd' is not proper numismatic terminology.|$|R

500|$|As he {{had with}} [...] "Something", Harrison {{composed}} the melody on a piano, part-way through a recording session – in this case, while working on his first post-Beatles solo album, All Things Must Pass (1970). As reproduced in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison's original lyrics carried the title [...] "WHENEVER (by Shirley Bassey)". He recalls in the book: [...] "I got the chord sequence, and 'When every song is sung' were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> {{to come out of}} my mouth, and it developed from there." ...|$|E
500|$|The second stanza, Aria Duetto, is a duet of soprano and alto, [...] "" [...] (No {{one could}} defeat death), over an ostinato continuo. It deals with [...] "humanity {{helpless}} and paralysed as it awaits God's judgement against sin". Bach has the music almost freeze on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> [...] "" [...] (death), {{and the word}} [...] "" [...] (imprisoned) {{is marked by a}} sharp dissonance of the soprano and alto. In the Halleluja, the voices imitate each other on long notes in fast succession, creating a sequence of suspensions.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{attestation}} to the oneness of God, {{the belief}} in Muhammad's prophethood is the main aspect of the Islamic faith. Every Muslim proclaims in Shahadah: [...] "I testify {{that there is no}} god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is a Messenger of God." [...] The Shahadah is the basic creed or tenet of Islam. Islamic belief is that ideally the Shahadah is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> a newborn will hear; children are taught it immediately and it will be recited upon death. Muslims repeat the shahadah in the call to prayer (adhan) and the prayer itself. Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed.|$|E
50|$|Emet Vayatziv is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> paragraph. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> emet (truth) is {{appended}} {{onto the}} Shema, and vayatziv appears as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{mutations}} are limited.

500|$|Black took an absolutist {{approach}} to First Amendment jurisprudence, believing <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of the Amendment that said [...] "Congress shall make no law..." [...] Black rejected {{the creation of}} judicial tests for free speech standards, such as the tests for [...] "clear and present danger", [...] "bad tendency", [...] "gravity of the evil," [...] "reasonableness," [...] or [...] "balancing." [...] Black would write that the First Amendment is [...] "wholly 'beyond the reach' of federal power to abridge... I {{do not believe that}} any federal agencies, including Congress and the Court, have power or authority to subordinate speech and press to what they think are 'more important interests.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In many {{of these}} {{settings}} a single verse of the Magnificat can be sung {{by one or more}} soloists alternating with choral singing, as Bach does in his treatment of the third Magnificat verse: the soprano sings <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of the verse, while the chorus concludes it. This particular split of the third verse, leaving only the last two words (omnes generationes) to the chorus, had been practised before by Ruggiero Fedeli, and in a Magnificat in G minor from 1720 which Bach probably knew (that Magnificat in G minor used to be attributed to Tomaso Albinoni). Also Graupner's 1722 Magnificat [...] had this split.|$|E
500|$|... "Al Aaraaf", which Poe {{claimed to}} have written before he was 15, was first {{published}} as the major poem in Poe's 1829 collection Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems. The book and [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] in particular received mostly negative reviews for its complexity, obscure references, and odd structure. Some, however, noted the potential in the young poet, including John C. Neal, to whom Poe had shown [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] prior to publication. Poe would later refer to Neal's response as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of encouragement he had received. Nevertheless, the negative response to [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] may have inspired Poe's later poetic theory that poems should be kept short.|$|E
50|$|Many Ocean County {{residents}} commonly {{refer to}} all of Lacey Township as Forked River with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word</b> pronounced with two syllables (FOR-ked or FORK-ed).

2500|$|Iẓāfat is a syntactical {{construction}} of two nouns, where <b>the</b> <b>first</b> component is a determined noun, {{and the second}} is a determiner. This construction was borrowed from Persian. A short vowel [...] "i" [...] is used to connect these two words. It may be written as zer (...) at the end of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word,</b> but usually is not written at all. If <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word</b> ends in choṭī he (...) or ye (...) then hamzā (...) is used above the last letter ( [...] or [...] ). If <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>word</b> ends in a long vowel then baṛī ye (...) with hamzā on top (...) is written.|$|R
500|$|Paolini said [...] "Brisingr" [...] {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> {{he thought}} of for the book's title, {{as it was the}} first Ancient Language word that Eragon learned in the series, and it holds a {{particular}} significance for him. Unlike the first two books in the series, Brisingr has a subtitle: The Seven Promises of Eragon Shadeslayer and Saphira Bjartskular. Paolini revealed it in a newsletter at his official website, in which he said that it was added [...] "because I felt it suited the story, and also because, in a way, I still view Brisingr and Book Four as two halves of the same volume; the subtitle is merely the name of the first of these two sections." ...|$|E
500|$|Another feature gifted to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen, {{following}} its inauguration in July 1999, is the parliamentary mace.

500|$|In January 2010, Karen Geurtsen, a Dutch {{journalist}} {{from the}} magazine HP-De Tijd, revealed a painful breach of security.

[...] "I could have killed him", were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>words</b> of the article that she published about this operation.

In July 2010, after Wilders complained that his security was inadequate, the Special Security Assignments Brigade, a special unit of Dutch military police, made four attempts to smuggle a firearm into the heavily guarded offices of Wilders' Freedom Party, two of which were successful. Following these breaches, security at the offices was increased.|$|E
