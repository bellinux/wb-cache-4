5|$|The State Bank was {{not sure}} how much it {{actually}} lost from the robbery, but the best estimates were around 341,000 rubles, worth around 3.4million US dollars as of 2008.

5|$|A {{junior and}} infant {{department}} opened in September 1997 after {{the closure of}} St Audrey's Convent school. St Audrey's was a feeder school, and its closure allowed the then headmaster, Robert Repper, to transfer most of the teaching staff to the new junior school. The junior and infant school {{has now become a}} preparatory school for the senior school. It was retitled as Magdalene House in 2005, a reference to a 17th-century scholarship which allowed two Wisbech Grammar School pupils to study at Magdalene College, Cambridge.

Seven of these cities are in Asia, <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> Europe. In addition, Braathens served numerous destinations as both a regular and an ad-hoc charter airline.

Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively.

5|$|Dennis claimed {{at least}} 88 lives: 56 in Haiti, 16 in Cuba, 15 in the U.S. and 1 in Jamaica. Total damages are {{estimated}} at US$4–6billion, including $2.23billion in the United States and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> the Caribbean. Dennis was most damaging to Cuba, where the storm wiped out {{a significant portion}} of the citrus crop. As the storm struck near the end of Cuba's dry season, farmers were not yet prepared for the heavy rainfall brought by the storm. In the United States, Dennis drew comparison with Hurricane Ivan of the previous year, but it was both smaller and weaker than Ivan at landfall and caused significantly fewer damages, partly because the region had not yet fully rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{the site}} and its {{outstanding}} debt of £70million were bought from the Bank of America by Hong Kong-based development company, Parkview International, for £10million. Following resolution of creditors' claims, it acquired the freehold title in May 1996. In November 1996 plans for the redevelopment of the site were submitted and outline consent was received in May 1997. Detailed consent {{for much of the}} site was granted in August 2000, and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> May 2001. The company received full possession of the site in 2003. Having purchased the site, Parkview started work on a £1.1billion project to restore the building and to redevelop the site into a retail, housing and leisure complex.|$|E

The largest numbers of foreign visitors come from Hungary, Italy, Germany, the United States, France, and Austria.

Lewis Hamilton, who was fastest in all three sessions, capitalized on his teammate's problem and took pole position by over half a second. It was his 39th pole position and his 4th at Albert Park. The {{rest of the field}} was more than a second behind Hamilton's time, with Felipe Massa in the Williams best of <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> third position. The two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen proved their regained competitiveness by taking fourth and fifth on the grid respectively.|$|E
5|$|On the book's publication, Waugh's friends praised it, but {{its general}} {{critical}} reception was muted. Most reviewers admired the self-portrait of Waugh {{with which the}} novel opens, but expressed divided views about <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> <b>in</b> particular the ending. Commentators have debated whether the novel provides a real-life depiction of Waugh, or if it represents the exaggerated persona that he cultivated {{as a means of}} preserving his privacy. The book has been dramatised for radio and as a stage play.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of students in upper secondary schools are women, although men represent the majority in higher education institutions. In addition, most young Faroese people who relocate to other countries to study are women. Out of 8,535 holders of bachelor degrees, 4,796 (56.2%) have had their education in the Faroe Islands, 2,724 (31.9%) in Denmark, 543 in both the Faroe Islands and Denmark, 94 (1.1%) in Norway 80 in the United Kingdom and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> other countries.

5|$|Breckinridge rode into Abbeville, South Carolina on {{the morning}} of April 28. While there, Breckinridge and Brigadier General Basil W. Duke finally {{convinced}} Davis that further prosecution of the war was hopeless. Breckinridge was put in charge of the $150,000 in gold specie remaining in the Confederate treasury; traveling southward by rail toward Washington, Georgia, a group of soldiers in his military escort – unpaid for months – threatened to divide the gold among themselves before it could be captured by federal troops. Breckinridge convinced them to abandon their scheme after paying them their wages from the treasury, but some of them refused to escort Breckinridge and the bullion any further. Breckinridge's party arrived in Washington on May 4 and, after paying out several requisitions from the treasury, deposited <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> banks there. He also composed a letter to his remaining deputies in which he disbanded the War Department.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Jardine {{achieved}} his highest {{average in}} a season, scoring 1,002 runs and averaging 91.09 {{in a very}} wet summer which led to difficult wickets to bat on. Wisden named {{him as one of}} its Cricketers of the Year, commenting that he had improved his style and footwork. That season, he only played 11 matches due to work commitments as a clerk with Barings Bank, for whom he had worked since qualifying as a solicitor. Despite his lack of practice, he scored hundreds in his first three matches and came top of the Surrey batting averages. He scored a century in the Gentlemen v Players match, which impressed influential observers at Lord's, and represented England in a trial match against <b>The</b> <b>Rest.</b> <b>In</b> this latter match, when Percy Chapman withdrew at the last minute, Jardine took over the captaincy, earning praise in the press for his performance. By this stage, he was considered a certainty to tour Australia the following winter.|$|E
