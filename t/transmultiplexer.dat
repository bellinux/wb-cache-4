First, a multirate state-space representation is introduced for the <b>transmultiplexer</b> with {{the consideration of}} channel dispersion.

In order to design an efficient separating filterbank for <b>transmultiplexer</b> system with uncertain input signal and additive noise, the filter is employed for robust signal reconstruction. The 2 filter design {{is considered to be a}} suboptimal approach to achieve the optimal signal reconstruction in <b>transmultiplexer</b> system under unitary noise power. Finally, a mixed 2 filter is proposed to achieve a better signal reconstruction performance in <b>transmultiplexer</b> systems. These design problems can be transformed to solving the eigenvalue problems (EVP) under some linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraint.

The problem of channel distortion is alleviated by passing the received composite signal through a channel compensation filter or equalizer.
