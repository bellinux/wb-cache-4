Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E
5|$|Frank Stilwell {{had just}} arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup. Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing,</b> Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several {{witnesses}} who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence {{just as he had}} done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> in late July, {{prosecutors}} presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors {{at both of}} his homes, {{indicating that}} Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house {{and spent most of}} his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a U.S. Postal Service inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan applications that indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible bias of the witnesses against him.|$|E

5|$|Earp improbably testified during <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> {{after the}} gunfight at the O.K. Corral {{that he and}} Behan had made a deal. If Earp withdrew his {{application}} to the legislature, Behan agreed to appoint Earp as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but did not keep {{his end of the}} bargain, and instead chose Harry Woods, a prominent Democrat, as undersheriff. Behan testified at first that he had not made any deal with Earp, although he later admitted he had lied. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> {{began on}} March 13, 1951, and lasted three days, {{during which the}} Crown called 20witnesses. Diefenbaker alleged that {{the rules of the}} CNR did not require that the {{telegraph}} operator listen to the repeat of his message, but merely recommended that he should. Nevertheless, Diefenbaker's motion to dismiss was unsuccessful and Atherton was committed for trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia (a trial-level court). Manslaughter was a charge for which the accused did not have the option of a speedy trial before a county court judge, and Atherton's case was set for the Spring Assizes in Prince George.|$|E
5|$|While Ike Clanton {{later said}} he was {{planning}} to leave town, Frank McLaury reported that he had decided to remain behind to take care of some business. Will McLaury, Tom and Frank's brother and a judge in Fort Worth, Texas, claimed in a letter he wrote during <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> after the shootout that Tom and Frank were still armed because they were planning to conduct business before leaving town to visit him in Texas. He wrote that Billy Clanton, who had arrived on horseback with Frank, intended to go with the McLaurys to Fort Worth. Will McLaury came to Tombstone after the gun fight and joined the prosecution team in an attempt to convict the Earps and Holliday for his brothers' murder. Paul Johnson told a different story, that the McLaurys were about to leave for Iowa to attend the wedding of their sister, Sarah Caroline, in Iowa. Tom and Frank were especially close to Sarah, one of their 14 siblings and half-siblings. Caroline married James Reed in Richland, Iowa at the end of November that year.|$|E

5000|$|On 6 February 1973 (one source purports {{the hearing}} {{was to take}} place on the 26 February 1973), [...] Sarah Bad Heart Bull and Robert High Eagle left their homes in Hot Springs, South Dakota and drove to Custer, taking with them Trina Bad Heart Bull, Eddy Clifford and Francis Means, all of whom were present in Buffalo Gap the night Wesley Bad Heart Bull was murdered, in order to attend <b>the</b> Schmitz <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> and to give {{statements}} to the Custer County State's Attorney, Hobart H.

However, the authorities had already made preparations, aided by natural occurrences, by the time AIM members arrived in Custer. There was a heavy snowstorm around Custer prior to the protest, to attend <b>the</b> Schmitz <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing.</b> First, an anonymous caller contacted the Rapid City Journal to announce that the demonstration had been canceled, [...] "leading" [...] journalist Lyn Gladstone to incorrectly report that there was no rally being held, causing a much lower turnout. Second, The Custer County authorities postponed <b>the</b> Schmitz <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> in anticipation of a caravan of American Indian Movement members who would be arriving in Custer on that 6 February 1973. There were also other [...] "security measures" [...] which were instituted on behalf of the Schmitz hearing. While the state attorney was present in the clerk of courts' office to meet with any individual who contested his handling of the Schmitz case, no more than 4-5 people were allowed entrance into the courthouse to discuss the matter simultaneously. Guards had been stationed at all exterior doors of the courthouse to screen all persons who wished to enter the courthouse, and various law enforcement officers, such as the State Highway Motor Patrol, were put on stand by in the event of trouble.|$|R

50|$|Since Lay Judges are not jurors, they {{cannot be}} excused, {{unless there are}} grounds that would justify an {{objection}} to a Judge. Also, they are not sequestered, because a trial often lasts too long to restrict travel: an Italian trial, including <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> investigations, <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing,</b> trial and appeals, can last several years. To keep a citizen â who continues to work, while serving as a Popular Judge â sequestered for years would be unfeasible.|$|R
50|$|In the {{canonical}} gospels, Pilate's court {{refers to the}} trial of Jesus in praetorium before Pontius Pilate, preceded by <b>the</b> Sanhedrin <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing.</b> In <b>the</b> Gospel of Luke, Pilate finds that Jesus, being from Galilee, belonged to Herod Antipas' jurisdiction, and so he decides to send Jesus to Herod. After questioning Jesus and receiving very few replies, Herod sees Jesus as no threat and returns him to Pilate. Fearing defilement, the Jews did not enter the court, and Pilate's discussion with them occurred outside the praetorium.|$|R

25|$|Four {{days after}} his formal plea before Judge Leetham, Vernon Butts {{committed}} suicide by hanging himself with a towel in his cell.

25|$|One {{of the six}} {{remaining}} accused {{requested a}} jury trial. This move leads to some interesting legal complications. All the remaining accused would now have to be tried by jury as a group. The case was assigned to Arkhangelsk Oblast Court (Arkhangelsk {{is a place of}} residence for Arctic Sea crew) and <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> was due to take place on 16 December 2010. As well, according to Russian law, earlier testimonies given by Savins et al. as part of a plea bargain are not admissible in jury trial.|$|E
25|$|The {{officials}} {{separated the}} men and acted {{to protect them from}} mob violence by taking them to other jails outside Henry County. <b>The</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> occurred about a month later, and the grand jury two months after that. A grand jury (which included both black and white members) indicted all the men. Their quick arrest assured the community that stability was being preserved. Authorities showed increased professional conduct and procedures since the controversial arrest and execution of Odell Waller during World War II (he was initially represented at trial by the Trotskyite Revolutionary Workers League and ultimately executed).|$|E
50|$|Since lay {{judges are}} not jurors, they cannot be excused, {{unless there are}} grounds that would also justify an {{objection}} to a judge. So, the office is practically mandatory. Also, they are not sequestered, because a trial often lasts too long to restrict travel. An Italian trial, including <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> investigations, <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing,</b> trial and appeals, can last several years. Keeping a citizen - who continues to work, while serving as a lay judge - sequestered for years would be unfeasible.|$|R

25|$|Biographer Karen Holliday Tanner {{found that}} Holliday {{had been arrested}} 17 times before his 1881 shootout in Tombstone. Only one arrest was for murder, which {{occurred}} in an 1879 shootout with Mike Gordon in New Mexico, {{for which he was}} acquitted. In <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated Holliday's actions as those of a duly appointed lawman. In Denver, the Arizona warrant against Holliday for Frank Stilwell's murder went unserved when the governor was persuaded by Trinidad Chief of Police Bat Masterson to release Holliday to his custody for bunco charges.|$|E
25|$|When Stilwell {{arrived in}} Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp and Tombstone Special Police Officer Wyatt Earp arrested {{them for the}} robbery. Stilwell and Spence were arraigned before Judge Wells Spicer and posted $7,000 bond. At <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing,</b> Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several {{witnesses}} who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence {{just as he had}} done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year. Having evaded the state charges, Virgil Earp in his other role as Deputy U.S. Marshal re-arrested Spence and Stilwell on October 13 for the Bisbee robbery on a new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, reported that they had been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred (October 8) near Contention City.|$|E
25|$|Rains argued during <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> that Mehserle {{lacked the}} malice {{necessary}} for a murder charge and {{that he intended to}} tase Grant. A BART officer testified, saying that Grant and his friends had yelled profanities and did not obey her orders to sit down moments before Mehserle fired at Grant. She said she was fearful when she heard taunts coming from Grant, his friends, and passengers on the train. After the seven days of testimony, Judge C. Don Clay concluded that Mehserle had not mistakenly used his service pistol instead of his stun gun. The judge based this on Mehserle's statements to other officers that he thought Grant had a gun. He also noted that Mehserle had held his weapon with both hands, but he was trained to use just his left if he was firing a Taser. Mehserle faced up to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.|$|E
25|$|In 1879 he {{was elected}} {{a member of the}} 10th Arizona Territorial Legislature {{representing}} Yavapai County and was chosen as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He served alongside Johnny Behan from Mohave County. Later in 1879 he moved his law practice to the frontier silver-mining boomtown of Tombstone. He was joined by William J. Hunsaker from San Diego. In October 1881 Fitch and Hunsaker were hired by the Earps when they were indicted for murder. Behan was by this time the Cochise County Sheriff and a witness for the prosecution during <b>the</b> Earp's <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> that determined whether the Earps and Doc Holliday would face murder charges {{as a result of the}} Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.|$|R
5000|$|Though not {{reported}} contemporaneously, research (most notably by authors Harrison and Swicegood) has revealed evidence of Tanzler's necrophilia with Hoyos's corpse. [...] Two physicians (Dr. DePoo and Dr. Foraker) {{who attended the}} 1940 autopsy of Hoyos's remains recalled in 1972 that a paper tube had been inserted in the vaginal area of the corpse that allowed for intercourse. [...] Others contend that since no evidence of necrophilia was presented at <b>the</b> 1940 <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing,</b> and because <b>the</b> physicians' [...] "proof" [...] surfaced in 1972, over 30 years after the case had been dismissed, the necrophilia allegation is questionable. While no existing contemporary photographs of the autopsy or photographs taken at the public display show a tube, the necrophilia claim was repeated by the HBO Autopsy program in 2005.|$|R
50|$|On May 18, 1993, Homolka was arraigned on {{two counts}} of manslaughter. Bernardo was charged with two counts each of kidnapping, {{unlawful}} confinement, aggravated sexual assault and first-degree murder {{as well as one}} of dismemberment. Coincidentally, that day Bernardo's original lawyer, Ken Murray, first watched the rape videotapes. Murray decided to hold onto the tapes and use them to impeach Homolka on the stand during Bernardo's trial. Neither Murray nor Carolyn MacDonald, the other lawyer on the defence team, were deeply experienced in criminal law and it was only over time that their ethical dilemma showed itself also to be a potentially criminal matter, for they were withholding evidence. By October 1993, he and his law partners had studied over 4,000 documents from the Crown. Murray has said he was willing to hand over the tapes to the Crown if they had let him cross-examine Homolka in <b>the</b> anticipated <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing.</b> <b>The</b> hearing was never held.|$|R
