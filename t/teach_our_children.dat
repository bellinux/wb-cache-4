60|$|I {{know one}} {{hindrance}} at least; {{and that is}} his parents' sins; when the parents' harshness or neglect tempts the child to fancy that God The Father is such a Father to him as his parents are, and {{that to be a}} child of God is to look up to his heavenly Father with dread and suspicion as to a hard taskmaster whose anger has to be turned away, and not with that perfect love, and trust, and respect, and self-sacrifice, with which the Lord Jesus Christ fulfilled His Father's will and proclaimed His Father's glory: or when the parents' unholiness and lip-religion teach the child to fancy that the Holy Spirit means only certain religious fancies and feelings, or the learning by heart of certain words and doctrines, or, worst of all, a spirit of bondage unto fear; instead of knowing Him to be, as He is, the Spirit of righteousness, and love, and joy, and peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, meekness, temperance: or when, again, parents by their own teaching, do despite to the Spirit of Grace in their own child, and destroy their child's good conscience toward God, by telling the child that it does not really love God, when it loves Him, perhaps, far better than they do; by telling the child that its sins have parted it from God, when its sins are light, yea, are as nothing in the balance compared to the sins they themselves commit every day, while they claim for themselves clearer light and knowledge than the child, and thereby condemn themselves rather than the child; when they darken and defile the pure and beautiful trust and admiration for its Heavenly Father, which God's Spirit puts into the child's heart, by telling it that it is doomed to I know-not-what horrible misery and torture when it dies; but that it can escape from that wretched end by thinking certain thoughts, and feeling certain feelings; and so (after stirring up in the child all manner of dreadful doubts of God's love and justice, and perhaps driving it away from religion altogether by making it believe that it has committed sins which it has not committed, and deserves horrible tortures which it has not deserved), do perhaps at last awaken in it a new love for God, but one which is not like that first love, that childlike love; one which, I fear, is hardly a love for God at all, but principally a selfish joy and delight at having escaped from coming torments. This is the reason, my friends; and this hindrance, at least, I know. I will not copy those parents, my friends, and tell them, as they tell their children, that they are bringing on themselves endless torture; but I must tell them, for the Lord Christ has told them, that they are bringing on themselves something--I know not what--of which it is written, that it were better for them that a millstone were hanged about their necks, and that they were drowned in the depth of the sea. Oh, my friends, if I speak sternly, almost bitterly, when I speak of parents' sins, it is because I speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. I plead for Christ's little ones: I plead for the souls and consciences of those little children of whom Christ said, 'Suffer the little children to come unto me;' not that they might become His, but because they were His already; not that they might win His love, but because He loved them from all eternity: not that they might enter into the kingdom of heaven, but, because they were in the kingdom of heaven already; because the kingdom of heaven was made up of such as them, and the angels who ministered unto them always beheld the face of our Father who is in heaven. Yes; I plead for those children, of whom the Lord said, 'Except ye be converted,' that is, utterly turned and changed, 'and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.' Deep and blessed words, which are the root-rule of all true righteousness; which so few really believe at heart, any more than the Pharisees, and Sadducees, and Herodians of old did. Up and down, all over England, I hear men of all denominations saying, not, 'Except we grown people be converted and become as little children;' but, 'except the little children be converted, and become like us, grown people.' God grant that the little children may not become like too many grown people! God grant it, I say. God grant that our children may not become like us! God grant that they may keep through youth and manhood, and through the grave, and through all worlds to come, the tender and childlike heart, which we too often have hardened in ourselves by bigotry and superstition, and dead faith, and lip-worship! And I can have good hope that God will grant it. I can have hope that God will <b>teach</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> and our children's children truly to know Him whose name is Love and Righteousness, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as long as I see His providence preserving for us this old Church Catechism, to <b>teach</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> what we forget to teach them, or what we have not faith enough to teach them.|$|E
6000|$|Occasionally {{these letters}} give us {{interesting}} glimpses of persons and things in England. In {{the letter of}} Williams just cited, there is a lesson for all parties raised to power by exceptional causes. [...] "Surely, Sir, youre Father & {{all the people of}} God in England ... are now in the sadle & at the helme, so high that non datus descensus nisi cadendo: Some cheere up their spirits with the impossibilitie of another fall or turne, so doth Major G. Harrison ... a very gallant most deserving heavenly man, but most highflowne for the Kingdom of the Saints & the 5th Monarchie now risen & their sun never to set againe &c. Others, as, to my knowledge, the Protector ... are not so full of that faith of miracles, but still imagine changes & persecutions & the very slaughter of the witnesses before that glorious morning so much desired of a worldly Kingdome, if ever such a Kingdome (as literally it is by so many expounded) be to arise in this present world & dispensation." [...] Poor General Harrison lived {{to be one of the}} witnesses so slaughtered. The practical good sense of Cromwell is worth noting, the English understanding struggling against Judaic trammels. Williams gives us another peep through the keyhole of the past: [...] "It pleased the Lord to call me for some time & with some persons to practice the Hebrew, the Greeke, Latine, French & Dutch. The secretarie of the Councell (Mr Milton) for my Dutch I read him, read me many more languages. Grammar rules begin to be esteemed a Tyrannie. I taught 2 young Gentlemen, a Parliament man's sons, as we <b>teach</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> English, by words, phrazes, & constant talke, &c." [...] It is plain that Milton had talked over with Williams the theory put forth in his tract on Education, and made a convert of him. We could wish that the good Baptist had gone a little more into particulars. But which of us knows among the men he meets whom time will dignify by curtailing him of the [...] "Mr.," [...] and reducing him to a bare patronymic, as being a kind by himself? We have a glance or two at Oliver, who is always interesting. [...] "The late renowned Oliver confest to me in close discourse about the Protestants aifaires &c that he yet feard great persecutions to the protestants from the Romanists before the downfall of the Papacie," [...] writes Williams in 1660. This [...] "close discourse" [...] must have been six years before, when Williams was in England. Within a year after, Oliver interfered to some purpose in behalf of the Protestants of Piedmont, and Mr. Milton wrote his famous sonnet. Of the war with Spain, Williams reports from his letters out of England in 1656: [...] "This diversion against the Spaniard hath turnd the face & thoughts of many English, so that the saying now is, Crowne the Protector with gould,[138] though the sullen yet cry, Crowne him with thornes." ...|$|E

Bullying has become the norm and fights {{continue}} on the playground; students show hostility towards their teachers {{and the world is}} at war, as people go on rampages, killing learners at schools. This study will discuss why classrooms should be considered spaces in which children can learn, understand and comprehend what peace and love is as opposed to war. Humans are taught from a young age to compete with their siblings and fight for survival, which creates a sense of clear winners and losers. The level of learner consciousness of respect for life and being at peace with themselves and those around them should be enhanced through teachings about life principles and through mindful training. Children spend most of their lives at school and in the classroom. If the school environment can make children more aware and conscious {{of what it means to}} be giving and accepting through teaching about mindful learning which encourages justice, peace, kindness, courage and goodness, then perhaps the world will be a better place, as opposed to accepting it when children bully, fight, tease, compete and undermine each other's potential. Children already display dictatorial behaviour from a young age because of the examples adults have set, as children tend to imitate figures of authority. Teachers should take the lead in ensuring social justice and peace. We teach children to take from the world as opposed to give to it, through subjects such as mathematics and accounting; accumulate, expand, make money at any expense. The playground and school environment promote the idea that scholars consider themselves only, damaging the environment, fighting for survival and the needs of human beings only. Littering, ganging up on the helpless, oppressing those less popular, going with the crowd and being tough, heartless bullies have become acceptable within the schooling system. If this is what we are <b>teaching</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> to become, will they be the leaders that we want them to be? The paper will touch on mindful learning as a means of creating a conducive peaceful schooling environment for learners...|$|R
