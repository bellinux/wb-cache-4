5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> {{were brought to}} court {{in the process of}} de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a coincidence that the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gordimer herself became {{involved}} in South African struggle politics after the arrest of a friend, Bettie du Toit, in 1960 for trade unionist activities and {{being a member of}} the SACP. Just as Rosa Burger in the novel visits family in prison, so Gordimer visited her friend. Later in 1986, Gordimer gave evidence at the Delmas Treason Trial in support of 22 ANC members accused of treason. She was a member of the ANC while it was still an illegal organization in South Africa, and hid several ANC leaders in her own home to help them evade arrest by <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 1936, Syrian {{nationalist}} sentiments became incensed as the French authorities suspended {{parliament and}} appointed the pro-French president Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Following {{the arrest of}} some nationalist leaders, a general strike was declared against the French Mandate and President al-Hasani. Speeches denouncing the arrests and colonialism were made at the Umayyad Mosque, after which demonstrators, including students and local youths, gathered at al-Bakri's home where they coordinated a march to the Serail (French government headquarters). The protests were led by al-Bakri, al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey, but they were confronted by <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> before leaving al-Bakri's street.|$|E

5|$|On 3 February, Ravalomanana {{dismissed}} Rajoelina {{as mayor}} of Antananarivo and appointed a special delegation headed by Guy Randrianarisoa to manage {{the affairs of the}} capital. Rajoelina denounced the decision and warned {{that it would not be}} accepted by the populace. The following day Rajoelina instead designated Michele Ratsivalaka to succeed him as mayor. Rajoelina incited demonstrators on 7 February to occupy the presidential palace, prompting the presidential guard to open fire on the advancing crowd, killing 31 and wounding more than 200. Popular disapproval of Ravalomanana intensified and polarized some in favor of his resignation, although perceptions of Rajoelina as an alternative remained mixed. Conflicts between pro-Rajoelina demonstrators and security forces continued over the following weeks, resulting in several additional deaths. <b>The</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Rajoelina at his compound on 5 March; they also raided the offices of his Viva media network. Initially they surrounded Viva, and after thirty minutes the staff attempted to remove Viva property, at which point <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> stormed the building and confiscated the equipment. For the next several days Rajoelina took refuge in the home of the French ambassador, reporting to the press that he feared for his safety.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 2002, a {{terrorist}} outfit first attacked {{in the market}} area by lobbing grenades and firing and then entered the temple. <b>The</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> surrounded them.

The second attack {{took place at the}} temple on 24 November 2002, when the Hindus were performing puja in the temple; this attack was made by bombers of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and resulted in the deaths of 13 devotees and injuries to several more.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack, {{hundreds}} of policemen and army forces personnel and two {{armored personnel carriers}} were brought into Yerevan, positioned on Baghramyan Avenue surrounding the National Assembly building. An anti-terrorist squad from Russia also participated in the operation. Meanwhile, ambulance vehicles rushed {{to the site of}} the shooting. President Robert Kocharyan was directing the operation of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> around the parliament building. While holding around 50 hostages inside the building, the men demanded a helicopter and airtime on national television for a political statement.|$|E
5|$|Soviet-oriented parties, {{backed by}} the Soviet Red Army and in control of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces,</b> held most of the power, {{concentrated}} especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Władysław Gomułka and Bolesław Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated {{at the time of}} the PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Tamarod and Al Wefaq {{opposition}} society {{praised the}} protests {{and said they}} were successful. The government of Bahrain however said protests did not affect everyday life. The United States said it supported freedom of expression and assembly, and voiced its concern at the chances of violence. Analysts were divided between those who expected protests to be huge and those that did not see them having any chance. They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama, some blaming it on <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces,</b> others on protest organizers.|$|E

5|$|The Rhodesian Bush War was the result, {{beginning}} in earnest on 21 December 1972 when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms near Centenary in the country's north-east. The Rhodesian Security Forces launched Operation Hurricane in response and fought back strongly, {{reducing the number}} of guerrillas active within the country to under 300 by December 1974. In the period October–November 1974, they killed more nationalist fighters than in the previous two years combined. However, a South African-brokered ceasefire, which <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> respected and the insurgents ignored, helped the nationalists to win back ground. By 1977 there were 2,500 guerrillas operating in Rhodesia, with several times that number in training abroad.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich {{developed}} close professional relationships {{only within}} the circle of the SS security forces. Heinrich Müller was one such example, and Heydrich appears to have trusted him. Adolf Eichmann's straightforward loyalty impressed Heydrich, and was one reason why he appointed him as secretary for the Wannsee Conference. Herbert Kappler, who was appointed as commander of all SS security forces in Rome, {{was said to have}} been a protégé of Heydrich. SS personnel favoured by Heydrich, especially those who attended the Wannsee conference, possessed similar traits of devotion to SS, lack of remorse regarding brutal or genocidal orders, and above all personal loyalty to Heydrich in his capacity as commander of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces.</b> On the other hand, Heydrich's dislike and distrust of Arthur Nebe and Walter Schellenberg may have stemmed from their independence and ambition.|$|E

5|$|On 17 November, the RhAR was {{withdrawn}} {{for a period}} of rest and recuperation (R). The battalion's Transport Platoon was ambushed by communist guerrillas as it was returning to base: a shot through the windscreen of one of the two trucks nearly hit its driver, but the convoy was able to escape the ambush without anybody being injured. On 26 November, the RhAR and the King's Own Scottish Borderers assisted the local police at Kelapa Sawit in an action called Tartan Rock: <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> moved into the village and arrested 34 communist sympathisers, most of whom were ethnic Chinese students from the University of Malaya in Singapore. Two days later, the RhAR were back on regular duty.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, RhAR patrols in the Chaah, Labis, Bekok and Sungai Karas areas were stepped up to last between 10 and 18 days each, but {{contacts}} with the communist forces remained rare. The constant patrols gradually began to take their toll on the insurgents, and guerrillas began to give themselves up increasingly frequently. A contributing factor here was Britain's granting of independence to Malaya within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957, which dented the motivation of many fighters. Starting in October 1957, the RhAR were tasked to work alongside former MNLA personnel to wipe out any remaining communist forces in the region. The ex-insurgents were supposed to lead <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> to MNLA camps and resting places, but this strategy was not successful. The RhAR soon developed a low opinion of these ex-MNLA men.|$|E
5|$|Smith and the RF decisively {{won three}} more general {{elections}} during the 1970s. The Anglo-Rhodesian Agreement of 1971–72, {{which would have}} legitimised the country's independence in Britain's eyes, fell apart after a British test of Rhodesian national opinion reported most blacks to be against it. The Rhodesian Bush War, fought against the government by the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), the respective guerrilla armies of the Maoist Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and its Warsaw Pact-aligned Marxist rival, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), intensified soon after, starting with ZANLA's attack on Altena and Whistlefield Farms in the country's north-east in December 1972. After a strong security force counter-campaign, the South African détente initiative of December 1974 introduced a ceasefire, which <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> respected, and the guerrillas ignored. This shifted {{the course of the}} war significantly in the nationalists' favour.|$|E

5|$|Turner and Meyszner clashed {{continually}} throughout 1942, as Meyszner {{sought to}} remove all police matters from Turner's remit, including the supervision of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> of the Serbian collaborationist regime. In response, Turner fought hard to maintain control over these areas. Meyszner believed {{the only way to}} maintain peace and security was the use of brutal police methods; Turner wanted to empower the Nedić regime and then replace the military administration with a civil one, akin to the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, with himself as Reichskommissar (governor). Meyszner attempted to have Turner's staff downgraded and incorporated into Bader's staff but Wolff intervened to prevent this. However, Turner's approach was also seriously out-of-step with the Wehrmacht, which considered the territory a combat zone and wanted to eliminate inefficiencies and overlapping jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Wilson and Smith held {{abortive}} talks aboard HMS Tiger in 1966 and HMS Fearless {{two years}} later.

5|$|A small {{ministry}} of defence (which was renamed the Ministry of Defence and Security in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited {{the extent to which the}} ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E
