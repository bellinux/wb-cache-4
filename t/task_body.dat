50|$|Ada has {{language}} {{support for}} task-based concurrency. The fundamental concurrent unit in Ada {{is a task}} which is a built-in limited type. Tasks are specified in two parts - the task declaration defines the task interface (similar to a type declaration), the <b>task</b> <b>body</b> specifies {{the implementation of the}} task.Depending on the implementation, Ada tasks are either mapped to operating system threads or processes, or are scheduled internally by the Ada runtime.|$|E
50|$|Task ports {{can now be}} {{declared}} ref. A reference gives the <b>task</b> <b>body</b> {{direct access to the}} source arguments. in the caller's scope. Since it is operating on the original variable itself, rather than a copy of the argument's value, the task/function can modify variables (but not nets) in the caller's scope in realtime. The inout/output port-declarations pass variables by value, and defer updating the caller-scope variable until the moment the task exits.|$|E
50|$|Tasks {{can have}} entries for {{synchronisation}} (a form of synchronous message passing). Task entries are declared {{in the task}} specification. Each task entry can have one or more accept statements within the <b>task</b> <b>body.</b> If the control flow of the task reaches an accept statement, the task is blocked until the corresponding entry is called by another task (similarly, a calling task is blocked until the called task reaches the corresponding accept statement). Task entries can have parameters similar to procedures, allowing tasks to synchronously exchange data. In conjunction with select statements {{it is possible to}} define guards on accept statements (similar to Dijkstra's guarded commands).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of the body postures on the visual acuity, refractive error and binocular vision. The near <b>task</b> <b>body</b> postures of thirty optometry students without pre-knowledge about the nature of the study were photographed from front view, side view and top view. The angles of the head tilt, body tilt and head rotation of the near <b>task</b> <b>body</b> posture for each subject were estimated based on the photographs. The habitual working distance and Harmon distance of each subject were also measured. The visual acuity, refractive error, amplitude of accommodation, positive and negatif relative accommodation, accommodation facility, accommodation lag, near point of convergence and heterophoria were tested for all subjects. Our results show that there was no significant effect of body posture on visual acuity, refractive error and binocular vision. Moderate head tilts, body tilts, head rotations and non-extreme habitual working distances of young adults do not seem to cause significant changes to their visual systems...|$|E
40|$|Kaisler [4] {{identified}} several design issues that arose from developing {{a process for}} transforming objectoriented programs written in Ada 95 or other objectoriented programming languages to process-oriented programs written in Ada 95. These issues limit- in the authors ' opinion- the flexibility of Ada 95 in writing concurrent programs. These problems arise from specific decisions made by the Ada 95 designers. This paper addresses three of these issues: circular references are invalid in packages, lack of a subclassing mechanism for protected types, and an inability to internally invoke access statements from within a <b>task</b> <b>body.</b> Our goal is to raise the Ada 95 community's awareness concerning these design issues and provide some suggestions for correcting these problems for a future revision of the Ada programming language. 2...|$|E
40|$|The Event-B {{method is}} a formal {{approach}} for modelling systems in safety-, and business-critical, domains. Initially, system specification {{takes place at}} a high level of abstraction; detail is added in refinement steps as the development proceeds toward implementation. Our aim has been to develop a novel approach for generating code, for concurrent programs, from Event-B. We formulated the approach so that it integrates well with the existing Event-B methodology and tools. In this paper we introduce a tasking extension for Event-B, with Tasking and Shared Machines. We make use of refinement, decomposition, and the extension, to structure projects for code generation for multitasking implementations. During the modelling phase decomposition is performed; decomposition reduces modelling complexity and makes proof more tractable. The decomposed models are then extended with sufficient information to enable generation of code. A <b>task</b> <b>body</b> describes a task’s behaviour, mainly using imperative, programming-like constructs. Task priority and life-cycle (periodic, triggered, etc.) are also specified, but timing aspects are not modelled formally.

40|$|Performing a {{cognitive}} task while maintaining upright stance {{can lead to}} increased or reduced body sway depending on tasks and experimental conditions. Because greater sway is commonly taken to indicate loosened postural control, and vice versa, the precise impact of cognitive load on postural stability has remained unclear. In much of the large literature on posture–cognition dual tasking, the assigned postural task is to simply maintain stance (so-called “quiet standing”). This contrasts with quotidian use of postural coordination to maintain balance while also facilitating suprapostural sensorimotor tasks. In this study, healthy young participants either maintained quiet stance or carried out a visuopostural alignment task while performing a spatial, nonspatial, or no additional cognitive <b>task.</b> <b>Body</b> sway increased during both cognitive tasks while quiet standing, as is often observed, but not while performing the visuopostural alignment task. This result is {{not consistent with the}} commonly invoked competition between tasks for limited processing resources. It suggests that constraints placed on posture control by suprapostural task goals may significantly alter interactions between posture control and cognitive tasks, and that dual-task results obtained under quiet standing conditions may not generalize to postural control in everyday task conditions...|$|E
40|$|Division of labour among {{workers is}} central to the {{organisation}} and ecological success of insect societies. If there is a genetic component to worker size, morphology or task preference, an increase in colony genetic diversity arising from the presence of multiple breeders per colony might improve division of labour. We studied the genetic basis of worker size and task preference in Formica selysi, an ant species that shows natural variation in the number of mates per queen and the number of queens per colony. Worker size had a heritable component in colonies headed by a doubly mated queen (h(2) = 0. 26) and differed significantly among matrilines in multiple-queen colonies. However, higher levels of genetic diversity did not result in more polymorphic workers across single- or multiple-queen colonies. In addition, workers from multiple-queen colonies were consistently smaller and less polymorphic than workers from single-queen colonies. The relationship between <b>task,</b> <b>body</b> size and genetic lineage appeared to be complex. Foragers were significantly larger than brood-tenders, which may provide energetic or ergonomic advantages to the colony. Task specialisation was also often associated with genetic lineage. However, genetic lineage and body size were often correlated with task independently of each other, suggesting that the allocation of workers to tasks is modulated by multiple factors. Overall, these results indicate that an increase in colony genetic diversity does not increase worker size polymorphism but might improve colony homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|The binding of incongruent cues poses a {{challenge}} for multimodal perception. Indeed, although taller objects emit sounds from higher elevations, low-pitched sounds are perceptually mapped both to large size and to low elevation. In the present study, we examined how these incongruent vertical spatial cues (up is more) and pitch cues (low is large) to size interact, and whether similar biases influence size perception along the horizontal axis. In Experiment 1, we measured listeners’ voice-based judgments of human body size using pitch-manipulated voices projected from a high versus a low, and a right versus a left, spatial location. Listeners associated low spatial locations with largeness for lowered-pitch but not for raised-pitch voices, demonstrating that pitch overrode vertical-elevation cues. Listeners associated rightward spatial locations with largeness, regardless of voice pitch. In Experiment 2, listeners performed the task while sitting or standing, allowing us to examine self-referential cues to elevation in size estimation. Listeners associated vertically low and rightward spatial cues with largeness more for lowered- than for raised-pitch voices. These correspondences were robust to sex (of both the voice and the listener) and head elevation (standing or sitting); however, horizontal correspondences were amplified when participants stood. Moreover, when participants were standing, their judgments of how much larger men’s voices sounded than women’s increased when the voices were projected from the low speaker. Our results provide novel evidence for a multidimensional spatial mapping of pitch that is generalizable to human voices and that affects performance in an indirect, ecologically relevant spatial <b>task</b> (<b>body</b> size estimation). These findings suggest that crossmodal pitch correspondences evoke both low-level and higher-level cognitive processes...|$|E

40|$|Introduction and Aims: The {{workers of}} mosaic art are {{susceptible}} to musculoskelet al disorders due to various risk factors including body posture during work, repetition of movement, old and sometimes non-ergonomic tools. The aims {{of this study were}} estimating the prevalence of musculoskelet al disorder and assessment of body posture of workers in the mosaic workers in Kerman. Methods: In this study, calling out Kerman Office of Cultural Heritage, 16 mosaic workshops and 32 mosaic workers were selected. Standardized Nordic questionnaire were completed for 26 mosaic worker. Using hierarchical task analysis, task of the mosaic profession were analyzed. After using ART posture analysis method for assessment of repetitive <b>task,</b> <b>body</b> posture of worker were used. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 18. Results: In this study, 18 (69. 2 %) males and 8 (30. 8 %) female were selected The mean of age (year), work experience (year) and working hours per day (hours) were subsequently 6. 6, 32. 9 and 11. 9, respectively The highest prevalence of musculoskelet al disorders during the past 12 months was in neck with a prevalence of (66. 7 %), upper back with prevalence of (63. 2 %). The results of the ART assessment method showed that, calculated risk scores for right and left hands in the mosaic career were not equal. And risk scores in all right hand's functions was higher than left hand's ones, that these results are consistent with the results of the Nordic questionnaire. Conclusion: The results of posture assessment indicated that body condition of right hand were more critical than left ones, and results of ART method confirm the Nordic questionnaire results. *Corresponding author: MSc Student in Occupational Health Engineering, member of Kerman Medical Student Research Committee.

40|$|This {{research}} {{consists of}} two studies. The purpose {{was to investigate the}} effects of slow and fast music tempo on interjoint co-ordination variability in an aerobic stepping task. The 2 ̆ 7 step knee-up 2 ̆ 7 task is a cyclical whole body movement performed on the step platform. The exercise consisted of a few repetitive cycles. A cycle was defined by eight counts, four counts for the left leg pattern and four for the right leg as follows: The first half of the cycle was counted: I. Step up with the left foot onto the 20 -cm step platform, 2. Flex the right hip to bring the right knee up; 3. Step down to the floor with the right foot and, 4. Tap once with the left foot on the floor near the right foot. The second half of the cycle consisted of the following four counts: I. Step up onto the platform with the right foot; 2. Flex the left hip to bring the left knee up. 3. Step down to the floor with the left foot and, 4. Tap once with the right foot on the floor near the right foot. The participants were instructed to move both arms simultaneously forward and backward so that the limbs would perform in-phase movement, which is opposite to the natural anti-phase arm movements that accompanies walking and stepping activities. This pattern of the arm movements has been defined as a proposed pattern or the 2 ̆ 7 to-be-learned 2 ̆ 7 pattern. In particular, the research examined to what extent unskilled and skilled participants would adjust their movement co-ordination to cope with changes in performance conditions in attempting to achieve the criterion task. In the first study, these effects were observed in novices and experts, while the effects of the fast tempo training on intrinsic dynamics (self-paced condition) were considered in the second study. Both studies were based on the Dynamic Systems Theory. The environmental factor, which was considered as the control parameter affecting performance in both studies, was the music tempo. In the first study interjoint co-ordination responses were analysed in terms of a version of the Haken, Kelso and Bunz 2 ̆ 7 s (HKB) modal that considers detuning or frequency competition terms. Six novice and six expert females participated in the experiment performing a 2 ̆ 7 step-knee-up 2 ̆ 7, a whole body rhythmical task, under different music tempos. They were tested at a slow tempo at 48 beat/min and at a fast tempo of 144 beat/min. Two hypotheses were proposed. Firstly, it was hypothesised that discrete relative phase variability of inter-joints co-ordination would be higher. at the fast tempo then at the slow tempo in both, novices and experts. It was further hypothesised that, in order to cope with changes in performance conditions and still achieve the criterion task, novices would demonstrate higher variability than experts at both the slow and fast tempo. Results showed that interjoint co-ordination in experts was more consistent (less variable) at both the slow and fast tempo compared to novices, in all couplings expect in the left leg. Furthermore, follow-up tests revealed that Tempo and Side effects in novices were not significant. In experts, however significant Side effect was found in shoulder joint coupling and hip-knee joint coupling. Higher variability was found in left leg interjoint coupling between hip and knee joints at both tempos, compared to the right leg. In shoulders joint coupling, however, higher variability was found only in the slow tempo for the right side observation of the L Shoulder-R Shoulder movement. Finally, it was observed that the initially specified arm movement direction (iso directional or in-phase movement) changed to anti-phase direction at fast tempo in novices. Therefore, in novices, in-phase arm movements were more sensitive to fast tempo perturbations compared to anti-phase. While these results may be in contrast to Haken, Kelso and Bunz 2 ̆ 7 s model predictions they are partly supported by Whittal, Forester and Song 2 ̆ 7 s (1999) findings. In the second study, whether practising the task under the fast music tempo would affect the interjoint co-ordination stability at the preferred tempo performance (without the music) was investigated. It was hypothesised that, after the training under the fast music tempo interjoint coupling variability at the preferred tempo would decrease. The hypothesis was partly accepted as variability decreased in the self- paced condition after training only in shoulder-shoulder interjoint couplings compared to the self-paced condition before training. Results in the second study were discussed in relation to Shaner and Kelso 2 ̆ 7 s (1988) dynamical theory of environmental function and motor learning transfer principles. It was found that training under the fast tempo did not significantly affect overall performance at self-paced and fast tempos. However, different changes in interjoint co-ordination strength were observed in different couplings before and after training as the function of (the left or right) body side. It was concluded that interjoint co-ordination flexibility is highly specific to the interaction between the <b>task,</b> <b>body</b> side, performance condition and skill level. Finally it was suggested that an individual approach to the analysis of variability in co-ordination dynamics in skilled and unskilled performance and learning be considered...|$|E
