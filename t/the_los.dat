40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the stability of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of lipid membranes in <b>the</b> liquid-ordered phase (<b>lo</b> phase) against a detergent, Triton X- 100.

We also found that ether-linked dihexadecylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) membranes containing more than 20 mol% cholesterol were in <b>the</b> <b>lo</b> phase, and that DHPC/chol-GUV and DHPC/chol-LUV in <b>the</b> <b>lo</b> phase were stable and no leakage of internal contents occurred in the presence of Triton X- 100. In contrast, octylglucoside solution could easily break these GUVs and LUVs of <b>the</b> <b>lo</b> phase membranes and induced internal contents leakage. These data indicate that GUVs and LUVs of <b>the</b> <b>lo</b> phase membranes are very valuable for practical use...|$|R

40|$|The size {{dependence}} of excitonic states and vibrational modes in CuCl cubic quantum dots embedded in NaCl crystals was studied {{by means of}} site-selective persistent spectral hole burning spectroscopy. It is shown that the interaction of <b>the</b> longitudinal optical (<b>LO)</b> phonon with <b>the</b> exciton results {{in the formation of}} coupled exciton-phonon modes when the energy of <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> phonon approaches <b>the</b> energy spacings between the ground and excited states of the exciton. The energy anticrossings of <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> phonon modes with two higher optically allowed excited states of the exciton in CuCl QD’s were clearly observed at confinement energies of about 10 and 6 meV, respectively. In addition, the linewidth of <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> phonon sideband in CuCl QD’s in NaCl crystals was found to increase abruptly from 0. 3 meV to about 1. 2 meV at a confinement energy of about 23 meV, which appears to result from the exciton-phonon mixing of <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> phonon mode with the first excited state of the exciton. The experimental results are qualitatively understood by <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> phonon renormalization theory...|$|R

40|$|Spatial prepositions work as {{pointers}} {{to localize}} objects in space. For instance “The book {{is over the}} table ” indicates that <b>the</b> located object (<b>LO)</b> is somewhere “over ” the reference object (RO). To understand where <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> is people need to assign direction to space (selecting a reference frame). Three experiments are reported which investigated the reference frame conflict between LO and RO. We found that when <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> was not vertically aligned, the appropriateness for a given spatial preposition (above, below, over and under) changes. In general scenes with <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> pointing at <b>the</b> RO were judged less acceptable than scenes with <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> vertically oriented. These results suggest that reference frames for both LO and RO are accessed before direction can be assigned for spatial prepositions. Modifications to Multiple Frame Activation theory (Carlson-Radvansky & Irwin, 1994) are discussed...|$|R
