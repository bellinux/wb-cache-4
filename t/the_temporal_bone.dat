5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone</b> {{in a complex}} cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the {{vestibule}} contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|People with cranial CSF leaks, the rarer form, have a 10% risk of {{developing}} meningitis per year. If cranial leaks last more than seven days, the chances {{of developing}} meningitis are significantly higher. Spinal CSF leaks cannot result in meningitis due to the sterile conditions of the leak site. When a CSF leak occurs at <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone</b> surgery becomes {{necessary in order to}} prevent infection and repair the leak. Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to autonomic dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly. The autonomic dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem, which controls breathing and circulation.|$|E

5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone.</b> The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone.</b> The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of the {{wildebeest}} are known to hybridise. Male black wildebeest {{have been reported to}} mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species, however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase {{in the size of the}} hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals, the tympanic part of <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone</b> is highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E

5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (<b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone)</b> can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E

It is biconcave in structure and attaches to the condyle medially and laterally. The anterior portion of the disc splits in the vertical dimension, coincident with the insertion of the superior head of the lateral pterygoid. The posterior portion also splits in the vertical dimension, and the area between the split continues posteriorly and {{is referred to as}} the retrodiscal tissue. Unlike the disc itself, this piece of connective tissue is vascular and innervated, and in some cases of anterior disc displacement, the pain felt during movement of the mandible is due to the condyle compressing this area against the articular surface of <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
