When compared <b>to</b> <b>playing</b> <b>against</b> a computer, <b>playing</b> <b>against</b> another human elicited higher Spatial Presence, engagement, anticipated threat, post-game challenge appraisals, and physiological arousal, as well as more positively valenced emotional responses. In addition, <b>playing</b> <b>against</b> a friend elicited greater Spatial Presence, engagement, and selfreported and physiological arousal compared <b>to</b> <b>playing</b> <b>against</b> a stranger.
