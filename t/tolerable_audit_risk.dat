40|$|The {{first part}} of the study {{examined}} the effect of industry risk changes on perceived <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> at the financial statement level and whether these changes depended on individual differences such as experience and tolerance for ambiguity. ^ Forty-eight auditors from two offices of one of the “Big 5 ” CPA firms participated in this study. The ANOVA results supported the effect of industry risk in the assessment of <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> at the financial statement level. Higher industry risk was associated with higher perceived <b>audit</b> <b>risk.</b> Tolerance for ambiguity was also significant in explaining the changes in the assessment of <b>audit</b> <b>risk.</b> Auditors with a high tolerance for ambiguity perceived lower <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> than auditors with a low tolerance for ambiguity. Although ANOVA results did not find experience to be significant, a t-test for experience showed it to be marginally significant and inversely related to <b>audit</b> <b>risk.</b> ^ The second part of this study examined whether differences in perceived <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> at the financial statement level altered the extent, nature or timing of the planned auditing procedures. The results of the MANOVA suggested an overall <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> effect at the financial statement level. Perceived <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> was significant in explaining the variation in the number of hours planned for the total cycle and the number of hours p 1 anned for the tests of balances and details.

The higher the inherent risk the more analytical procedures were planned. Perceived <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> was not significant in explaining the timing of the procedures, but individual differences were significant.

40|$|The <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> {{model has}} become an {{extremely}} important element in audit practice. The basic intuition behind the model is that changes in risk should affect {{the work of the}} auditor. However, little systematic empirical evidence has been published on the assessment of <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> and its effect on audit work. This study, using documentation from actual audits and follow-up interviews, provides such evidence. Assessments of <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> and <b>audit</b> programme details have been obtained from eight clients of four Dutch <b>audit</b> firms. <b>Audit</b> <b>risk</b> assessments are obtained for two <b>risk</b> categories: (1) <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> factors, such as the degree of client management turnover or the quality of the client's internal audit department; and (2) <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> model variables (inherent or control risk), related to the account or assertion being audited. The results indicate that there is substantial variation in <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> factors between clients and among the <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> factors per client. To a lesser extent these findings hold for the risk model variables. The study also indicates that to some degree there is risk variation over time. Variability of risk factor assess-ments over time is higher than variability of risk model variable assessments over time. Audit programmes differ substantially between clients and, to a lesser extent, over time. Interestingly, the only two engagements with a change in the audit programme were the clients with most risk factor changes. The study also identifies factors other than risk, such as a change in the audit team, that influence audit programme planning. The observation in Dutch audit practice of variation in both <b>risk</b> assessments and <b>audit</b> programmes highlights the opportunity to design risk-adjusted audits, which are both efficient and effective. In addition, this observation encourages the carrying out of further research to fine-tune our models concerning which factors are most important within the <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> model and to the audit planning process. ...|$|R

Extant literature on voluntary disclosure analyzes the relationships between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and <b>audit</b> <b>risk,</b> finding that auditors charge lower fees and issue less going concern opinions to firms with good CSR performance. In this study, we test the relationship between intellectual capital disclosure (ICD) and <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> and we assess the effect of ICD and <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> on <b>audit</b> fees. To do so, we use data from the ESG Asset 4 database (Thomson Reuters Datastream) on 166 UK and 27 Italian listed firms that issue stand-alone social and intellectual capital statements. The <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> is measured from both a qualitative and a quantitative perspective. Panel data analysis on 2004 – 2011 years has been used to test our research hypotheses. Empirical findings from a sample of UK and Italian listed companies show that auditors estimate a lower qualitative risk, albeit a higher quantitative one, for those companies reporting higher ICD scores, compared to those ones with lower disclosure scores on the intellectual capital. Furthermore, we find that reputation risk contributes to the relationship between ICD and <b>audit</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between and corporate environmental responsibility (CER) and <b>audit</b> <b>risk.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A survey participation request was mailed to 5, 008 US auditors at random. The request provided a link to an electronic survey. The final sample consists of anonymous responses from 163 auditors. Findings – The authors find that auditors, on average, do not perceive a significant relationship between corporate environmental strengths and audit risk; however, they do perceive an increase in <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> among firms with corporate environmental concerns. Use of CER in the risk assessment process also varies across types of CER: 15 per cent of auditors use corporate environmental strengths to assess <b>audit</b> <b>risk,</b> while 43 per cent of auditors use corporate environmental concerns to assess <b>audit</b> <b>risk.</b> Perception of the CER/audit risk relationship is a significant determinant of CER use. Finally, both types of CER are found to have average usefulness in the risk assessment process. Research limitations/implications – The findings are limited to US auditors; results may not be transferable to other countries. Originality/value – Studies involving the impact of CER on earnings generally involve archival data. By examining the impact of CER on <b>audit</b> <b>risk,</b> using a unique dataset, the authors present a different and timely setting to study the CER/earnings relationship.

40|$|Purpose – The {{conduct of}} this {{research}} represents {{part of an effort}} to modify <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> model (ARM) as an implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) by certified public accounting (CPA) firms. It is intended to make clear the phenomena about the relationship between <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> (AR), implementation of business ethics principles (IBEP) and corporate governance risk (CGR). Design/methodology/approach – The method used was hypothesis testing. Unit of analysis was individual (i. e. Indonesian CPA), and the gathering of data was cross-sectional. The sample was determined by purposive sampling. Data were collected using questionnaires, and data analysis was conducted by structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings – According to Indonesian CPAs' perception, the AR is affected by the client's CGR, whereas the client's IBEP does not affect AR, but clients' CGR and IBEP both significantly affect AR. It is suggested: first, that the next researcher should study <b>audit</b> <b>risk</b> related to business ethics. Second, that the management should strengthen the implementation of business ethics in running a business; and finally that the Bapepam (Capital Market Oversight Board) should oversee both public company and public accountant in the implementation of governance. search limitations/implications – This research noted some implications, including: nature and intensity of gathering data, restricted respondent (CPA-CMAF), and restricted variables of corporate governance (BoD, and Audit Committee).
