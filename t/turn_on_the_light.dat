500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Man" [...] was {{directed}} by Urban Strom and produced by Danny Germaine in July 2009. It was shot in a mansion in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California. For the video, the singer wore a [...] "clingy" [...] white vest and hotpants. It begins with showing {{a man who is}} in bed and cannot sleep. Ewen is later shown in the mansion which prompts the man to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of a torch, leave the bed and search for her. Ewen then begins dancing on the wall as the torch is being flashed at her by the man. During the second verse, she is shown singing on a couch, again with the torch being flashed. When the song's bridge begins, Ewen is shown dancing outside on the porch where the man is watching her. As the video ends, it is revealed that the man was dreaming, in which Ewen appears near the room's curtains.|$|E

6000|$|Morton was {{suffering}} with the girl, whose hand {{was beginning to}} tremble beneath his palm. She no longer replied to his questions, but {{that she was still}} awake he knew, for he could hear her sighing deeply, so deeply that the sound troubled him almost as if she were weeping. His impulse was to rise and <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and give over this trial, which could only end in humiliating her. [...] "Her temerity is a part of her malady," [...] he argued. [...] "It has arisen through years of misconceived petting and nursing on the part of her mother. Up to this moment her performances have always been in the presence of friends and relatives, or for the consolation of those eager to believe, and therefore easily deluded. Every sitter has conspired to practically force her into an elaborate series of deceptions, each deceit being built upon and made necessary by the other. It is pitiful, but she now believes in herself--that is pathetically certain. Otherwise she would not have yielded herself so completely into the hands of an inexorable investigator like Weissmann. She must take the consequences," [...] he ended, with grim closing of the lips. [...] "We must be cruel in order to be kind. This night may be her salvation." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know {{of another}} psychic in America {{who would have}} {{submitted}} to the test we put upon Mrs. Smiley to-night, but 'Mitchell' has assured me he will go further: he will let us hold her hands and <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> I feel as if the great mystery were almost within our grasp. By the ghost of Euclid! I have the conviction at this moment {{that we are at}} the point of proving for ourselves the elongation of the psychic's limbs! Suppose Flammarion is right? Suppose that the psychic can extend her arms beyond their normal proportions? You should be ready to give a year, ten years, to demonstrating a single one of these physical effects. If I am any judge of character, this little woman is as honest and as wholesome as Mrs. Miller herself. It isn't this one performance alone which proves it. It is the implication of a dozen other sittings, almost as convincing as this, that gives me hope of proving something. Let us have our next sitting at Cameron's. It is only fair to readmit them, for we have proven that they {{had nothing to do with}} our performance that first night. Let us ask to be permitted to hold the hands and feet of the psychic, and also to take a flash-light picture of the floating cone. We may yet see these ghostly hands in the light of the lamp." ...|$|E
60|$|There are no {{universal}} laws {{of affection}} and desire, {{but it is}} manifestly true {{that for the most}} of us free talk, intimate association, and any real fellowship between men and women turns with an extreme readiness to love. And that being so it follows that under existing conditions the unrestricted meeting and companionship {{of men and women in}} society is a monstrous sham, a merely dangerous pretence of encounters. The safe reality beneath those liberal appearances is that a woman must be content with the easy friendship of other women and of one man only, letting a superficial friendship towards all other men veil impassable abysses of separation, and a man must in the same way have one sole woman intimate. To all other women he must be a little blind, a little deaf, politely inattentive. He must respect the transparent, intangible, tacit purdah about them, respect it but never allude to it. To me that is an intolerable state of affairs, but it is reality. If you live in the spirit of any other understanding you will court social disaster. I suppose it is a particularly intolerable state of affairs to us Strattons because it is in our nature to want things to seem what they are. That translucent yet impassible purdah outrages our veracity. And it is plain to me that our social order cannot stand and is not standing the tensions it creates. The convention that passions and emotions are absent when they are palpably present broke down between Mary and myself, as it breaks down in a thousand other cases, as it breaks down everywhere. Our social life is honeycombed and rotten with secret hidden relationships. The rigid, the obtuse and the unscrupulously cunning escape; the honest passion sooner or later flares out and destroys.... Here is a difficulty that no bullying imposition of arbitrary rules on the one hand nor any reckless abandonment of law on the other, can solve. Humanity has yet to find its method in sexual things; it has to discover the use and the limitation of jealousy. And before it can even begin to attempt to find, it has to cease its present timid secret groping in shame and darkness and <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of knowledge. None of us knows much and most of us do not even know what is known.|$|E
60|$|Though {{it was not}} yet {{four o'clock}} she was already {{beginning}} to droop like a flower that wants water. But she sat down to her piano, resolutely, till tea came; playing on and on with a spirit only half present, the other half of her wandering in the Town, seeking for Miltoun. After tea she tried first to read, then to sew, and once more came back to her piano. The clock struck six; and as if its last stroke had broken the armour of her mind, she felt suddenly sick with anxiety. Why was he so long? But she kept on playing, turning the pages without taking in the notes, haunted by the idea that he might again have fallen ill. Should she telegraph? What good, when she could not tell in the least where he might be? And all the unreasoning terror of not knowing where the loved one is, beset her so that her hands, in sheer numbness, dropped from the keys. Unable to keep still, now, she wandered from window to door, out into the little hall, and back hastily to the window. Over her anxiety brooded a darkness, compounded of vague growing fears. What if it were the end? What if he had chosen this as the most merciful way of leaving her? But surely he would never be so cruel! Close on the heels of this too painful thought came reaction; and she told herself that she was a fool. He was at the House; something quite ordinary was keeping him. It was absurd to be anxious! She would {{have to get used to}} this now. To be a drag on him would be dreadful. Sooner than that she would rather--yes--rather he never came back! And she took up her book, determined to read quietly till he came. But the moment she sat down her fears returned with redoubled force-the cold sickly horrible feeling of uncertainty, of the knowledge that she could do nothing but wait till she was relieved by something over which she had no control. And in the superstition that to stay there in the window where she could see him come, was keeping him from her, she went into her bedroom. From there she could watch the sunset clouds wine-dark over the river. A little talking wind shivered along the houses; the dusk began creeping in. She would not <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> unwilling to admit that it was really getting late, but began to change her dress, lingering desperately over every little detail of her toilette, deriving therefrom a faint, mysterious comfort, trying to make herself feel beautiful. From sheer dread of going back before he came, she let her hair fall, though it was quite smooth and tidy, and began brushing it. Suddenly she thought with horror of her efforts at adornment--by specially preparing for him, she must seem presumptuous to Fate. At any little sound she stopped and stood listening--save for her hair and eyes, as white from head to foot as a double narcissus flower in the dusk, bending towards some faint tune played to it somewhere oft in the fields. But all those little sounds ceased, one after another--they had meant nothing; and each time, her spirit returning--within the pale walls of the room, began once more to inhabit her lingering fingers. During that hour in her bedroom she lived through years. It was dark when she left it.|$|E
