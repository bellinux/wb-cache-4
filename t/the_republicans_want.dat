60|$|But {{although}} the peasants rejoiced, their leaders {{knew that the}} struggle could not long continue. The number of fighting men--that is to say, of the whole male population of La Vendee capable of bearing arms--had diminished terribly; indeed, the number that originally responded to the summons of the church bells was decreased by fully a half. Food was scarce. Owing to the continued absence of the peasants the harvest had, in many places, not been garnered; and wherever the Republican troops had passed, the destruction had been complete. A {{large portion of the}} population were homeless. The very movements of the Vendeans were hampered by the crowds of women and children who, with the few belongings that they had saved, packed in their little carts, wandered almost aimlessly through the country. Many of the towns were in ruins, and deserted; in all save a few secluded spots, as yet unvisited by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>want</b> and misery were universal.|$|E
25|$|Mink (1986) {{concludes that}} {{the link between the}} AFL and the Democratic Party rested in part on {{immigration}} issues, noting the large corporations, which supported <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>wanted</b> more immigration to augment their labor force.|$|R
5000|$|William L. Harris, one Mississippian secession commissioner, told {{a meeting}} of the Georgian general {{assembly}} that <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> to implement [...] "equality between the white and negro races" [...] and thus secession was necessary for the slave states to resist their efforts.|$|R
5000|$|According to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), {{he voted}} against <b>the</b> bill and <b>Republicans</b> filibustered it in general because Senator Reid refused to allow votes on a few {{amendments}} that <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted.</b> McConnell, arguing that the amendments were legitimate ones and not a delaying tactic, said that [...] "it's laughable to say it's obstructionism to allow the minority to have five or six amendment votes." ...|$|R

50|$|General Fernandez and Lon Nol {{left the}} country before the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh in 1975. All <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> to stop <b>the</b> Civil War in Cambodia. Several others {{officials}} such as Long Boret, Lon Non and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak remained in office until the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975. They mistakenly thought {{that they would be}} spared through the intercession of Norodom Sihanouk, but were executed by the Khmer Rouge.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{having an}} {{influential}} hand in {{city and state}} politics, Montana was known in <b>Republican</b> circles throughout <b>the</b> nation. In June 1936, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Convention met in Cleveland as they do every four years to nominate a top candidate from the party. During prohibition, Herbert Hoover was <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> President eventually replaced by the Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt; <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> position back. Montana was chosen as an alternate delegate from New York and mingled with top politicians as they endorsed Alf M. Landon and Frank Knox to run against FDR and his Vice President. While <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> lost <b>the</b> election, Montana was still noted as an influential man in Republican circles.|$|R
50|$|When Clinton {{refused to}} cut the budget in <b>the</b> way <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted,</b> Gingrich {{threatened}} to refuse to raise the debt limit, which would have caused the United States Treasury to suspend funding other portions {{of the government to}} avoid putting the country in default.|$|R
5000|$|Ezra Klein of The Washington Post {{has written}} that the Hastert Rule is [...] "more of an aspiration" [...] than a rule and that codifying it as a formal rule would be {{detrimental}} to House Republicans, as it would prevent them from voting against bills that <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> caucus <b>wanted</b> passed but {{that a majority of}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> to oppose for ideological or political reasons.|$|R
500|$|There {{were two}} main {{divisive}} issues in 1868. The {{first was the}} continued Reconstruction of the South. The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices, and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> endorsed <b>the</b> proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote. The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks. The Democrats wanted to redeem the bonds with $100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold. The greenbacks were known as [...] "cheap money" [...] and would be inflationary. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> to pay <b>the</b> redemption of war bonds only with gold, a position attractive to investors and bankers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Northumbrian <b>Republican</b> Movement (NRM) is a {{political}} group that seeks independence for Northern England with the Metropolis as its capitol. Factions vary from <b>the</b> Conservative <b>Republicans,</b> who <b>want</b> recognition as a separate Dominion or Kingdom with its own parliament, to <b>the</b> Radical <b>Republicans,</b> who <b>want</b> to be declared a separate country (the Republic of Northumbria). Its militant Armed Wing (<b>the</b> Northumbrian <b>Republican</b> Army) commits acts of violence against the British government in pursuit of its goals. It is rumored to receive support from America.|$|R
50|$|African American {{males were}} allowed to vote in Alabama until 1901, when the state disenfranchised them {{although}} still letting them register. <b>The</b> Negro <b>Republican</b> Party in Birmingham, Alabama was organized in opposition to <b>the</b> lily-white <b>Republican</b> party, after that party prevented any of the twenty-five black delegates from taking part in its Birmingham convention.In Maryland, while the Democrats were typically against allowing blacks to vote at all, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> to give them this and other basic rights, but many did not want blacks to hold important political offices or to have frequent contact with whites. Their vote was important to <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> though. In 1909, {{at a time when}} the Democrats were pushing for disenfranchisement in <b>the</b> state, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> called on all members of <b>the</b> Negro <b>Republican</b> Party to turn out on voting day in every district.|$|R
50|$|In other words, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> judges <b>wanted</b> {{to retain}} all state {{bankruptcy}} {{laws and the}} Federalists wanted to abolish them all.

50|$|Washington dedicates a {{large part}} of his {{farewell}} address to discussing foreign relations and the dangers of permanent alliances between the United States and foreign nations, which he views as foreign entanglements. This issue dominated national politics during the French Revolutionary Wars between France and Britain. Federalists favored Britain and <b>the</b> Jeffersonian <b>Republicans</b> favored France. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> U.S. to honor the 1778 Treaty of Alliance and to aid France, while the Federalists favored an alliance with Britain. Washington had avoided American involvement in the conflict by issuing the Proclamation of Neutrality, which in turn led to the Neutrality Act of 1794. He tries to further explain his approach to foreign policy and alliances in this portion of the address.|$|R
50|$|Tariffs {{soon became}} a major {{political}} issue as the Whigs (1832-1852) and (after 1854) <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> to protect their mostly northern industries and constituents by voting for higher tariffs and the Southern Democrats, which had very little industry but imported many goods voted for lower tariffs. Each party as it came into power voted to raise or lower tariffs under the constraints that the Federal Government always needed {{a certain level of}} revenues. The United States public debt was paid off in 1834 and President Andrew Jackson, a strong Southern Democrat, oversaw the cutting of the tariff rates roughly in half and eliminating nearly all federal excise taxes in about 1835.|$|R
5000|$|The party {{coalesced}} around Jefferson, who diligently maintained extensive {{correspondence with}} like-minded <b>Republican</b> leaders throughout <b>the</b> country. Washington frequently decried the {{growing sense of}} [...] "party" [...] emerging from the internal battles among Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, Adams and others in his administration. As warfare in Europe increased, the two factions increasingly made foreign policy the central political issue of <b>the</b> day. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> to maintain <b>the</b> 1777 alliance with France, which had overthrown the monarchy and aristocracy and become a republic. Even though Britain was by far America's leading trading partner, Republicans feared that increased trade would undermine republicanism. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> distrusted Hamilton's national bank and rejected his premise that a national debt was good for <b>the</b> country; <b>Republicans</b> said they were both forms of corruption. They strongly distrusted the elitism of Hamilton's circle, denouncing it as [...] "aristocratic"; and they called for states' rights lest the Federalists centralize ever more power in the national governments.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Missouri <b>Republicans</b> {{believe that}} <b>the</b> {{traditional}} {{family is the}} foundation of the U.S. and it is the country's future. <b>The</b> Missouri <b>Republicans</b> <b>want</b> to encourage <b>the</b> values of hard work and personal responsibility. They believe that marriage should only happen {{between a man and a}} woman, and that is the only type of marriage they will support no matter what state it took place in. The party also wants to end the marriage penalty in the state's tax code.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, both <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> and Democratic {{conventions}} {{moved to}} July, before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in August. One reason why <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>wanted</b> a July convention {{was to help}} avoid a drawn-out primary battle similar {{to what happened in}} 2012 that left the party fractured heading into the general election. The Democrats then followed suit so they could provide a quicker response to <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> rather than wait for more than two weeks until after the Olympics are over.|$|R
50|$|In 1891 De Lamar {{served as}} state senator {{in the first}} {{legislature}} of the new state of Idaho, and occupied the Chairmanship on Finance, Railroads and Constitutional Amendments. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>wanted</b> him as their candidate for the U.S. Senate, but, as biographer G. W. Barrett shows, DeLamar was never interested in becoming the first U. S. Senator from Idaho and declined to continue in politics. He moved to New York.|$|R
60|$|The {{campaign}} was a decidedly strenuous one. The Democrats {{made every effort}} to win, while on the other hand <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> who had <b>wanted</b> Governor Black for another term did not give to Mr. Roosevelt the support promised when his nomination had been made unanimous.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{pressure}} Britain {{to the brink}} of war (and assumed that America could defeat a weak Britain). Therefore, they denounced the Jay Treaty as an insult to American prestige, a repudiation of the French alliance of 1777, and a severe shock to Southern planters who owed those old debts, and who were never to collect for the lost slaves <b>the</b> British captured. <b>Republicans</b> protested against <b>the</b> treaty, and organized their supporters. The Federalists realized they had to mobilize their popular vote, so they mobilized their newspapers, held rallies, counted votes, and especially relied on the prestige of President Washington. The contest over the Jay Treaty marked the first flowering of grassroots political activism in America, directed and coordinated by two national parties. Politics was no longer the domain of politicians; every voter was called on to participate. The new strategy of appealing directly to the public worked for the Federalists; public opinion shifted to support the Jay Treaty. [...] The Federalists controlled the Senate and they ratified it by exactly the necessary ⅔ vote, 20-10, in 1795. However, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> did not give up and public opinion swung toward <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> after <b>the</b> Treaty fight; and in the South the Federalists lost most of the support they had among planters.|$|R
25|$|In 1823, {{during the}} First Costa Rican Civil War, Costa Rica {{was divided into}} two groups: the Imperialists, who were loyal to the First Mexican Empire, and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> who <b>wanted</b> independence. For the most part, Alajuela and San José fought against the coup staged by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in Heredia and Cartago. The Alajuelan side won, and Costa Rica left the Mexican Empire shortly before it dissolved. While Costa Rica {{was a member of}} the Federal Republic of Central America in the 1830s, the city of Alajuela was the nation's capital.|$|R
50|$|From the 1860s to the 1940s, {{conservative}} Democrats came to mean {{opposition to}} <b>the</b> Radical <b>Republicans</b> who <b>wanted</b> to grant full citizenship rights to freed slaves and take political power {{away from the}} ex-Confederates. In the 1940s, the Democratic Party began to advocate against segregation.|$|R
50|$|This {{plan for}} gradual {{emancipation}} infuriated <b>the</b> Radical <b>Republicans,</b> who <b>wanted</b> slavery abolished immediately. They took their grievances to Lincoln, {{who refused to}} take sides in the dispute. Provisional governor Gamble offered to resign, but the convention would not accept it. He died in office on 31 January 1864.|$|R
50|$|One health-care {{issue is}} the problem that healthy people will go without {{insurance}} and then buy coverage only if they need it, such as after an accident or a diagnosis of serious illness. Insurers that must cover such people have to charge high premiums to everyone, {{to be able to}} meet those expenses. The ACA addressed this problem by requiring everyone to purchase insurance and imposing a tax penalty on those who did not. This individual mandate {{was one of the most}} unpopular parts of the ACA, so <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> to repeal it. The AHCA would replace it with a provision that, if someone went without coverage for 63 days or more, an insurer could add a 30 percent surcharge to the premium. The original draft of the BCRA would have repealed the ACA's individual mandate but it did not include the AHCA's continuous coverage provision. A few days after the draft's release, therefore, it was amended to provide that someone who went without coverage for 63 days or more would have to wait six months to obtain new coverage.|$|R
500|$|On October 17, 2008, in Brunner v. Ohio <b>Republican</b> Party, 07A332, <b>the</b> United States Supreme Court {{overturned}} the 6th Circuit Decision requiring Brunner to provide lists of improperly registered voters to each county election board. [...] The ruling means that Brunner can instruct the 88 county boards of elections to ignore public record requests by <b>the</b> Ohio <b>Republican</b> Party made to challenge registrants with information mismatched between their registration and their driver's license or social security number. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party {{claimed that the}} ruling {{was based on a}} technicality rather than the merits of the arguments. [...] Bennett said that [...] "The justices did not disagree with our argument that Jennifer Brunner has failed to comply with federal election law. [...] They merely said we don't have a right to bring a private challenge against her under this particular provision." [...] The McCain-Palin campaign said [...] "...the United States Supreme Court does not address violations of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) by Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner. Rather, the Court ruled that Congress had likely not authorized private individuals or political parties to bring suit under the section of HAVA requiring voter registration verification through data-matching." [...] Since the ruling did not directly address the issues that <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> determined, they filed a similar case in the Ohio Supreme Court. [...] However, they withdrew the case.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>wanted</b> {{to achieve}} the gradual {{extinction}} of slavery by market forces, because its members believed that free labor was superior to slave labor. Southern leaders said <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> policy of blocking the expansion of slavery into the West made them second-class citizens, and challenged their autonomy. With the 1860 presidential victory of Abraham Lincoln, seven Deep South states whose economy was based on cotton and slavery decided to secede and form a new nation. The American Civil War broke out in April 1861 with the firing on Fort Sumter in South Carolina. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion, four more slave states seceded.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that there have been differing constructed narratives of this rebellion due to the problematic political alignments involved in the Cambodian struggle. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> government <b>wanted</b> to portray the Cambodian revolutionary movement as largely a foreign (mainly Vietnamese) transplant and preferred to gloss over the significance of indigenous leftist activity from 1967. Alternatively, F.U.N.K.(National United Front of Kampuchea) wanted to demonstrate unity between Sihanouk supporters and the Khmer Rouge, understating the extent of the development of the revolutionary opposition to Sihanouk before his overthrow.|$|R

However, they were defeated when Washington mobilized public opinion {{in favor of the}} treaty.|$|R
25|$|During the Civil War, Raymond {{supported}} Lincoln's {{policies in}} general, but protested his delays in aggressively prosecuting the war.

5000|$|Doggett accused <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> of <b>wanting</b> {{to make it}} difficult, if not impossible, for an Anglo Democrat to {{be elected}} to Congress from Texas, saying, [...] "The Republican Party is {{determined}} to make the Democratic Party a party of minorities — that is what this is about, as well." [...] He added that <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were deliberately trying to reduce Austin's clout in Congress by [...] "deny(ing) the capital city an opportunity to have a district that reflects the capital city."

50|$|On 16 April 1938, the Anglo-Italian pact was signed.

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the incident, university president Dennis H. Holtschneider issued a statement reaffirming the value of free speech and apologising for the harm caused by Yiannopolous's appearance on the campus. Attendees of the talk, organised by DePaul's College Republican's Chapter, criticised university police and event security for not removing the protesters. Yiannopoulos later stated that he and <b>the</b> College <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> a refund of the money that was paid to the security team that ultimately did nothing. The university later agreed to reimburse <b>the</b> College <b>Republicans</b> for <b>the</b> costs of event security. Within three days, the university's ratings on Facebook became overwhelmingly dominated by 1-star reviews. This ultimately accumulated over 16,000 1-star reviews that brought the university's average to 1.1, before the page's rating system was closed indefinitely.|$|R
