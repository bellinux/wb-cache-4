5|$|Assigned to the American Patrol Detachment, Schurz {{departed}} Charleston {{toward the}} end of April and, for the next two months, conducted patrols and performed escort duty and towing missions along the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 19 June, she departed New York for Key West. At 04:44 on the 21st, southwest of Cape Lookout lightship, she was rammed by the merchant ship Florida. The ship hit Schurz on the starboard side, crumpling that wing of the bridge, penetrating <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> berth deck about 12 feet, and cutting through bunker no. 3 to the forward fire room. One of Schurzs crewmen was killed instantly; twelve others were injured. Schurz was abandoned and sank three hours later. The ship was struck from the Navy list on 26 August 1918.|$|E
5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> blows up both <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E
5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number of reports {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles {{to make sense of}} what he sees as contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse makes no sense if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> the sacrifice in the temple could be two different versions of the story or, alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.|$|E

5|$|Maggie {{asks the}} group for help to remove a bloated walker that fell into a {{freshwater}} well before it contaminates the water. Glenn (Steven Yeun) is lowered down and saddles the walker with rope to pull it out, but as the group pulls it out, its body is ripped in half, its lower half falling back into <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> contaminating it. Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E
5|$|One {{consignment}} of 250 copies {{was stopped}} at Dover. Then the Chairman of the Board of Customs balked. He had read <b>The</b> <b>Well</b> <b>and</b> {{considered it a}} fine book, not at all obscene; he {{wanted no part of}} suppressing it. On 19 October he released the seized copies for delivery to Leopold Hill's premises, where the Metropolitan Police were waiting with a search warrant. Hill and Cape were summoned to appear at Bow Street Magistrates' Court to show cause why the book should not be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was useful}} in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia. One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is contaminated {{it may not be}} used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing a certain number of buckets of water from the well will remove the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in the well (or the well walls) rendering the well impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.|$|E

The North Penn Oil and Gas Company sunk a test well in 1902. They quickly failed, plugged <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> left the area. Methane gas escaped from <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> was used by the Wheaton family, owners of a nearby dairy farm.
