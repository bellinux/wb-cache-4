5|$|One of {{the first}} {{positions}} to develop within the code {{was referred to as}} the kick through. The position was unique to the Sheffield game and developed {{because of the lack of}} an offside rule. The job of the man playing in the kick through position was to remain near to the opposition's goal and wait for a through ball, a tactic today called cherry picking or goal hanging. By 1871 this position had become modern-day forwards. Cover goals developed in opposition of kick <b>throughs.</b> Despite their name their job was to man mark the kick through.|$|E
