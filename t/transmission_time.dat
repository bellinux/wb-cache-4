25|$|Dolphin {{brain stem}} <b>transmission</b> <b>time</b> is faster than that {{normally}} found in humans, and is approximately {{equivalent to the}} speed found in rats. As echo-location is the dolphin's primary means of sensing its environmentanalogous to eyes in primates – and since sound travels {{four and a half}} times faster in water than in air, scientists speculate that the faster brain stem <b>transmission</b> <b>time,</b> and perhaps the paralimbic lobe as well, assist quicker processing of sound. The dolphin's greater dependence on sound processing is evident in the structure of its brain: its neural area devoted to visual imaging is only about one-tenth that of the human brain, while the area devoted to acoustical imaging is about 10 times that of the human brain. Sensory experiments suggest a great degree of cross-modal integration in the processing of shapes between echolocative and visual areas of the brain. Unlike the case of the human brain, the cetacean optic chiasm is completely crossed, and there is behavioral evidence for hemispheric dominance for vision.|$|E

2500|$|In {{some other}} papers, Poincaré (1895, 1900b) argued that {{experiments}} {{like that of}} Michelson–Morley show the impossibility of detecting the absolute motion of matter, i.e., the relative motion of matter {{in relation to the}} aether. He called this the [...] "principle of relative motion". In the same year he interpreted Lorentz's local time {{as the result of a}} synchronization procedure based on light signals. He assumed that 2 observers A and B, which are moving in the aether, synchronize their clocks by optical signals. Since they believe themselves to be at rest, they must consider only the <b>transmission</b> <b>time</b> of the signals and then cross-reference their observations to examine whether their clocks are synchronous. However, from the point of view of an observer at rest in the aether, the clocks are not synchronous and indicate the local time [...] But because the moving observers do not know anything about their movement, they do not recognize this. So, contrary to Lorentz, Poincaré-defined local time can be measured and indicated by clocks. Therefore, in his recommendation of Lorentz for the Nobel Prize in 1902, Poincaré argued that Lorentz has convincingly explained the negative outcome of the aether drift experiments by inventing the [...] "diminished" [...] or [...] "local" [...] time, i.e. a time coordinate in which two events at different places could appear as simultaneous, although they are not simultaneous in reality.|$|E
2500|$|In 1900 Poincaré {{interpreted}} {{local time}} {{as the result of}} a synchronization procedure based on light signals. He assumed that 2 observers A and B which are moving in the ether, synchronize their clocks by optical signals. Since they believe to be at rest they must consider only the <b>transmission</b> <b>time</b> of the signals and then crossing their observations to examine whether their clocks are synchronous. However, from the point of view of an observer at rest in the ether the clocks are not synchronous and indicate the local time [...] But because the moving observers don't know anything about their movement, they don't recognize this. In 1904 he illustrated the same procedure in the following way: A sends a signal at the time 0 to B, which arrives at the time t. B also sends a signal at the time 0 to A, which arrives at the time t. If in both cases t has the same value the clocks are synchronous, but only in the system in which the clocks are at rest in the aether. So according to Darrigol Poincaré understood local time as a physical effect just like length contraction – in contrast to Lorentz, who used the same interpretation not before 1906. However, contrary to Einstein, who later used a similar synchronization procedure which was called Einstein synchronisation, Darrigol says that Poincaré had the opinion that clocks resting in the aether are showing the true time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} minimizing the energy used to transmit packets over a wireless link via lazy schedules that judiciously vary packet <b>transmission</b> <b>times.</b> The problem is motivated by the following key observation: In many channel coding schemes, the energy required to transmit a packet can be significantly reduced by lowering transmission power and transmitting the packet {{over a longer period}} of time. However, information is often time-critical or delay-sensitive and <b>transmission</b> <b>times</b> cannot be made arbitrarily long. We therefore consider packet transmission schedules that minimize energy subject to a deadline or a delay constraint. Specifically, we obtain an optimal offline schedule for a node operating under a deadline constraint. An inspection of the form of this schedule naturally leads us to an online schedule which is shown, through simulations, to be energy-efficient. Finally, we relax the deadline constraint and provide an exact probabilistic analysis of our offline scheduling algorithm. We then devise a lazy online algorithm that varies <b>transmission</b> <b>times</b> according to backlog and show that it is more energy efficient than a deterministic schedule that guarantees stability for the same range of arrival rates.
