40|$|Principles of {{development}} of parametric finite-element models of thread {{connections in the}} finite-element analysis system Abaqus? are examined. Models can be utilized for a complex analysis and optimization. The examples of calculations of different designs of thread connection of sucker rods, <b>tool-joint</b> thread connection of drill pipes, thread connection of tubing are considered. ??????????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????????? ???????-?????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ? ????? ???????-??????????? ???????

40|$|Abstract. One {{drill pipe}} ’ tool joint {{fractured}} rarely after just servicing ten days in drilling process of one natural gas well. Failure reason of <b>tool-joint</b> pin was researched through visual inspection, mechanical properties testing and working condition analysis. Results show that fracture failure reason is mainly {{due to the}} dramatic friction between the tool joint and the accumulated debris during the drill-string’s rotating process. Accumulated debris blocked mud’s circulation channel and leaded to poor circulation. The dramatic friction between the tool joint and accumulated debris leaded tool joint’s local temperature to risen significantly, and reduced its carrying capacity. In the end, tool joint fractured under the effect of tensile and torsional loads...|$|E
40|$|Acoustical data {{transmission}} {{through the wall}} of drill pipes is considered. Drill pipes are known to behave like bandpass filters; {{the position of the}} pass bands can be determined analytically. This work extends the frequency domain drill pipe models presented by Barnes and Kirkwood [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 51, 1606 – 1608 (1972) ], and more recently by Drumheller [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 85, 1048 – 1064 (1989) ]. The approach discussed in this paper has the advantage that it yields explicit expressions for the fine structure of the drill pipe's frequency response in the pass bands. It furthermore allows the effect of energy dissipation and pipe segment length variations {{to be included in the}} model. The emphasis of the paper, however, lies on the time domain modeling of the drill pipe. The propagation of sound energy pulses through its wall, and the effect of multiple reflections and/or transmissions during this propagation, are described using a Markov chain. Explicit expressions result for the expected duration of an energy pulse's trip from one end of the drill pipe to the other, depending upon the number of drill pipe segments and the transmission coefficient at the <b>tool-joints</b> connecting them. The results are applicable to any situation where sound or energy transmission through a cascade of acoustic components occur...|$|R
