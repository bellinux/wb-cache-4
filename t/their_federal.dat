5|$|As {{early as}} 2008, {{advocacy}} groups in Maryland and New York, and <b>their</b> <b>federal</b> representatives, pushed for legislation to establish two national historical parks honoring Harriet Tubman: one to include her {{place of birth}} on Maryland's eastern shore, and sites along {{the route of the}} Underground Railroad in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties in Maryland; and a second to include her home in Auburn, NY. For the next six years, bills to do so were introduced, but were never advanced or enacted. Meantime, in 2013, President Barack Obama used his executive authority to create the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument, consisting of federal lands on Maryland's Eastern Shore at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
5|$|Lethal {{injection}} is {{the practice}} of injecting one or more drugs into a person by a government {{for the express purpose}} of causing immediate death. While Nazi Germany was known to execute enemies of the state using an injection of lethal drugs, the first country to legalize and formally implement what is referred to today as lethal injection was the United States. The state of Texas adopted it as its form on capital punishment in 1977 and executed the first person by it, Charles Brooks Jr., in 1982. The practice was subsequently adopted by the other U.S. states using capital punishment. As of 2017, the method is being used by 31 U.S. states, as well as by <b>their</b> <b>federal</b> government and military.|$|E
