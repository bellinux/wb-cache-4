25|$|Fayette Avery McKenzie {{was born}} July 31, 1872, in Montrose, Pennsylvania, {{one of four}} sons of Edwin and Gertrude McKenzie, a {{merchant}} and a homemaker. McKenzie's father lost nearly everything in the financial crash of 1876. In 1890, {{the family moved to}} South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where McKenzie completed his senior year in high school. McKenzie attended Lehigh University from 1891 to 1895, where he earned a B.S. and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Upon graduating from Lehigh University in 1895, McKenzie spent the summer studying at the University of Pennsylvania under Franklin Henry Giddings, a prominent sociologist and economist from Bryn Mawr College, and Simon Nelson Patten, Professor of Economics at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. For the next two years, McKenzie tutored families of railroad officials of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1897, Martin Grove Brumbaugh, a long-time McKenzie family friend and President of Juniata College, in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, offered McKenzie a position at the college teaching French, German, English, history, and economics. In 1900, Brumbaugh, who was to become Governor of Pennsylvania from 1915 to 1919, helped McKenzie secure a scholarship to pursue doctoral work in sociology and economics at the University of Pennsylvania. To help pay his living expenses while in school, McKenzie taught modern languages at the Blight School for Boys in Philadelphia, often teaching five hours prior <b>to</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the university for classes and study in the evening.|$|E

25|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Imam Aqa Ali Shah {{maintained}} {{close ties with}} the Nimatullahi Sufi order. This relationship was no doubt facilitated by the common Alid heritage that Aqa Ali Shah and the Nimatullahis shared: both Shah Nimatullah Wali (d. 1430-1), the eponymous founder of the order, and Aqa Ali Shah traced their ancestry to the Shia Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq and, hence, to Ali. It appears that the affiliation between the Nimatullahis and the Nizari Imams can be traced {{at least as far}} back as the 18th century to the 40th Nizari Imam, Shah Nizar, who had close connections with the order. Prior <b>to</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> India, Aqa Ali Shah had developed close relations with the leader of one of the Nimatullahi branches, Rahmat Ali Shah, who had been a guest of Aga Khan I in Mahallat in 1833. After Rahmat Ali Shah's death in 1861, Aqa Ali Shah often sent money from India for the recitation of the Qur'an at his grave in Shiraz. Aqa Ali Shah also had close ties with Rahmat Ali Shah's uncle as well as one of Rahmat Ali Shah's successors, Munawwar ‘Alī Shāh (d. 1884). Aqa Ali Shah received a number of important visitors belonging to the Nimatullahi order, including Rahmat Ali Shah's son Muḥammad Ma‘Ṣūm Shīrāzī, who visited India in 1881 and stayed with Aqa Ali Shah for a year. Another prominent figure of the Nimatullahi order received by Aqa Ali Shah was Safi Ali Shah, who first went to India in 1863 at Aqa Ali Shah's invitation.|$|E

In 2008, due to her character's HIV scare, Metcalfe feared she was <b>to</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be fired from the serial and had to seek reassurance from the producer that her fears were unfounded. In 2011 Metcalfe stated her plans {{to stay with the}} serial indefinitely, saying, [...] "I never get bored or lose interest" [...] with her storylines and scripts. In 2012, Kirkwood said that due to Metcalfe being the first actress he cast in Hollyoaks he was [...] "so chuffed that she's becoming a real star". He added that [...] "telling stories for Mercedes is as exciting now as it was on day one". In 2013, Metcalfe revealed to The Mirror that she was proud of portraying the character [...] "everyone loves to hate". In May 2013, Metcalfe signed a new contract keeping her on the soap for at least another year.|$|E
