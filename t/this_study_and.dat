5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to be close to 15,000.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the species}} (when {{it was known}} as Calvatia utriformis) has been {{separated}} into three varieties (C.utriformis var. utriformis, C.utriformis var. hungarica and C.utriformis var. gruberi) based on differences in the ornamentation of the exoperidium (outer tissue layer of the wall, or peridium) and spores. However, a 1997 study of these characters revealed that the three varieties are not clearly demarcated. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> others suggest that variations in the environmental conditions in which the specimens are grown can affect {{the development of these}} characteristics.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{instruments}} is unclear, though {{there have been many}} suggestions. Historical accounts, of which the earliest date from 588CE, note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the kakko, a drum that originated in South China. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko. Certain court music styles, especially gigaku and gagaku, arrived in Japan through both Korea and China. In both traditions, dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko. Certain percussive patterns and terminology in togaku, an early dance and music style in Japan, in addition to physical features of the kakko, also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E

25|$|Carbon-dating studies {{published}} in 1996 of {{material from the}} mound appeared to place the Serpent Mound construction as later than the span of the Adena.

25|$|Vicari et al. {{describe}} that {{it remains unclear}} whether neural circuits involved in semantic and episodic memory overlap partially or completely, and this case {{seems to suggest that}} the two systems are independent. Both of the patient's hippocampal and diencephalic structures on the right and left sides were disconnected. When C.L. came to Vicari et al.'s office, her chief complaint was forgetfulness involving both semantic and episodic memory. After administering a battery of neuropsychological tests, Vicari determined that C.L. performed well in tests of visual naming and sentence comprehension, visual-spatial ability, and “general semantic knowledge about the world.” They also noted an improved vocabulary and general knowledge base after 18 months. C.L.'s episodic memory, on the other hand, was far below expectations: She could not retain daily events, where she had gone on vacation, the names of places she had been, and other such information. However, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> others like it are susceptible to subjectivity, since it is not always possible to clearly distinguish between episodic and semantic memory. For this reason, the topic remains controversial and debated.|$|E
25|$|The {{most direct}} evidence, {{according}} to Kahneman, is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of TomW., a fictional graduate student. One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student {{in each of}} nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate how {{likely it is that}} Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the base rates, i.e., the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom {{is more likely to be}} a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.|$|E
