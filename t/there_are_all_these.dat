500|$|The My Little Pony toys {{have been}} {{collected}} mainly by women {{who grew up with}} the toys during the 1980s and 1990s, before Hasbro revived the toy series with its Friendship Is Magic line. Bonnie Zacherle, the original creator of the franchise, noted that the toys and show were originally conceived to appeal to preschool children of both genders, and considers it a [...] "good thing" [...] for the adult fandom to have the same appreciation of the show as the collectors. According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and nobody seemed to care. But now that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> guys in their 20s that are crazy about it, it's suddenly important and it means something." [...] Hayes also said, [...] "To the bronies, I say, I think My Little Pony is awesome, so more power to you".|$|E
60|$|Surely, not the {{pavement}} of Paris? Yes, I think it is, too. I don't know {{any other place}} where <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> high houses, all these haggard-looking wine shops, all these billiard tables, all these stocking-makers with flat red or yellow legs of wood for signboard, all these fuel shops with stacks of billets painted outside, and real billets sawing in the gutter, all these dirty corners of streets, all these cabinet pictures over dark doorways representing discreet matrons nursing babies. And yet this morning - I'll think {{of it in a}} warm-bath.|$|E
60|$|David tells us, that God {{heard the}} VOICE of his supplication, {{the voice of}} his cry, the voice of his tears, {{and the voice of}} his roaring. For indeed <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> without this {{acceptable}} sound in them, nor can any thing but sense, and affection, and fervent desire, make them sound well in the ears of God. Tears, supplications, prayers, cries, may be all of them done in formality, hypocrisy, and from other causes, and to other ends than that which is honest and right in God's sight: For God as he had experience of, would search and look after the VOICE of his tears, supplications, roarings, prayers, and cries.|$|E
5000|$|An {{indifferent}} {{student in}} her early years, Piercy developed a love of books when she came down with rheumatic fever in her mid-childhood and could do little but read. [...] "It taught me that there's a different world <b>there,</b> that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> horizons that <b>were</b> quite different from what I could see".|$|R
5000|$|He {{described}} it as [...] "a very weird experience. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> white collar workers conscientiously putting together music with the precision of chemists. Way before Brian Eno was doing it, these guys were doing it for real. They were pre-occupied with the pace of workers in factories, and how to maximise their efficiency." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] he said. [...] "I {{stood like}} a stuffed calf. She just looked back once, you know, and stood smiling like and crying--I {{could see the}} shine of her eyes--and then she <b>was</b> gone, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> little fellows bustling about me, {{stuffing}} my 'ands and my pockets {{and the back of}} my collar and everywhere with gold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I seem to feel," [...] went on Bastin, [...] "is that I {{have work}} to my hand here. Also, the locum tenens at Fulcombe no doubt runs the parish as well as I could. Indeed I {{consider}} him a better man for the place than I am. That old Oro is a tough proposition, but I do not despair of him yet, and besides him there is the Glittering Lady, a most open-minded person, whom I have not yet had any real opportunity of approaching in a spiritual sense. Then <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> natives who cannot learn without a teacher. So on the whole I think I would rather stay where I am until Providence points out some other path." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] {{said one}} of us, [...] "if Shakspeare were living, {{what he would say}} to our times, and what he would think of all the {{questions}} that are agitating the world now." [...] That he did have thoughts whose roots ran far beyond the depth of the age in which he lived, is plain enough from numberless indications in his plays; but whether he would have taken any practical interest in the world's movements is a fair question. The poetic mind is not always the progressive one; it has, like moss and ivy, a need for something old to cling to and germinate upon. The artistic temperament, too, is soft and sensitive; so <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> reasons for thinking that perhaps he would have been for keeping {{out of the way of}} the heat and dust of modern progress. It does not follow because a man has penetration to see an evil, he has energy to reform it.|$|E
6000|$|However, on this May {{afternoon}} in 1796, {{it is early}} days with him. He is only 26, and has but recently become a general, partly by using his wife to seduce the Directory (then governing France) partly by the scarcity of officers caused by the emigration as aforesaid; partly by his faculty of knowing a country, with all its roads, rivers, hills and valleys, as he knows {{the palm of his}} hand; and largely by that new faith of his in the efficacy of firing cannons at people. His army is, as to discipline, in a state which has so greatly shocked some modern writers before whom the following story has been enacted, that they, impressed with the later glory of [...] "L'Empereur," [...] have altogether refused to credit it. But Napoleon is not [...] "L'Empereur" [...] yet: he has only just been dubbed [...] "Le Petit Caporal," [...] and is in the stage of gaining influence over his men by displays of pluck. He is {{not in a position to}} force his will on them, in orthodox military fashion, by the cat o' nine tails. The French Revolution, which has escaped suppression solely through the monarchy's habit of being at least four years in arrear with its soldiers in the matter of pay, has substituted for that habit, as far as possible, the habit of not paying at all, except in promises and patriotic flatteries which are not compatible with martial law of the Prussian type. Napoleon has therefore approached the Alps in command of men without money, in rags, and consequently indisposed to stand much discipline, especially from upstart generals. This circumstance, which would have embarrassed an idealist soldier, has been worth a thousand cannon to Napoleon. He has said to his army, [...] "You have patriotism and courage; but you have no money, no clothes, and deplorably indifferent food. In Italy <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things, and glory as well, to be gained by a devoted army led by a general who regards loot as the natural right of the soldier. I am such a general. En avant, mes enfants!" [...] The result has entirely justified him. The army conquers Italy as the locusts conquered Cyprus. They fight all day and march all night, covering impossible distances and appearing in incredible places, not because every soldier carries a field marshal's baton in his knapsack, but because he hopes to carry at least half a dozen silver forks there next day.|$|E
50|$|During this time, {{a series}} of skilful mansion break-ins {{occurred}} along the East Coast, in which high values of silver were taken. These initially puzzled their investigators, as Detective Jack McGiness of the Philadelphia serious crime unit later explained:Suddenly <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> burglaries that had Nordahl's modus operandi all over them. We {{thought that he was}} locked up, but then discovered that he was not.|$|R
5000|$|He {{would later}} {{describe}} his experience: [...] "There {{was so much}} going on with the music. Like with bebop, we had a long period of just salivating on. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> different idioms within a genre, the avant-garde and free music, bebop still, and of course the music of John Coltrane and Miles. It was just a hell of a period. And then <b>there</b> <b>was</b> also the political scene going on...." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{different}} writers, {{but everything}} ended up sounding {{with the same}} energy. I've never felt anything like that energy — raucous, raw.... It wasn't the most accurate of bands, but the actual power, and the wildness of the soloing.... It was so exciting. Regardless of who wrote what, once {{we got to the}} meat of the music, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> fireworks.... A lot of spunk, man, a lot of testosterone going around! ...|$|R
5000|$|According to vocalist/guitarist Mike Vennart: [...] "at the {{beginning}} of 'Ornament/The Last Wrongs' <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> weird ambient noises {{and what it was}} is that a friend of ours was in the Amazon jungle and recorded all these parrots. They sounded like kids laughing and shouting, not parrots." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cardiff {{includes}} many house concerts on his tours, frequently preceding a larger public show with an intimate {{performance in a}} fan's living room. [...] "There are people connecting, people introducing themselves to each other. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> different groups of friends," [...] he says, [...] "and honestly, that’s one of the neatest things about shows like that, people are just opening up their homes." ...|$|E
50|$|Guitarist Mike McCready on the song:I wrote {{part of that}} one. I {{had this}} Gretsch Country Gentleman and I started jamming on this little thing in D (sings riff); the riff {{just came out of}} that. Stone came up with his weird part. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> strange, disjointed parts that kind of turned into a song. Stone's doing {{something}} weird, Jeff's doing something weird and offbeat, but for some reason it works, I really don't know why.|$|E
5000|$|Mila Kunis - Actress, told GQ in 2011 she has vintage Star Trek {{figures and}} a signed photo from Leonard Nimoy. She's even {{attended}} a Trek conference. [...] "I {{went to the}} Star Trek Experience in Vegas maybe five years ago. I hung out {{with a bunch of}} fake characters inside Quark's bar. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> actors <b>there</b> pretending to <b>be</b> the different characters from the different shows. Yes, I loved it." [...] Her favorite series is The Next Generation.|$|R
50|$|In 1953 Hoyland went {{abroad for}} the first time, hitch-hiking with a friend to the South of France. After the bleakness of Sheffield it was a revelation: 'To me it was like landing in Tahiti. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> still {{rationing}} here. Down <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> brown girls, swimming and diving, and <b>all</b> <b>these</b> grapes.' Hoyland visited again in 1957 with David Smith {{when he was at}} the Royal Academy and got what he referred to as 'The Gauguin syndrome', a lifelong romance with travel and the south.|$|R
5000|$|... "We were rehearsing {{and writing}} Satellite {{a couple of}} blocks away from the school. One day {{on the way to the}} studio, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{helicopters}} and cars speeding by. We really didn’t know what was going on. When we got to the studio, this guy had the news on, and he was like, ‘This kid just went and started blasting fools.’ So we started jamming, and that rhythm just naturally came out then Wuv drummer put that drumbeat on it, and the song was born." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hornby {{has also}} {{developed}} {{a career as a}} screenwriter, and has said that he enjoys the challenge of working in film as opposed to writing novels. In his BAFTA & BFI Screenwriters' Lecture he said, “once you get to a certain point in your novelistic career, unless you screw up very badly the book is going to come out. With a screenplay <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> hurdles that seem {{to have some kind of}} objectivity to them. The screenplay has to work and I love that.” ...|$|E
50|$|Because I’m {{just the}} worst under pressure. When someone {{tells me that}} I am {{supposed}} to do something, you’re {{not going to get}} it. I’m gonna slam. It has to be spontaneous for me. Every once in a while, I’ll get a request and somehow end up doing it, but usually, I can’t. Even if it’s fairly easy, I won’t be able to do it. With those contests, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> people watching who have such high expectations for me, I can only lose. I hate it. I don’t want to let anybody down so I just shut down.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1986 the group's line-up was Pigott, Bell, Nicolette Boaz on keyboards, Bill Heckenberg on {{drums and}} Geoff Lundren on bass guitar. Hunter had {{returned}} to his work with Dragon. During 1986 Melanie Oxley provided backing vocals. Scribble toured {{in support of the}} album and its singles. They disbanded in 1987 and Pigott continued song writing with Hunter. Hunter revealed that [...] "there are film projects that we've got that we have to start soon... <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> projects on hold. Dragon's taking up a lot of time at the moment." [...] Although achieving some cult interest there was little commercial success for Scribble. Both Borkman (1989) and Caen (1989, 1995) were later members of Dragon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{director}} of a 2010 stage production of Rabbit Hole, Robert A. Norman, declared, [...] "The 2010 movie version starring Nicole Kidman lacked the humor and hopefulness of the stage script. Our production will have plenty of both of those things." [...] However, Abaire, who wrote both the stage play and screenplay, believes, [...] "For the film, we cut so much that worked in the play that I worried we had cut all the laughs. But <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> other laughs I didn't know were there." ...|$|R
2500|$|ELP's {{record deal}} {{provided}} funds for Emerson {{to buy his}} own Moog modular synthesizer. He later said, [...] "It {{cost a lot of}} money and it arrived and I excitedly got it out of the box stuck it on the table and thought, 'Wow That's Great! a Moog synthesizer [...] How do you switch it on?... <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> leads and stuff, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no instruction manual." [...] The patch which had been provided by Mike Vickers produced six distinctive Moog sounds, and these six became the foundation of ELP's sound.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, The Sunday Times {{published}} an article called [...] "The Woman Who Started a Cult," [...] referring to the brand's cult-like following and Germany's suspicion that Dermalogica was affiliated with Scientology. In the article, Jane Wurwand said, [...] "We had to sign a document declaring we had never been affiliated with Scientology, because <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> people smiling, {{saying the same thing}} so enthusiastically. They assumed we did a form of brainwashing. I suppose I can see why — we do talk about Dermalogica like a tribe on a mission." ...|$|R
5000|$|David Mirkin, who {{produced}} the episode, {{responded to the}} criticism {{in an interview with}} The Newcastle Herald by saying: [...] "We like to have the Simpsons, the entire family, travel and this was the beginning of that. Australia was a fantastic choice because it has lots of quirky visual things. And it's a country that is really very close to America, very in sync with America. We are so similar but yet <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> fantastic differences, familiar yet twisted. It was intentional to make it very inaccurate. That was our evil side coming out: We'll take our knowledge of Australia and we'll twist it around to stimulate an audience and annoy them at the same time." [...] Despite being criticized for mocking the country, the episode received positive reviews from Australians, too. Jim Schembri of the Australian newspaper The Age named it the funniest episode ever.|$|E
5000|$|Snyder {{eventually}} became a lieutenant in the Navy, and served in Afghanistan as an explosive ordnance disposal officer. In September 2011, he lost both of his eyes after stepping on an IED {{in an attempt to}} help victims of another bombing. The explosion also gave him lacerations to his face and a shattered eardrum. Snyder subsequently spent three weeks in intensive care, and then recovered for another five weeks in Florida. He explained, [...] "When you’re kind of patching your life back together and figuring out how to adjust to blindness, you’re not good at anything. Walking was a challenge. Cooking’s a challenge. Dressing and color matching is a challenge. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things that used to be no problem that are all of a sudden really challenging. I had a hard time getting the right amount of toothpaste on the toothbrush, because I can’t see it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song, which {{describes}} a partner's {{commitment to a}} relationship despite having moments of difficulty, was written by Rae immediately after an argument with her late husband Jason Rae in January 2008. She stated {{in an interview with}} The Observers Sean O'Hagan that [...] "It was written literally just after me and Jason had this massive disagreement, a big argument, a bad one. Almost as he was leaving the room, I just sat down and wrote it. It's just about how I felt about him at that time. Even {{right in the middle of}} the worst times, I remember thinking that I would choose this exact life again, that I would do it all again. It was me saying, I'm not wishing myself out of this situation. I'm 100 percent committed to this person. I don't have any regrets about this relationship even though <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> difficult times." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} first {{performed}} at the Glastonbury Festival in 1995, where Cocker explained his inspiration. [...] "'Sorted for E's and wizz' is a phrase a girl that I met in Sheffield once told me... {{and she went to}} see The Stone Roses at Spike Island and I said [...] "what do you remember about it?". And she said [...] "Well <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> blokes walking around saying 'Is everybody sorted for E's and wizz?'" [...] And that's all she remembered about it and I {{thought it was a good}} phrase." ...|$|R
2500|$|These {{are things}} {{related to the}} past and the {{environment}} I found myself in at the time. In the early '90s, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> different youth gangs in Norway and one thing led to another. I was involved in gang fights and had false friends [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> no political disposition – not with me nor any of my friends. But you had to profess allegiance to a certain group if you wanted to defend yourself and not get your ass kicked. [...] But <b>there</b> have definitely <b>been</b> changes and an evolution in my thinking. I'm a different person today.|$|R
50|$|A {{friend of}} mine (Carlo Ditta) who owns Orleans Records here in New Orleans {{approached}} me {{with the idea of}} working with him on a Delta record, a blues record where you just play acoustic and {{do what you want to}} do. There's so much good material here in New Orleans from the early 50s and 60s, and he still had a box of 45s. We went through them, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> hit records that weren't hit records; maybe regional hits by artists from New Orleans. I picked out the stuff that worked with my voice.|$|R
5000|$|Well {{that depends}} on {{what we want to}} do at the time. It depends. I don't know. Yeah, exactly. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{considerations}} you're talking about. But yes, it just depends on the moment you're asked. If you feel it and if you feel something creatively interesting then it's possible. For everything that we're asked to do, if we have a creative answer and think we might bring something to a project then we can do it. But if we don't have any ideas or don't think we can push the envelope by creating with anybody... Well, if you take Sébastien Tellier for example it is one of the few collaborations where I had the idea that I could do something and bring something to it. But it's all about the moment and the situation. When it feels right to us, when we feel it we do it, and when we have the time. There's so many factors.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2015, it was {{announced}} that composer Ludwig Göransson would score Creed, marking the second feature-length film collaboration between Göransson and director Ryan Coogler after Fruitvale Station (2013). Influenced by 1970s culture and the musical legacy of the Rocky film series, Coogler noted that [...] "the music was a big focal point" [...] for the film, stating, [...] "'Eye of the Tiger', 'No Easy Way Out', all those songs were a massive hit. And we embraced that. We recorded original songs for the movie." [...] Göransson brought in an array of artists to modernize the orchestral aspects of the soundtrack. [...] "The first name that came to mind was obviously Meek Mill, because we needed a voice from Philly," [...] said Göransson. [...] "For me that was an obvious choice for the big training montage. It's all full orchestral, and it has some dark 808s under it. In the middle <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> dirt bikes coming out, and there's a 45-second rap verse that Meek Mill is doing over that." [...] Other musicians that recorded with Göransson specifically for the film include Donald Glover, Future, Vince Staples, and Jhené Aiko.|$|E
5000|$|Cereghino has {{published}} 12 novels, and a non-fiction {{collection of short}} stories. In 2015, his novel [...] "116* Days With Dad" [...] was published by Black Hill Press, which was loosely based on {{his experience as a}} commercial fisherman on the Alaskan fishing vessels. He was reported as saying, [...] "I went to Alaska, and it turned into a great story. At first, I thought it was the worst job in the world. You have no time off, and you spend 18 to 22 hours a day waist deep in fish blood and guts," [...] he said. [...] "Then when you get on shore <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> bears, and you stink like fish." [...] An earlier publication of Cereghino's eleventh novel [...] "A Time To Lie" [...] has been his best seller to date. Since 2004, he has also been a contributing author to the Chicken Soup for the Soul Series of books, appearing in publications of Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul IV as well as being included in the top 101 Chicken Soup for the Soul stories of all time in the book, Chicken Soup for the Soul:Christmas Cheer. Later in 2015, his novel, [...] "Kiki's Angel" [...] was published by same publishing house as [...] "A Time to Lie." ...|$|E
5000|$|After the marriage, {{father and}} son {{returned}} to Calcutta and Nag Mahasaya set up his medical practice. Nag Mahasaya also began to accept fees {{for the treatment of}} patients. About this time he lost his aunt. This was the first instance of bereavement in his life. His biography mentions that his disenchantment with the material possessions arose with this incident- [...] "With death all relationships cease, so why should <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> [...] "I" [...] and [...] "mine"?

[...] "We figured <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> songs by men bashing women and {{treating}} women like sex objects. So we decided a song that turned the tables on men might attract some attention". According to Gillette, {{the point of the}} song is to [...] "strike back at all the women-bashing songs in pop, especially in rap". The music video images Gillette singing [...] "Short Dick Man" [...] or [...] "Short Short Man" [...] on a beach alternate with those of a brawny man performing a photo session.|$|R
5000|$|In an NPR interview, Jonathan Spottiswoode {{made this}} {{comment on the}} paradox of {{being a member of}} a well loved band but still having to {{struggle}} financially in the harsh environment of the modern music industry: [...] "Maybe <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an illusion that was created in the '50s and '60s and '70s where <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> huge bands making tons of money and <b>there</b> still <b>are</b> a few. But I think maybe the old-fashioned way, where you just — you're an itinerant musician and you depended on the kindness of strangers is — maybe that's the path again these days as things kind of implode." ...|$|R
