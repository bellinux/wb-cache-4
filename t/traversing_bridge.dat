50|$|The {{station has}} an unusual luggage <b>traverser</b> <b>bridge,</b> {{which can be}} moved out over the track to give access to {{platform}} 1 from the ticket hall. It is mainly used for disabled passengers and at peak times for the large flow of students to Brockenhurst College.|$|R
50|$|Annagh is <b>traversed</b> by <b>Bridge</b> Street, Daisy Hill, the N87 road (Ireland) {{and some}} demesne lanes.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed limit}} is 45 mph between Milepost 27 to Milepost 29, {{approaching}} and <b>traversing</b> the <b>bridge,</b> {{one of two}} stretches on the Parkway where the speed limit is so reduced (the other is between Milepost 126.7 and 127.7, approaching and <b>traversing</b> the Driscoll <b>Bridge).</b> The Beesley's Point Generating Station {{can be seen from}} the bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} of the canal took 15 years, from 1839-1854 and covered 80 km of which 17 km were underground. The canal also <b>traverses</b> 18 <b>bridges.</b>|$|R

60|$|Passing the school, {{still taking}} its {{enforced}} holiday, {{the father and}} daughter <b>traversed</b> the <b>bridge</b> and entered the growing suburb known as Bankside, where wretched cottages belonging to needy, grasping proprietors, formed an uncomfortable contrast to the villa residences interspersed among them.|$|R

50|$|Finally, {{downstream}} from the Hamilton Dam is an inflatable dam {{just west of}} the Grand <b>Traverse</b> Street <b>Bridge.</b> The Fabridam was completed in 1979 mostly for visual and recreational purposes as it impounds very little of the river. It was replaced in 2001 with a $604,000 Obermeyer Hydro Inc. dam.|$|R
5000|$|State Road 679, a hook-shaped north-south {{road with}} a four-lane divided {{northern}} half (between SR 682 and Tierra Verde) and a two-lane southern half serving Fort DeSoto Park {{at the tip}} of the [...] "hook" [...] (50 cents toll).

5000|$|The engine route {{availability}} {{on the bridge}} since the Grouping had been [...] "yellow", meaning that only the lightest locomotives could <b>traverse</b> the <b>bridge.</b> Special authorisation was given for the 63XX class of 2-6-0 locomotive to use the bridge during the periods when the Severn Tunnel was closed for maintenance. South Wales to London trains generally ran via Gloucester during these closures.|$|R

50|$|The Münchenstein rail {{disaster}} on 14 June 1891 was historically {{the worst}} railway accident ever to affect Switzerland. A crowded passenger train fell through a girder bridge, killing over seventy people and injuring many more. The accident {{occurred on the}} railway line between Basel and Delémont, near the Bruckgut just below the village centre of Münchenstein, as the train was <b>traversing</b> the <b>bridge</b> across the river Birs.|$|R
50|$|With {{the start}} of World War II, the Type 97 contributed {{significantly}} to the Japanese victories at the Battle of Malaya and the Battle of the Philippines, as its light weight enabled the tank to <b>traverse</b> unsupported <b>bridges</b> and ferry crossing which would be unable to take heavier tanks, and its small size allowed it to travel along the long winding and narrow roads at that time.|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} form of {{the problem}} asks for a path that <b>traverses</b> all <b>bridges</b> and also has the same starting and ending point. Such a walk is called an Eulerian circuit or an Euler tour. Such a circuit exists if, and only if, the graph is connected, {{and there are no}} nodes of odd degree at all. All Eulerian circuits are also Eulerian paths, but not all Eulerian paths are Eulerian circuits.|$|R
50|$|Day-asan Floating Villages. Dense {{forest of}} {{mangroves}} dominate {{a cluster of}} villages built along shallow water channels. Instead of tricycles, locals use wooden boats as their prime mode of transport. Two foot <b>bridges</b> <b>traverse</b> across swift moving channels.|$|R
50|$|The older {{portion of}} the station {{occupies}} part of the central reservation of the Autopista Central, which is sunken. Two street-level mezzanines at {{the northern and southern}} extremes of the station are connected with <b>bridges</b> <b>traversing</b> the highway.|$|R
50|$|Another, more {{contemporary}} theory {{based on the}} study of the evolution of languages suggests that starting 4000-2000 BC, Austronesian groups descended from Yunnan Plateau in China and settled in what is now the Philippines by sailing using balangays or by <b>traversing</b> land <b>bridges</b> coming from Taiwan. Many of these Austronesians settled on the Philippine islands and became the ancestors of the present-day Filipinos and later colonizing most of the Pacific islands and Indonesia to the south.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, Stopham Bridge was {{replaced}} by a new reinforced concrete bridge, located 100 feet North of the old bridge, to alleviate the large queues which built up at this point and due to increasing levels of damage {{to the inside of the}} parapet by vehicles <b>traversing</b> the <b>bridge.</b> Due to poor ground conditions, the piers of the new bridge are supported on piles that go down between 15 and 20 metres to the sandstone bedrock.|$|R
50|$|It is bounded on {{the north}} by Annagh townland, on the west by Derryginny townland, on the south by Agharaskilly townland and on the east by Mullaghduff townland. Its chief {{geographical}} features are the Shannon-Erne Waterway which flows north along its western boundary and a central drumlin hill which rises over 200 feet above sea level. Cullyleenan is <b>traversed</b> by <b>Bridge</b> Street, the N87 road (Ireland), the Agharaskilly road, the Chapel Road and by the disused Cavan & Leitrim Railway.|$|R
50|$|Palo Alto {{is served}} by two major freeways, Highway 101, and Interstate 280, and is traversed by the Peninsula's main north-south boulevard, El Camino Real (SR 82). The city is also served {{indirectly}} by State Route 84 which <b>traverses</b> the Dumbarton <b>Bridge</b> to the north.|$|R
2500|$|The route {{begins at}} Highway 50 (Begin Boulevard) {{at the new}} Benzion Netanyahu Interchange {{just west of the}} Beit Hanina {{neighborhood}} of Jerusalem. [...] From there the route <b>traverses</b> a <b>bridge</b> over the Atarot Stream. [...] East of the bridge, the route connects to the existing Abdul Hamid Shomaan Street (Road 4197) 0.5km before the intersection where the planned north-south Jerusalem Road 21 will cross. [...] Originally a 2-lane road, Shoman Street has been upgraded as a 4 lane divided boulevard including new sidewalks and infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|The North Arm Bridge {{does not}} carry {{automotive}} vehicles, as the neighbouring Oak Street Bridge does. The bridge has two tracks enabling SkyTrains to pass each other either way <b>traversing</b> the <b>bridge</b> between Bridgeport Station in Richmond and Marine Drive Station in south Vancouver. The main span is 180 metres (591 ft) {{and has a}} total length of 562 m (1844 ft). The bridge deck elevation can go up to 25 metres (83 ft) while the maximum tower elevation is 47 metres (154 ft).|$|R
50|$|The 400 m {{main span}} of the CCLEX will be {{cable-stayed}} and will be supported by 145 m pylons. The design of the pylons was inspired from the historic Magellan's Cross. The main span will have a 60 m navigation clearance, which allow ships to <b>traverse</b> the <b>bridge.</b> Viaduct approach bridges and a causeway will also form part of the CCLEX, as well as toll road facilities on an artificial island. The toll facilities' design are inspired from the eight-rayed sun of the Philippine flag.|$|R
