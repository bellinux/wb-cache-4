2500|$|<b>To</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> pension, assumed for {{simplicity}} to {{be received}} {{at the end}} of each year, and taking discounted values in the manner of a net present value calculation, you need a lump sum available at retirement of: ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 26, 1995, Wilson {{signed a}} bill authorizing the {{possible}} use {{of the death penalty}} toward any individual who committed a murder amid a carjacking or killed a juror. Wilson said the law was the result of four years worth of attempts on his part to toughen the laws against carjacking: [...] "This bill sends an unmistakable message to gang bangers: If you take someone's life while committing a cowardly carjacking, you can expect <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> crime with your own life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{that you are}} not better acquainted with city ways. You may have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> dearly <b>for</b> <b>your</b> experience, though I hope not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{hold your}} meddlesome tongue," [...] said Solomon, [...] "and come out, {{if you want}} to speak <b>to</b> me. <b>Pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> wine, and come out. Who's this man?" ...|$|R
60|$|GAYNOR. Well, perhaps I {{can get the}} Society <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> half <b>for</b> <b>your</b> daughter--if you're {{really as}} hard up as you pretend. They're {{willing to do that}} where it seems necessary.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was silence}} for a few minutes; then Ole said: [...] "How much money do you require <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> father's farm and set {{yourself}} up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have had}} the plunder of the Palace and the custom-houses, my friends, and you liked that very well; now you will have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> pleasure.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And he says it's so {{much trouble}} to get you <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> share of the drinks that he'd sooner pay himself and have done with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't hurt you," [...] Fugger said; [...] "you'll {{simply have}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> less <b>for</b> <b>your</b> stones {{and sell them}} cheaper after they are cut. It won't make much {{difference}} in the long run." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will call}} it fifteen guilders," [...] said he. [...] "To-morrow I {{will give you}} fifteen guilders, and you will pay all expenses. And then what shall I have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>for</b> <b>your</b> services?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then let me advance you a month's salary. Half of it I {{would advise}} you to invest in an {{overcoat}} and a stout pair of shoes. The remainder you will probably have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> out <b>for</b> <b>your</b> board. Mr. Hardwick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{your young}} men are very shabby," [...] said Newman; [...] "that's all I can say. They ought <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> daughter, and not ask money themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's, right, my lad," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "I like your spirit. Have you money enough <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> hotel {{expenses}} {{while you are}} waiting for a ship?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have sold}} the labouring-man, squire, [...] Body and soul to shame, <b>To</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> {{seat in the}} House, squire, [...] And {{to pay for the}} feed of your game.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>for</b> <b>your</b> folly in {{entering}} my castle, I {{will make}} you my slave, and some day, if you're not good, I'll feed you to my seventeen-headed dog. I never eat little girls myself. I prefer mutton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{wants you}} {{take him in}} hand yourself, Woodall, if you can spare {{the time to do}} so; of course, he is ready <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>for</b> <b>your</b> time and trouble, and would meet you at any hour you like to name in the {{afternoon}} at your shed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know just}} how to begin," [...] he said. [...] "The {{situation}} is--er--is embarrassing for you. You see, I'm trying to be fair. As I say, you've worked hard. I don't want to confiscate the pearls. I want <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>for</b> <b>your</b> time and trouble, and expense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will want}} some money <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> passage, young gentleman." [...] Captain Wilson said to Ralph {{before leaving the}} ship. [...] "I will authorize you to tell an agent that I will be {{security}} for the payment of your passage-money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, at any rate, {{some one}} has <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> lodging. Don't you think you'd come cheaper to your friends, if, {{instead of going}} to a hotel every night, you'd take a room somewhere, and pay for it by the month?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In that case," [...] said Button-Bright, [...] "you're {{entitled}} to the best there is <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> trouble. A powerful ruler ought to be rich and {{to live in a}} splendid palace. Your folks ought to treat you with great respect, as Trot says." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can drive}} and you're going to," [...] she continued. [...] "I've got to send this {{telegram}} quick, and you've {{got to take}} it." [...] She opened her purse and placed two coins on the fender of the car. [...] "There's a dollar <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the message, and there's a five-dollar gold-piece <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>for</b> <b>your</b> trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't time," [...] said Wilkinson. [...] "Didn't {{charge you}} high and guess you've got <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> {{learning}} <b>your</b> business. The trouble is you're too sure about yourself and reckoned you'd make a splash at farming without much trouble. Anyhow, I don't {{want to sell}} Charnock a horse; he's a better judge than you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Dias, {{we come to}} {{the very}} {{important}} question, what are we <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>for</b> yourself, <b>your</b> nephew, and the five mules--say by the month?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] she retorted, [...] "but can't {{you see the}} difference? I wouldn't take a {{penny of}} your money from you as a gift, but I haven't the least compunction in taking my share of what you will have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> freedom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even then," [...] I {{answered}} after a moment, [...] "you {{ought to}} see that it's too terrible a price <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> happiness. And Ham hasn't ever pretended to consider you in any way. It's certain you didn't agree that he should do--what he is doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She may do {{what she}} pleases with her faith," [...] said the Skinner, with {{malignant}} pleasure, [...] "but I have the money in good keeping; as for you, Mr. Birch, we will bear your insolence, for the fifty guineas that are <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> gallows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can well}} {{understand}} {{that we would not}} stick at doing you harm, and it may be our fingers itch <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>for</b> <b>your</b> treachery, therefore should any one approach this building and you attempt to make an outcry, I shall consider that I have done the Cause a service by taking your life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{but poor}} people, {{but if you}} choose to stay here for a time, we will <b>pay</b> {{something}} <b>for</b> every tiger you kill; and we will send round to the other villages, within ten miles, and doubtless every one of them will contribute, so that you might get enough <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>for</b> <b>your</b> exertions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{must be as}} you will, of course," [...] the Prince declared. [...] "Only remember, Mr. Jacks, that a {{great nation}} like mine which wants a {{particular}} man for a particular purpose is not afraid <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> him. <b>Your</b> work out there would certainly take you {{no more than three}} years. For that three years' work you would receive the sum of thirty thousand pounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laugh {{as much as}} you please," [...] he said. [...] "I, {{who have}} been hounded out from society by a lot of highly moral souls, can't see {{anything}} funny in that story. But here we are, and you will now have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> fun, Mr. Heyst." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{gathered}} from Mr. Ascough {{that you were}} left sufficient means <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> education, and also to start you in life," [...] his visitor continued. [...] "Yours {{is considered to be}} an overcrowded profession, but I am glad to understand that you seem likely to make your way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now tell me," [...] the man demanded, [...] "what is your price? I {{have had}} money. There {{is not much}} left. Sophia is extravagant and {{traveling}} costs a great deal. But why do I weary you with these things?" [...] he added. [...] "Let me know what I have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> silence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe {{some day}} I shall be able <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you back <b>for</b> <b>your</b> {{goodness}} to me," [...] said he. [...] "If it comes that way, I shall certainly do it," [...] {{and then he}} shook hands once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{it for my}} {{good that}} I make the road? What benefit do you think I get out of it? It is for you, {{so that you can}} walk in comfort and carry your copra in comfort. I offered <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>for</b> <b>your</b> work, though it was <b>for</b> <b>your</b> own sake the work was done. I offered <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you generously. Now you must pay. I will send the people of Manua back to their homes if you will finish the road and pay the twenty pounds that I have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> them." ...|$|R
5000|$|When an {{individual}} flees {{the scene of}} an accident without leaving sufficient information to identify him or herself, the individual is considered uninsured for the purposes of an uninsured motorist provision. Note, however, that a positive ID of the license plates in a hit and run accident will often be considered by insurance companies sufficient information to identify the negligent Hit and run driver. Such identification will often lead to the denial of an uninsured motorist claim, as insurance companies will often litigate the claim, bringing in the registered owner of the vehicle with matching plates, even when that person denies involvement in the accident. Some states don't allow uninsured motorist property damage to be used in hit-and-run collisions. In these states, your collision coverage may be able <b>to</b> help <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> car repairs.|$|R
