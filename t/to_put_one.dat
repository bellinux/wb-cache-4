5|$|There was no Whig platform—the {{party leaders}} decided that trying <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>one</b> {{together}} would tear the party apart. So the Whigs ran on {{their opposition to}} Van Buren, blaming him and his Democrats for the recession. In campaign materials, Tyler was praised for integrity in resigning over the state legislature's instructions. The Whigs initially hoped to muzzle Harrison and Tyler, lest they make policy statements that alienated segments of the party. But after Tyler's Democratic rival, Vice President Johnson, made a successful speaking tour, Tyler was called upon to travel from Williamsburg to Columbus, Ohio, and there address a local convention, in a speech intended to assure Northerners that he shared Harrison's views. In his journey of nearly two months, Tyler made speeches at rallies. He could not avoid questions, and after being heckled into an admission that he supported the Compromise Tariff (many Whigs did not), resorted to quoting from Harrison's vague speeches. In his two-hour speech at Columbus, Tyler entirely avoided {{the issue of the}} Bank of the United States, one of the major questions of the day.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days after}} the draw with Notre Dame, the Cougars {{traveled}} to Lexington, Kentucky to face the UK Wildcats, {{a team that was}} ranked most of last season.

25|$|The {{interior}} of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, {{and would have been}} very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>one.</b> Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may {{have been one of the}} items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench against the back wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as they still do in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|In August, Sin Cara rekindled a {{feud with}} Cody Rhodes, {{who claimed that}} {{he was wearing a}} mask to cover his ugly face. Sin Cara scored pinfall wins over Rhodes in {{consecutive}} matches on SmackDown and Raw, both times taking advantage of Rhodes trying to remove his mask. He then also saved fellow masked wrestler Rey Mysterio from being unmasked by Rhodes and afterward teamed up with Mysterio <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>one</b> of his masks on Rhodes. After defeating WWE Intercontinental Champion The Miz in a non-title match, Sin Cara was granted an opportunity to win the title at Night of Champions in a four-way match, which also included Rhodes and Mysterio and saw The Miz retain the title. The following day on Raw, Sin Cara and Mysterio teamed up to defeat Epico and Primo in a tag team match. Sin Cara and Mysterio entered a tournament to determine the number one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship, defeating Primo & Epico and The Prime Time Players (Titus O'Neil and Darren Young) to advance to the final. Sin Cara and Mysterio lost the final of the tournament to the Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow) on the October 22 episode of Raw. At Survivor Series on November 19, Sin Cara and Mysterio were victorious in a 10-man elimination tag team match alongside Brodus Clay, Justin Gabriel, and Tyson Kidd against the Prime Time Players, Epico, Primo, and Tensai. On December 16 at , Sin Cara and Mysterio were defeated by Team Rhodes Scholars in a number one contenders tables match for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Two days later on SmackDown, Sin Cara suffered a legitimate knee injury and was written off television following an attack by The Shield.|$|E

Later that year, a team of RCA Records representatives including the label's CEO Peter Edge met with Sia to discuss a record deal.

In an interview published by NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that 1000 Forms of Fear was released as a contractual obligation: [...] "Basically, I put this out {{to get out of my}} publishing deal.

2500|$|Track {{bicycles}} {{are built}} without brakes {{so as to}} avoid sudden changes in speed when racing on a velodrome. Since track bikes have a fixed gear, braking can be accomplished by reversing the force on the pedals to slow down, or by locking the pedals backwards and inducing a skid. Fixed gear road bikes may also lack brakes, and slowing or stopping is accomplished as with a track bike. [...] Many fixed gear bikes however are fitted with a front brake for safety reasons, or because it is a legal requirement. Some BMX bicycles do not have brakes. The usual method of stopping is for the rider <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>one</b> or both feet on the ground, or to wedge a foot between the seat and the rear tyre, effectively acting as a spoon brake. Cycle Speedway is a type of close track racing in the UK, Poland, Australia, and France. The special built bike has a single freewheel and no brakes. Slowing is done during cornering by dragging the inside foot. These bikes are not intended for road use and are kept at the track.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two types}} of stance-direction used by snowboarders. A [...] "regular" [...] stance places the rider's left foot {{at the front of the}} snowboard. [...] "Goofy", the {{opposite}} stance direction, places the rider's right foot at the front, as in skateboarding. Regular is the most common. There are different ways to determine whether a rider is [...] "regular" [...] or [...] "goofy". One method used for first time riders is to observe the first step forward when walking or climbing up stairs. The first foot forward would be the foot set up at the front of the snowboard. Another method used for first time riders is to use the same foot that you kick a football with as your back foot (though this can be an inaccurate sign for some, as there are people who prefer goofy though are right handed, and therefore naturally kick a football with their right foot). This is a good method for setting up the snowboard stance for a new snowboarder. However having a surfing or skateboarding background will also help a person determine their preferred stance, although not all riders will have the same stance skateboarding and snowboarding. Another way to determine a rider's stance is to get the rider to run and slide on a tiled or wooden floor, wearing only socks, and observe which foot the person puts forward during the slide. This simulates the motion of riding a snowboard and exposes that persons natural tendency to put a particular foot forward. Another method is to stand behind the first-timer and give them a shove, enough for them <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>one</b> foot forward to stop themselves from falling. Other good ways of determining which way you ride are rushing a door (leading shoulder equals leading foot) or going into a defensive boxing stance (see which foot goes forward).|$|E
2500|$|Following the Battle of Columbus and Gen. John J. Pershing's Mexican Expedition in 1916 and 1917, Pancho Villa's {{army was}} {{scattered}} across northern Mexico, but by 1918 he had assembled several hundred men and began attacking the Carrancistas again. The Villistas were mostly unsuccessful {{in their final}} campaign. Though they captured Parral and took several smaller towns, they chose not to attack the city of Chihuahua because of its large garrison. Instead, Villa {{turned his attention to}} Ciudad Juarez in the summer of 1919. According to Friedrich Katz, author of The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, his motivations for attacking Ciudad Juarez are unclear. Katz says that Villa wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>one</b> of his generals, Felipe Ángeles, up to it because in the past he had spoken of the [...] "need for reconciliation with the Americans" [...] and the hope that the US would then [...] "change its attitude" [...] toward the Villistas. Katz also says that Villa may have chosen to attack Juarez because there was a smaller enemy garrison there than in Chihuahua, there was a large source of food and—possibly—to see if the Americans, just across the Rio Grande, were still as hostile as they had been during Pershing's campaign. The new Carrancista commander in northeastern Mexico, Gen. Juan Agustin Castro, was also factored in. According to Katz, Castro was not as aggressive as his predecessor and was [...] "content to fortify himself in a few towns without ever taking offensive action." [...] Therefore, Villa felt [...] "relatively confident" [...] that he could win the battle for Juarez without having to worry about Castro attacking him from the rear. Villa's army consisted of over 4,000 infantry and cavalry but he had no artillery support. The Carrancista forces, under Gen. Pablo González Garza, numbered nearly 3,000 and had fortified Juarez and occupied the citadel, Fort Hidalgo. Gen. Gonzalez also had artillery and two other important advantages: he would be fighting a defensive battle and was protected on the northern flank by El Paso and the American army.|$|E
