5|$|The French ships {{followed}} Swiftsure by <b>tacking</b> {{into the}} wind and a complicated chase developed, with Jean Bart and Constitution maintaining {{the pressure on the}} slow moving British vessel, while the rest of Ganteaume's squadron used the prevailing wind to push far ahead of the ongoing chase before <b>tacking</b> at 08:00 across Hallowell's intended course. Unless Hallowell could escape the trap, his ship would be caught between the two French divisions and overwhelmed. For six hours Hallowell continued his efforts to escape, but the French ships were too fast, Ganteaume's force passing some distance ahead of the British ship and then turning back towards him so that by 14:00 Swiftsure was at serious risk of being surrounded. Hallowell determined that his only option was to attempt to drive though those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line Indivisible (under Pierre-Paulin Gourrège) and Dix-Août (under Louis-Marie Le Gouardin) and the frigate Créole.|$|E

The day after Groves took over, he and Marshall took a train to Tennessee to inspect the site that Marshall had chosen for the proposed production plant at Oak Ridge. Groves was suitably impressed with the site, and steps were taken to condemn the land. Protests, legal appeals, and congressional inquiries were to no avail. By mid-November US Marshals were <b>tacking</b> notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.|$|E
5|$|The Scandinavian {{trade routes}} were equally {{important}} for the Batavian Navy, and to protect their merchant shipping from attack by British frigates, the Batavian authorities also sent a frigate squadron to the region, consisting of the 36-gun frigates Alliantie and Argo and the 16-gun cutter Vlugheid. On the afternoon of 22 August 1795 the Batavian force was sailing southeast {{along the coast of}} Norway, then part of Danish Norway, <b>tacking</b> to port towards the land, when the British squadron was spotted approaching from the south.|$|E

5|$|On hearing Donnelly's report, Duncan {{immediately}} despatched a small squadron to {{the mouth}} of the Texel to wait for the arrival of the Batavian squadron. Command of this squadron was given to Captain Lawrence Halstead in the 36gun frigate HMS Phoenix, accompanied by Pegasus, Sylph and the 50gun fourth rate HMS Leopard. The squadron detached at 05:00 and almost immediately the Batavian squadron was sighted to the southeast, heading for the entrance to the Texel, <b>tacking</b> against the northwest wind. Halstead's force was not unified, with Pegasus and Sylph far ahead of Phoenix and Leopard, and the British commander decided to deliberately detach his forces, the faster Pegasus and Sylph pursuing the brigs under Donnelly's command and Halstead's rear force attacking the frigate Argo. Duncan's main fleet, some distance behind Halstead, also sighted the Batavian squadron and joined the chase.|$|E
5|$|The {{blockade}} squadron off Lorient {{comprised the}} ships {{of the line}} HMS Theseus, HMS Triumph and HMS Valiant under Commodore John Poo Beresford, watching three ships in the harbour under Contre-amiral Amable Troude. At 15:15 Paget, who had {{lost sight of the}} French, reached the waters off Lorient and signaled a warning to Beresford. At 16:30, Beresford's squadron sighted Willaumez's fleet, <b>tacking</b> to the southeast. Willaumez ordered his second-in-command, Contre-amiral Antoine Louis de Gourdon to drive Beresford away and Gourdoun brought four ships around to chase the British squadron, with the remainder of the French fleet following more distantly. Beresford turned away to the northwest, thus clearing the route to Lorient. His objective achieved, Gourdan rejoined Willaumez and the fleet sailed inshore, anchoring near the island of Groix.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, lookouts on Greyhound {{were able}} to {{establish}} that Victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and Elphinstone was encouraged to resume the attack. Aalbers sailed shortly afterwards, his ships <b>tacking</b> away from the shore in line of battle ready for the British advance. In doing so, Pallas drew ahead of the next ship in line, creating a gap through which the British attack could be directed. At 05:00, Elphinstone raised French colours {{in an effort to}} confuse the Dutch officers and indicated that he wished to speak with the Dutch commander. Aalbers was not fooled, and when Elphinstone opened fire on Pallas at close range at 05:30, the Dutch frigate replied immediately. With the frigates engaged, Harrier cut between Pallas and Victoria, Troubridge discharging his carronades into Victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at the deck of Pallas. In response, Victoria and Batavier pulled out of the line to engage Harrier, which continued its fire against Pallas, while William, bringing up the rear of the Dutch line, pulled out completely and sailed for the coast.|$|E

Thumb <b>tack</b> and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb <b>tacks</b> made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass <b>tacks,</b> brass pins, tin <b>tacks</b> or iron <b>tacks,</b> respectively. These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) <b>tacks,</b> meaning to consider basic facts of a situation. Drawing pin or drawing-pin refers to thumb <b>tacks</b> used to hold drawings on drawing boards.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, a British {{squadron}} sailing off La Havre spotted the French ships pulling {{to the west and}} gave chase, Captain Laforey leading in the 38-gun , followed by the bomb vessel , under Captain Robert Fitzgerald, and the 12-gun cutter , under Lieutenant Henry Garrett. Discovering the British in pursuit, Pevrieux ordered his squadron to retreat towards the shore, <b>tacking</b> in front of Hydra and opening an ineffective fire at long range. Laforey continued his approach, and a 06:00 successfully tacked Hydra into a position between Confiante and Vésuve, which had turned back towards the shore. Although the British frigate came under fire from both French ships, their attacks had little impact. Laforey was able to concentrate his broadside against Vésuve and rapidly forced the French corvette to turn inshore, pursued by Vesuvius and Trial. Laforey then set off in pursuit of Confiante, which was attempting to turn back towards Le Havre. The French cutter was unable to escape the British pursuit and its crew deliberately drove it ashore near the mouth of the Dives River.|$|E
5|$|Soleil's {{squadron}} departed Rochefort on {{the evening}} of 24 September, aiming to bypass Hood's squadron in the dark. However at 01:00 on 25 September, with the wind coming from the northeast, lookouts on HMS Monarch spotted sails to the east. Hood's squadron was spread out, <b>tacking</b> southeast towards the Chassiron Lighthouse at Saint-Denis-d'Oléron with HMS Centaur in the centre, HMS Revenge to the east (or windward) and Monarch to the west. HMS Mars was also close by, {{with the rest of the}} squadron spread out in the rear. Hood's immediate reaction was that the sails must belong to a squadron of French ships of the line, and ordered his ships to form a line of battle in anticipation. Even as the signal was raised however, lookouts on Monarch identified the strangers as frigates and Hood abandoned his previous orders and raised a new signal ordering a general chase, confident that his ships could destroy the convoy even without the power and defensive capability of a line of battle.|$|E
25|$|Machine {{quilting}} is {{the process}} of using a home sewing machine or a longarm machine to sew the layers together. With the home sewing machine, the layers are tacked together before quilting. This involves laying the top, batting, and backing out on a flat surface and either pinning (using large safety pins) or <b>tacking</b> the layers together. Longarm quilting involves placing the layers to be quilted on a special frame. The frame has bars on which the layers are rolled, keeping these together without the need for <b>tacking</b> or pinning. These frames are used with a professional sewing machine mounted on a platform. The platform rides along tracks so that the machine can be moved across the layers on the frame. A longarm machine is moved across the fabric. In contrast, the fabric is moved through a home sewing machine.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve patient outcome {{and quality of life}} after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, resorbable {{fixation}} devices have been developed to allow adequate mesh fixation while minimizing accompanying side-effects as <b>tack</b> erosion and adhesion formation. In experimental set-up, 24 pigs were treated by laparoscopic mesh placement. Two different meshes (PP/ORC and PP/ePTFE) and four fixation devices were evaluated: a 6. 4 mm poly(D,L) -lactide pushpin (<b>tack</b> I), a 6. 8 mm poly(D,L) -lactide with blunt tip (<b>tack</b> II), a 4. 1 mm poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) (<b>tack</b> III) and one titanium <b>tack</b> (control <b>tack).</b> A first group of animals (n = 12) was euthanized after 2 weeks survival and a second group (n = 12) after 6 months. At euthanasia, a relaparoscopy was performed to assess adhesion formation followed by laparotomy with excision of the entire abdominal wall. Tensile strength of the individual fixation systems was tested {{with the use of a}} tensiometer by measuring the force to pull the <b>tack</b> out of the mesh. Additionally, the foreign body reaction to the fixation systems was evaluated histologically as was their potential degradation. At 2 weeks the tensile strength was significantly higher for the control <b>tack</b> (31. 98 N/cmA(2)) compared to the resorbable devices. Except for <b>tack</b> II, the tensile strength was higher when the devices were fixed in a PP/ePTFE mesh compared to the PP/ORC mesh. After 6 months only <b>tack</b> III was completely resorbed, while <b>tack</b> I (9. 292 N/cmA(2)) had the lowest tensile strength. At this time-point similar tensile strength was observed for both <b>tack</b> II (29. 56 N/cmA(2)) and the control <b>tack</b> (27. 77 N/cmA(2)). Adhesions seem to be more depending on the type of mesh, in favor of PP/ePTFE. At long term, the 4. 1 mm poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) <b>tack</b> was the only <b>tack</b> completely resorbed while the 6. 8 mm poly(D,L) -lactide <b>tack</b> with blunt tip reached equal strengths to the permanent <b>tack...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractTracking, the pick-up of {{bituminous}} materials by paving equipment tires, can occur when <b>tack</b> coat emulsion was not appropriately applied. This tracking {{can result in}} the existing pavement {{with little or no}} <b>tack</b> coat left in the wheel paths, leading to slippage and delamination. A special <b>tack</b> coat material, trackless <b>tack,</b> which does not track or pick up on paving equipment, has been developed. While researches have been conducted on the trackless <b>tack</b> shear strength evaluation, little work has been done on its cracking performance. Interface cracking performance of one type trackless <b>tack</b> at two application rates was evaluated using the composite specimen interface cracking (CSIC) test. The testing system involves repeated tensile loading and monitoring of the rate of damage development (reduction in stiffness) on composite specimens. Results indicated that trackless <b>tack</b> interface reduced the pavement top-down cracking performance as compared with conventional <b>tack</b> coat. However, it was reported in literature that trackless <b>tack</b> had superior shear strength than conventional <b>tack.</b> Therefore, it can be concluded that both shear strength along the interface and cracking resistance across the interface should be evaluated for any interface bond agents...|$|R

25|$|Vice Admiral Ashby {{of the red}} {{squadron}} {{failed to}} help the Dutch, as the Marquis de Villette succeeded in <b>tacking</b> ahead, placing Ashby between two fires. When Torrington brought {{the remainder of the}} red squadron into action, he found difficulty in getting close enough because of the sag in the French line and came no closer than twice gunshot range. Admiral Tourville, finding himself with few adversaries in the centre, pushed forward his own leading ships, which Torrington's dispositions had left without opponents, further strengthening the French attack in the van. The Dutch were now opposed by the whole of Château-Renault's squadron and the van and centre divisions of Tourville's squadron.|$|E
50|$|More recent {{developments}} {{have been made}} in <b>tack</b> treatments that are water-soluble, allowing them to be washed from hands, tools or a surface to reduce the incidence of <b>tack</b> transfer from accumulated resins or to wash the <b>tack</b> from the cloths.

25|$|The {{start of}} the tea season was {{during the early stages}} of the South-West monsoon in the China Sea, so head winds would be experienced, and very light or {{variable}} winds together with sudden squalls.
