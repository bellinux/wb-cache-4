40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{scheduling}} concurrent periodic real-time transactions on Multi-Domain Ring Bus (MDRB). The problem is challenging because although the bus allows multiple non-overlapping transactions to be executed concurrently, the degree of concurrency depends on the topology of the bus and of executed transactions. This is a different challenge compared to that of multi-processor real-time task scheduling. To solve this problem, first, we propose two novel efficient scheduling algorithms for topographically-acyclic <b>transaction</b> <b>sets.</b> The first algorithm is optimal for <b>transaction</b> <b>sets</b> under restrictive assumptions while the second one induces a competitive sufficient schedulable utilization bound for more general <b>transaction</b> <b>sets.</b> Then, we extend these two algorithms for the scheduling of topographically-cyclic <b>transaction</b> <b>sets.</b> Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm can schedule <b>transaction</b> <b>sets</b> with high bus utilization and is better than that of related works in most practical settings. The implementation of the algorithms in a real test-bed shows that they have relatively low execution-time overhead...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} scheduling real-time data transactions on the bus of multicore processors. The problem is challenging because the bus allows multiple degrees of transaction concurrency. The number of concurrency degrees depends on how the transactions are routed on the bus. We propose an practical abstraction for the scheduling problem together with two scheduling algorithms. The first algorithm is optimal for scheduling specific <b>transaction</b> <b>sets</b> while the second one induces a good sufficient schedulable utilization bound for general <b>transaction</b> <b>sets.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|Conceptually, {{fraudulent}} {{trading is}} similar to a fraudulent conveyance, but the key distinction is that an application to have a <b>transaction</b> <b>set</b> aside as a fraudulent conveyance usually requires to the third party beneficiary to disgorge the benefit of the conveyance to undo the loss to the company's assets, whereas a court order in relation to fraudulent trading it is the responsible parties (usually the directors) who must make up the loss and the third party beneficiaries will usually retain the benefit. [...] However, it is perfectly possible for a single transaction to be simultaneously fraudulent trading and a fraudulent conveyance, and to be the subject on concurrent applications. [...] Some legal systems permit a director who makes a contribution to the company's assets pursuant to an order for fraudulent trading to subrogated to any claim that the company might have with respect to a fraudulent conveyance.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{scheduling}} real-time data transactions on a multicore processor bus. In particular, to increase system predictability and tighten WCET estimation, we propose to employ a software-controllable Multi-Domain Ring Bus (MDRB) architecture. The problem of scheduling periodic real-time transactions on MDRB is challenging because the bus allows multiple non-overlapping transactions to be executed concurrently, and because the degree of concurrency depends on the topology of the bus and of executed transactions.

40|$|As {{large-scale}} databases become commonplace, {{there has}} been significant interest in mining them for commercial purposes. One of the basic tasks that underlies many of these mining operations is querying of <b>transaction</b> <b>sets</b> for frequencies of specified attribute values. The size of these databases makes it important to develop summary structures capable of high compression ratios as well as supporting fast frequency queries. The {{nature of the problem}} and its differences with respect to traditional text compression allows very high compression ratios. In this paper, we propose a binary trie-based summary structure for representing <b>transaction</b> <b>sets.</b> We demonstrate that this trie structure, when augmented with an appropriate set of horizontal pointers, can support frequency queries several orders of magnitude faster than raw transaction data. We improve the memory characteristics of our scheme by compressing the trie into a Patricia trie and demonstrate that this does not have [...] ...|$|R
