5|$|In 1972, Joseph Brady of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied {{irregularities}} in {{the motion of}} Halley's Comet.

However, both Marsden and PlanetX proponent P. Kenneth Seidelmann attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, and that such a massive object as Brady's PlanetX would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.|$|E
