5|$|St Andrew's Day, 30 November, is the {{national}} day, although Burns' Night <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> widely observed, particularly outside Scotland. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament passed the St. Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007, designating the day an official bank holiday. Tartan Day is a recent innovation from Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Jackson's {{hartebeest}} {{does not}} have a clear taxonomic status. It is regarded as a hybrid between the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. The African Antelope Database (1998) treats it as synonymous to the Lelwel hartebeest. From Lake Baringo to Mount Kenya, the Jackson's hartebeest significantly resembles the Lelwel hartebeest, whereas from Lake Victoria to {{the southern part of the}} Rift Valley it <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> like the Coke's hartebeest.|$|E

5|$|Vinegar is {{typically}} 4–18% acetic acid by mass. Vinegar is used directly as a condiment, {{and in the}} pickling of vegetables and other foods. Table vinegar <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> diluted (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial food pickling employs solutions that are more concentrated. The proportion of acetic acid used worldwide as vinegar is not as large as commercial uses, but {{is by far the}} oldest and best-known application.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs are {{abundant}} {{and can be}} found throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E
5|$|Eccles is the ninth-most densely {{populated}} ward in Salford, {{and has the}} highest number and proportion of people aged 75and over of all wards in Salford. Levels of crime are below the average for the city. The adult population <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> qualified than the city average, and primary and secondary education results are also slightly higher than average for Salford. Unemployment is below average, with people tending to work longer hours. More residents live in purpose-built and converted flats than do in {{the city as a}} whole, with a minority occupying detached houses or bungalows. Between 1994and2004, 367homes were added to the ward, above the average for Salford.|$|E
50|$|High {{levels of}} many {{transcription}} factors and co-factors are seen at super-enhancers (e.g., CDK7, BRD4, and Mediator).This {{high concentration of}} transcription-regulating proteins suggests why their target genes <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> highly expressed than other classes of genes. However, housekeeping genes <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> highly expressed than super-enhancer—associated genes.|$|R
50|$|Women, on average, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{attracted}} <b>to</b> men {{who have}} a relatively narrow waist, a V-shaped torso, and broad shoulders.

5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: {{the use of a}} separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|Given its {{formidable}} {{size and}} dentition, the silky shark {{is regarded as}} potentially dangerous to humans. However, it only rarely comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly and closely approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited {{in the presence of}} food. The silky shark <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> aggressive if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists six attacks attributable to the silky shark, three of them unprovoked and none fatal.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{psoriasis}} in HIV-positive {{individuals is}} {{comparable to that of}} HIV-negative individuals, however, psoriasis <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> severe in people infected with HIV. A much higher rate of psoriatic arthritis occurs in HIV-positive individuals with psoriasis than in those without the infection. The immune response in those infected with HIV is typically characterized by cellular signals from Th2 subset of CD4+ helper T cells, whereas the immune response in psoriasis vulgaris is characterized by a pattern of cellular signals typical of Th1 subset of CD4+ helper T cells and Th17 helper T cells. It is hypothesized that the diminished CD4+-T cell presence causes an overactivation of CD8+-T cells, which are responsible for the exacerbation of psoriasis in HIV-positive people. Psoriasis in those with HIV/AIDS is often severe and may be untreatable with conventional therapy.|$|E

50|$|The more {{fundamentalist}} Christian churches <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{political and}} down-to-earth {{in their approach}} to life and in sermons. This <b>is</b> in contrast <b>to</b> the mainline Protestant denominations, which <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> aloof and other-worldly. Overall, the city <b>is</b> becoming <b>more</b> secular. Youth <b>are</b> less inclined <b>to</b> attend church, but <b>more</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved with the YMCA and YWCA.|$|R
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is similar}} to two hybrid species {{of which it is}} a parent, Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with A.pinnatifidum, and Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a {{backcross}} with A.montanum. In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe ends {{at the base of the}} leaf blade, the pinnae are more shallowly lobed and the enlargement of acroscopic lobes or pinnules is less distinct, and the apical portion of the blade forms a long, tapering tip with slight lobes (as in A.pinnatifidum), rather than being cut into pinnae. In addition to the general reduction of the toothiness of A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii also shows faint winging along the stipe. Likewise, in A.×wherryi, the dark color of the stipe again ends at the base of the leaf blade, the overall shape of the blade <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> distinctly lance-shaped, and the fronds are somewhat more deeply cut than A.bradleyi, progressing from bipinnate in the lower half to pinnate-pinnatifid and finally pinnate at the apex. Finally, the diploid hybrid A.montanum × platyneuron, from which A.bradleyi arose by chromosome doubling, is essentially identical in appearance to A.bradleyi. On close examination, its spores are found to be abortive, and the sori are smaller and not do not become fused with each other as they grow, as they do in fertile A.bradleyi.|$|E

50|$|Nonetheless, even {{in those}} {{languages}} there is usually some phonetic correlation between rounding and backness: front rounded vowels <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> front-central than front, and back unrounded vowels <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> back-central than back. Thus, the placement of unrounded vowels {{to the left of}} rounded vowels on the IPA vowel chart is reflective of their position in formant space.|$|R
