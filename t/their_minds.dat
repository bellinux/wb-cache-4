Most agree with Rick's choice for various reasons, but Shane (Jon Bernthal) agrees to support Dale should {{he be able to}} convince the others to change <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b>|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine how far previous reigns had broken Roman Catholic devotion, with its belief in the saints and in purgatory, but certainties—especially those that drew public financial support—had been shaken. Benefactions to the church did not return significantly. Trust in clergy who had changed <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> and were now willing to leave their new wives—as they were required to do—was bound to have weakened.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, mooted the idea of a Federation of Malaysia, comprising existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei and the British Borneo territories of North Borneo and Sarawak. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.|$|E

5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E

5|$|A {{thousand}} years before The Sword of Shannara, an Elf named Galaphile gathers {{all of the}} people who still had some knowledge of the old world to Paranor to try to bring peace and order to all of the races.

He almost succeeds in seizing rule of the Four Lands, but the tide turns, and the war ends with his defeat and disappearance. The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive, withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members.|$|E
5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that {{this was one of}} the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E
