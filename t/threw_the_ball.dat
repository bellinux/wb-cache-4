5|$|Baseball America rated Humber as the 50th-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} {{heading into the}} 2005 season. Humber entered spring training in 2005 with the Mets. There, he clashed with Mets' pitching coach Rick Peterson, who wanted Humber to adopt a different training regimen and change the manner with which he <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to the plate. The Mets front office supported Humber, telling him to pitch how he felt comfortable.|$|E
5|$|England {{then started}} their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. Seeing that Lindwall was able to bowl through the pain, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller for the second over to see if Miller could bowl. However, Miller <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back, indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|While {{with the}} Senators, Bordagaray raced a horse in a 100-yard dash, losing {{by a few}} feet. During a game, Bordagaray {{reportedly}} went to use the toilet during the ninth inning. While he was off the field, the pitcher <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> unaware he had no right fielder. The batter hit the pitch to right field, leading to a double. Manager Earl McNeely did not criticize Bordagaray, rather telling the pitcher {{to make sure his}} fielders were in place before throwing.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ball</b> can be <b>thrown</b> {{in several}} ways. <b>Throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while running causes <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{to move in}} <b>the</b> {{direction}} faced. <b>Throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while standing still allows a 360 degree aim, with better tracking. <b>Throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while jumping increases the force at which <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> hits.|$|R
25|$|Pass - Move {{and then}} <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> (or just <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball).</b> In certain circumstances, players may instead throw their own {{teammates}} with this action, {{who may or}} may not be carrying <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> - for instance an Ogre might throw a Goblin teammate.|$|R
5000|$|CP1 {{competitors}} {{are classified as}} either BC1 or BC3. In BC1, they can generally <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> past <b>the</b> V Line. [...] They are allowed to have assistants. BC3 players cannot <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> themselves, require <b>the</b> use of an electric wheelchair and use a ramp to propel <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 1962–63 NBA season, Baylor {{was back}} full-time. West {{averaged}} 27.8points, 7.0rebounds and 5.6assists and was again NBA All-Star and All-NBA First-Team; however, {{he played in}} only 55 regular season games, missing the last seven weeks due to a hamstring injury. Again, the Lakers reached the finals, and again, they battled the Celtics. With West not yet in shape, Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3–2; then they succumbed in Game 6 {{in front of their}} home crowd with a 112–109 loss. As the game ended, veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> high into the rafters of the L.A. Sports Arena.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play from {{scrimmage}} in the third quarter, Garcia <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> out {{of the end zone}} for a safety following a bad snap. After the free kick, Alabama scored on a 39-yard Shelley field goal, to make the score 21–14. After a one-yard Lattimore touchdown run, Alabama answered with a 51-yard Darius Hanks touchdown reception from McElroy, to make the score 28–21. However, Lattimore scored on a two-yard touchdown run late in the fourth to give the Gamecocks a 35–21 victory. The win marked South Carolina's first all-time victory over a team ranked number one in the AP poll.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} morning, English tailender Alec Bedser had reached 37. His partner Denis Compton hit a {{ball into the}} covers and Bradman and Loxton {{collided}} {{in an attempt to}} field the ball and prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to the wicket-keeper's end. Bedser was a long way short of the crease and was run out. The wicket ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 in a 121-run partnership. England then lost their last three wickets for 26 runs to be all out for 363.|$|E
50|$|<b>Throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into <b>the</b> stands or {{otherwise}} preventing a ball from being made live promptly after a made goal to allow one's team {{to set up}} on defense (if a blatantly unsportsmanlike act, a technical foul against the player; otherwise, a warning to that team and team technicals thereafter). This includes <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to an official when such act is not required—such would likely incur a warning. In addition, <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at an opponent's head may also be considered a technical foul.|$|R
50|$|Spike: This throw can be {{used when}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is caught in the front half of the court. Here the idea is for the player to jump {{as high as they}} can and <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> toward <b>the</b> opponents' back half. To make this <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> player holds <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> over their head, jumps up, and <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> over <b>the</b> net. The key to a {{successful}} spike is <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> toward <b>the</b> ground as fast and hard as possible. The player does not want to lob <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> over <b>the</b> net in an arch; rather they want to throw it in a direct line to the opponents' back half.|$|R
50|$|No-drop holding <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{was next}} {{introduced}} by the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1938. The VFA, which did not come under the National Council's influence, introduced the rule {{as part of a}} suite of novel rule changes, which also included <b>the</b> legalisation of <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> as a type of handpass. The VFA's combination of the no-drop rule and <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> had <b>the</b> immediate effect of reducing congestion, as it gave players the easy option to <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into open space when tackled, instead of dropping <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at their feet and causing a scrimmage to form around it.|$|R
5|$|Washbrook and Hutton then {{strode to}} the crease as England faced a short burst of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after {{delivering}} the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over {{to see if he}} could lift and bowl as well. However, Miller <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back to his captain, indicating that his body would not be able to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|After a short return, Georgia QB Stafford {{went to work}} on the Georgia 24-yard line. Two {{incomplete}} {{passes and}} one sack later, Georgia was again punting. Virginia Tech again was in excellent field position, starting on their own 47-yard line. Instead of rushing the ball, as had been the trend for the Tech offense up to that point, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer called for a trick play. At the snap, quarterback Sean Glennon lateraled the football to wide receiver Eddie Royal. Rather than running the ball, Royal <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> downfield, catching the Georgia defense off guard. Tight end Sam Wheeler, the target of the throw, had been left uncovered by a defense expecting a run. The pass was completed, and Wheeler ran unimpeded 53yards for a touchdown. The play took 19seconds to execute, and gave Virginia Tech a 21–3 lead with 4:00 remaining in the half.|$|E
5|$|DeGrom pitched for the Savannah Sand Gnats of the Class A South Atlantic League and the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2012, {{finishing}} {{the year with}} a 2.43 ERA in 19 games started. In 2013, he began the season with St. Lucie, but was promoted to the Binghamton Mets of the Class AA Eastern League after two starts due to injuries to Binghamton's Luis Mateo and Cory Mazzoni. He received a promotion to the Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League in June after the Mets promoted Zack Wheeler and Carlos Torres to the major leagues and traded Collin McHugh. He had a combined 4.51 ERA for the season, due to a broken finger suffered during the offseason, which altered the way he <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Savies or Taxis: If {{a player}} feels {{he is too}} far from <b>the</b> wall to <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and make wall contact, <b>the</b> thrower can <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to another player and hope the {{receiver}} will wait until the thrower has run {{to the wall and}} touched it. However, savies can backfire if the catcher betrays <b>the</b> thrower by <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to <b>the</b> wall before the thrower has run and touched the wall. In some places, there is no betrayal as, if you save them they don't have to run.|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{subsequent}} to the resumption, Compton took two boundaries from Lindwall's first over and another from Johnston's subsequent over. He then hit a ball into the covers and Bradman and Loxton collided {{in an attempt to}} prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to the wicket-keeper's end with Bedser a long way short of the crease. It ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 and featured in a 121-run partnership with Compton. According to O'Reilly, it was the only mistake Compton made in his innings. The stand fell five runs short of England's highest Test partnership for the eighth wicket against Australia, a mark set by Patsy Hendren and Harold Larwood.|$|E
5|$|The Volunteers' kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 22-yard line, and the Hokies began another drive. On the first play of the drive, however, Maurice DeShazo scrambled for a ten-yard gain but fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by a Tennessee defender, and the Volunteers took over on offense from the Tech 32-yard line. Branndon Stewart came out onto the field in place of Manning, and completed an eight-yard pass to James Stewart to begin the drive. James Stewart then ran to the 20-yard line for a first down. On the next play, Tennessee executed a trick play in which James Stewart received the ball via a hand-off, imitating a running play, but <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> instead. The pass was caught by James Kendrick for a touchdown, and after the extra point, Tennessee had a 357 lead with 2:08 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|However, {{his career}} turned sour in a match against Victoria in January 1930. After {{contributing}} three not out in Western Australia's first innings of 187, Halcombe opened the bowling for Western Australia from the pavilion {{end of the}} Melbourne Cricket Ground. He delivered the first three balls to Clive Sindrey who took a single from the third ball. Leo O'Brien then faced Halcombe and umpire Andrew Barlow no-balled Halcombe six times in succession from square leg. One of the balls struck O'Brien in the hand and forced him to retire with a burst blister on the palm, while another went for four byes. After the first two no ball decisions, the Western Australian captain Richard Bryant conferred with Barlow, but when Halcombe resumed, the umpire continued to call him for throwing. After the sixth no ball, Halcombe <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to his skipper in disgust. After another discussion, he bowled at significantly reduced pace and completed his over. Victoria took a lead of 22, before Western Australia compiled 311, with Halcombe scoring 10 not out. With Halcombe out of the attack, Victoria {{went on to win}} by four wickets.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Immediate Inbound" [...] Rule: After a made basket, <b>the</b> referee will <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to {{a nearby}} player, instead of a player <b>throwing</b> in <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from under <b>the</b> basket, to {{eliminate}} wasted time.|$|R

When either team sends <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> over <b>the</b> touch line in futsal, the other team kicks rather than <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back into play in {{what is known as}} a kick-in.|$|R
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Oxford University, Loxton {{came in at}} 4/206 and {{anchored}} the innings, remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431. He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring, who both made fifties. He then took the new ball in both innings, taking 1/14 and 1/16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory. When Oxford batted, Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton, and {{took a few steps}} out of his crease. Loxton prepared to throw at the Whitcombe's stumps in a run out attempt, but did not release, while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the crease. In those days, the fielding standards were lower, with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his crease, while Loxton was around thirty away. The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton, and Whitcombe again wandered outside his crease. This time Loxton <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and hit the stumps directly, running out the batsman, who was unable to comprehend what had happened and shook his head.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Egekeze {{attempted}} {{to kick the}} ball as it fell off the tee. This resulted in an unintentional squib that was returned 36yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{into the end zone}}, but it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate, resulting in a touchback. The Terps started on their own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett rushed for 13yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a false start penalty, the Terps were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a pass interference call against Maryland, and scrambled for yet another. He then handed off to Taua, who rushed 17yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Seattle Seahawks linebacker Mike Curtis {{blocked a}} field goal that would have sent the game into overtime, guaranteeing a Seahawk victory in what was billed as the “expansion bowl” meeting between two winless, first-year teams. The Buccaneers outgained the Seahawks, 285 yards to 253, but the {{officials}} outgained both, with 310 yards in penalties. The 35 penalties (accepted, 41 were thrown by the officials) were two short of the 25-year-old league record. Each team was penalized for holding eight times. Defensive tackle Pat Toomay complained that “the officials made us look {{like a bunch of}} idiots”. Dan Ryczek was the only Buccaneer lineman not to be called for holding. Tampa Bay running back Louis Carter, stuffed at the goal line, <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to Morris Owens, who dived into the end zone for the first Buccaneer passing touchdown. A tackle by Seahawk punter Rick Engles prevented a touchdown return by Danny Reece that would have won the game for the Buccaneers. An earlier field goal try was blocked by Lyle Blackwood. The game ended with Dave Brown being helped from the field after being hit in the eye by the final penalty flag.|$|E
50|$|On passing plays, the {{offensive}} line is responsible for stopping defensive players from tackling the quarterback before he has <b>thrown</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Stopping these players indefinitely is usually not possible, so the main objective of {{the offensive}} line is to slow them down, providing the quarterback with several seconds to identify an open receiver and <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|R

5|$|Kansas {{took over}} {{at its own}} 12-yard line after the punt. On the first play of the drive, Reesing {{completed}} a 37-yard pass to Dexton Fields, putting the ball near midfield. Three straight incomplete passes later, Kansas faced a fourth-and-ten and a punt. Instead of punting the ball away, however, Kansas elected to try a risky fake punt-pass. Instead of snapping {{the ball to the}} punter, the ball was snapped to running back Brandon McAnderson, who <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 22yards downfield to Micah Brown for a first down. On the very next play, Reesing, having returned to the field, connected on a 28-yard pass to Dexton Fields, who was pushed out of bounds just short of the goal line. With a first-and-goal from inside the one-yard line, a Kansas touchdown seemed inevitable. On the first play inside the red zone, however, Kansas fumbled the ball. Though the ball was recovered by a Kansas player, the play lost fouryards. On the next play, Kansas committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty. The personal foul was followed by a 10-yard holding penalty, and Kansas was pushed entirely outside the Virginia Tech red zone. In an effort to push back, Reesing threw a pass deep downfield. Instead of being completed, however, the ball was intercepted by Virginia Tech's D.J. Parker. With 39seconds left in the quarter, Virginia Tech had stopped Kansas from gaining a point despite the Jayhawks penetrating inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina's first {{possession}} of the second overtime period ended with a turnover, while Kansas missed a long jump shot in theirs. North Carolina's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over Brennan to collect the rebound and was called for over the back. Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling, while Chamberlain <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> out of bounds on the subsequent possession. Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain's error when Kearns missed {{the front end of}} a one–and–one. Kansas came down the court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham. This sparked an altercation between the two teams, which resulted in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a megaphone and his knee being scarred by a Carolina cheerleader. The referees stopped the commotion and Chamberlain was sent to the line, where he missed his shots, and Carolina got the rebound. The Tar Heels aimed to hold the ball for a final shot but they turned the ball over to Kansas with ten seconds to go and the Jayhawks called a timeout with six seconds left. The ball went to Kansas' Loneski who missed a shot and the game remained tied at 48.|$|E
5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball was in the air and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E
