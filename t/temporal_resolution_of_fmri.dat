25|$|<b>Temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> {{is limited}} by: (1) the {{feedback}} mechanism {{that raises the}} blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to wait till net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or region of interest. Advanced techniques to improve temporal resolution address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up acquisition time in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique is to decide which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a spatial map (that is small clusters dotting the image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a high-pass filter in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford. These mechanisms assume the researcher has {{an idea of the}} expected shape of the activation image.|$|E

There are a number of advantages that are presented in comparison to PET. According to D’Esposito, they include that fMRI “does not require an injection of radioisotope into participants and is otherwise noninvasive, has better spatial resolution, and has better temporal resolution." [...] The first MRI studies employed the use of “exogenous paramagnetic tracers to map changes in cerebral blood volume”, which allowed for the assessment of brain activity over several minutes. This changed with two advancements to MRI, the rapidness of MRI techniques were increased to 1.5 Tesla {{by the end of the}} 1980s, which provided a 2-d image. Next, endogenous contrast mechanisms were discovered by Detre, Koretsky, and colleagues was based on the net longitudinal magnetization within an organ, and a “second based on changes in the magnetic susceptibility induced by changing net tissue deoxyhemoglobin content”, which has been labeled BOLD contrast by Siege Ogawa. These discoveries served as inspiration for future brain mapping advancements. This allowed researchers to develop more complex types of experiments, going beyond observing the effects of single types of trials. When fMRI was developed one of its major limitations was the inability to randomize trials, but the event related fMRI fixed this problem. Cognitive subtraction was also an issue, which tried to correlate cognitive-behavioral differences between tasks with brain activity by pairing two tasks that are assumed to be matched perfectly for every sensory, motor, and cognitive process except the one of interest. Next, a push for the improvement of <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> studies led to the development of event-related designs, which according to Peterson, was inherited from ERP research in electrophysiology, but it was discovered that this averaging did not apply very well to the hemodynamic response because the response from trials could overlap. As a result, random jittering of the events was applied, which meant that the time repetition was varied and randomized for the trials in order to ensure that the activation signals did not overlap.|$|E

In line with previous ¢ndings, visual activity was observed in the auditory cortex of deaf, but not hearing, subjects. This activity occurred within 100 ^ 400 ms of stimulus presentation and was primarily over the right hemisphere.

40|$|Stimulus {{repetition}} {{often leads}} to facilitated processing, re-sulting in neural decreases (repetition suppression) and faster RTs (repetition priming). Such repetition-related effects {{have been attributed to}} the facilitation of repeated cognitive processes and/or the retrieval of previously encoded stimulus–response (S-R) bindings. Although previous research has dissociated these two forms of learning, their interaction in the brain is not fully understood. Utilizing the spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> and EEG, respectively, we examined a long-lag classification prim-ing paradigm that required response repetitions or reversals at multiple levels of response representation. We found a repetition effect in occipital/temporal cortex (fMRI) that was time-locked to stimulus onset (EEG) and robust to switches in response, to-gether with a repetition effect in inferior pFC (fMRI) that was time-locked to response onset (EEG) and sensitive to switches in response. The response-sensitive effect occurred even when changing from object names (words) to object pictures between repetitions, suggesting that S-R bindings can code abstract rep-resentations of stimuli. Most importantly, we found evidence for interference effects when incongruent S-R bindings were retrieved, with increased neural activity in inferior pFC, demon-strating that retrieval of S-R bindings can result in facilitation or interference, depending on the congruency of response between repetitions. ...|$|R

However hemodynamic signal variation can occur {{at a faster}} rate, causing changes in functional connectivity at a smaller time scale. In this study we proposed to use MREG technique to increase the <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> resting-state <b>fMRI.</b> A three-dimensional single-shot concentric shells trajectory was used instead of conventional EPI, with a TR of 100 ms and a nominal spatial <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> 4 × 4 × 4 mm 3.

We used a sliding-window method on signal components at different frequency bands, to look at the non-stationary connectivity maps over the course of each scan session. The aim of the study paradigm was to specifically observe visual and motor resting-state networks. Preliminary results have found corresponding networks at frequencies above 0. 1 Hz. These networks at higher frequencies showed better stability in both spatial and temporal dimensions from the sliding-window analysis of the time series, which suggests the potential <b>of</b> using high <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> MREG sequences to track dynamic resting-state networks at sub-minute time scale...|$|R

In experiment two, higher temporal sampling of a more limited spatial field was used to measure temporal offsets between regions. Activation maps produced solely from the single-trial data were comparable to those produced from blocked runs.

25|$|Although {{this may}} be seen as similar to neuroimaging techniques, {{molecular}} measures help to enhance areas of activation that would otherwise be indecipherable to neuroimaging. One such technique that aids in both the <b>temporal</b> and visual <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> is the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response. Changes in the BOLD response can be seen when there is differing levels of activation in suspected areas of functioning. Energy is supplied to the brain in the form glucose and oxygen (which is transferred by hemoglobin). The blood supply is consistently regulated so that areas of activation receive higher amounts of energy compared to areas that are less activated. In positron emission tomography, the use of radionuclides (isotopes with short half lives) facilitates visual resolution. These radionuclides are attached to glucose, water and ammonia so that easy absorption into the activated brain areas is accomplished. Once these radioactive tracers are injected into the bloodstream, the efficiency and location of chemical processes can be observed using PET.|$|R
40|$|Our {{emotions}} tend to {{be directed}} towards someone or something. Such emotional intentionality calls for the integration between two streams of information; abstract hedonic value and its associated concrete content. In a previous {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study we found that the combination of these two streams, as modeled by short emotional music excerpts and neutral film clips, was associated with synergistic activation in both temporal-limbic (TL) and ventral-lateral PFC (vLPFC) regions. This additive effect implies the integration of domain-specific 'affective' and 'cognitive' processes. Yet, the low <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fMRI</b> limits the characterization of such cross-domain integration. To this end, we complemented the fMRI data with intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings from twelve patients with intractable epilepsy. As expected, the additive fMRI activation in the amygdala and vLPFC was associated with distinct spatio-temporal iEEG patterns among electrodes situated within the vicinity <b>of</b> the <b>fMRI</b> activation foci. On the one hand, TL channels exhibited a transient (0 - 500 msec) increase in gamma power (61 - 69 Hz), possibly reflecting initial relevance detection or hedonic value tagging. On the other hand, vLPFC channels showed sustained (1 - 12 sec) suppression of low frequency power (2. 3 - 24 Hz), possibly mediating changes in gating, enabling an on-going readiness for content-based processing of emotionally tagged signals. Moreover, an additive effect in delta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was found among the TL channels, possibly reflecting the integration between distinct domain specific processes. Together, this study provides a multi-faceted neurophysiological signature for computations that possibly underlie emotional intentionality in humans...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{has been}} settled that the left {{posterior}} temporal region and the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) are associated with language processing, their role and their interaction have not been understood thoroughly. Hagoort (2005) proposed the former to underpin the retrieval of single word information and the latter the unification thereof into a coherent representation and supportive evidence for this hypothesis was found in an fMRI experiment on noun/verb ambiguous words (Snijders et al., 2007). The poor <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI,</b> however, left the question unanswered whether the LIFG is involved directly in the competition between ambiguous alternatives or {{in the selection of}} the context-relevant interpretation.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{studies on}} {{multimodal}} brain source imaging {{have shown that}} the use of functional MRI (fMRI) prior information could enhance spatial resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG), while MEG could compensate poor <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI.</b> This article deals with a multimodal imaging method, which combines fMRI and MEG for enhancing both spatial and temporal resolutions. Recent studies on the combination of fMRI and MEG have suggested that the fMRI prior information could be very easily implemented by just giving different weighting factors to the diagonal terms of source covariance matrix in linear inverse operator. We applied the fMRI constrained imaging method to several simulation data and experimental data (Japanese language lexical judgment experiment), and found that some MEG sources may be eliminated by the introduction of the fMRI weighting and the eliminated sources may affect source estimation in fMRI activation regions. In this article, in order to check whether the eliminated sources were fMRI invisible ones or just spurious ones, we placed small numbers of regional sources (rotating dipoles) around all possible activation regions and investigated their temporal changes.

To address this question, we adopted a computational model-based approach to electroencephalography (EEG) data acquired during a simple binary choice task. fMRI data were also acquired from the same participants for source localization. Post-decision value signals emerged 200 ms post-stimulus in a predominantly posterior source {{in the vicinity of the}} intraparietal sulcus and posterior temporal lobe cortex, alongside a weaker anterior locus. The signal then shifted to a predominantly anterior locus 850 ms following the trial onset, localized to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex. Comparison signals between unchosen and chosen options emerged late in the trial at 1050 ms in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that such comparison signals may not be directly associated with the decision itself but rather may play a role in post-decision action selection. Taken together, these results provide us new insights into the temporal dynamics of decision-making in the brain, suggesting that for a simple binary choice task, decisions may be encoded predominantly in posterior areas such as intraparietal sulcus, before shifting anteriorly...|$|E

40|$|Object {{recognition}} {{is a fundamental}} mechanism of visual processing and requires the extraction of shape information. Early visual areas {{have been linked to}} the analysis of local image features, while higher visual areas of the ventral visual pathway rather mediate the perception and recognition of global shapes. Investigations of the spatiotemporal characteristics of shape analysis in the human visual cortex by rapid event-related fMRI adaptation in combination with a region of interest analysis suggested a transient manner of contour integration and shape processing in early visual areas compared to sustained processing in higher visual areas. fMRI adaptation (or repetition suppression) paradigms offer the possibility to enhance the restricted spatial <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> conventional <b>fMRI</b> by focusing on decreased responses for repeated stimulus presentation. However, improving our understanding of complex neuronal mechanisms in the human brain requires the investigation not only at high spatial but also <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution.</b> A limitation <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> adaptation can be found in its poor <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> which EEG- and MEG-techniques can overcome, though at a lower spatial resolution. The present study aimed to investigate temporal characteristics of shape processing in the human brain by adapting the principles <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> adaption in a MEG study.

40|$|This thesis {{consisting}} of five papers examines {{the relationship between}} haemodynamicactivation in the prefrontal cortex with episodicmemoryfunction in the healthy human brain. Brain function is measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (FMRI) and episodic memory for words as well as visuo-spatial material is examined. The first paper consists of two experiments using either verbal or visuospatial material and examines the effects of practice on episodic memory in repeated cycles of encoding and retrieval. Subjects are scanned with PET during retrieval. It is found that before practice, the tasks activate frontoparietal networks and that this activity diminishes with practice in favour of paracentral brain activity, perhaps reflecting decreasing demands on working memory. The second paper examines incidental encoding of figurative and non-figurative drawings while processing of the drawings takes place in different levels of processing (LOP). Subjects are biased toward either deep or shallow by rating agree-ability or graphical quality of the drawings respectively. A behavioural experiment is undertaken {{in the first part of}} the paper, establishing that the LOP effect extends to visuo-spatial material. PET scanning then shows increased activity for deep encoding compared to shallow encoding in left prefrontal, parietal and anterior temporal regions, while comparing shallow encoding to deep encoding yielded right prefrontal, parietal and posterior temporal activations. The third paper continues to examine effects of practice in another setting. Subjects are taught a specific aid to memory, a mnemonic known as the method of loci. They are scanned with PET while encoding a list of words both with and without use of the mnemonic as well as during acquisition of the mnemonic. Use of the mnemonic is associated with increased activity in left frontal and occipito-parietal networks. Acquisition of the mnemonic compared to baseline is associated with increased activity in lateral and medial parietal cortex while activity in the left medial Abstract temporal lobe increased with practice. In the fourth paper, FMRI is used to expand the findings from the second paper by applying the greater <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> event-related <b>FMRI</b> to separate activity for the figurative from the non-figurative drawings. Only some of the results from the second paper are replicated. In the last paper, the remember / know paradigm is used. This means that subjects are given a recognition test of previously seen words and asked to indicate the quality of a recognition experience as either remembered, meaning that the subject can recall the encoding event, or known, meaning that the subject finds the word familiar but has no recollection of the encoding event. The recognition test as well as the attribution of the recognition experience as remembering or knowing is scanned using event-related FMRI. Recognised words that are later remembered compared to words that are later known are associated with increased activity in the posterior part of the right hippocampus and comparing later remembered words with correct rejections revealed activations in the left inferior parietal lobule and in the right middle frontal gyrus. We conclude that practice in an episodic memory task represents a change from controlled to automatic processing; that the strong form of the hemispheric encoding retrieval asymmetry hypothesis (HERA) is not sufficient to account for the patterns of activity in the frontal cortex associated with episodic memory; that levels of processing can be shown with visuo-spatial material and that levels of processing are reflected in differently lateralised frontal and parietal activity...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the cognitive processing stages underlying associative recognition using MEG. Over {{the last four}} decades, a model of associative recognition has been developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture.

Unfortunately, the limited spatial resolution of EEG and the limited <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> have {{made it difficult to}} fully understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of associative recognition. We therefore conducted an associative recognition experiment with MEG, which combines excellent temporal resolution with reasonable spatial resolution. To analyze the data, we applied non-parametric cluster analyses and a multivariate classifier. This resulted in a detailed spatio-temporal model of associative recognition. After the visual encoding of the stimuli in occipital regions, three separable memory processes took place: a familiarity process (temporal cortex), a recollection process (temporal cortex and supramarginal gyrus), and a representational process (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). A late decision process (superior parietal cortex) then acted upon the recollected information represented in the prefrontal cortex, culminating in a late response process (motor cortex).

40|$|AbstractFunctional MRI {{research}} suggests that different frontal and parietal cortical regions support strategic processes that are engaged {{at different stages of}} recollection, from pre-retrieval processing of a cue to post-retrieval maintenance and evaluation of recollected information. Whereas some of these regions respond in a domain-general way, other regions are sensitive to the type of information being recollected. However, the low <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> cannot distinguish component processes at the time-scale at which recollection occurs. We therefore combined fMRI with the excellent temporal resolution of source localised EEG/MEG to investigate the spatiotemporal neural dynamics of recollection. fMRI and EEG/MEG data were collected from the same participants in two sessions while they retrieved different types of episodic information. This multimodal imaging approach revealed striking consistency between the regions identified with fMRI and EEG/MEG, providing novel evidence of how these brain areas interact over time to support source recollection. For domain-general recollection, results from both modalities converged in showing the strongest activations in medial parietal cortex, which according to EEG/MEG was reliable at a late retrieval stage. Domain-specific source recollection increased fMRI and EEG/MEG activation in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, which EEG/MEG indicated also to be recruited during a post-recollection stage. The findings suggest that although medial parietal and left lateral prefrontal regions mediate functionally different retrieval processes, they are both engaged at a late stage of episodic retrieval...|$|E
40|$|A {{leftward}} bias is {{well known}} in humans and animals, and commonly related to the right hemisphere dominance for spatial attention. Our previous fMRI study suggested that this bias is mediated by faster conduction from the right to left parietal cortices, than the reverse (Siman-Tov et al., 2007). However, the limited <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> and evidence on the critical involvement of sub-cortical regions in orienting of spatial attention suggested further investigation of the leftward bias using multi-scale measurement. In this simultaneous EEG–fMRI study, healthy participants were presented with face pictures in either the right or left visual fields while performing a central fixation task. Temporo-occipital event related potentials, time-locked to the stimulus onset, showed an association between faster conduction from the right to the left hemisphere and higher fMRI activation in the left pulvinar nucleus following left visual field stimulation. This combined-modal finding provides original evidence of the involvement of sub-cortical central attention-related regions in the leftward bias. This assertion was further strengthened by a DCM analysis designated at cortical (i. e., inferior parietal sulcus; IPS) and sub-cortical (pulvinar nucleus) attention related nodes that revealed: 1. Stronger inter-hemispheric connections from the right to left than vice versa, already at the pulvinar level. 2. Stronger connections within the right than the left hemisphere, from the pulvinar to the IPS. This multi-level neural superiority can guide future efforts in alleviating attention deficits by focusing on improving network connectivity...|$|E

However, due to the low <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI,</b> the exact cortical dynamics and timing of processing during task performance could not be resolved until now. In order to clarify the detailed cortical activity and temporal dynamics, 14 healthy subjects performed an established version of the "Clock Task", which comprises a visuospatial task (angle discrimination) and a control task (color discrimination) with the same stimulus material, in an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment. Based on the time-resolved analysis of network activations (microstate analysis), differences in timing between the angle compared to the color discrimination task were found after sensory processing in a time window starting around 200 ms. Significant differences between the two tasks were observed in an analysis window from 192 ms to 776 ms. We divided this window in two parts: an early phase - from 192 ms to ∼ 440 ms, and a late phase - from ∼ 440 ms to 776 ms. For both tasks, the order of network activations and the types of networks were the same, but, in each phase, activations for the two conditions were dominated by differing network states with divergent temporal dynamics.

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) has begun to narrow down the neural correlates of self-generated forms of thought, with current evidence pointing toward central roles for the default, frontoparietal, and visual networks. Recent work has linked the arising of thoughts more specifically to default network activity, but the limited <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> has precluded more detailed conclusions about where in the brain self-created mental content is generated and how this is achieved. Here I argue that the unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) in human epilepsy patients can begin to provide answers to questions about the specific neural origins of self-generated thought. I review the extensive body of literature from iEEG studies {{over the past few}} decades and show that many studies involving passive recording or direct electrical stimulation throughout the brain all point to the medial temporal lobe as a key site of thought-generation. At the same time, null effects from other brain regions suggest that various other default network hubs, such as the posterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobule, might have only a marginal role (if any) in the self-generation or initiation of mental content like dreams, visual imagery, memories, and prospective simulations. Ultimately, combining a variety of neuroscientific methods that compensate for each other's weaknesses and complement each other's strengths may prove to be the most effective way to understand the brain's remarkable ability to decouple from the immediate environment and generate its own experiences...|$|E

A gradient-echo EPI sequence was used. Ten axial slices were acquired. A single Chinese character was used for each stimulus. The subjects were asked to perform a word generation task. In all the subjects, strong activation was detected in left middle to inferior prefrontal gyri. Highly left hemisphere dominance of the activation in prefrontal cortex was observed in all the subjects, with the locations in well agreement with the previous studies using blocked design.

In addition, EEG instrumentation is portable and easy to wear, offering the opportunity to record inter-brain effects during daily-life interactions. However, the disadvantage of this approach is that it is difficult to localize the epicenter of the inter-brain effect. fNIRS has better <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> and portability than fMRI, but has limited spatial resolution and a limited ability to record deep brain structures. Future studies should employ hyperscanning EEG–fMRI, because this approach combines the high <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> EEG with the high spatial <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI.</b> Hyperscanning EEG–fMRI allows us to use inter-brain effects as neuromarkers of the properties of social interactions in daily life. We also wish to emphasize the need to develop a mathematical model explaining how two brains can exhibit synchronized activity...|$|R
40|$|Progress in {{functional}} neuroimaging of {{the brain}} increasingly relies on the integration of data from complementary imaging modalities {{in order to improve}} spatiotemporal resolution and interpretability. However, the usefulness of merely statistical combinations is limited, since neural signal sources differ between modalities and are related non-trivially. We demonstrate here that a mean field model of brain activity can simultaneously predict EEG and fMRI BOLD with proper signal generation and expression. Simulations are shown using a realistic head model based on structural MRI, which includes both dense short-range background connectivity and long-range specific connectivity between brain regions. The distribution of modeled neural masses is comparable to the spatial <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> BOLD, and the <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the modeled dynamics, importantly including activity conduction, matches the fastest known EEG phenomena. The creation of a cortical mean field model with anatomically sound geometry, extensive connectivity, and proper signal expression is an important first step towards the model-based integration of multimodal neuroimages...|$|R
40|$|SummaryFormal {{computational}} {{models of}} human memory posit {{a central role}} of feature representations in episodic memory encoding and retrieval [1 – 4]. Correspondingly, fMRI studies have found that, in addition to activity level [5, 6], the neural activation pattern similarity across repetitions (i. e., self-similarity) was greater for subsequently remembered than forgotten items [7 – 9]. This self-similarity has been suggested to reflect pattern reinstatement due to study-phase retrieval [7, 10, 11]. However, the low <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> measures could determine neither the temporal precision of study-phase reinstatement nor the processing stage at which the reinstatement supported subsequent memory [12]. Meanwhile, although self-similarity {{has been shown to}} correlate with the activity level in the left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) [10, 13], a causal link between left LPFC function and pattern similarity remains to be established. Combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and EEG, we found that greater spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS) across repetitions of the same item (i. e., self-STPS) during encoding predicted better subsequent memory. The self-STPS located in the right frontal electrodes occurred approximately 500  ms after stimulus onset, reflected item-specific encoding, and contributed to memory above and beyond the effects of ERP amplitude and global pattern similarity (i. e., similarity to all other items in memory space). Anodal stimulation over the left LPFC specifically enhanced memory performance and item-specific STPS in the right frontal electrodes. These results support a causal role of LPFC in enhancing STPS and memory and contribute to a mechanistic understanding of memory formation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{measured}} metabolic changes {{associated with}} temporal lobe (TL) spikes using combined electroencephalography (EEG) and functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). We selected 18 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who underwent a 2 -h simultaneous EEG 9 ̆ 6 fMRI and had unilateral or bilateral independent TL spikes for interindividual group analysis, in order to identify consistent blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses to TL spikes. Methods: EEG was postprocessed and spikes were visually identified. fMRI data were preprocessed with motion correction, spatial smoothing, and removal of low frequency drifts. Spike timings were used as events for fMRI statistical analysis. Four hemodynamic response functions were used to account for variability in the BOLD response. Results: Group analysis revealed common areas of BOLD activations and deactivations. The hemodynamic response function (HRF) peaking 3 s after the spike showed activation involving ipsilaterally the mesial temporal structures (presumably the hippocampus), putamen/globus pallidus, inferior insula, and superior temporal gyrus. The HRF peaking at 5 s showed activations involving ipsi- and contralaterally the superior temporal gyrus and inferior insula. Both HRFs showed bilateral posterior cingulate deactivations. Discussion: We disclosed involvement of a network of activated areas during unilateral TL spikes, including ipsilateral mesial temporal structures, basal ganglia, and bilateral neocortical temporal regions. Despite the low <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> we demonstrated that contralateral temporal involvement occurred later than ipsilateral activation. This contralateral change took place in the absence of visible EEG changes. The posterior cingulate deactivation may reflect the interconnections between this region and other limbic structures. It may also partially correspond to a suspension of the default mode network, as previously described for TL spikes...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) has demonstrated {{the potential for}} non-invasive mapping of structure and function (fMRI) in the human brain. In this thesis, we propose a series of methodological developments towards improved fMRI of auditory processes. First, the inefficiency of standard fMRI that acquires brain volumes one slice at a time is addressed. The proposed single-shot method is capable, for the first time, of imaging the entire brain in a single-acquisition while still maintaining adequate spatial resolution for fMRI. This method dramatically increases the <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fMRI</b> (20 fold) and improves sampling efficiency {{as well as the}} ability to discriminate against detrimental physiological noise. To accomplish this it exploits highly accelerated parallel imaging techniques and MRI signal detection with a large number of coil elements. We then address a major problem in the application of fMVIRI to auditory studies. In standard fMRI, loud acoustic noise is generated by the rapid switching of the gradient magnetic fields required for image encoding, which interferes with auditory stimuli and enforces inefficient and slow sampling strategies. We demonstrate a fMRI method that uses parallel imaging and redesigned gradient waveforms to both minimize and slow down the gradient switching to substantially reduce acoustic noise while still enabling rapid acquisitions for fMRI. Conventional fMRI is based on a hemodynamic response that is secondary to the underlying neuronal activation. In the final contribution of this thesis, a novel image contrast is introduced that is aimed at the direct observation of neuronal magnetic fields associated with functional activation. Early feasibility studies indicate that the imaging is sensitive to oscillating magnetic fields at amplitudes similar to those observed by magnetoencephalography. by Thomas Witzel. Thesis (Ph. D.)
