5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is one <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> {{without an}} apparent cause {{and in the}} absence of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E

30|$|The {{incipient}} droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> {{during the}} wintering {{period of the}} winter wheat growth helped to increase the winter wheat yield, while the mild droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> during the maturity stage of winter wheat resulted in a reduction of yield.

The moderate droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> during the flowering, filling, and maturity periods of the winter wheat growth {{had a significant impact on}} yield. In addition, the water shortage due to droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> during the seeding period in autumn also affected the production of winter wheat, and that is particularly true for the severe and extreme droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> during the seeding period. With some exception of the occurrence of droughts of certain intensities during some specific growth stages of winter wheat, droughts of higher intensities had greater impacts on winter wheat yield during the critical growth stages.|$|R

5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, {{upper part of the}} chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E

Dew {{is a form}} of precipitation <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> naturally when atmospheric water vapour condenses onto a substrate. It is distinct from fog, in that fog is made of droplets of water that condense around particles in the air. Condensation releases latent heat which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss <b>that</b> <b>occurs</b> in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E

Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E

50|$|In {{his early}} {{statistics}} textbooks, Smith cited a study claiming that famous people can postpone death {{until after the}} celebration of their birthdays. Several of Smith’s students attempted to replicate this finding, and could not.

5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules.
