5000|$|After WW2 the Zeiss factory at Jena {{ended up}} in East Germany behind the Iron Curtain, and {{developed}} a popular camera named the 'Werra' after the river which runs through the town.

50|$|To get {{the company}} going, Franke and Heidecke decided to {{manufacture}} a stereo {{camera in the}} short term. Cameras of this type were popular, and Reinhold Heidecke was very familiar with them. As they were also in Voigtländer's product range, however, Franke and Heidecke {{did not want to}} look as if they were simply copying theirs. They purchased several Voigtländer units, and from what they learned by dismantling these, constructed the Stereo Heidoscop. It included two Carl Zeiss <b>Tessar</b> <b>lenses</b> (f/4.5, 55 mm) and, mounted between them, a Carl Zeiss Super Triplet (f/3.2) viewfinder. At that time, <b>Tessar</b> <b>lenses</b> were widely regarded as the best available; they were often used in the United States, even though locally produced alternatives were available. Zeiss had an excellent reputation world-wide, which Franke & Heidecke leveraged for their own products. More importantly, they differentiated themselves from cheaper alternatives. The camera projected an image onto glass plates of dimensions 45 mm x 107 mm. The name Heidoscop was chosen in part to remind the management at Voigtländer that they had restricted Heidecke in his work there.|$|R

50|$|While the Leica camera popularized the format, several 35 mm still cameras used {{perforated}} {{movie film}} before the Leica {{was introduced in}} the 1920s. The first patent for one was issued to Leo, Audobard and Baradat in England in 1908. The first full-scale production camera was the Homeos, a stereo camera, produced by Jules Richard in 1913, and was sold until 1920. It took 18x24 mm stereo pairs, using two <b>Tessar</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|A key {{business}} {{decision was made}} in 1920 when the company decided to work with former Zeiss developer Paul Rudolph, who was previously significantly involved {{in the success of}} the Protar, Planar and <b>Tessar</b> <b>lenses.</b> Rudolph also gave Meyer Optik access to his patent for the so-called Plasmat lenses, which at the time included {{one of the most powerful}} lenses in the world. In 1936, the company was renamed Optische und Feinmechanische Werke Hugo Meyer & Co and produced approximately 100,000 lenses a year. During World War II, civilian production discontinued and mainly optical components for telescopes were produced.|$|R
5000|$|... 1953: Zeiss Ikon Contaflex I (West Germany): first leaf shutter 35 mm SLR. Had Synchro-Compur leaf shutter {{and front}} cell {{focusing}} 45mm f/2.8 <b>Tessar</b> <b>lens,</b> built-in selenium-coupled exposure meter. For many years, reliable focal-plane shutters were very expensive and SLRs equipped with Compur or Prontor leaf shutters were strong competitors. As FP shutters improved, their faster available speeds won {{out in the}} late 1960s and leaf shutter 35 mm SLRs disappeared around 1976.|$|E

50|$|Some time {{probably}} between 1947 and 1949 {{when the}} first KMZ Fed-Zorki cameras were being assembled at the KMZ factory in Moscow with the collaboration of Fed engineers the copy of the Leitz Elmar 50mm f3.5 {{was replaced by a}} copy of the Tessar 50mm f3.5 in the same collapsible mount. This probably happened due to technical information taken as spoils of war from the Zeiss factory, which was in the Soviet-controlled zone of East Germany. The KMZ version of this <b>Tessar</b> <b>lens</b> was the Industar-22.|$|E

50|$|Kodak Retinette is {{the name}} of a classic series of cameras {{manufactured}} by the Eastman Kodak company. They were introduced in 1939 as a less expensive alternative to the Kodak Retina series. The first models were of the folding type using bellows and their lenses had three elements as compared to the four element <b>Tessar</b> <b>lenses</b> (Tessera meaning four) of the Retina series. The first non-folding (rigid) variant was introduced in 1954 with the model 022. They most often featured Schneider Kreuznach Reomar lenses but, sometimes, Rodenstock Reomar lenses were installed. The Rodenstock lenses were based on the original Schneider Kreuznach triplet (three optical element) design. Kodak Anastigmat Angénieux lenses were also used especially for the French market. Common shutters included Compur - Rapid as well as various Pronto, Vero and Kodak models.|$|R
50|$|For its time, the Rollei 35 was the {{smallest}} camera that used standard 35 mm film cartridges, {{which made it}} an ideal second camera for amateur photographers. Initially, it came with a Zeiss <b>Tessar</b> <b>lens</b> with an aperture of f/3.5 and focal length of 40 mm. In contrast to 16 mm cameras (especially pocket cameras that came along later), {{there was no need}} to work with two different film formats, which was especially convenient for showing slides. Equally important, image quality was not compromised, despite the pocket camera format. Over time, several Rollei 35 models were released; especially notable was the 35S which had a 5-element Zeiss Sonnar f/2.8, 40 mm lens.|$|E
50|$|The Robot I {{was quite}} small, the body {{measuring}} 4¼ inches long, 2½ inches high, and 1¼ inches deep. A very sharp zone-focusing f/2.8, 3.25 cm Zeiss <b>Tessar</b> <b>lens</b> added 1/2 inch {{to the camera}} depth. It was {{about the size of}} the much later Olympus Stylus although it weighed about 20 ounces, approximately the weight of a modern SLR. The die-cast zinc and stamped stainless steel body was crammed with clockwork. A spring motor on the top plate provided the driving force for a rotary behind-the-lens shutter and a sprocket film drive. The film was loaded into cassettes in a darkroom or changing bag. The cassettes appear to be based on the Agfa Memo cassette design, the now-standard Kodak 35 mm cassette not yet being popular in Germany. In place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes, the Robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage. When the camera back was shut, the compression opened the passage and the film could travel freely from one cassette to another.|$|E
5000|$|The camera {{had to be}} {{converted}} to use parts from Rollei's suppliers, as Rollei did not maintain business relations with Metrawatt and Steinheil. A high-quality <b>Tessar</b> <b>lens</b> was made by Zeiss. Rollei's light meter supplier was Gossen. Whether to use either a photovoltaic selenium sensor or a CdS photoresistor, was finally decided in August in favour of the CdS. Gossen named the same measuring range for both solutions. A selenium-cell powered light meter was cheaper in production and did not need a battery. However, the much smaller CdS-photoresistor improved the stylish look of the camera, the battery powered light-meter was more shock-resistant, and the [...] "CdS technology" [...] {{could be used as}} a selling point in advertising.The housing needed to be changed just slightly, since Waaske unknowingly had adopted the appearance of Rollei's twin-lens reflex cameras, by placing the exposure time and aperture controls to the right and to the left side of the lens. Nevertheless, Rollei's designer Ernst Moeckl revised the housing, and by changing the edge radius made the camera body even smaller.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cameras were}} {{manufactured}} by the Itek Corporation. A 12 in, f/5 triplet lens {{was designed for}} the cameras. Each lens was 7 in in diameter. [...] They were quite similar to the <b>Tessar</b> <b>lenses</b> developed in Germany by Zeiss. The cameras themselves were initially 5 ft long, but later extended to 9 ft in length. Beginning with the KH-4 satellites, these lenses were replaced with Petzval f/3.5 lens. The lenses were panoramic, and moved through a 70° arc perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} orbit. A panoramic lens was chosen because it could obtain a wider image. Although the best resolution was only obtained {{in the center of the}} image, this could be overcome by having the camera sweep automatically ("reciprocate") back and forth across 70° of arc. The lens on the camera was constantly rotating, to counteract the blurring effect of the satellite moving over the planet.|$|R
50|$|From the Super (new) and Super B, the Zeiss <b>Tessar</b> 50mm f:2.8 <b>lens</b> was recomputed and {{supposedly}} performed better. They could still {{take the same}} supplementary lenses, with one exception discussed in the relevant section.|$|R
