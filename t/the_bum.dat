He states that he had become irritated with shooting restrictions such as [...] "three quarters of {{one side of a}} boob... You can only show one inch down from <b>the</b> <b>bum</b> crack..." [...] and with uncooperative subjects. Thus, he says, he created his own magazine with what Daily Beast described as [...] "female full-frontal nudity, luxe-y aesthetic, and [...] underpinning of fashion-world credibility" [...] that has gotten [...] "influential tastemakers and industry icons" [...] to take notice. According to Shaw, treats! was founded to present content that was too risqué for magazines such as Vogue, Elle and InStyle. Shaw's nickname for photos that could not be used because they pushed the borders too far was [...] "treats", and he decided to use the nickname as the title for the magazine. The magazine presents images that have not been airbrushed or photographically retouched.|$|E
500|$|A {{columnist}} {{from the}} British newspaper New! described [...] "Bye Bye" [...] as their [...] "favorite track" [...] and wrote, [...] "the delicious 'Bye Bye' {{is a classic}} slushy Mariah ballad, with a swoonsome chorus." [...] Jonathan Reyes from Rap-Up felt the track would get listeners [...] "teary eyed", and due to it being a [...] "song everyone can relate too", assure it would become Carey's next number-one single. While ABC News writer, Steve Jones, described how [...] "Bye Bye" [...] packed <b>the</b> <b>bum</b> with [...] "an emotional wallop", The Washington Posts Freedom De Luc compared it heavily to [...] "Don't Forget About Us", Carey's 2005 single. De Luc wrote how both shared similar piano instrumentation, however different lyrical settings; [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] finds Carey playing a [...] "broken-hearted lover", while [...] "Bye Bye" [...] an [...] "inspirational song that comes with {{its own set of}} suggested demographics and instructions." [...] Some reviewers felt the song was a sub-par effort from an artist of Carey's stature, with many describing it as unoriginal and not a good follow-up single to [...] "Touch My Body". Entertainment Weeklys Margeaux Watsman felt [...] "Bye Bye" [...] was an [...] "odd choice" [...] for a second single, and called it [...] "somber edgy". Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as a [...] "shmaltzy ballad", while an anonymous VH1 critic wrote [...] "with the “We Belong Together” sonic template and lyrics tailored appeal to everyone on such a basic level seems like too easy of a combination for someone as established as Mimi. This one’s like insurance – in case nothing else is a hit, here’s a sure-shot. But ultimately, {{it turns out that the}} album is too good for that." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the best}} known traditions in the history of UMKC was Hobo Day, later known as Bum Friday. The campus-wide event was created as Hobo Day, and it first {{occurred}} on May 8, 1935, to celebrate the end of the spring semester. Students dressed as hobos throughout the day, and various events and competitions took place. The day started with the Hobo parade, and then everyone gathered in the quad where university president Clarence Decker would read a proclamation that he was cancelling classes and turning the university over to the students. President Decker was an appropriate master of ceremonies for the day, as he had lived the life of a hobo during a portion of his younger years. Events throughout the day included beard growing contests, pie eating contests, glee club performances, skits satirizing campus life, car rallies, talent shows, and athletic contests. <b>The</b> <b>Bum</b> Friday Queen and the Most Fascinating Man were crowned, and the day ended with a dance in which students switched out their bum attire for formal wear. Awards for the daytime activities were presented at the dance. A bonfire closed out the evening. In 1951, Hobo Day was renamed Bum Friday, although the activities essentially remained the same. In 1982, the Student Life Office put a stop to Bum Friday and replaced it with [...] "Roo Fest", which lacked many of the activities and traditions of Bum Friday and its predecessor, Hobo Day.|$|E
