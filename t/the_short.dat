The problem with determining <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> path, however, is to find both the fastest and <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> path.

He was in second place going into the free skate. He won the free skate, landing a clean quadruple jump, {{but was unable to}} pull up to first overall, due to Daisuke Takahashi's twelve point lead after <b>the</b> <b>short</b> program. He went on to the 2007 Cup of China, where he won <b>the</b> <b>short</b> program with a score of 81.55, improving his personal best by almost thirteen points. He placed second in the free skate after falling on his quadruple jump, and finished second overall to Johnny Weir.|$|E

40|$|Definition: The {{problem of}} finding <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> path in a graph from one vertex to another. “Shortest ” may be least number of edges, least total weight, etc. Also known as single-pair shortest-path problem.

For a map, it is to produce <b>the</b> (<b>shortest)</b> road {{distance}} from one city to another city, not which roads to take.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a novel algorithm, MAXSMINT (Maximizing Speed and Minimizing Time) for determining <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> route in a railway network. In today's busy world, no one takes {{the effort to}} determine <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> route to <b>the</b> destination but expect to reach their destinations in <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> possible time. Thus, this system involves providing <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> time taking path to their destination automatically. Optimization is achieved by splitting the entire process into two. First finding <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> paths to <b>the</b> end station and then calculating and zero down to <b>the</b> final <b>shortest</b> time taking path. This approach is more generalized and is proved to offer higher efficiency and shorter process time then the conventional methodologies...|$|R

50|$|It is {{sometimes}} crucial {{to have more}} than one path between two nodes in a given network. In the event there are additional constraints, other paths different from <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> path can be computed. To find <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> path one can use shortest path algorithms such as Dijkstra’s algorithm or Bellman Ford algorithm and extend them to find more than one path. <b>The</b> k <b>shortest</b> path routing algorithm is a generalization of <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> path problem. <b>The</b> algorithm not only finds <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> path, but also k − 1 other paths in non-decreasing order of cost. k is <b>the</b> number of <b>shortest</b> paths to find. The problem can be restricted to have <b>the</b> k <b>shortest</b> path without loops (loopless k shortest path) or with loop.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGiven a {{polyhedral}} terrain S with n vertices, <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> watchtower {{is defined}} as <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> vertical line segment uv whose lower endpoint u lies on S and whose upper endpoint v can see the entire terrain. In 1988 Sharir gave an O(nlog 2 n) time algorithm for computing <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> watchtower and posed the open problem of computing <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> watchtower in O(nlogn) time. In this paper, we show that by extending Dobkin-Kirkpatrick's hierarchical representation of a convex polyhedron, the problem can be solved in O(nlogn) time. This settles the above open problem posed by Sharir. We also discuss the closely related problem of computing <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> vertical distance between two convex polyhedra...|$|R
