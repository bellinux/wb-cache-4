This study {{extended}} {{research on}} choice by determining if choice making {{behavior can be}} influenced by altering <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> associated with choice. Participants were 8 undergraduate college students. They were {{given the opportunity to}} choose themselves or to have the experimenter choose for them among simple office tasks in 3 different experiments. In the first experiment, <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of choosing were made more favorable than <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of not choosing. Participants did not respond differentially. In Experiment 2, <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of not choosing were made even less favorable. Two of the 3 participants reallocated their responding towards choosing for themselves.

5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who {{administrated}} the DA-funds, {{stating that}} both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license {{to play in the}} top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.|$|E
