As in any breed, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> range of personalities, so your needs should be outlined clearly to your breeder. An experienced breeder {{can try to}} identify that personality which would be happier as an independent livestock dog, or that which wants more to please and {{would make a good}} obedience dog or family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability and general attitude.|$|E

25|$|After {{the current}} splits into the Svalbard Branch and the Yermak Branch, the general sinking process {{described}} above still {{continues in the}} Svalbard Branch. However, in the Yermak Branch the WSC {{is not able to}} penetrate deep inside the Arctic Ocean because the zone it enters has very strong tidal mixing. This allows the Atlantic Water to mix with the Polar Waters, creating more of a homogeneous mixture of relatively warm and moderately saline water. This extends down to about 300 meters which is recognized as the bottom depth of the Return Atlantic Current. For the Svalbard Branch, the Atlantic Water core of the WSC continues to sink as it meets more and more freshwater on its eastern route. It sinks fairly quickly to a depth greater than 100 meters by the time it reaches the Barents Sea because in Northern Svalbard <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of freshwater run-off from fjords which adds to a deeper, less dense Arctic Surface Water and thus a deeper WSC. By the time this water recirculates to the Beaufort Gyre, the Atlantic core of the WSC is 400 to 500 meters deep. Unlike the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current, the Svalbard Branch is able to retain a strong Atlantic Water chemical signal whereas the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current carry a very weak Atlantic Water signal. The Atlantic Water core temperature is a direct reflection of the depth of the Svalbard Branch of the WSC.|$|E

500|$|Guitarist The Edge {{explained}} {{that some of}} the sounds in the introduction that resemble keyboards were actually created by him on guitar. Of the song's introduction, bassist Adam Clayton says, [...] "When people put on the record, we wanted their first reaction to be either 'this record is broken' or 'this can't be the new U2 record, there's been a mistake.' So <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> dramatic extended intro where you just don't know what you are listening to."

500|$|In {{an early}} {{review by the}} trade {{magazine}} The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said that, [...] "After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black. Calling the film [...] "darker and more serious than its predecessors," [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times credited Black for [...] "chang this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit of Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic Westworld and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw {{all kinds of stuff}} at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday characterized Iron Man as [...] "the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out." [...] Psychology Today concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the death}} of Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone attack, Fazlullah was {{appointed}} as the new [...] "Amir" [...] (Chief) of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan on 7 November 2013. In a May 2010 interview, U.S. Gen. David Petraeus described the TTP's relationship with other militant groups as difficult to decipher: [...] "There is clearly a symbiotic relationship between all of these different organizations: al-Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban, the Afghan Taliban, TNSM [...] And it's very difficult to parse {{and to try to}} distinguish between them. They support each other, they coordinate with each other, sometimes they compete with each other, [...] sometimes they even fight each other.

2500|$|Gandalf calls Tom Bombadil {{the eldest}} being in existence; this is {{evidenced}} by his Sindarin name Iarwain Ben-adar (Eldest and Fatherless). Dwarves called him Forn (Old Norse, meaning [...] "Ancient" [...] or [...] "Belonging to the distant past"; in Icelandic it can also mean that he has magical abilities), Men Orald (compare to Dutch oeroud and German uralt, [...] "ancient, very old"). All these names apparently mean [...] "Eldest". Treebeard calls himself the eldest living being of Middle-earth and says {{that he was there}} before anyone else. However, Tolkien remarked in another context: [...] "Treebeard is a character in my story, not me; and though he has a great memory and some earthy wisdom, he {{is not one of the}} Wise, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot he does not know or understand." [...] The apparent discrepancy has also been explained by Tolkien deliberately mirroring the self-contradictory textual traditions of real-world medieval texts.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{reaction}} to the album from music critics was highly favorable. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "Naturally, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit of roiling darkness here -- they're Cure-loving metalheads, it's in their blood -- but there's shade and light, control of texture, with the band deepening rather than expanding." [...] Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press also awarded the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "Unlike their alleged 'peers' (do they really have any?), Deftones learned years ago that a whisper can be more terrifying than a scream and power isn't always about BPMs and downstrokes per minute." [...] He also added that Diamond Eyes [...] "belongs in a pantheon of amazing albums born from tragedy". BBC writer Mike Diver was also impressed, and opined that the album [...] "knocks every pretender to the band's throne {{into the middle of}} next week". He praised the band for playing to their strengths, and summarized: [...] "Eros is reportedly their excursion into weirdness, while this is a statement of consolidation, a neatly segued set that finds Deftones playing to their well-established strengths." ...|$|E

2500|$|In chapter 16, Gangleri asks [...] "what other {{particularly}} notable {{things are}} there to tell about the ash?" [...] High says <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot to tell about. High continues that an eagle sits on the branches of Yggdrasil {{and that it has}} much knowledge. Between the eyes of the eagle sits a hawk called Veðrfölnir. A squirrel called Ratatoskr scurries up and down the ash Yggdrasil carrying [...] "malicious messages" [...] between the eagle and Níðhöggr. Four stags named Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr, and Duraþrór run between the branches of Yggdrasil and consume its foliage. In the spring Hvergelmir are so many snakes along with Níðhöggr [...] "that no tongue can enumerate them". Two stanzas from Grímnismál are then cited in support. High continues that the norns that live by the holy well Urðarbrunnr each day take water from the well and mud from around it and pour it over Yggdrasil so that the branches of the ash do not rot away or decay. High provides more information about Urðarbrunnr, cites a stanza from Völuspá in support, and adds that dew falls from Yggdrasil to the earth, explaining that [...] "this is what people call honeydew, and from it bees feed".|$|E
2500|$|The soprano {{voice has}} {{typically}} {{been used as}} the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera since {{the latter half of the}} 18th century. Earlier, it was common for that part to be sung by any female voice, or even a castrato. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the Classical period. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high A (Handel, for example, only wrote one role extending to a high C), though the castrato Farinelli was alleged to possess a top D (his lower range was also extraordinary, extending to tenor C). The mezzo-soprano, a term of comparatively recent origin, also has a large repertoire, ranging from the female lead in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas to such heavyweight roles as Brangäne in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde (these are both roles sometimes sung by sopranos; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of movement between these two voice-types). For the true contralto, the range of parts is more limited, which has given rise to the insider joke that contraltos only sing [...] "witches, bitches, and britches" [...] roles. In recent years many of the [...] "trouser roles" [...] from the Baroque era, originally written for women, and those originally sung by castrati, have been reassigned to countertenors.|$|E
2500|$|George Loddiges' {{tropical}} hothouse range {{made use}} of recently invented curvilinear iron glazing bars and central heating systems, which together with his own inventions, enabled many new species of tropical plant to be introduced into cultivation, or flower {{for the first time}} in Europe. Visiting the hothouses on 30 March 1822, the Quaker pharmacist William Allen, his Cousin Emily Birkbeck and Anna Hanbury noted: We all went to Loddiges Nursery to see the camellias which are now in full bloom and very beautiful ! <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> forest of them: his hot-houses are, perhaps, the most capricious in the world: one off them is forty feet high: in this there is a banana tree which nearly reaches the top. A few years later, in 1829, Jacob Rinz (a visitor from a Frankfurt nursery) commented: never shall I forget the sensation produced by this establishment. I cannot describe the raptures I experienced on seeing that immense palm house. All that I had seen before of the kind appeared nothing to me compared with this. I fancied myself in the and especially at that moment when Mr Loddiges had the kindness to produce, in my presence, a shower of artificial rain. Such conditions were ideal for tropical orchids, several of which were named in honour of George Loddiges, including Loddiges' dendrobium.|$|E

2500|$|Jean Grey {{appears as}} a playable {{character}} in , voiced by Molly Hagan. She can be unlocked by collecting 5 shards of the M'Kraan Crystal. Her default costume is her Phoenix costume. She uses telepathy, telekinesis, {{and the power of}} the Phoenix. Jean's alternate costume is her [...] costume and she fits in the X-Men, Masters of Energy, Repentant Killers, Natural Leaders, and Femme Fatales team bonuses. Since she is a playable character in this game, her fate in the first game is non-canon. In the game she has a special conversation with Cable, however this conversation is only available if you pick Anti-Registration in the game, it deals on their family relationship and the status on the Civil War. Jean also has the unique ability to possibly resurrect herself from the dead in both versions of the game. In game, whenever Jean picks up an object the object hovers, giving the effect that Jean is holding the object with her tk. During her block, whenever she is hit by a projectile a telekinetic shield is partially visible. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> difference in the PS2/PSP/Wii version of her and her Xbox 360/PS3 version. In the former, Jean's telekinesis and telepathy is in the form of her pink energy signature, along with some fiery powers, and most of the animations are completely from X-Men Legends II. She also harnesses the signature Phoenix raptor during fusions. In the latter version, all of Jean's powers are fiery energy, including her telekinesis and telepathy. No Phoenix Raptor is in this version of her. Jean is not playable in the DS Version. Jean also appears on the back of the MUA2 cover for all versions. For some reason on the back of the cover she possess the fiery mane type of hair that she had under the artistic work of Phil Jimenez and Greg Land, but in the actual game she has straight hair.|$|E
