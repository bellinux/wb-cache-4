40|$|Abstract—Information {{propagation}} in a microblog network aims {{to identify}} a set of seed users for propagating a <b>target</b> <b>message</b> to as many interested users as possible. This problem differs from the traditional influence maximization in two major ways: it has a content-rich <b>target</b> <b>message</b> for propagation and it treats each link in the network as communication on certain topics and emphasizes the topic relevance of such communication in propagating the <b>target</b> <b>message.</b> In realistic situations, however, the topics associated with a link are not explicitly expressed but are hidden in the microblogs previously exchanged through the link. In this paper, we present a topic-aware solution to information propagation in a microblog network. We first model the latent topic structure of the network using observed microblog messages published in the network. We then present two methods for estimating the propagation probability based on the topic relevance between a link and the <b>target</b> <b>message.</b> Once the propagation probability is estimated, we adopt the standard greedy algorithm for influence maximization to find seed users. This approach is topic-aware in that the <b>target</b> <b>message</b> finds its way of propagation according to its topic relevance to the latent topic structure in the network. Experiments conducted on real Twitter datasets suggest that the proposed methods are able to select right seed users. I...|$|E
40|$|This letter studies an {{emerging}} wireless communication intervention {{problem at the}} physical layer, where a legitimate spoofer aims to spoof a malicious link from Alice to Bob, by replacing Alice's transmitted source message with its <b>target</b> <b>message</b> at Bob side. From an information-theoretic perspective, {{we are interested in}} characterizing the maximum achievable spoofing rate of this new spoofing channel, which is equivalent to the maximum achievable rate of the <b>target</b> <b>message</b> at Bob, under the condition that Bob cannot decode the source message from Alice. We propose a novel combined spoofing approach, where the spoofer sends its own <b>target</b> <b>message,</b> combined with a processed version of the source message to cancel the source message at Bob. For both cases when Bob treats interference as noise (TIN) or applies successive interference cancelation (SIC), we obtain the maximum achievable spoofing rates by optimizing the power allocation between the target and source messages at the spoofer.

3000|$|As discuss above, CE {{protocols}} {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} data privacy in deduplication. However, it is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. That is, suppose the <b>target</b> <b>message</b> is drawn from a finite space of size n S={M_ 1, [...]..., M_n}. Then, any attacker can generate the convergent key of each message and compute the corresponding ciphertext as in off-line encryption. If one computed ciphertext is equal to the target ciphertext, the <b>target</b> <b>message</b> is inferred. The basic reason is that CE is a deterministic symmetric encryption scheme, and the key space is limited. It implies that no MLE (CE) scheme can achieve traditional semantic security [21]. The ideal security for MLE scheme, PRV-CDA [6], refers to an encryption scheme that can achieve semantic security when the messages are unpredictable (i.e., have high min-entropy).|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an integrated compile-time and run-time system for efficient shared memory parallel computing on distributed memory machines. The combined system presents the user with a shared memory programming model, with its well-known benefits {{in terms of}} ease of use. The run-time system implements a consistent shared memory abstraction using memory access detection and automatic data caching. The compiler improves the effi ciency of the shared memory implementation by directing the runtime system to exploit the message passing capabilities of the underlying hardware. To do so, the compiler analyzes shared memory accesses, and transforms the code to insert calls to the run-time system that provide it with the access information computed by the compiler. The run-time system is augmented with the appropriate entry points to use this information to implement bulk data transfer and to reduce the overhead of run-time consistency maintenance. In those cases where the compiler analysis succeeds for the entire program, we demonstrate that the combined system achieves performance comparable to that produced by compilers that directly <b>target</b> <b>message</b> passing. If the compiler analysis is successful only for parts of the program, for instance, because of irregular accesses {{to some of the}} arrays, the resulting optimizations can be applied to those parts for which the analysis succeeds. If the compiler analysis fails entirely, we rely on the run-time's maintenance of shared memory, and thereby avoid the complexity and the limitations of compilers that directly <b>target</b> <b>message</b> passing. The result is a single system that combines efficient support for both regular and irregular memory access patterns...|$|E

Our attack works in the nonce misuse model. The attack exploits the slow propagation of message differences. The attack is very close to the universal forgery attack.
