5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> the stands, the {{opposing}} players and all four umpires gave Ripken {{a standing ovation}} lasting more than 22 minutes, {{one of the longest}} standing ovations for any athlete; ESPN did not go to a commercial break during the entire ovation. During the ovation, Ripken did a lap around the entire Camden Yards warning track to shake hands and give high-fives to the fans.|$|E
5|$|During the protest, {{the crowd}} {{assaulted}} a JNA armoured personnel carrier {{and managed to}} remove a machine gun mounted on the vehicle, while one of the protesters, Ivica Balić, hoisted a Croatian flag at the building to singing of the Croatian anthem by <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> <b>In</b> a scuffle which broke {{out in front of}} the building, Saško Gešovski, a JNA conscript from Macedonia, was killed by a shot fired from the crowd. By the end of the afternoon, the crowd removed the Yugoslav flag from the building, moved away and dispersed.|$|E

50|$|There {{have also}} been some cases of certain uses of force by civil {{resistance}} movements, whether against their adversaries, or to maintain internal discipline. For example, on 2 February 2011, in the generally peaceful Egyptian struggle against President Mubarak, some groups among <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>in</b> Tahrir Square in Cairo did use certain forms of force for a defensive purpose when they were attacked by pro-regime thugs, {{some of whom were}} riding on horses and camels. In the subsequent days <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>in</b> Tahrir Square reverted to using non-violent methods.|$|R
5|$|QPR paraded {{the trophy}} {{in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> their {{following}} home match at Loftus Road, where they defeated Bournemouth 4–0. The 1966–67 season saw QPR do a double, winning the Third Division title as well. The season {{is considered to be}} the most successful season in the club's history. Albion reached the final again in 1970, where they were once again runners-up, this time to Manchester City. QPR did not reach the final until 1986 when they lost against Oxford United.|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{was awarded}} a {{testimonial}} match by the club, against Scottish-side Celtic. All proceeds of the match went to charitable causes. Because of the injury he sustained three games earlier at Sunderland, Shearer was unable {{to play in the}} whole match; however he kicked-off the game and came off the bench to score a penalty, winning the game 3–2. The match was a sell-out, and saw Shearer perform a lap of honour at the end with his family, with his young son notably covering his ears due to the volume of noise produced by <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> tribute.|$|E
5|$|The Australians moved {{onto the}} next match against Derbyshire, where Miller scored a half-century and took 3/31 in an innings victory. Against Glamorgan, Miller took two wickets before {{striking}} a hard-hitting 84 with five sixes. He struck {{one of the}} sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> <b>In</b> a match against Lancashire, Jack Ikin had reached 99 despite being repeatedly hit. Miller refused to bowl to Ikin, saying that he felt the batsman deserved a century. Lindwall was given the ball and promptly removed Ikin for 99.|$|E

5|$|The Giants' 12–4 {{record in}} 1989 was the NFC's second-best (only to San Francisco's 14–2 record) They lost their divisional playoff game in {{overtime}} to the Rams, 19–13. The {{highlight of the}} game was wide receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass. After catching the ball, Anderson made a long run to the end zone, silencing <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> attendance. In 1989, free-agent acquisition Ottis Anderson ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Rookie Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third downs and special teams, catching 34 passes for 531 yards, and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The Kop {{is a large}} single-tiered stand. Originally a large terraced banking {{providing}} accommodation {{for more}} than 30,000spectators, the current incarnation was constructed in 1994–95 and is single-tiered with no executive boxes. The Kop houses the club's museum, the Reducate centre and the official club shop. The Kop is the most-renowned stand at Anfield among home and away supporters, {{with the people who}} occupy the stand referred to as kopites. Such was the reputation that the stand had it was claimed that <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> the Kop could suck the ball into the goal. Traditionally, Liverpool's most vocal supporters congregate in this stand.|$|E
5|$|To prevent Jewish {{violence}} from further escalating, Agrippa assembled the populace and delivered a tearful speech to <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> {{the company of}} his sister, but the Jews alienated their sympathies when the insurgents burned down their palaces. They fled the city to Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Meanwhile, Cestius Gallus moved into the region with the twelfth legion, {{but was unable to}} restore order and suffered defeat at the battle of Beth-Horon, forcing the Romans to retreat from Jerusalem.|$|E

2500|$|Reginald Marsh {{rejected}} modern art, {{which he}} found sterile. Marsh's style {{can best be}} described as social realism. His work depicted the Great Depression and a range of social classes whose division was accentuated by the economic crash. His figures are generally treated as types. [...] "What interested Marsh was not <b>the</b> individuals <b>in</b> a <b>crowd,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> itself ... <b>In</b> their density and picturesqueness, they recall <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movies of Preston Sturges or Frank Capra".|$|R

5|$|Filming {{took place}} on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often {{employed}} the art of guerrilla filmmaking (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, Kahaani was shot mostly without artificial light. The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included Kalighat Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot, Kumartuli, Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of Vijayadashami (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami in the premises of a Barowari (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the Ballygunge neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> the climax were not actors. Some actors mingled with the crowd engaged in Sindoor khela—their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply sindoor (vermilion) on Vidya's face so that accidental exposure of her eyes to sindoor could be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} season on 16 September, as Chelsea {{defeated}} Maccabi Tel Aviv 4–0 in the Champions League. He, Costa and Oscar were jeered by <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> December after the dismissal of Mourinho, with the supporters believing that the trio's conduct and poor performances were more culpable for the team's poor form. His first league goal came in a 3–3 home draw against Everton on 15 January 2016 and his second came in a 2–1 away win against Southampton on 27 February 2016. On 19 March 2016, Fàbregas scored a free-kick {{as well as a}} penalty in 2–2 home draw against local rivals West Ham United. Fàbregas scored Chelsea's last goal of the season after converting a penalty in the 1–1 draw against new Premier League champions, Leicester City.|$|E
5|$|In the World Cup finals El Salvador {{was drawn}} into a group with Belgium, Mexico, and the Soviet Union. El Salvador lost their first game 3–0 to Belgium in Mexico City on June 3. The second match was played against the host nation, Mexico, on 7 June. The game was decided by a {{controversial}} call {{near the end of}} the first half, with the score still at 0–0. Egyptian referee Hussain Kandil awarded a free kick to El Salvador in their own half. However, a Mexican player took the free-kick, passing to another Mexican player who scored. The Salvadoran players protested vigorously, to the extent of physically jostling Bermudan linesman Keith Dunstan, but the goal was allowed to stand. El Salvador restarted the game by kicking the ball into <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> protest. They eventually lost the game 4–0. The team's third and final game occurred on June 10 with El Salvador losing 2–0 to the Soviet Union in Mexico City, to finish at the bottom of Group A with 0 points.|$|E

5|$|Peace {{having been}} restored, a grand {{ceremonial}} procession was staged on 12 April 1159 for the triumphant entry of the Byzantine army into the city, with Manuel riding {{through the streets}} on horseback, while the Prince of Antioch and the King of Jerusalem followed on foot. Manuel dispensed justice to the citizens and presided over games and tournaments for <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> <b>In</b> May, {{at the head of}} a united Christian army, he started on the road to Edessa, but he abandoned the campaign when he secured the release by Nur ad-Din, the ruler of Syria, of 6,000 Christian prisoners captured in various battles since the second Crusade.* P. Magdalino, The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos, 67* J. H. Norwich, A short history of Byzantium Despite the glorious end of the expedition, modern scholars argue that Manuel ultimately achieved much less than he had desired in terms of imperial restoration.|$|E
5|$|Waddington first {{played for}} Yorkshire after the First World War, {{when the team}} had been {{weakened}} by injuries and retirements. He made an immediate impression in 1919, his first season; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire's victory in the County Championship that year. After a similarly successful season in 1920, he was selected for the 1920–21 Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Australia, during which he appeared {{in two of the}} five Tests. However, the England team were outclassed; used in an unfamiliar tactical role, Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again. He continued to be effective for Yorkshire, particularly against the weaker counties, but was often inconsistent. His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>in</b> a game against Middlesex. A succession of injuries reduced his effectiveness and he retired from first-class cricket in 1927. He continued to play league cricket and worked for the family business, a fat-refining firm, but maintained his connection with Yorkshire cricket.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} league {{championship}} in 1899, Villa's record-breaking average crowd of 21,000 allowed {{the club to}} invest in a two-stage ground improvement programme. The first stage extended the terrace covering on the Trinity Road side at the cost of £887; the second cost £1,300 and involved re-laying all terracing around the track to remedy a design flaw that caused poor sightlines for the majority of <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> <b>In</b> 1911, Villa bought the freehold of the ground for £8,250, the office buildings in the old aquarium and car park area for £1,500 and the carriage drive and bowling green for £2,000. This was the first stage in plans drawn up by Villa director Frederick Rinder that saw the capacity of Villa Park increased to 104,000. In June 1914, another phase of enhancements began at Villa Park to compete with improvements at other grounds around the country, including Everton's Goodison Park, where a new two-tiered stand had just been completed. The first stage of improvements saw the cycling track removed, new banking at the Holte Hotel End (Holte End), and a re-profiling of all the terracing to bring it closer to the newly squared-off pitch. Rinder turned to the renowned architect Archibald Leitch to design a new Villa Park. Their joint plans included large banked end stands at the Holte and Witton ends and the incorporation of the original Victorian Lower Grounds buildings, including the aquarium and the newly acquired bowling greens. The outbreak of the First World War severely hampered design and construction efforts.|$|E
