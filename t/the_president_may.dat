5|$|The President of Croatia is the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces of the Republic of Croatia and appoints and relieves military commanders of duty, conforming to applicable legislation. Pursuant to decisions of the parliament, the president declares war and concludes peace. In cases of immediate threats to the independence, unity and existence of the state, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>may</b> order the use of armed forces, even if no state of war is declared, provided that such an order is countersigned by the prime minister. During a state of war, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>may</b> promulgate regulations with the force of law on the basis of, and within the scope of, authority obtained from the parliament. In such circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>may</b> convene government cabinet meetings and preside over them. If the parliament is not in session, the president is authorized to regulate all matters required by the state of war through regulations carrying the force of law. In case of an immediate threat to the independence, unity and existence of the state, or if the governmental bodies are prevented from performing their constitutional duties regularly, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>may,</b> at the proposal of the prime minister, issue regulations carrying the force of law. Such regulations must also be countersigned by the prime minister to become valid. The president is required to submit regulations that are promulgated thus to the parliament for approval as soon as the parliament may convene, otherwise the regulations become void. The president cooperates with the government directing operation of the Croatian security and intelligence system. The president and the prime minister jointly appoint heads of the security agencies, and <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>may</b> attend cabinet meetings, taking part in discussions held at such meetings.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{national}} emergency has an {{adverse effect on}} these rights. Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such a situation, the legislature may make laws that go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> again {{submit a}} written {{declaration}} of recovery to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House.

5|$|Section 4 {{is meant}} to be invoked should the President's incapacitation prevent him from {{discharging}} his duties, but he is unable or unwilling to provide the written declaration called for by Section 3. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> resume exercising the Presidential duties by sending a written declaration to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House.|$|E

5|$|The President of Croatia may {{dissolve}} Parliament {{upon the}} request of the government if the government proposes a confidence motion to Parliament and the majority of all deputies adopt a motion of no confidence or if Parliament fails to approve government budget 120 days after the budget is proposed in the parliament. That decision must be countersigned by the Prime Minister to become valid. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> also dissolve Parliament after a motion of no confidence supported by a majority of all deputies has been adopted and a new government cannot be formed within 30 days or if a new government cannot be formed after general elections (maximum period of 120 days). However, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> not dissolve Parliament at {{the request of}} the government if a procedure to determine if the President has violated provisions of the constitution is in progress.|$|E

5|$|In case of brief incapacitation {{to execute}} {{the office of the}} President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>may</b> {{transfer}} his powers to the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties {{for a longer period of}} time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.|$|E
5|$|That the negotiations, {{acceptance}} of the assignment and agreements and understandings in respect thereof were within the competence of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> not be doubted. Governmental power over external affairs is not distributed, but is vested exclusively in the national government. And in respect of what was done here, the Executive had authority to speak as the sole organ of that government. The assignment and the agreements in connection therewith did not, {{as in the case}} of treaties, as that term is used in the treaty making clause of the Constitution (article 2, 2), require the advice and consent of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{provides}} that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> {{refer to a}} tribunal consisting of not less than three judges of the Supreme Court for its opinion any question as {{to the effect of}} any provision of the Constitution that has arisen or appears likely to arise. Where a Constitutional Tribunal has given an opinion, no court has jurisdiction to question the opinion, or the validity of any law the bill for which {{was the subject of a}} reference to the Tribunal.|$|E

5|$|The President must {{declare the}} office of Prime Minister vacant if the Prime Minister resigns his office, or if the President, acting in his discretion, is {{satisfied}} that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. In the latter situation, the President is required first to inform the Prime Minister of his evaluation in this regard, and if the Prime Minister requests him to, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> dissolve Parliament instead of making a declaration of vacancy. A general election must be held within three months after the dissolution of Parliament. This gives the former Prime Minister the opportunity to consolidate support by receiving a fresh mandate at the polls.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} grounds relate to {{attempts}} by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts {{to alter the}} President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the bill does not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} eleven presidents of Pakistan since the {{introduction}} of the post in 1956. The office was established when Pakistan was declared as a republic with the adoption of the 1956 constitution, and Saad Mirza became the first president of the country. Apart from these eleven, two acting presidents have also been in office for short periods of time. One of them, Wasim Sajjad, served as acting president on two non-consecutive occasions during 1993 and 1997–98. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>may</b> remain in office for a tenure of five years. In the case where a president's term of office is terminated early or during the absence of the president, the Chairman of the Senate assumes office.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Vice <b>President</b> <b>may</b> play a {{major role}} in foreign affairs. For instance, <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> {{generally}} sits on the Foreign Affairs Leading Group, a policy coordination body of the Communist Party. <b>The</b> Vice <b>President</b> has also typically sits on the Central Coordination Group for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs. Therefore, while <b>the</b> Vice <b>President</b> <b>may</b> not actually have substantive powers as defined in the Constitution, the office nonetheless carries significance and prestige. The holders of the office have all been individuals with a degree of political clout.|$|R

5|$|Whenever the Prime Minister is ill, {{absent from}} Singapore, or has been granted {{leave of absence}} from his duties, the {{functions}} conferred on him by the Constitution are exercisable by any other Minister authorized by the President. In general, the President must act in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice in appointing a Minister for this purpose. However, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> act in his own discretion if in his opinion it is impracticable to obtain the advice of the Prime Minister due to his illness or absence.|$|E
5|$|A {{reference}} must be {{made under}} the hand of (that is, signed by) the President, and must be served on the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is required to assist the Tribunal in the hearing of the reference, and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> be represented by such legal counsel as the Tribunal may appoint, after consulting the President. The parties appearing before the Tribunal are {{not confined to the}} President and the Attorney-General. The Tribunal may direct that the hearing of a reference be notified to any interested person or, where there is an interested class of persons, to one or more representatives of the class. If there is any interest that is affected which is not represented by counsel, the Tribunal may request that counsel argue the case for this interest.|$|E
5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>may</b> rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E

5|$|The Fundamental Rights are not {{absolute}} and {{are subject to}} reasonable restrictions as necessary {{for the protection of}} public interest. In the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case in 1973, the Supreme Court, overruling a previous decision of 1967, held that the Fundamental Rights could be amended, subject to judicial review in case such an amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights can be enhanced, removed or otherwise altered through a constitutional amendment, passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of Parliament. The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension any of the Fundamental Rights, excluding Articles 20 and 21, by order of the President. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>may,</b> by order, suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well, thereby barring citizens from approaching the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights, except Articles 20 and 21, during the period of the emergency. Parliament may also restrict the application of the Fundamental Rights to members of the Indian Armed Forces and the police, in order to ensure proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline, by a law made under Article 33.|$|E

5|$|The National Assembly makes legislation. The body {{consists}} of 155 members elected for four-year terms who meet {{three times per}} year. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions when called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a National Assembly president every two years. The president must sign or reject newly passed laws within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister's plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch's programme twice in one year, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>may</b> disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through his party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), which holds a large majority.|$|E
