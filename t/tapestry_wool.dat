500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, canvaswork in tent or petit point stitch again became popular. [...] The new fashion, using printed {{patterns}} and coloured <b>tapestry</b> <b>wools</b> imported from Berlin, was called Berlin wool work. Patterns and wool for Berlin work appeared in London in 1831. Berlin work was stitched to hand-coloured or charted patterns, leaving {{little room for}} individual expression, and was so popular that [...] "Berlin work" [...] became synonymous with [...] "canvaswork". [...] Its chief characteristic was intricate three-dimensional looks created by careful shading. [...] By mid-century, Berlin work was executed in bright colours {{made possible by the}} new synthetic dyes. [...] Berlin work was very durable and was made into furniture covers, cushions, bags, and slippers as well as for embroidered [...] "copies" [...] of popular paintings. The craze for Berlin work peaked around 1850 and died out in the 1870s, under the influence of a competing aesthetic that would become known as art needlework.|$|R

25|$|Traditionally, {{cochineal}} {{was used}} for colouring fabrics. During the colonial period, {{with the introduction of}} sheep to Latin America, the use of cochineal increased, as it provided the most intense colour and it set more firmly on woolen garments than on clothes made of materials of pre-Hispanic origin such as cotton or agave and yucca fibers. In general, cochineal is more successful on protein-based animal fibres (including silk) than plant-based material. Once the European market discovered the qualities of this product, the demand for it increased dramatically. By the beginning of the 17th century, it was traded internationally. Carmine became strong competition for other colourants such as madder root, kermes, Polish cochineal, Armenian cochineal, brazilwood, and Tyrian purple, as they were used for dyeing the clothes of kings, nobles, and the clergy. For the past several centuries, it was the most important insect dye used in the production of hand-woven oriental rugs, almost completely displacing lac. It was also used for painting, handicrafts, and <b>tapestries.</b> Cochineal-coloured <b>wool</b> and cotton are important materials for Mexican folk art and crafts.|$|R
40|$|Fragment of {{woven fabric}} with yellowed wool warp, small {{remnants}} of undyed linen weft {{and a large}} tapestry oval (pendant ?). The oval is edged with slit tapestry floral motifs.

The <b>wool</b> <b>tapestry</b> weft is varying shades of grey/green on less abraded (front?) side but is purple {{on the opposite side}} of the fabric.; Somewhat dirty and very worn. There are several interior holes and edge tears. Much of the linen weft-wrapping has deteriorated, as well as the linen wefts. Minor edge fraying of the tapestry weft...|$|R
50|$|In the 14th and 15th centuries, Arras, France was a {{thriving}} textile town. The industry specialised in fine <b>wool</b> <b>tapestries</b> which {{were sold to}} decorate palaces and castles all over Europe. Few of these tapestries survived the French Revolution as hundreds were burnt to recover the gold thread that was often woven into them. Arras is still {{used to refer to}} a rich tapestry no matter where it was woven. Indeed, as literary scholar Rebecca Olson argues, arras were the most valuable objects in England during the early modern period and inspired writers such as William Shakespeare and Edmund Spenser to weave these tapestries into their most important works such as Hamlet and The Faerie Queen.|$|R

2500|$|During {{a trip to}} Los Angeles in 1978, Lichtenstein {{was fascinated}} by lawyer Robert Rifkind's {{collection}} of German Expressionist prints and illustrated books. He began to produce works that borrowed stylistic elements found in Expressionist paintings. The White Tree (1980) evokes lyric Der Blaue Reiter landscapes, while Dr. Waldmann (1980) recalls Otto Dix's Dr. Mayer-Hermann (1926). Small colored-pencil drawings were used as templates for woodcuts, a medium favored by Emil Nolde and Max Pechstein, as well as Dix and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Also in the late 1970s, Lichtenstein's style was replaced with more surreal works such as Pow Wow (1979, Ludwig Forum für Internationale Kunst, Aachen). A major series of Surrealist-Pop paintings from 1979–81 is based on Native American themes. These works range from Amerind Figure (1981), a stylized life-size sculpture reminiscent of a streamlined totem pole in black-patinated bronze, to the monumental <b>wool</b> <b>tapestry</b> Amerind Landscape (1979). The [...] "Indian" [...] works took their themes, like {{the other parts of}} the Surrealist series, from contemporary art and other sources, including books on American Indian design from Lichtenstein's small library.|$|R
40|$|Fragment of a woven <b>wool</b> <b>tapestry</b> {{with brown}} warp and red, black, purple, blue, green/blue, olive green, white and yellow weft. A row of eight multi-colored birds, {{outlined}} in black, crosses {{the center of}} the fragment. Above and below the birds there are red bands with a row of small black diamonds outlined in white. There is a border of warp loops enclosing three white yarns (two are zzS, the third is two zzS yarns that have been Z-twisted together) along the edge below the birds. There are six picks of yellow weft between the red bands and the border. Along the opposite edge there is a section with a very crude finish of overcast white stitches which enclose two white yarns across the edge. The balance of this edge is unfinished with loose warps that are up to 3 cm long. The two warp-wise edges have plain selvedges.

Some of the black yarn outlining the birds has deteriorated...|$|R
40|$|Large {{fragment}} of linen fabric with <b>wool</b> and linen <b>tapestry</b> borders. The tapestry bands, using two colors; purple/red and dark brown, vary from 4. 5 cm to 5 cm wide. The dark brown/black/purple yarn is z twisted. There {{are parts of}} selvedge {{in two of the}} corners on the same side. This fragment was, possibly, part of a tunic or other item of clothing. There is a small section of linen plain weave (1. 1 cm wide) near the top right corner, indicating a plain linen border at the top and, probably at the bottom, also. The center of the fragment is linen plain weave.; Approximately {{in the center of each}} band there is an animal in a rectangle 6 cm across. Another figure appears at bottom right. The figures are woven with linen using a wool background. The rest of each border consists of scallops of wool with linen as a center line.

40|$|For {{over five}} hundred years a group of <b>wool</b> <b>{{tapestries}}</b> created in China have been stored in Japan. The tapestries are woven of soft wool, their surfaces hand painted with unusual motifs on backgrounds dyed the soft orange-red hue produced by the safflower plant. Their motifs are identified with the ancient Manichaean religion, considered extinct since the seventeenth century. The motifs and {{the layout of the}} tapestries’ design suggests that they functioned as mantles used by religious leaders. The Chinese government outlawed the Manichaean religion and prohibited its trappings, the laws strictly enforced as the Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644) became firmly established. The tapestries were collected and destroyed, with a few sold off to ocean traders. In the following centuries the merchants of Kyoto were able to acquire some of the latter and have utilized them ever since to adorn their annual Gion Festival Procession. Meanwhile, in China, surviving religionists migrated southward to China’s Southern Coastal communities. This migration, began as early as the Sung Dynasty (1127 - 1278), continued throughout the Yuan (1279 - 1368) and Ming (1368 - 1644) Dynasties. The artisans, who were descendants of Uyghur Manichaean clans who had settled in China as early as the ninth century, strived to perpetuate their sacerdotal costume tradition of decorated wool mantles. However, in their new environment in Southern Coastal China, the only sheep bred were marshland sheep, which produce a coarse rough yarn. The cherished red-orange dye was scarce as well, as safflower was cultivated in the North. Fine hand painting was replaced by wood-block printing. Taoist motifs, more acceptable to the Chinese Government, replaced the outlawed Manichaean motifs. Nevertheless the designers, weavers, and dyers continued to produce the transformed tapestries in Southern Coastal communities, production continuing throughout the twentieth century...|$|R
