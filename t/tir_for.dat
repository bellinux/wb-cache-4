This is called spherical aberration. When moving from a denser medium into a less dense one (i.e., n 1  > n 2), above an incidence angle known as the critical angle, all light is reflected. This phenomenon is known as TIR (later we will discuss how TIR affects our designed model). The critical angle is approximately 41.5  degrees for Plexiglas in air [9, 10].|$|E

In the memristor, Joule heating therefore cannot be conservedby an increase in temperature. Instead, conservation proceeds by the QED induced creation of photons within the TIR confinement frequency of the memristor. QED stands for quantum electrodynamics and <b>TIR</b> <b>for</b> total internal reflection. The TIR confinement of QED photons is enhanced by the fact the absorbed energy is concentrated in the TIR mode {{because of the high}} surface to volume ratio in nanostructures.

The setup is devised by directly etching gratings into the bottom side of a prism so that light can successfully enter (or exit) the compression grating. Dependence of the - 1 order diffraction efficiencies on the constructive parameters is analyzed for TE- and TM-polarized incident light at Littrow angle by using Fourier modal method {{in order to obtain}} optimal grating structure. The electric field enhancement within the high-efficiency TIR gratings is regarded as another criterion to optimize the structure of the TIR gratings. With the criterion of high diffraction efficiency, low electric field enhancement and sufficient manufacturing latitude, TIR compression gratings with optimized constructive parameters are obtained for TE- and TM-polarized incident light, respectively. The grating for TE-polarized light exhibits diffraction efficiencies higher than 0. 95 within 23 nm bandwidth and relatively low square of electric field enhancement ratio of 5. 7. Regardless of the internal electric field enhancement, the grating for TM-polarized light provides diffraction efficiencies higher than 0. 95 within 42 nm bandwidth. With compact structure, such TIR compression gratings made solely of fused silica should be of great interest for application to chirped pulse amplification (CPA) systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract—Ovshinsky {{initiated}} {{scientific research}} in the field of amorphous and disordered materials that continues to this day. The Ovshinsky Effect where the resistance of thin GST films is significantly reduced upon the application of low voltage is of fundamental importance in phase-change- random access memory (PC-RAM) devices. GST stands for GdSbTe chalcogenide type glasses. However, the Ovshinsky Effect is not without controversy. Ovshinsky thought the resistance of GST films is reduced by the redistribution of charge carriers; whereas, others at that time including many PC-RAM researchers today argue that the GST resistance changes because the GST amorphous state is transformed to the crystalline state by melting, the heat supplied by external heaters. In this controversy, quantum mechanics (QM) asserts the heat capacity of GST films vanishes, and therefore melting cannot occur as the heat supplied cannot be conserved by an increase in GST film temperature. By precluding melting, QM re-opens the controversy between the melting and charge carrier mechanisms. Supporting analysis is presented to show that instead of increasing GST film temperature, conservation proceeds by the QED induced creation of photons within the GST film, the QED photons confined by TIR. QED stands for quantum electrodynamics and <b>TIR</b> <b>for</b> total internal reflection. The TIR confinement of QED photons is enhanced by the fact the absorbedheat energy absorbed in the GST film is concentrated in the TIR mode because of their high surface to volume ratio.

40|$|Using {{infrared}} {{data from}} the Herschel Space Observatory and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) 3 GHz observations in the COSMOS field, we investigate the redshift evolution of the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) we classify as either spheroid- or disc-dominated based on their morphology. The sample predominantly consists of disc galaxies with stellar mass ≳ 10 ^ 10 M_, and residing on the star-forming main sequence (MS). After the removal of AGN using standard approaches, we observe {{a significant difference between}} the redshift-evolution of the median IR/radio ratio q_TIR of (i) a sample of ellipticals, plus discs with a substantial bulge component (`spheroid-dominated' SFGs) and, (ii) virtually pure discs and irregular systems (`disc-dominated' SFGs). The spheroid-dominated population follows a declining q_TIR vs. z trend similar to that measured in recent evolutionary studies of the IRRC. However, for disc-dominated galaxies, where radio and IR emission should be linked to star formation in the most straightforward way, we measure very little change in q_TIR. This suggests that low-redshift calibrations of radio emission as an SFR-tracer may remain valid out to at least z ≃ 1 - 1. 5 for pure star-forming systems. We find that the different redshift-evolution of q_ <b>TIR</b> <b>for</b> the spheroid- and disc-dominated sample is mainly due to an increasing radio excess for spheroid-dominated galaxies at z ≳ 0. 8, hinting at some residual AGN activity in these systems. This finding demonstrates that in the absence of AGN the IRRC is independent of redshift, and that radio observations can therefore be used to estimate SFRs at all redshifts for genuinely star-forming galaxies.

30|$|Robust {{waveform}} {{design to}} resist uncertainty sets of target or clutter parameters (i.e., Doppler frequency, angle) has received considerable attention {{during the last}} decades [4 – 19]. According {{to the structure of}} radar systems, these works can be classified into two categories. The first one focuses on the robust design for monostatic radar systems. Specifically, in [4], the design of robust radar code under energy and similarity constraints is investigated to improve the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over the possible target Doppler frequencies by using semidefinite programming (SDP)-related technique. In [5], the robust approach based on SDP and randomization with respect to the target Doppler is proposed to synthesize the radar waveform accounting for a peak-to-average-power ratio (PAR) and an energy constraint in order to the improvement of the worst-case SNR. For the detection problem of the extended target with the uncertain set on target impulse response (TIR), the robust transmit waveform accounting for constant modulus constraint and receiving filter have been designed jointly. In [6], considering worst-case SINR as the performance measure and assuming an interval of target Doppler shift are available, the robust design of transmit sequence and receive filter under energy and similarity constraints has been considered by exploiting related SDP relaxation. Considering the same criteria, the uncertain set, and waveform constraints, the related generalized Dinkelbach’s procedure [7] is developed to optimize radar waveform and doppler filter bank. For extended targets considering the uncertainties on the TIR and using the PAR and energy as signal constraints, in [8], a design procedure, based on SDP relaxation and randomization technique, is proposed to devise robust transmit code and receive filter aiming to improve the worst-case SINR. Assuming as figure of merit worst-case SINR, in [9], a max-min approach against the uncertainly sets of <b>TIR</b> <b>for</b> extended targets and the second-order statistics of the interference, is exploited to devise the waveform considering energy constraint.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. MD is {{commonly}} used in computational physics to determine the atomic response of nanostructures. MD stands for molecular dynamics. With theoretical basis in statistical mechanics, MD relates the thermal energy of the atom to its momentum by the equipartition theorem. Momenta of atoms are derived by solving Newton’s equations with inter-atomic forces derived by Lennard-Jones or L-J potentials. MD implicitly assumes the atom always has heat capacity as otherwise the momenta of the atoms cannot be related to their temperature. In bulk materials, the continuum is simulated by imposing PBC on an ensemble of atoms, the atoms always having heat capacity. PBC stands for periodic boundary conditions. MD simulations of the bulk are therefore valid because atoms in the bulk do indeed have heat capacity. Nanostructures differ. Unlike the continuum, the atom confined in discrete submicron structures is precluded by QM from having the heat capacity necessary to conserve absorbed EM energy {{by an increase in}} temperature. QM stands for quantum mechanics and EM for electromagnetic. Quantum corrections of MD solutions that would show the heat capacity of nanostructures vanishes are not performed. What this means is the MD simulations of discrete nanostructures published in the literature not only have no physical meaning, but are knowingly invalid by QM. In the alternative, conservation of absorbed EM energy is proposed to proceed by the creation of QED induced non-thermal EM radiation at the TIR frequency of the nanostructure. QED stands for quantum electrodynamics and <b>TIR</b> <b>for</b> total internal reflection. QED radiation creates excitons (holon and electron pairs) that upon recombination produce EM radiation that charges the nanostructure or is lost to the surroundings – a consequence only possible by QM as charge is not created in statistical mechanics. Valid and invalid MD simulations from the literature are illustrated with nanofluids and nanocars, respectively. Finally, valid and invalid MD solutions for the stiffening of NWs in tensile tests are presented to illustrate the unphysical findings if QM is ignored at the nanoscale. NW stands for nanowire...|$|E
