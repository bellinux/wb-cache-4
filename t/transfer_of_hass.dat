40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{generally}} focused on summarization {{of the information}} related to the high activity sealed sources of ionizing radiation, known as HASS, which are widely used {{in a variety of}} sectors in whole world and the Czech Republic as well. The thesis discusses specific cases of actual use <b>of</b> <b>HASS,</b> technical specification, types of occurring radionuclides and examples of use. The biological effects of ionizing radiation on humans related to HASS and some examples of specific adverse events are also described. In the intentions of this thesis is to take into account not only risks arising from incorrect manipulation, but also risks associated with potentially abuse <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> by terrorist organization. For these reasons, the thesis outlines the basic security requirements associated to the international standards and also mentioned in legislation of CR. In connection with these requirements the suggestion of particular security system on specific workplaces with HASS is than discussed. To supplement the reader's imagination of the real problems <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> in the Czech Republic, there is created a statistical overview <b>of</b> all <b>HASS</b> located in the Czech Republic. This includes the total number <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> and the largest area of use devided into various areas of application (medicine, industry, research/education, etc.), representation of most commonly used radionuclides, the geographical distribution <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> in the Czech Republic and the distribution in terms of the most common activities. The State Office for Nuclear Safety Registry was used as a source for this statistical overview. In the discussion part of the thesis, the real possibility <b>of</b> abuse <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> and also a possible ways of gain {{from the perspective of a}} potential lone striker or a wider terrorist organization is discussed. In general, the following thesis is a logical synthesis of relevant information allowing the reader to obtain a relatively comprehensive view on the whole issue <b>of</b> <b>HASS,</b> especially from the perspective of the broader field of radiation protection emphasized on achieving a socially acceptable security level of all high activity sources of ionizing radiation...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of humanities {{and social sciences}} in the development of empathetic and effective physicians has been documented in the literature. At AKU, Pakistan Studies and Islamic Studies have been mandatory components of the medical curriculum as per Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) requirements since the inception of the college. The Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS) program in the medical curriculum was introduced in 2008. It has evolved from being limited to Pakistan and Islamic Studies to including electives in foreign languages, literature, sociology, film, music, fine arts, photography etc. The main two strands of Pakistan Studies and Islamic Studies continue, but with emphasis on critical appraisal of history and respect for all religions of Pakistan. Methods: This study is a review of the history and evolution <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> at AKU and the associated opportunities and challenges that allowed for the development <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> as it is today using the following methodology: 1. Review of documents relevant to the shaping <b>of</b> <b>HASS.</b> 2. Key interviews of faculty members and senior leadership involved in the policy-level discourse that paved the way for introduction <b>of</b> a broader <b>HASS</b> curriculum in the Medical College at AKU. Results: The study is currently in progress, but anecdotal and preliminary evidence reveals institutional recognition of the {{importance of}} humanities education in the medical curriculum. Conclusions: The experience <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> academic team in the evolution and development <b>of</b> the current <b>HASS</b> program in the medical college at AKU will be shared. The importance of {{humanities and social sciences}} in the medical curriculum will be discussed in light of WHO’s focus on social determinants of health, and social accountability of medical education.

40|$|Objective: Aga Khan University, {{a private}} medical college, {{had a vision}} of {{producing}} physicians who are not only scientifically competent, but also socially sensitive, the latter by exposure of medical students to a broad-based curriculum. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the genesis of broad-based education and its integration into the undergraduate medical education program as the Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS) course. Methods: A qualitative methodology was used for this study. Sources of data included document review and in-depth key informant interviews. Nvivo software was utilized to extract themes. Results: The study revealed the process of operationalization of the institutional vision to produce competent and culturally sensitive physicians. The delay in the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which was expected to take a lead role in the delivery of a broad-based education, led to the development <b>of</b> an innovative <b>HASS</b> course in the medical curriculum. The study also identified availability of faculty and resistance from students as challenges faced in the implementation and evolution <b>of</b> <b>HASS.</b> Conclusions: The description of the journey and viability <b>of</b> integration <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> into the medical curriculum offers a model to medical colleges seeking ways to produce socially sensitive physicians...|$|R

40|$|The council annals <b>of</b> Johannes <b>Hass,</b> {{the last}} Catholic {{mayor of the}} West Bohemian town of Görlitz, are a {{fascinating}} document.

Regardless <b>of</b> <b>Hass’s</b> staunch Catholicism, Martin Luther’s impact can be felt in his vision of the divine and the demonic as he subconsciously incorporated minor elements of Lutheranism and commented positively on small changes brought about by the Reformation. Hass shows how receptive Catholics were towards Lutheran theology, without necessarily acknowledging it, as long as the new religion did not challenge the urban order. In rich and colourful language, Hass changed the very nature of God, the Devil and the saints. In this way he was responding to the slow but steady introduction of the Reformation in Görlitz. Only by gradually turning God into a passive observer and giving greater agency to human actors could <b>Hass</b> make sense <b>of</b> the absence of a clear sign in favour of the Catholics in Görlitz...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistical}} methods {{for the analysis}} of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity underwent considerable theoretical-practical development following the need for assessing the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of substances. Antimutagenicity is investigated through the analysis of respondents in dose-response assays, when two different molecules are administered separately and as a mixture to a respondent system. When the number of respondent units is high, and doses are orthogonal, it is possible to apply simple models such as analysis of variance. This is not always possible or common, and alternative approaches have been developed, based on multiple regression and on tables of proportions. In this work, some of the most frequently used methods for the assessment of joint responses are reviewed, particularly those based on multiple regression, such as the method of Shaeffer et al. and the method <b>of</b> <b>Hass</b> et al. In order to illustrate these methods, joint responses of perylene and cyclopentapyrene, of N-acetylcysteine and dinitropyrene, and of N-acetylcysteine and extracts from diesel exhausts were analyzed. An antagonistic effect of perylene on the action of CPP was detected by the algorithm of Shaeffer et al. The effect is not multiplicative, i. e., it is not proportional to the product of doses. The antimutagenic effect of N-acetylcysteine on dinitropyrene is multiplicative, as detected by the method <b>of</b> <b>Hass</b> et al. The latter reveals that the inhibition by N-acetylcysteine on the mutagenic effect of extracts from diesel exhausts is also multiplicative...|$|R
50|$|Hass avocado trees, {{like some}} other cultivars, may only bear well every other year. After {{a year with}} low yield, often because of cold, for which the tree does not have much tolerance, yields may be very high the next year.

The percent of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen {{are in agreement}} with literature. HA SS has higher percent of nitrogen which attributed to pertinacious structures. FTIR spectra of both acids exhibit, generally similar spectra with the typical major peaks reported for humic acids. Humic acid extracted from sewage sludge is characterized by lower average molecular weight, higher acidity, more phenolic groups and low heterogeneity than humic acids extracted from Nile hyacinth. The acidity of the two extracted humic acids were determined by potentiometric titrations and bariyta method The concentrations of COOH {{were found to be}} 2. 90 and 3. 74 meq / g H in HA extracted from sewage sludge and Nile hyacinth composts respectively, while the phenolic OH concentration was 4. 86 and, 2. 82 meq / g H in both acids respectively. The dissociation constant of COOH and phenolic OH acidic groups, pKa 1 and pKa 2 for the two acids were determined and effect of ionic strength on the ionization constants was studied and compared.
