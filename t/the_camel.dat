5|$|How <b>the</b> <b>Camel</b> Got His Hump — how {{the idle}} camel was punished {{and given a}} hump.|$|E
5|$|On 16 March, five {{companies}} from <b>the</b> <b>Camel</b> Corps and mounted infantry scouts, {{supported by a}} 12-pounder artillery battery and a Maxim machine gun battery, crossed the Darfur frontier and four days later occupied Um Shanga. Their only opposition was from a small observation post which was forced to withdraw. Unexpectedly, upon arrival the Anglo-Egyptian force found the water supply at Um Shanga scarce. With {{the main body of}} his force expected to arrive that evening, having only two days supply of water with them, Kelly considered withdrawing back to Sudan. Instead, he divided his force, forming a fast moving column, consisting of thirty mounted infantry scouts, 240 men from <b>the</b> <b>Camel</b> Corps, two artillery pieces and eight Maxims, which left for Jebel el Hella at dawn on 22 March.|$|E
5|$|The Just So Stories each {{tell how}} a {{particular}} animal was modified from an original form {{to its current}} form by the acts of man, or some magical being. For example, the Whale has a tiny throat because he swallowed a mariner, who tied a raft inside to block the whale from swallowing other men. <b>The</b> <b>Camel</b> has a hump {{given to him by}} a djinn as punishment for the camel's refusing to work (the hump allows <b>the</b> <b>camel</b> to work longer between times of eating). The Leopard's spots were painted by an Ethiopian (after the Ethiopian painted himself black). The Kangaroo gets its powerful hind legs, long tail, and hopping gait after being chased all day by a dingo, sent by a minor god responding to the Kangaroo's request to be made different from all other animals.|$|E
50|$|During production, {{several of}} <b>the</b> <b>camels</b> became {{dehydrated}} and {{drank too much}} water too quickly, causing them to become intoxicated. <b>The</b> <b>camels</b> had to be run in the heat until they regained their composure.|$|R
60|$|As before, {{the women}} and {{children}} were perched on the summit of their household goods on the top of <b>the</b> <b>camels.</b> Contrary to their usual custom most of the men walked, as <b>the</b> <b>camels</b> were loaded to the full extent of their powers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Fighting <b>Camels</b> {{have only}} {{appeared}} in one NCAA Tournament. <b>The</b> <b>Camels</b> lost their only NCAA tournament game, 56-82, to eventual 1992 National Champion Duke.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the role}} of <b>the</b> <b>camel</b> is {{diminishing}} {{with the advent of}} technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas. The dromedary has been used in warfare since the 2nd century BC, and it remains popular for racing, particularly in the Arab world. Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and the Sahara are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.|$|E
5|$|From 1996 to 2006, Nissin Foods {{operated}} a Cup Noodles billboard with smoke effects (an effect that {{had also been}} famously used by other Times Square billboards, such as <b>the</b> <b>Camel</b> Cigarettes sign). The Cup Noodles billboard was replaced in 2006 by a General Motors billboard featuring a Chevrolet branded clock; however, {{as a part of}} cutbacks resulting from GM's bankruptcy and re-organization, the Chevrolet Clock was removed in 2009 and eventually replaced by the current Dunkin' Donuts display.|$|E
5|$|In 1761 John Griffin {{published}} {{a letter in}} the London Chronicle recommending methods for entering <b>the</b> <b>Camel</b> estuary during rough weather, particularly while north-northwest winds were blowing and described the bolts and rings he had fixed to the cliffs to assist ships trying to enter the harbour. Mooring rings were still there in 1824, and around 1830, three capstans {{at the base of}} the cliffs and bollards along the cliffs, by which means boats could be warped safely past the bar were installed.|$|E
5000|$|Dickson now had two camels and 100 lions that he {{no longer}} needed. An {{assistant}} tied <b>the</b> <b>camels</b> behind a car, led them to the Seine and abandoned them. There they were found by the police. Eventually Dickson rented <b>the</b> <b>camels</b> and lions to another circus for 10,000 francs a week, only for the circus to fail and Dickson to be summoned to collect his animals. By now he was also being pursued by the Société de Protection des Animaux for cruelty in abandoning <b>the</b> <b>camels.</b> <b>The</b> animals were finally sent to a zoo near Hamburg.|$|R
5000|$|Biggles first meets Algy in <b>The</b> <b>Camels</b> Are Coming, {{at the end}} {{of which}} the First World War ends. However, Algy also {{features}} throughout Biggles in France, so the whole of Biggles in France must be set during the second half of <b>The</b> <b>Camels</b> Are Coming.|$|R
5000|$|The idiom {{the straw}} that broke <b>the</b> <b>camel's</b> back, {{alluding}} to the proverb [...] "it is the last straw that breaks <b>the</b> <b>camel's</b> back", describes <b>the</b> seemingly minor or routine action which causes an unpredictably large and sudden reaction, because of {{the cumulative effect of}} small actions.|$|R
5|$|Draught camel {{are used}} for several {{purposes}} including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators. It {{may be used for}} ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught camel can plough at around , and should not be used for more than six hours a day four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. <b>The</b> <b>camel</b> is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.|$|E
5|$|Kress von Kressenstein's Fourth Army {{was made}} up of the 3rd (Anatolian) Infantry Division's three regiments, the 31st, 32nd and 39th Infantry Regiments, totalling 16,000 men, of whom 11,000 to 11,873 were combatants, Arab {{ancillary}} forces; and one regiment of <b>the</b> <b>Camel</b> Corps. Estimates of their arms range from 3,293 to 12,000 rifles, 38 to 56 machine guns, and two to five anti-aircraft gun sections; they also fielded four heavy artillery and mountain gun batteries (30 artillery pieces) and the Pasha I formation. Nearly 5,000 camels and 1,750 horses accompanied the advance.|$|E
5|$|The Doom Bar is a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of <b>the</b> <b>Camel</b> estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. The bar is {{composed}} mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by bed load processes, and {{it has been shown that}} there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary. This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood. There is only a very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of the river's sediment is deposited much higher up the estuary.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>camels</b> {{were used}} as pack animals, {{especially}} in the north, while in <b>the</b> south, <b>camels</b> were used to pull drays with supplies for <b>the</b> riders. <b>Camels</b> were ideal for this as they could go {{for a long time}} without water, and it has been suggested [...] that the fence could not have been built or maintained without <b>the</b> use of <b>camels.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Camels</b> Butte Member {{consists}} of montmorillonitic and micaceous claystone, siltstone, lignite, poorly cemented sandstone and conglomerate. The upper part includes a massive fluvial sandstone that caps {{many of the}} major buttes in southwestern North Dakota. <b>The</b> <b>Camels</b> Butte Member reaches a maximum thickness of about 107 m.|$|R

5|$|The baggage camel {{should be}} robust and heavy. Studies have {{recommended}} <b>the</b> <b>camel</b> should have either a small {{or a large}} head with a narrow aquiline nose, prominent eyes and large lips. The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high. The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle. The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular and sturdy. The dromedary can be trained to carry baggage {{from the age of}} five years, but must not be given heavy loads before the age of six. The hawia is a typical baggage saddle from Sudan. The methods of training the baggage camels are similar to those for riding camels.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Arabian horse {{may have}} been domesticated {{by the people of}} the Arabian {{peninsula}} known today as the Bedouin, some time after they learned to use <b>the</b> <b>camel,</b> approximately 4,000–5,000years ago. One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia. Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in the Arabian peninsula prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions in the Arabian Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.|$|E
5|$|With the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve, Chauvel {{sent the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{to move on}} Magdhaba by the north and {{north-east}} {{to cut off the}} possibility of retreat while the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade followed the telegraph line straight to Magdhaba. The 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced mounted to the attack but fierce shrapnel fire forced them to advance up the wadi bed. By midday all three brigades and <b>the</b> <b>Camel</b> Brigade, despite support from machine-guns and artillery, were hotly engaged. Aerial reconnaissance from Australian and British aircraft, which scouted out the Turkish positions, greatly assisted the attack, although the Turkish positions were obscured by the effect of a mirage and dust clouds.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Bactrian <b>camel</b> shares <b>the</b> genus Camelus {{with the}} {{dromedary}} (C. dromedarius) and <b>the</b> wild Bactrian <b>camel</b> (C. ferus). <b>The</b> Bactrian <b>camel</b> belongs to <b>the</b> family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) {{was the first}} to describe the species of Camelus. He named two species in his History of Animals: <b>the</b> one-humped Arabian <b>camel</b> and <b>the</b> two-humped Bactrian <b>camel.</b> <b>The</b> Bactrian <b>camel</b> was given its current binomial name Camelus bactrianus by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae.|$|R

5|$|Brian {{begins to}} search for a way {{to get back to the}} United States, but Stewie refuses to leave with him and insists they travel to London. Brian and Stewie search for a camel to use as transportation, and they perform a musical number as a {{diversion}} in order to steal one. They begin their journey, but <b>the</b> <b>camel</b> dies in the middle of the desert. They soon find a nearby Comfort Inn, however, in which to stay. They steal a hot air balloon from the hotel premises and make their way to the Vatican City, embarrassing the Pope upon landing, then traveling by train from Switzerland to Munich, and end up in Amsterdam. Upon finally arriving at the BBC Television Centre, Stewie is horrified to learn that the farm is a set, and his beloved characters are merely tired out, disinterested actors. Enraged, Stewie decides to travel back home with Brian to Quahog after getting revenge at the Mother Maggie actress for kicking him by defecating in her shoes. This ordeal also causes Stewie to lose interest in the show.|$|E
5|$|Fleas and ticks {{are common}} causes of {{physical}} irritation. In {{a study in}} Egypt, a species of Hyalomma was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.6% of the adult ticks isolated from the camels. In Israel, the number of ticks per camel ranged from 20 to 105. Nine camels in the date palm plantations in Arava Valley were injected with ivermectin, which is not effective against Hyalomma tick infestations. Larvae of <b>the</b> <b>camel</b> nasal fly Cephalopsis titillator can cause possibly fatal brain compression and nervous disorders. Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are pyogenic diseases and wound infections caused by Corynebacterium and Streptococcus, pulmonary disorders caused by Pasteurella such as hemorrhagic septicemia and Rickettsia species, camelpox, anthrax, and cutaneous necrosis caused by Streptothrix and deficiency of salt in the diet.|$|E
5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help <b>the</b> <b>camel</b> avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for {{an equal amount of}} time.|$|E

5000|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} {{from a single}} leaf specimen found at the White Butte locality, USNM number 14048. This locality is placed in <b>the</b> <b>Camels</b> Butte member of the Golden Valley Formation. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Camels</b> Butte member outcrops {{at a number of}} sites in western North Dakota, and is designated the type locality.|$|R
50|$|The {{camp was}} the {{headquarters}} for U.S. Camel Corps, which experimented with using dromedaries as pack {{animals in the}} southwestern United States. <b>The</b> Army imported <b>camels</b> in 1856 and 1857, using them with some success in extended surveys in <b>the</b> Southwest. <b>The</b> <b>camels</b> did not get along with the Army's horses and mules, which would bolt out of fear when they smelled a <b>camel.</b> <b>The</b> soldiers found <b>the</b> <b>camels</b> difficult to handle and they detested {{the smell of the}} animals.|$|R
5|$|The first clashes {{took place}} at 6:30 when French tank {{divisions}} stormed the central position of the Syrian defensive line while French cavalry and infantry units assaulted the Syrians' northern and southern positions. <b>The</b> <b>camel</b> cavalry were the first Syrian units to engage the French. Syrian forces initially put up stiff resistance along the front, but lacked coordination between their different units. Early in the clashes, Syrian artillery fire inflicted casualties on a battery of French soldiers. French tanks faced heavy fire as they attempted to gain ground against the Syrians. However, French artillery took a toll on Syrian forces and by 8:30 the French had broken the Syrians' central trench. At {{one point in the}} first few hours of the clashes, Syrian forces managed to briefly pin down two Senegalese companies that were relatively isolated on the French right flank. The losses inflicted on the two Senegalese units represented roughly half of the French army's total casualties. Nonetheless, by 10:00, the battle was effectively over, having turned decisively in favor of the French.|$|E
5|$|The {{landings}} were overwhelmingly successful. On Delta and Alpha beaches, German {{resistance was}} low. The Osttruppen surrendered quickly, {{and the biggest}} threat to the Allies were the mines. A single German gun as well as a mortar position were silenced by destroyer fire. The Allied units in this sector were able to secure a bridgehead and quickly linked up with the paratroopers, capturing Saint-Tropez as well LeMuy. The most serious fighting was on Camel Beach near the town of Saint-Raphaël. This beach was secured by several well-emplaced coastal guns as well as flak batteries. Through heavy German fire the Allies attempted to land at the shore. However, at sector Red of <b>the</b> <b>Camel</b> Beach landing zone the Allies were not able to succeed. A bombing run of 90Allied B-24 bombers was called in against a German strongpoint here. Even with the assistance of naval fire, the Allies were not able to bring the landing ships close to the shore. They decided to avoid Camel Red and land only at the sectors of Camel Blue and Camel Green, which was successful.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{considered}} it very unlikely that an attack would occur anywhere {{other than in}} the northern sector and therefore was prepared to reduce the troops in Nos 1 and 2 Sectors to a minimum. He decided not to reinforce his four infantry brigades, but to increase the available fire-power at Romani by moving up the 160th and 161st Machine Gun Companies of the 53rd (Welsh) and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions. He also ordered the concentration of a small mobile column {{made up of the}} 11th Light Horse, the City of London Yeomanry (less one squadron each) with the 4th, 6th and 9th Companies of the Imperial Camel Brigade in No. 2 Sector. He calculated that the whole of the defensive force, including <b>the</b> <b>camel</b> transport necessary to enable infantry in the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division to advance into the desert, would be fully equipped and the camels assembled by 3 August. Approximately 10,000 Egyptian Camel Transport Corps camels concentrated at Romani prior to the battle. British monitors in the Mediterranean Sea off Mahamdiyah got into position to shell the assembling Ottoman force, while an armoured train at Kantara was ready to assist the defence of the right flank, and all available aircraft were on standby at Ismailia, Kantara, Port Said and Romani.|$|E
