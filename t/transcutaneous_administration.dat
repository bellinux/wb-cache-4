40|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} neurogenic bladder dysfunctions in children is administration of anticholinergic medication {{in combination with}} a intermittend catheteriziation. However, not all patients can be sufficiently stabilized with this established therapy. Botulinum toxins are gaining increasing importance in treating neurogenic and non-neurogenic bladder dysfunctions in children. For my doctoral thesis I studied the efficiency side effects, and causes for failures of this new treatment {{in case of a}} neurogenic symptomatic entity. The following points can be concluded: -BoNT/A detrusor injections are a safe treatment option for children with refractory neurogenic detrusor hyperactivity: no significant toxin-related side effects were seen. -BoNT/A leads to a clear improvement in all urodynamic parameters: increase in reflex volume, maximum bladder capacity and compliance, and decrease in maximum detrusor pressure. -Therapy failures can be caused by the occurrence of botulinum toxin antibodies. In our clinic BoNT/A detrusor injection has established itself as a new and effective instrument for children with neurogenic detrusor hyperactivity. It closes the gap for patients who do not respond sufficiently to high-dosage anticholergenic medication only, and for whom the last measure would be bladder augmentation. Our therapy algorithm, consisting of a combined therapy of oral / intravesical / <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of anticholinergics and, if required, additional BoNT/A injection at a nine-month intervals ensures an adequate bladder pressure situation in most children/ adolescents...|$|E

40|$|<b>Transcutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> has the {{potential}} to improve therapeutics delivery, providing an approach that is safer and more convenient than traditional alternatives, while offering the opportunity for improved therapeutic efficacy through sustained/controlled drug release. To this end, a microneedle materials platform is demonstrated for rapid implantation of controlled-release polymer depots into the cutaneous tissue. Arrays of microneedles composed of drug-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles or solid PLGA tips are prepared with a supporting and rapidly water-soluble poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) matrix. Upon application of microneedle patches to the skin of mice, the microneedles perforate the stratum corneum and epidermis. Penetration of the outer skin layers is followed by rapid dissolution of the PAA binder on contact with the interstitial fluid of the epidermis, implanting the microparticles or solid polymer microneedles in the tissue, which are retained following patch removal. These polymer depots remain in the skin for weeks following application and sustain the release of encapsulated cargos for systemic delivery. To show the utility of this approach the ability of these composite microneedle arrays to deliver a subunit vaccine formulation is demonstrated. In comparison to traditional needle-based vaccination, microneedle delivery gives improved cellular immunity and equivalent generation of serum antibodies, suggesting {{the potential}} of this approach for vaccine delivery. However, the flexibility of this system should allow for improved therapeutic delivery in a variety of diverse contexts. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

40|$|The alpha 7 nicotinic {{receptor}} is reportedly {{a key element}} in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Because a prototypical ligand for this receptor is nicotine, we studied the in vivo human response to bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the context of nicotine or placebo pretreatment. Twelve adult male normal subjects were studied prospectively. Six received overnight <b>transcutaneous</b> nicotine <b>administration</b> by application of a standard patch (7 mg). Six hours later, all subjects were given an intravenous dose of endotoxin (2 ng/kg) and were evaluated for an additional 24 h for circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers, vital signs and symptoms. The nicotine subjects had elevated blood levels of the nicotine metabolite, continine, prior to and throughout the 24 -h post-endotoxin exposure phase. Subjects receiving nicotine exhibited a significantly lower temperature response as well as attenuated cardiovascular responses for 2 · 5 – 6 h after LPS exposure. In addition, increased circulating interkeukin (IL) - 10 and cortisol levels were also noted in nicotine subjects. These data indicate an alteration in LPS-induced systemic inflammatory responses in normal subjects exposed to transcutaneous nicotine. In this model of abbreviated inflammation, nicotine exposure attenuates the febrile response to LPS and promotes a more prominent anti-inflammatory phenotype...|$|R

The objective of our {{study was to determine the}} permeation of ketoprofen, EPA, and DHA (from fish oil) across pig ear skin in vitro in the presence of the enhancer 1, 8 -cineole. Formulations containing 2. 5 % ketoprofen in fish oil with varying concentrations of 1, 8 -cineole were prepared and applied to full-thickness pig ear skin mounted in all glass Franz-type diffusion cells. Simultaneous permeation of ketoprofen and EPA and DHA from these formulations was determined by reverse phase HPLC over a 48 -hr period (n = 6). We found that fish oil alone enhanced the permeation of ketoprofen across pig ear by a factor of 1. 72 relative to a water vehicle. There was a dose-dependent increase in the rate of permeation of ketoprofen relative to the concentration of 1, 8 -cineole. The highest Q 24 and Q 48 was obtained with a 20 % 1, 8 -cineole formulation with values of 355. 78 +/- 50. 73 microg cm(- 2) and 963. 29 +/- 136. 69 microg cm(- 2), respectively. Surprisingly, no clear effect upon the permeation of EPA and DHA by 1, 8 -cineole was observed, with the highest Q 24 and Q 48 values seen in a formulation containing no 1, 8 -cineole. This may have been due to differential solvation effects prior to or during the permeation process or modulation of the skin during the permeation process...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) therapy {{refers to}} the <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of CO(2) for {{therapeutic}} purposes. This effect has been explained {{by an increase in}} the pressure of O(2) in tissues known as the Bohr effect. However, there have been no reports investigating the oxygen dissociation of haemoglobin (Hb) during transcutaneous application of CO(2) in vivo. In this study, we investigate whether the Bohr effect is caused by transcutaneous application of CO 2 in human living body. METHODS: We used a novel system for transcutaneous application of CO(2) using pure CO(2) gas, hydrogel, and a plastic adaptor. The validity of the CO(2) hydrogel was confirmed in vitro using a measuring device for transcutaneous CO(2) absorption using rat skin. Next, we measured the pH change in the human triceps surae muscle during transcutaneous application of CO(2) using phosphorus- 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31) P-MRS) in vivo. In addition, oxy- and deoxy-Hb concentrations were measured with near-infrared spectroscopy in the human arm with occulted blood flow to investigate O 2 dissociation from Hb caused by transcutaneous application of CO(2). RESULTS: The rat skin experiment showed that CO(2) hydrogel enhanced CO(2) gas permeation through the rat skin. The intracellular pH of the triceps surae muscle decreased significantly 10 min. after transcutaneous application of CO(2). The NIRS data show the oxy-Hb concentration decreased significantly 4 min. after CO(2) application, and deoxy-Hb concentration increased significantly 2 min. after CO(2) application in the CO(2) -applied group compared to the control group. Oxy-Hb concentration significantly decreased while deoxy-Hb concentration significantly increased after transcutaneous CO(2) application. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel transcutaneous CO(2) application facilitated an O(2) dissociation from Hb in the human body, thus providing evidence of the Bohr effect in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The skin {{is part of}} the {{epithelial}} {{system of}} the body, which serves as an effective barrier against a potentially hostile environment. As a structural barrier, the skin keeps water and other vital substances in and foreign material out. As an immunological barrier the skin is rich of immunocompetent cells, such as Langerhans cells. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of skin as a non-invasive route for administering antigens. In the case of protein antigens, the skin barrier limits the penetration of high molecular weight molecules, preventing their use for therapeutic purposes. However, co-administration of proteins with cholera toxin (CT) has been shown to enhance protein-specific antibody responses. Also, CT was not toxic when applied onto bare skin. Using non-invasive routes such as the skin for vaccine delivery could be advantageous for vaccination for several reasons. The use of needles is avoided, limiting the risk of infections from blood-borne pathogens. Also, the first-pass metabolism is avoided. Finally, transdermal vaccination does not require trained medical personnel and it is expected to be more economical. Subcutaneous delivery of antigen-loaded PLA- and PLGA-microspheres and nanospheres has been found capable of inducing efficient and long-lasting immune responses. In the present study we investigated the immune responses obtained after <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of a model antigen (ovalbumin, OVA) encapsulated in PLA nanospheres. OVA-loaded PLA nanospheres were applied onto bare skin of Balb/c mice in the presence or the absence of CT and the immune responses obtained were compared to those obtained with free OVA (OVA aqueous solution). Also, we investigated the possible route of entry of the nanospheres in the skin. PLA polymer was synthesized by melt polymerization and was characterized by 1 H-NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). OVA-loaded nanospheres were prepared by a double emulsion technique and characterized for their size by photon correlation spectroscopy and for antigen loading by the bicinchoninic acid assay. The average size of the nanospheres was 150 nm and the loading with antigen was 10 % w/w. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{stimulation}} of peripheral nerve regeneration {{has been studied}} in different ways, {{including the use of}} electrical fields. The capacity of this modality to enhance nerve regeneration is influenced by the parameters used, including current type, frequency, intensity, and means of <b>administration.</b> <b>Transcutaneous</b> electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a frequently used form of administering electrical current to the body, but its effects on peripheral nerve regeneration are not known. This study assessed the influence of TENS on sciatic nerve regeneration, using a model of crush lesion in the mouse. Mice were stimulated 30 min a day, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks with both high- (100 Hz) and low- (4 Hz) frequency TENS. Control animals had the sciatic nerve crushed but were not stimulated. Assessment was performed weekly by functional analysis using the Static Sciatic Index for the mouse {{and at the end of}} the experiment by light and electron microscopy. The results showed that although there were no differences between the groups regarding the Static Sciatic Index values, TENS led to nerves with morphological signs of impaired regeneration. At light microscopy level, TENS nerves presented more axons with dark axoplasm, signs of edema, and a less organized cytoarchitecture. Electronmicrographs showed fewer and thinner thick myelinated fibers and increased number of Schwann cell nuclei. Myelinated axon diameters and density and diameter of nonmyelinated fibers were not affected by TENS, leading to the conclusion that this regimen of electrical stimulation leads to a delayed regeneration after a crush lesion of the sciatic nerve in the mouse. All these effects were more pronounced on high-frequency TENS nerves...|$|R

A poor result often is related to the persistence of adipose tissue irregularity in the form of fatty tissue accumulation. This complication, common to this type of surgery, has called for research to determine methods for its treatment. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) therapy refers to the <b>transcutaneous</b> and subcutaneous <b>administration</b> of CO 2 for therapeutic purposes. This treatment originated at the Royal Spas of France in 1932 with the treatment of patients affected by obliteration of arteriopathies. Recent studies have demonstrated the effect of subcutaneous CO 2 therapy performed to improve local parameters of circulation (performed by Doppler, laser-Doppler, and trans-cutaneous partial pressure of oxygen determination), and to reduce localized adiposities (verified reporting variations in maximum circumference and performing histologic studies). With these results, the absence of toxicity, and the relevant side effects related to this treatment taken into consideration, the Plastic Surgery Unit of Siena has been committed to researching the role that CO 2 therapy can play in the treatment of skin irregularity and as a complement to liposuction. The authors report their experience using Carbomed programmable automatic CO 2 therapy apparatus and 30 GA 1 / 2 0, 3 X 13 microlance needles for the treatment of patients with adipose tissue accumulations located on the thighs and knees. In their study, 42 patients were divided into three groups: A, B, and C. In Group A, only liposuction was performed. In group B 3 weeks after liposuction CO 2 therapy was administered in two weekly subcutaneous applications of CO 2 for 10 consecutive weeks. In group C, CO 2 therapy alone was administered with the same contingencies used for group B (two weekly subcutaneous applications of CO 2 for 10 consecutive weeks). The objective was to assess the effectiveness of CO 2 therapy for skin irregularity and as a complement to liposuction for adipose tissue accumulation by reporting variations in circumference and skin elasticity monitored by the Cutometer SEM 474 in all treated areas.

However, the novel barrier function of stratum corneum hinders the transport of antigen and adjuvant in transcutaneous immunization. Novel nanoscale delivery systems employing, for example, liposomes and nanoparticles, have been widely investigated to overcome the penetration barrier of stratum corneum for effective transcutaneous immunization. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to prepare two types of flexible liposomes and determine their efficacies for the transcutaneous delivery of antigen and the subsequent immune response induced in vivo. Methods: Ovalbumin (OVA) liposome-based transcutaneous vaccines were prepared using reverse-phase evaporation and film-dispersion methods. Particle sizes and antigen encapsulating efficiency were then evaluated. After application to bare mouse skin, topical sites were examined for the presence of fluorescence-labeled liposome. The efficacy of the transcutaneously delivered OVA-loaded flexible liposome in activating the immune responses was investigated by detecting serum immunoglobulin G levels. The influence of an adjuvant, imiquimod, in the transcutaneous immunization was also tested. Results: Two flexible liposomes with well-encapsulated OVA were successfully prepared by film-dispersion or reverse-phase evaporation methods. The sizes of the prepared flexible liposomes ranged from 200 to 400 nm. In vivo, the fluorescence-labeled liposome was detected in hair-follicle ducts, indicating that the flexible liposome can penetrate the skin barrier through the hair follicles. Upon <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>administration,</b> the OVA-encapsulated flexible liposome elicited a strong immune response similar to that of positive control (ie, OVA solution administrated by subcutaneous injection with Al(OH) 3 as an adjuvant). Co-administration of imiquimod with the OVA-loaded liposome expressed a significant enhancement on the transcutaneous immune responses. Conclusion: Results of this study highlight the nanoscale formulation, flexible liposome, as a promising carrier for the transcutaneous delivery of antigen proteins. Imiquimod was shown to be an effective adjuvant as a transcutaneous immunization enhancer with the potential for transcutaneous vaccine development.

40|$|Life {{sciences}} (i. e. fundamental science, translational medicine, pharmaceuticals) {{represent a}} major strategic market in Europe. The industry is highly innovative and dynamic but continues {{to rely on}} the use of laboratory animals to model most human diseases. Russell and Burch first enounced the principles of the 3 Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) in 1959. The 3 Rs summarise the ethical compromises appended to the use of any laboratory animal for medical of scientific advancements and have as such been thoroughly quoted in all contexts relating to the use of animals in research—e. g., in laws, policies, ethical statements, textbooks. The work presented in this thesis is especially concerned with the concept of refinement, defined as “any decrease in the incidence or severity of inhumane procedures applied to those animals which still have to be used”. The control of pain and distress by appropriate use of anaesthetic and analgesic agents represents a major aspect of the refinement of research procedures. This last statement, while simple, does not fully translate into the reality of pain and distress management for laboratory animals. While anaesthesia is near-always used when indicated, chosen anaesthetic agents or inappropriate per-anaesthesia monitoring might indirectly contribute to increasing morbidity, mortality, or inter-individual variations. An inevitable consequence is an increase in the required sample size, contradicting the principle of reduction. Additionally, only a minority of small mammals receives appropriate analgesia after experimental surgical procedures. Pain, or the lack of standard pain relief strategy would further exacerbate unwanted variations between subjects. Perceived technical difficulties, fear of unwanted interactions of anaesthetic and analgesic agents with the primary aims of the procedure, and failure to identify animals in pain are commonly quoted to justify such sub-optimal refinement of scientific procedures. The objectives of the present thesis were to: (1) Describe the impact of non-binding guidelines on peri-anaesthesia practices in laboratory animal care; (2) Document the practicality and efficiency of refined anaesthesia, analgesia and euthanasia techniques routinely performed in laboratory animal procedures; (3) Contribute {{to the development of a}} pain assessment method for laboratory animals. The scientific contributions from this thesis are:  Non-binding guidelines such as the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) guidelines did not succeed in changing peri-anaesthesia practice in rat stroke models.  The vast majority of rats undergoing surgery for cerebral ischemia models are not intubated or mechanically ventilated. Abstract of the thesis 10  Endotracheal intubation of small mammals such as marmosets is straightforward and can be performed with readily available materials (over-the-needle catheter and Silastic tubing); it should be part of standard anaesthetic care.  When concerns surround the use of systemic opioids for analgesia, the intrathecal route could be considered in rodents. <b>Transcutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of morphine (L 6 -S 1) is easily performed (82 % success at 1 st attempt) in anaesthetised rats using cheap and readily-available material (hypodermic 25 G needle and syringe), and provides analgesia for up to 8 h (acute surgical pain).  Adding N 2 O to a rising concentration of CO 2 (60 % and 20 % of the chamber volume per minute) shortens the time to loss of consciousness by 10 % in mice being euthanised, without any behavioural sign of distress. Nitrous oxide may therefore reduce the duration of any stress or distress to which mice are exposed during euthanasia.  Rabbits experience pain during the tattooing process. Variation of facial expressions can be used as a means to identify acute pain in rabbits using a Rabbit Grimace Scale. The refinement of peri-anaesthesia techniques is both possible and effective (Studies II-VI), and their impact on the welfare and quality of life of laboratory animals is discussed. Given that attempts to improve animal welfare by merely adopting legislation and guidelines (Study I), and hoping for their implementation at a scientific level have only returned disappointing results, other approaches are further discussed as perpective for future refinement of laboratory animal use...|$|E
