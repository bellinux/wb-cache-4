500|$|The {{theme of}} a young woman hiding in a lodge room had become a {{standard}} formula for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>report,</b> which was uncritically echoed and embellished as it spread from newspaper to newspaper. Anderson herself denied that it was possible for a woman to be made a mason, but remained non-committal or downright enigmatic when questioned as to the origin of her extensive knowledge of Freemasonry. Born in Alsace in 1818, she was raised in Paris after her parents died by her uncle, a [...] "prominent mason". She met and married Captain Andrew Anderson in the 1840s, and settled in New Orleans, accompanying her husband on his coastal voyages in their own vessel, and managing their finances. They moved to Oakland, California in 1854, where Andrew became a respected businessman and an active mason. He died in 1867, leaving Salome a wealthy widow, who turned her fortune to helping masonic charities. She became the founding treasurer of Oak Leaf Chapter No 8 of the Order of the Eastern Star, and when a Masonic Temple was built, she became the largest stock-holder. In spite of opposition, she was elected to the board of trustees. In 1892, the Trestle Board published a biography of her as a prominent citizen and implied that she had acquired some degree of masonic knowledge from the masons meeting at the house of her uncle. The San Francisco News-Letter and Advertiser then embellished the story by saying that she [...] "claimed to be a mason", having cajoled the younger members of her uncle's lodge into clandestinely conferring the three Blue Lodge degrees on her. This story was rapidly picked up by the West Coast press, and various versions of the story were passed around. While she strenuously denied that she had come by her knowledge in an improper way, in subsequent interviews she refused to be drawn on the source of her masonic knowledge. It not known if she was ever initiated.|$|E

5000|$|An {{opinion is}} said to be unqualified, or unmodified, when the Auditor concludes that the Financial Statements give a true and fair view in {{accordance}} with the financial reporting framework used for the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements. An Auditor gives a Clean opinion or Unqualified Opinion when he or she does not have any significant reservation in respect of matters contained in the Financial Statements. The most frequent <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>report</b> {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Unqualified Opinion", and is regarded by many as the equivalent of a [...] "clean bill of health" [...] to a patient, which has led many to call it the [...] "Clean Opinion", but in reality it is not a clean bill of health, because the Auditor can only provide reasonable assurance regarding the Financial Statements, not the health of the company itself, or the integrity of company records not part of the foundation of the Financial Statements. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>report</b> is issued by an auditor when the financial statements are free of material misstatements and are presented fairly in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which in other words means that the company's financial condition, position, and operations are fairly presented in the financial statements.

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that respondents experiencing equal-status contact across ethnic lines {{are more likely}} to hold tolerant attitudes toward minorities than those not having been exposed to such interaction. This paper extends the research on this proposition in three ways. We examine: (1) responses <b>of</b> blacks <b>reporting</b> equal-status contact with Jews; (2) effects of equal-status contact compared with other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> associations with Jews such as perceived economic mistreatment; and (3) possible trends in the shifting effects <b>of</b> both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> contact over time. The findings indicate strong support for the contact hypothesis, particularly when equal-status contact is intimate and occurs in a noninstitutional setting. On the other hand, they show that perceived economic mistreatment is strongly related to heightened antipathy toward Jews. When the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> contacts are compared for their predictive effects, the economic variable exerts by far the greater influence of the two. Last, we examine trends in the changing effects <b>of</b> these two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> contact on anti-Semitism. We observed two patterns. First, the younger generation of blacks exhibits a weaker inverse relationship between intimate, equal-status contact and anti-Semitism tha...|$|R

Sometimes a recommendation can be given to do nothing, if all options currently possible would prove unbeneficial. The recommendation report answers the question [...] "Which option should we choose?" [...] (or [...] "Which are the best options?") by allowing a recommendation to be made.
