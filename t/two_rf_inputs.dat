40|$|A {{low noise}} RF signal phase {{comparator}} comprised of two high stability driver buffer amplifiers driving a double balanced mixer which operate {{to generate a}} beat frequency between the two RF input signals coupled to the amplifiers from the RF sources is described. The beat frequency output from the mixer is applied to a low noise zero crossing detector which is the phase difference between the <b>two</b> <b>RF</b> <b>inputs.</b> Temperature stability is provided by mounting the amplifiers and mixer on a common circuit board with the active circuit elements located {{on one side of}} a circuit board and the passive circuit elements located on the opposite side. A common heat sink is located adjacent the circuit board. The active circuit elements are embedded into the bores of the heat sink which slows the effect of ambient temperature changes and reduces the temperature gradients between the active circuit elements, thus improving the cancellation of temperature effects. The two amplifiers include individual voltage regulators, which increases RF isolation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The ICRF {{system at}} ASDEX Upgrade {{has proved to}} be very {{flexible}} in use, from high power heating down to moderate or low power levels needed for vessel conditioning. As a consequence of these wide varieties of applications the present capabilities of the data acquisition system became a limiting factor, as the CAMAC system could only record up to about 500 ksamples per channel with 12 bit resolution. The upgrade to the SIO (serial I/O data acquisition) system allows a constant sampling time of 5 µs during the whole plasma discharge with an increased resolution of 16 bit. The SIO system was already used in the last campaign of ASDEX Upgrade with 96 channels and will be further expanded. At low power ICRF experiments the output voltage of the linear rf-detectors was rather low, which led to large measurement errors. As a consequence of this the linear detectors were replaced by logarithmic detectors, expanding the dynamic range from 30 db to 60 dB. Each of the new rf-detectors has <b>two</b> <b>rf</b> <b>inputs</b> and allows to measure the phase difference between the inputs...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} many efforts to improve {{efficiency}} of transmitter while meeting stringent linearity requirement of modern communication system. Among the technology to enhance efficiency of linear transmitter, the out-phasing technology, also called the linear amplification with nonlinear components (LINC), is considered as promising technology. LINC has been studied long time, since it provides excellent linearity with high efficiency by allowing adopt higg efficient switch-mode power amplifiers. In this paper, various state-of-art techniques for multi-level digital LINC transmitters are presented. For their all-digital implementation, flexible digital phase modulators (DPMs) are used to realize <b>two</b> <b>RF</b> phase <b>input</b> signals in LINC systems. An unbalanced phase calibration technique compensates amplitude/phase mismatches between two parallel paths in the LINC system, and an uneven multi-level LINC structure improves the overall power efficiency. The performance of multi-level LINC technology was experimentally verified for WiMAX signals. clos...|$|R
40|$|A logarithmic-ratio beam {{position}} monitor (BPM) circuit {{has been}} designed that operates directly from radio frequency signals in the 100 ~MHz to 500 -MHz frequency range. The circuit uses four logarithmic amplifiers, a pair for each channel. One amplifier per channel receives its signal input directly from a BPM electrode, while the second amplifier receives the same signal attenuated by 7 -dB. The two outputs of each channel are summed together and the composite video outputs are applied to a differencing amplifier. The net result is the logarithmic-ratio position measurement derived from the <b>two</b> <b>input</b> <b>rf</b> signals. Paralleling the pairs of outputs from the amplifiers provides measurement accuracy that is comparable to other circuit techniques used for position measurement. I...|$|R
40|$|The RIA RF {{high power}} coupler window was {{designed}} by AMAC to meet the specification requirements for the RIA accelerator project, {{and is based on}} AMAC’s SNS RF coupler window design. MSU provided the RF specification, and performed the calculations to match the coupler to the SRF cavity. CPI performed the manufacturing optimization, and fabricated two prototype couplers. The prototypes have been high RF power tested by the Jefferson Lab and met or exceeded the requirements of the RIA technical specifications. The RF tests and conditioning are described in a separate presentation in this workshop. AMAC was awarded a contract to provide <b>two</b> prototype RIA <b>RF</b> <b>input</b> power coupler windows in a very short period, and for this reason it was decided to base the design on the proven SNS AMAC- 1 coupler [1]. The main changes were the modification of the antenna and the removal of the water cooling feature. The water is not required due to the lower required RF power level of 10 kW CW. Two window couplers were delivered; high RF power tested, and qualified to meet the RIA technical requirements.

40|$|A 2. 4 GHz {{rectifier}} {{operating in}} a region of low <b>RF</b> <b>input</b> power was developed. The rectifier has a cross-coupled bridge configuration and is driven by a differential <b>RF</b> <b>input</b> signal. Since a rectifier needs an RF signal higher than the threshold voltage of transistors, we introduced a pre-biasing circuit {{to compensate for the}} threshold voltage. A low-voltage digital circuit, subthreshold voltage regulator, and low-power level shifter were introduced for reducing the power consumption of the pre-biasing circuit and increasing the driving voltage for the switches at the same time. The circuit simulations revealed that the pre-biasing circuit was effective in a low <b>RF</b> <b>input</b> power region. However, the output voltage was degraded in a high power region. Then, we combined the pre-biased rectifier in parallel with a non-biased rectifier. Three types of rectifiers consisting of LC matching circuits, three-stage rectifier cells, and biasing circuits were designed and fabricated using a 0. 18 -mu m mixed signal/RF CMOS process with one poly and six metal layers. The fabricated pre-biased rectifier operated in a region of <b>RF</b> <b>input</b> power of less than - 15 dBm, while the non-biased rectifier could not operate in this region.

40|$|Information {{processing}} within neural systems often {{depends upon}} selective amplification of relevant signals and suppression of irrelevant signals. This {{has been shown}} many times by studies of contextual effects but there is as yet no consensus on how to interpret such studies. Some researchers interpret the effects of context as contributing to the selective receptive field (<b>RF)</b> <b>input</b> about which neurons transmit information. Others interpret context effects as affecting transmission of information about <b>RF</b> <b>input</b> without {{becoming part of the}} RF information transmitted. Here we use partial information decomposition (PID) and entropic information decomposition (EID) to study the properties of a form of modulation previously used in neurobiologically plausible neural nets. PID shows that this form of modulation can affect transmission of information in the <b>RF</b> <b>input</b> without the binary output transmitting any information unique to the modulator. EID produces similar decompositions, except that information unique to the modulator and the mechanistic shared component can be negative when modulating and modulated signals are correlated. Synergistic and source shared components were never negative in the conditions studied. Thus, both PID and EID show that modulatory inputs to a local processor can affect the transmission of information from other inputs. Contrary to what was previously assumed, this transmission can occur without the modulatory inputs becoming part of the information transmitted, as shown by the use of PID with the model we consider. Decompositions of psychophysical data from a visual contrast detection task with surrounding context suggest that a similar form of modulation may also occur in real neural systems...|$|R
