25|$|In {{computer}} science, tabulation hashing is {{a method}} for constructing universal families of hash functions by combining table lookup with exclusive or operations. It was first studied {{in the form of}} Zobrist hashing for computer games; later work by Carter and Wegman extended this method to arbitrary fixed-length keys. Generalizations of tabulation hashing have also been developed <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> variable-length keys such as text strings.|$|E
25|$|Some software, such as text editors, will {{refuse to}} {{correctly}} display or interpret UTF-8 unless the text {{starts with a}} byte order mark, and will insert such a mark. This {{has the effect of}} making it impossible to use UTF-8 with any older software <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> ASCII-like encodings but cannot handle the byte order mark. This, however, is no problem of UTF-8 itself but one of bad software implementations.|$|E
25|$|An FAA-certified airport <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> small {{aircraft}} {{was built by}} the Puerto Rican government. This airport has no ICAO or IATA code. The United States Coast Guard is able to provide transportation with helicopter flights from Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla, to help with medicines and first aid equipment; they also fly whenever an emergency requiring hospitalization occurs. Private and commercial planes require a special permit issued by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources to use the airport's facilities.|$|E

IBM Roadrunner uses the PowerXCell 8i version of the Cell processor, manufactured using 65nm technology and enhanced SPUs <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> double precision calculations in the 128-bit registers, reaching double precision 102GFLOPs per chip.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} has {{gates and}} a nearby runway <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> the Airbus A380. This capability was proven when Singapore Airlines briefly offered A380 flights to Beijing in August 2008 during the Summer Olympics. Emirates Airline has started its scheduled daily operation to Dubai as of 1 August 2010. Lufthansa {{has been using}} these facilities since October 2010 to handle up to five A380 flights per week. Several other airlines {{in the near future}} will operate the A380 out of this terminal, including Malaysia Airlines and British Airways.|$|E
25|$|Any {{computer}} programming language or software package {{that is used}} to compute D mod 97 directly must have the ability to handle integers of more than 30 digits.

If the application software in use does not provide the ability to handle integers of this size, the modulo operation can be performed in a piece-wise manner (as is the case with the UN CEFACT TBG5 Javascript program).|$|E

25|$|One {{must not}} mistake the Mozartian {{dramatic}} coloratura soprano with the Italian dramatic coloratura soprano. A singer that sings Konstanze, Donna Anna or Fiordiligi can not necessarily sing the Italian dramatic coloratura parts, due to other vocal demands. Imogene, Leonora and Violetta require a dramatic soprano voice and {{are most often}} sung by dramatic sopranos with an agile voice that can easily produce coloratura and high notes. Roles like Norma, Lady Macbeth, Odabella or Abigaille are good examples of Italian roles that are not necessarily a coloratura soprano (even though the score calls for coloratura singing), but a full bodied dramatic soprano with a voice <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> extreme dramatic singing and that is flexible enough to sing coloratura. Giuseppe Verdi wrote many parts like this in his early years.|$|E
25|$|Commissioned in 2001 and {{operating}} on a landlord port concept, it is outsourcing all services required for operation and maintenance, and new terminals are being developed with {{the participation of the}} private sector. During the year of 2010–11, it handled a total cargo of 11.01 million tons. The port has effectively taken over all the ore movement from the Chennai Port. By 2016, the port is expected to have the capacity to handle over 80 million tons of cargo and its coal-handling capacity is expected to be about 43 million tons. The port is equipped to handle 16 million tonnes of coal per year from its two dedicated coal berths with 15m alongside depth and manned by TNEB, while its third berth promoted by Chettinad International Coal Terminal, is a common user facility <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> 8 million tonnes per annum.|$|E
25|$|In the Summer of 2009, a £50million {{redevelopment}} programme for Terminal 1 was completed, {{which included}} a new £14million 14-lane security area. Passenger flow on Terminal 1's gating piers is due to be realigned, with plans to redesign the piers so departures and arrivals do not contraflow on the same level, allowing larger seating areas at the gates, express retail outlets and a dedicated lounge and gating area for future Airbus A380 flights. Currently, Gate 12, Pier B has been upgraded to accommodate the A380, the only gate at the airport <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> this aircraft so far.
