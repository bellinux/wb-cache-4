5|$|Moreau {{preferred}} to retreat through the Black Forest via the Kinzig River valley, but Nauendorf blocked that route. Instead, Saint-Cyr's column led <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> the Höllenthal, {{breaking through the}} Austrian net at Neustadt and reaching Freiburg im Breisgau on 12 October. Moreau's supply trains took a route down the Wiese River to Hüningen. The French general wanted to reach Kehl farther down the Rhine, but by this time Charles barred the way with 35,000 soldiers. In order for his trains to get away, Moreau needed to hold his position for a few days. The Battle of Emmendingen was fought on 19 October, the 32,000 French losing 1,000 killed and wounded plus 1,800 men and two guns captured. The Austrians sustained 1,000 casualties out of 28,000 troops engaged. Beaupuy and Wartensleben were both killed. There was some fighting on the 20th, but when Charles advanced on 21 October the French were gone.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Coodie and Chike and it premiered in November 2003. Kanye West, who financed the video, conceived ideas for the clip after seeing an Adidas advertisement in BlackBook magazine. He stated, [...] "I don't like gettin' ideas from direct shit ... I like to pull ideas from all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> here. Sometimes my vision can't be explained in words, 'cause I couldn't have even told you in words how I envisioned that video ending up." [...] Chike recalled {{the making of the}} clip, saying, [...] "one day Coodie calls me out the blue about a concept he and Kanye had for a video revolving around Polaroid snapshots. I was leaving work at 7 PM only to come back at 10 PM, work all night then go home at 7 AM". Coodie stated that [...] "If we would have wrote a treatment" [...] for the video, [...] "they would have shot that down. They had to see it to understand. Otherwise they'd have said, 'No, Kanye should be rapping at a party, with lots of girls poolside'". It was awarded the Video of the Year at the 2004 Source Hip Hop Awards.|$|E

2500|$|The Balaton son Kubinec, {{out of the}} *Muscat {{daughter}} Kosmetika, was foaled at Tersk in 1987. A chestnut with a wide blaze {{going all}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>over</b> his nose and lips, Kubinec’s white markings weren't considered acceptable in the Tersk breeding program. According to Dr. O.A. Balakshin of the All Russian Research Institute of Horse Breeding, “Too many horses now have white markings on their head and legs. This is undesirable and should be eliminated by selection.”. Kubinec was sold in 1991 and began making his mark in European show rings. He was named German National, European, and World Champion Stallion as well as European Conference of Arab Horse Organizations (ECAHO) [...] "Five Star Stallion" [...] and his offspring are desirable around the world today.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{return to}} Australia Walker {{continued}} his musical career living near Wollongong. His album, Abstract Poverty, {{was released in}} 1997 on <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Over</b> There label. Hans Uhad of Stylus Magazine felt it showed a [...] "juxtaposition of slow burning, moody, Codeine-like numbers with deft, mildly psychotic stabs at fusing traditional Celtic music with his own burnt version of Americana and flamenco". One of the tracks, [...] "Jezebel", was a re-recorded version of his earlier work as Shed Method. For touring Walker expanded the band with Guy Freer on accordion and keyboards; Marianthe Loucataris on drums; and Jonathan Nix on bass and samples. Machine Translations' second album, Halo, appeared {{in the following year}} on Way Over There and was distributed by Shock Records. White provided clarinet for the album.|$|E

2500|$|In 1974, he {{sold out}} the Pavilion Theatre {{in his home}} town. In 1975, the rapidity and extent of Connolly's {{breakthrough}} was used to secure him a booking on Britain's premier TV chat show, the BBC's Parkinson. Connolly {{made the most of}} the opportunity and, ignoring objections from his manager, told a bawdy joke about a man who had murdered his wife and buried her bottom-up so he'd have somewhere to park his bike. This ribald humour was unusually forthright on a primetime Saturday night on British television in the mid-1970s, and his appearance made a great impact. He became a good friend of the host, Michael Parkinson, and now holds the record for appearances on the programme, having been a guest on fifteen occasions. Referring to that debut appearance, he later said: [...] "That programme changed my entire life." [...] Parkinson, in the documentary Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years, stated that people still remember Connolly telling the punchline to the 'bike joke' three decades after that TV appearance. When asked about the material, Connolly stated, [...] "Yes, it was incredibly edgy for its time. My manager, on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>over,</b> warned me not to do it, but it was a great joke and the interview was going so well, I thought, 'Oh, fuck that!!' I don't know where I got the courage in those days, but Michael did put confidence in me." [...] Connolly's UK success spread to other English-speaking countries: Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. [...] However, his broad Scottish accent and British cultural references made success in the US improbable.|$|E
