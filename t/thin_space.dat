50|$|Often, {{large numbers}} are written with (preferably non-breaking) half-spaces or <b>thin</b> <b>spaces</b> {{separating}} the thousands (and, sometimes, with normal spaces or apostrophes) instead of commas - {{to ensure that}} confusion is not caused in countries where a decimal comma is used. Thus, a million is often written 1 000 000.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954, Late Jogesh Chandra Biswas first {{modified}} the then-existing Harmoniums, so it folds {{down into a}} much <b>thinner</b> <b>space</b> for easier-maneuverability.

This improvisation became a generic design in most harmoniums since then and coined with the term [...] "Folding Harmoniums".|$|R

50|$|Apochromatic designs require {{optical glasses}} with special {{dispersive}} properties to achieve three color crossings. This is usually achieved using costly fluoro-crown glasses, abnormal flint glasses, and even optically transparent liquids with highly unusual dispersive {{properties in the}} <b>thin</b> <b>spaces</b> between glass elements. The temperature dependence of glass and liquid index of refraction and dispersion must be accounted for during apochromat design to assure good optical performance over reasonable temperature ranges with only slight re-focusing. In some cases, apochromatic designs without anomalous dispersion glasses are possible.|$|R

25|$|Before Word 2010 (Word 14) for Windows, {{the program}} was unable to {{correctly}} handle ligatures defined in TrueType fonts. Those ligature glyphs with Unicode codepoints may be inserted manually, but are not recognized by Word for what they are, breaking spell checking, while custom ligatures present in the font are not accessible at all. Since Word 2010, the program now has advanced typesetting features which can be enabled: OpenType ligatures, kerning, and hyphenation. Other layout deficiencies of Word include the inability to set crop marks or <b>thin</b> <b>spaces.</b> Various third-party workaround utilities have been developed.|$|R
5000|$|In Ada, C# (from version 7.0), D, Eiffel, Java (from version 7), Julia, Perl, Python (from version 3.6), Ruby, and Swift, integer literals {{and float}} literals can be {{separated}} with an underscore (...) [...] There can be some restrictions on placement; for example, in Java they cannot {{appear at the}} start or end of the literal, nor next to a decimal point. Note that while the period, comma, and (<b>thin)</b> <b>spaces</b> are used in normal writing for digit separation, these conflict with their existing use in programming languages as radix point, list separator (and in C/C++, the comma operator), and token separator.|$|R

5000|$|Em dashes used as parenthetical dividers, and en dashes {{when used}} as word joiners, are usually set {{continuous}} with the text.

The hair space {{can be written}} in HTML by using the numeric character references [...] or , or the named entity , but is not universally supported in browsers yet, [...] The <b>thin</b> <b>space</b> is named entity [...] and numeric references [...] or [...] These spaces are much thinner than a normal space (except in a monospaced (non-proportional) font), with the hair space being the thinner of the two.|$|E
50|$|In print, a <b>thin</b> <b>space</b> is {{traditionally}} placed before a colon {{and a thick}} space after it. In modern English-language printing, no space is placed before a colon and a single space is placed after it. In French-language typing and printing, the traditional rules are preserved.|$|E
50|$|The {{reference}} to a footnote may be given by an asterisk of the fount body, if {{there are only a}} few footnotes in the book, and not more than one per page. But if there are two or more footnotes per page, use superior fraction figures preceded by a <b>thin</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
60|$|By {{means of}} <b>thin</b> <b>spaces</b> between the braids of matting, {{the place was}} open to the air, but not to view.

In front, a deep-dyed rug of osiers, covering the entrance way, was intricately laced to the standing part of the tent. As I divided this lacing with my cutlass, there arose an outburst of voices from the Islanders. And they covered their faces, as the interior was revealed to my gaze.|$|R
50|$|Sentence spacing {{in digital}} media is the {{horizontal}} space between sentences in computer and web-based media. Digital media allow sentence spacing variations not {{possible with the}} typewriter. Most digital fonts {{permit the use of}} a variable space or a no-break space. Some modern font specifications, such as OpenType, have the ability to automatically add or reduce space after punctuation, and users may be able to choose sentence spacing variations. Modern fonts that allow spacing variations will allow the average user the ability to easily manipulate the following spaces: non-breaking short <b>spaces</b> (<b>thin</b> <b>spaces),</b> non-breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), and breaking long spaces (em spaces).|$|R
5000|$|Flatman has {{the ability}} to stretch any part of his body to great lengths (although not nearly as long or complex as Mister Fantastic). He can {{withstand}} all forms of physical injury at a superhuman level, appear to be nearly invisible by standing at just the right angle and slip through very <b>thin</b> <b>spaces,</b> thanks to his nearly two-dimensional body. He can also turn his entire body into any shape, including animals such as frogs or monkeys, in the style of origami. Initially, he never appeared to be able to assume a [...] "normal" [...] three-dimensional shape. However, in the ongoing series The Great Lakes Avengers, he reveals that he can assume that shape at will. He is also an excellent hand-to-hand combatant.|$|R
