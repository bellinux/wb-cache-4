6000|$|One {{sees the}} {{sanctuary}} where the great Caliph said his prayers, and the Koran written by Othman and stained with his blood was kept; but I know {{at least one}} traveler who saw it without sentiment or any sort of reverent emotion, though he had not {{the authority of the}} [...] "old rancid Christianity" [...] of a Castilian for withholding his homage. If people would be as sincere as other people would like them to be, I think no one would profess regret for the Arab civilization in the presence of its monuments. Those Moors were of a religion which revolts all the finer instincts and lifts the soul with no generous hopes; and the records of it have no appeal save to the love of mere beautiful decoration. Even here it mostly fails, to my thinking, and I say that for my part I found nothing so grand in the great mosaue of Cordova as the cathedral which rises in the heart of it. If Abderrahman boasted that he would rear a shrine to the joy of earthly life and the hope of an earthly heaven, in the place of the Christian temple which he would throw down, I should like to overhear what his disembodied spirit would have to say to the saint whose shrine he demolished. I think the saint would have the better of him in any contention for their respective faiths, and could easily convince the impartial witness that his religion then abiding in medieval gloom was of promise for the future which Islam can never be. Yet it cannot be denied that when Abderraham built his mosque the Arabs of Cordova were a finer and wiser people than the Christians who dwelt in intellectual darkness among them, with an ideal of gloom and self-denial and a zeal for aimless martyrdom which must have been very hard for a gentleman and scholar to bear. Gentlemen and scholars were what the Arabs of the Western Caliphate seem to have become, with a primacy in medicine and mathematics beyond the learning of all other Europe in their day. They were tolerant skeptics in matters of religion; polite agnostics, who disliked extremely the passion of some Christians dwelling among them for getting themselves put to death, as they did, for insulting the popularly accepted Mohammedan creed. Probably people of culture in Cordova were quite of Abderrahman's mind in wishing to substitute the temple of a cheerfuler ideal for the shrine of the medieval Christianity which he destroyed; though they might have had their reserves as to the taste in which his mosque was completed. If they recognized it as a concession to <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>preference,</b> they could do so without the discomfort which they must have suffered when some new horde of Berbers, full of faith and fight, came over from Africa to push back the encroaching Spanish frontier, and give the local Christians as much martyrdom as they wanted.|$|E
6000|$|Certainly the {{religious}} and moral ideas of the Dodsons and Tullivers were of too specific a kind to be arrived at deductively, from the statement that {{they were part of}} the Protestant population of Great Britain. Their theory of life had its core of soundness, as all theories must have on which decent and prosperous families have been reared and have flourished; but it had the very slightest tincture of theology. If, in the maiden days of the Dodson sisters, their Bibles opened more easily at some parts than others, it was because of dried tulip-petals, which had been distributed quite impartially, without preference for the historical, devotional, or doctrinal. Their religion was of a simple, semi-pagan kind, but there was no heresy in it,--if heresy properly means choice,--for they didn't know there was any other religion, except that of chapel-goers, which appeared to run in families, like asthma. How should they know? The vicar of their pleasant rural parish was not a controversialist, but a good hand at whist, and one who had a joke always ready for a blooming female parishioner. The religion of the Dodsons consisted in revering whatever was customary and respectable; it was necessary to be baptized, else one could not be buried in the church-yard, and to take the sacrament before death, as a security against more dimly understood perils; but it was of equal necessity to have the proper pall-bearers and well-cured hams at one's funeral, and to leave an unimpeachable will. A Dodson would not be taxed with the omission of anything that was becoming, or that belonged to that eternal fitness of things which was plainly indicated in the practice of the most substantial parishioners, and in the family traditions,--such as obedience to parents, faithfulness to kindred, industry, rigid honesty, thrift, the thorough scouring of wooden and copper utensils, the hoarding of coins likely to disappear from the currency, the production of first-rate commodities for the market, and <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>preference</b> of whatever was home-made. The Dodsons were a very proud race, and their pride lay in the utter frustration of all desire to tax them with a breach of traditional duty or propriety. A wholesome pride in many respects, since it identified honor with perfect integrity, thoroughness of work, and faithfulness to admitted rules; and society owes some worthy qualities in many of her members to mothers of the Dodson class, who made their butter and their fromenty well, and would have felt disgraced to make it otherwise. To be honest and poor was never a Dodson motto, still less to seem rich though being poor; rather, the family badge was to be honest and rich, and not only rich, but richer than was supposed. To live respected, and have the proper bearers at your funeral, was an achievement of the ends of existence that would be entirely nullified if, on the reading of your will, you sank in the opinion of your fellow-men, either by turning out to be poorer than they expected, or by leaving your money in a capricious manner, without strict regard to degrees of kin. The right thing must always be done toward kindred. The right thing was to correct them severely, if they were other than a credit to the family, but still not to alienate from them the smallest rightful share in the family shoebuckles and other property. A conspicuous quality in the Dodson character was its genuineness; its vices and virtues alike were phases of a proud honest egoism, which had a hearty dislike to whatever made against its own credit and interest, and would be frankly hard of speech to inconvenient [...] "kin," [...] but would never forsake or ignore them,--would not let them want bread, but only require them to eat it with bitter herbs.|$|E

40|$|Information {{about the}} binding {{preferences}} of many transcription factors is known and {{characterized by a}} sequence binding motif. However, determining regions of the genome in which a transcription factor binds based on its motif is a challenging problem, particularly in species with large genomes, since there are often many sequences containing matches to the motif but are not bound. Several rules based on sequence conservation or location, relative to a tran-scription start site, have been proposed to help differentiate true binding sites from random ones. Other evidence sources may also be informative for this task. We developed a method for integrating multiple evidence sources using logistic regression classifiers. Our method works in two steps. First, we infer a score quantifying <b>the</b> <b>general</b> binding <b>preferences</b> of transcription factor binding at all locations based on a large set of evidence features, without using any motif specific information. Then, we combined this <b>general</b> binding <b>preference</b> score with motif information for specific transcription factors to improve prediction of regions bound by the factor. Using cross-validation and new experimental data we show that, surprisingly, <b>the</b> <b>general</b> binding <b>preference</b> can be highly predictive of true locations of transcription factor binding even when no binding motif is used. When combined with motif information our method outperforms previous methods for predicting locations of true binding. [Supplemental material is available online a...|$|R

30|$|When {{the main}} dataset was {{analyzed}} {{with regard to}} the effect of the building ratio, neither <b>general</b> landscape <b>preferences</b> nor <b>the</b> perceived prospect–refuge attributes were found to be affected by the building ratio. On the other hand, a significant correlation was observed between perceived pleasantness of/disturbance from <b>the</b> buildings and <b>general</b> landscape <b>preferences,</b> which indicated that <b>the</b> <b>general</b> landscape <b>preferences</b> (like–dislike) of the participants who assessed the buildings as disturbing were lower compared to <b>the</b> <b>general</b> landscape <b>preferences</b> of <b>the</b> participants who found the buildings pleasant. This situation suggests that the subjective characteristics of observers may have a greater influence on their perception of the background building views. Moreover, it can be concluded that perceived pleasantness of/disturbance from the buildings is independent of the objective attributes of the scene and related to the personal characteristics and experiences of the observer. This hypothesis leads us to some new research questions, such as what are the subjective qualities of the observer; who finds the background buildings disturbing or pleasant; what are some alternative attitudes of the observer on background buildings; and what should be done to satisfy the observers who find the background buildings disturbing? These questions were tried to be investigated partially in another study which was {{the second phase of the}} survey (Senoglu et al. 2018). In their study, Senoglu et al.

For example, the second figure from the left is {{a man wearing a}} plaited belt; he may represent Fortitudo (bravery).The uppermost register, in which Christ appears flanked by the twelve apostles, is most likely a representation of the Last Judgment. It remains only to describe the jambs, which are decorated with a striking array of ornament, and at top and bottom with a variety of kneeling figures.
