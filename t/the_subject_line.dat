This version adds Norton Spam Alert to reduce [...] Spam filtering scans the whole message and its context, rather than looking for keywords to ensure accuracy. A POP3 client must be used. When a message is identified as spam, Norton inserts an identifier, by default it is [...] "Spam Alert:", in <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>line.</b> Using the mail client, users can create a rule to delete or move flagged messages. Users can also create strings of text for Spam Alert to look for when classifying e-mail. In PC Magazine testing, Spam Alert mistakenly classified 2.8 percent of legitimate e-mail as spam. 47 percent of spam slipped past the filter. Although false positive rate was low, the feature did not fare well at finding actual spam.|$|E

Those emails with relationships related terms in their <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> exhibited a 6. 2 % higher open rate than those not containing those types of terms.

To accomplish its purpose, the study reviewed the positions of 13 semiotic theorists and applied certain of their theories in an analysis of the open rates of these commercial emails...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — For a human-robot {{interface}} it {{is important}} to have a good model of how <b>the</b> human <b>subject</b> operates. However, since such a model is difficult to obtain, then the robotics interface must observe accurately <b>the</b> <b>subject’s</b> behaviour when interacting with him. We present here a new human-robot interface for active interaction with the cognitive and emotional human domains. Since eye movements convey a lot of information about one subject’s cognitive and emotive status, we have designed a new human-robot interface which uses a video-based Eye-Tracker (ET) to observe <b>the</b> <b>subject’s</b> <b>line</b> of gaze. Since we are also interested in using our interface for studying and treating depression, our interface can send stimulating inputs to <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> using both a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator (TMS) and a visual stimulus. The latter elicits <b>the</b> <b>subject’s</b> emotions and consists of a set of pictures of facial expressions, which have been shown according to a novel visualization protocol, called Memory-Guided Filtering (MGF). Its effectiveness has been verified by means of many experimental results. We also present the application of our human-robot interface for preliminary studies concerning new cognitive rehabilitation strategies in depression. I...|$|R
