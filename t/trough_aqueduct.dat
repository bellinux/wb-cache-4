50|$|The use of {{cast iron}} for {{structural}} purposes {{began in the late}} 1770s, when Abraham Darby III built the Iron Bridge, although short beams had already been used, such as in the blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale. Other inventions followed, including one patented by Thomas Paine. Cast-iron bridges became commonplace as the Industrial Revolution gathered pace. Thomas Telford adopted the material for his bridge upstream at Buildwas, and then for a canal <b>trough</b> <b>aqueduct</b> at Longdon-on-Tern on the Shrewsbury Canal.|$|E
50|$|The {{aqueduct}} {{was built}} by Thomas Telford and William Jessop near the 18th-century road crossing, Pont Cysylltau. After the westerly high-ground route was approved, the original plan {{was to create a}} series of locks down both sides of the valley to an embankment that would carry the Ellesmere Canal over the River Dee. However, after Telford was hired the plan was changed to an aqueduct that would create an uninterrupted waterway straight across the valley. Despite considerable public scepticism, Telford was confident his construction method would work because he had previously built a cast-iron <b>trough</b> <b>aqueduct</b> - the Longdon-on-Tern aqueduct on the Shrewsbury Canal.|$|E
50|$|As a {{temporary}} measure the lock system originally installed was brought back into use, and Benjamin Bevan, an engineer {{employed by the}} canal company, designed a replacement structure. By this time, cast iron <b>trough</b> <b>aqueducts</b> designed by Thomas Telford for the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and elsewhere, had become proven, and Bevan adopted the system for his structure. However, the canal was then operating as a wide canal in contradistinction to some northern narrowboat canals, so that the troughs had to be substantially larger and stronger than elsewhere.The cast iron units were cast at the Ketley foundry at Coalbrookdale; the company had already been involved with Telford on the Longdon-on-Tern aqueduct. They were transported to Cosgrove by the canal itself, and assembled and erected at site. The new structure was completed in January 1811.|$|R
5000|$|Cosgrove {{aqueduct}} is a navigable {{cast iron}} <b>trough</b> navigable <b>aqueduct</b> {{that carries the}} Grand Union Canal over the River Great Ouse, on the borders between Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire at the northwest margin of Milton Keynes in England. The present structure was built in 1811, to replace a previous brick structure that had failed. When the present structure was erected, it {{was known as the}} [...] "Iron Trunk".The structure has two cast iron trough spans, with a single central masonry pier. The abutments were constructed in masonry but have been refaced in brick during the twentieth century. The trough is 15 ft wide, 6 ft deep, with a total length of 101 ft. The canal surface is about 40 ft above the surface of the river. There are large approach earthworks about 36 ft high above the valley floor and 150 ft wide, with a total length of half a mile (800m).|$|R
50|$|Near the Vyrnwy Aquedect arches {{were built}} in the {{embankment}} of the canal, to provide protection from flooding of the River Vyrnwy. The aqueduct itself has been repaired and strengthened in the 1820s, 1890s and 1970s. It sometimes can be seen to leak into the River Vyrnwy, though the leaks self-heal. Unlike the nearby Chirk Aqueduct and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, which have a cast iron <b>trough,</b> the Vyrnwy <b>Aqueduct</b> is built of stone and is puddled. The weight of this structure led to it being strengthened with tie bars and girders in the 1820s.|$|R
50|$|Mathoor Aqueduct or Mathoor Hanging <b>Trough,</b> is an <b>aqueduct</b> in {{southern}} India, in Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu state. Built over the Pahrali River (also called Parazhiyar), it takes {{its name from}} Mathoor, a hamlet near the aqueduct, which is about 3 kilometres from Thiruvattar town and about 60 km from Kanyakumari, the southernmost town of India. It is one of the longest and highest aqueducts in South Asia and is a popular tourist spot in Kanyakumari District. The nearest railway station is Kuzhithura Railway Station which is about 15 kilometres away and the nearest airport is the Trivandrum International Airport which is about 70 kilometres awaay.|$|R
