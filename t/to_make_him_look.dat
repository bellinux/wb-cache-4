5|$|In {{the first}} Rurouni Kenshin kanzenban, {{published}} in Japan in July 2006, Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin's character. To make his X-shaped scar more notable, Watsuki made {{it long enough}} to cross his nose. Kenshin's hair is tied in two tails, which are flowing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> younger, and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a Habaki to Kenshin's sword {{to make it easier}} to draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly, by making his clothes more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe's neck scarf.|$|E
5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E

5|$|One {{year since}} the {{documentary}} has aired, the crew has returned to gain more footage for the DVD bonus features. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) are about to get married. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), after being humiliated with his talent show audition tape going viral on the internet, has found a job at his alma mater Cornell University in the Admissions Office. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) has helped expand Athlead, now named Athleap, opening a branch in Austin, Texas. Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) is enjoying retirement in Florida and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) tries to get Stanley's replacement Malcolm (Malcolm Barrett) fat on chocolates <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Stanley. After being fired by Dwight, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) bought a bar and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) started a career as an author in New York City. Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) has moved to Poland. Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) had faked his death but was then revealed to be a wanted fugitive, so Dwight replaced him with former employee Devon White (Devon Abner). Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) is preparing to run for a State Senate seat and is now Phillip's godfather. Andy, Darryl, Stanley, Toby, and Nellie return to Scranton for the wedding {{as well as a}} panel for the documentary.|$|E
5|$|Todd's {{identical}} twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), {{whom he had}} never known, is physically altered and brainwashed {{to believe that he}} is Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, he assumes Todd's identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd to keep him from exposing her agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd's scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Mitch Laurence's long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with Téa, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor's fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. Téa's brother, Tomás (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tomás is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene's murder; Téa gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tomás as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tomás into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty bonding with Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor's murder.|$|E
25|$|In the Tom and Jerry cartoon The Lonesome Mouse (1943), Jerry finds a {{portrait}} of Tom and draws on it <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Hitler. However, this scene is often cut from Cartoon Network airings.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Norton, {{though a}} Royalist, {{was still the}} chief personage in that neighbourhood, and his name {{produced}} sufficient effect on Original-Sin <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> come forward, <b>look</b> at the hoof, and select a shoe from those hung {{on the walls of}} his forge. Little Ben looked on, highly delighted to watch the proceedings, and Steadfast, as he waited, glanced towards the servant, a well-made young man, in a trim, sober suit of grey cloth, with a hat a good deal slouched over a dark swarthy face, that struck Stead as having been seen by him before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look up {{over your}} head," [...] cried the voice, rather a harsh voice. Peter looked, then {{all in a}} flash {{it came to him}} who it was Chebec had meant by the handsomest member of his family. It was Cresty the Great Crested Flycatcher. He was a wee bit bigger than Scrapper the Kingbird, yet not quite so big as Welcome Robin, and more slender. His throat and breast were gray, shading into bright yellow underneath. His back and head were of a grayish-brown with a tint of olive-green. A pointed cap was all that was needed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> quite {{distinguished}} <b>looking.</b> He certainly was the handsomest as well as the largest of the Flycatcher family.|$|R
25|$|Even {{the cast}} poked fun at their alter egos. On October 30, 2006, {{three of the}} series' cast members, {{appearing}} in their characters (Ferrera as Betty, Mabius as Daniel, and Newton as Amanda), gave New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick a 'makeover' <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more like quarterback Tom Brady in a spoof that was featured on ESPN's Monday Night Countdown.|$|E
25|$|According to NBC, the set for {{the show}} has had two major changes over the years. When the show first started in 1991, it was very basic with white walls, {{in an effort to}} capture the feel of fellow talk show Donahue, Jerry's haircut and glasses even seeming <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Phil Donahue. The general look of this set was carried over when the series first moved to Chicago in September 1992, with an unpolished, open air look and bright colored shapes.|$|E
25|$|Australia was 151 {{for seven}} – {{and the man}} wreaking the havoc was F. R. Brown! That was the {{remarkable}} part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not expect him to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in his mouth <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like the original Farmer Brown.|$|E
50|$|Zeke and Jimmy Jr. {{get into}} an impromptu wrestling match at lunch {{time in front of}} Tina, and Zeke lets his friend win <b>to</b> try and <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> good. Tina doesn't get swayed that easily but tells Jimmy Jr. to keep trying to impress her. Jimmy Jr. goes to Louise and Gene for help and ends up dressed as a horse reciting garbled {{messages}} via walkie talkie. Tina is firm in her decision to go with Josh and is pleased to know that her rejection just makes Jimmy Jr. want her more. While Louise and Gene stay home with a baby sitter, a dressed up Tina and Bob get ready for the dance of their lives (Linda even rended a limo hummer to take Bob to the dance in style).|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately for Craig, Carly dumped {{him at the}} altar, {{leaving him}} single. Dusty {{proposed}} <b>to</b> Meg <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> also <b>look</b> like a family man. He said it will prove to her estranged husband Paul that their life together was over and he'll stop stalking her {{to get her to}} take him back. Meg refused, not being in love with him but Dusty convinces her to consider. He tells Josie that he has to do it for Johnny because he comes first. Paul went to Emma's to see Meg to convince her to take him back. Meg almost considers, but brings up Dusty's proposal, having been told by an angry Josie. They argue and Meg tells him to leave. Paul tells her she still loves him and she reminds him she never denied it, only the fact she can't take him back and his behavior just confirms it. Paul threatened Meg, telling her she can't ever live without him. A disgusted Meg told Dusty she'll marry him. On January 26, 2009 they were married in Reno, Nevada in a small, simple ceremony, following the finalization of her divorce from Paul that day. It was only when they returned that they learned from Lily and Holden that Craig and Carly didn't marry.|$|R
50|$|LeeAnn Demerest {{comes to}} Llanview in 1991 {{on the heels}} of her mother DuAnn, the midwife who had helped birth Max Holden. Max is trying to uncover whether he is Asa Buchanan's {{biological}} son, and DuAnn seems inclined <b>to</b> help <b>him</b> <b>make</b> it <b>look</b> that way. LeeAnn becomes involved with Kevin Buchanan, who is on the rebound from a failed romance with Stephanie Hobart, but LeeAnn and Max are also drawn to one another. When LeeAnn believes that Max has fallen for Luna Moody, she sleeps with Kevin and becomes pregnant. Kevin finds out in 1992, and they elope. Meanwhile, blackmailing DuAnn is murdered, and Julia Medina confesses to the crime. Kevin and LeeAnn's marriage crumbles over her closeness with Jason Webb; they divorce, and LeeAnn leaves town for Texas with their son Duke Buchanan in 1993.|$|R
25|$|Armstrong enjoyed {{working with}} Oliver, but Louis' second wife, pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong, {{urged him to}} seek more {{prominent}} billing and develop his newer style away from the influence of Oliver. Lil had her husband play classical music in church concerts to broaden his skill and improve his solo play and she prodded him into wearing more stylish attire <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> sharp and to better offset his growing girth. Lil's influence eventually undermined Armstrong's relationship with his mentor, especially concerning his salary and additional moneys that Oliver held back from Armstrong and other band members. Armstrong and Oliver parted amicably in 1924. Shortly afterward, Armstrong received an invitation to go to New York City {{to play with the}} Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, the top African-American band of the time. Armstrong switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section. His influence upon Henderson's tenor sax soloist, Coleman Hawkins, can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period.|$|E
500|$|Krusty's {{design has}} {{undergone}} several subtle changes {{since the early}} years. For the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Krusty's design was permanently enhanced and {{he was given a}} different shaped mouth muzzle and permanent bags under his eyes in order to distinguish him from Homer. In the episode [...] "Lisa's Wedding", which is set fifteen years in the future, Krusty's design was significantly altered <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> considerably older and was based on Groucho Marx.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Sasuke's {{appearance in}} Part II, Kishimoto's main objective was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> cool.

He also tried other clothing such as a turtleneck and a military uniform to show [...] "cleanliness". However, he ended up choosing Japanese-style clothes with a Chokutō-style sword. For the film , Kishimoto gave Sasuke a new, young adult design, with [...] "even sharper" [...] facial features.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you say it}} in Russian?" [...] {{demanded a}} young man, whose eyes he had seen {{dwelling}} on her from the beginning. She laughed archly, and responded with some Slavic words, and then delivered her train of sight-seers over to the custodian who was to show them through the halls and chambers of the Burg. These were undergoing the repairs which the monuments of the past are perpetually suffering in the present, {{and there was some}} special painting and varnishing for the reception of the Kaiser, who was coming to Nuremberg for the military manoeuvres then at hand. But if they had been in the unmolested discomfort of their unlivable magnificence, their splendor was such as might well reconcile the witness to the superior comfort of a private station in our snugger day. The Marches came out owning that the youth which might once have found the romantic glories of the place enough was gone from them. But so much of it was left to her that she wished <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> stop and <b>look</b> at the flirtation which had blossomed out between that pretty young girl and the Russian, whom they had scarcely missed from their party in the Burg. He had apparently never parted from the girl, and now as they sat together on the threshold of the gloomy tower, he most have been teaching her more Slavic words, for they were both laughing as if they understood each other perfectly.|$|R
6000|$|I was now struck dumb indeed, {{and had not}} {{one word}} to say; I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for God and {{religion}} before me, let his particular principles be of what kind soever. As for me, I had {{not so much as}} entertained a thought of this in my heart before, and I believe should not have thought of it; for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we any work for them to do, we would have used as such, or would have been glad to have transported them to any other part of the world; for our business was to get rid of them, and we would all have been satisfied if they had been sent to any country, so they had never seen their own. But to the case: I say I was confounded at his discourse, and knew not what answer <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him.</b> He <b>looked</b> earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder; [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "I shall be very sorry, if what I have said gives you any offence."--"No, no," [...] said I, [...] "I am offended with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to think that I should never take any notice of this before, but with reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now. You know, Sir," [...] said I, [...] "what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East Indies, in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be an insufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the men lying all this while at victuals and wages upon the owners' account. It is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and if I stay more I must pay 32 sterling per diem demurrage; nor can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more, and I have been here thirteen days already; so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this work; unless I would suffer myself to be left behind here again; in which case, if this single ship should miscarry in any part of her voyage, I should be just in the same condition that I was left in here at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully delivered." ...|$|R
50|$|In November 1272, {{strained}} {{relations between}} Charles and Ghibelline-ruled Genoa finally broke into war. Ghibelline revolts broke {{out across the}} north of Italy, and increasingly occupied the attention of Charles, even as Michael Palaeologus was negotiating a union of churches with the Pope. At the same time, he made contact with Genoa and sent money to encourage revolts in the north. At the apparently successful conclusion of the Council of Lyon, a Union of Churches was declared, and Charles and Philip of Courtenay were compelled to extend a truce with Michael. This was {{a blessing in disguise}} for Charles, for the Ghibellines now controlled most of the north, and he was forced to retreat from Piedmont in late 1275. In truth, Pope Gregory was not entirely displeased; he regarded north Italy as best dealt with by its new emperor, Rudolph of Habsburg, and preferred that Charles be confined to the south. If he wished <b>to</b> <b>make</b> war, let <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> Outremer. To this end, Gregory endorsed the sale to Charles of the claims of Maria of Antioch on the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had been rejected by the Haute Cour there. On 18 March 1277, he bought her claim and assumed the title of King of Jerusalem, sending Roger of San Severino as his bailli to Acre. There Roger ousted Balian of Arsuf, the bailli of Hugh III, and compelled the nobles to swear fealty. In the meantime, Gregory had been succeeded by Pope Innocent V, who arranged a peace between Charles and the Genoese.|$|R
500|$|The Silver Samurai, {{rendered}} by Weta Digital, {{was based}} on a model that had been 3D printed and chrome painted using electrolysis. Stunt performer Shane Rangi, wearing a motion capture suit, stood on stilts while filming as the Silver Samurai. Rangi's performance was then used to animate the digital character. Hill said the main challenge was creating the Silver Samurai's highly reflective surface, [...] "He's pretty much chrome. We were worried {{that he was going to}} look incredibly digital and that it was going to be very hard <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> solid and real and not just like a mirrored surface." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, the Japanese {{publishers}} of Rurouni Kenshin released the kanzenban edition. In the fifth kanzenban, Watsuki redesigned {{the character of}} Sanosuke in a draft version. To emphasize his hate of the Meiji Government, Watsuki drew the Japanese kanji for [...] {{on the back of}} Sanosuke's jacket in the original series, but on the kanzenban redesign, the tattoo is located inside his clothes. Unlike in the manga where Sanosuke uses an oversized zanbatō as a weapon, Watsuki gave him a more historically authentic zanbatō; a sword notably thinner and longer in design. He also gave him an armor-like cloth <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more as a warrior.|$|E
500|$|Meeting {{the rest}} of Pam's family and friends, Greg still feels like an outsider. Despite efforts to impress the family, Greg's {{inadvertent}} actions make him {{an easy target for}} ridicule, disdain and anger: He accidentally breaks Debbie's nose during a volleyball mishap; uses a malfunctioning toilet that floods the Byrnes' back yard with sewage; sets the wedding altar on fire and inadvertently leads Jack to think he is a marijuana user. He also feels inferior to Kevin, Pam's ex-fiance who, unlike him, receives nothing but warmth and friendliness from Jack. Later, Greg loses Jinx and replaces him with a feral cat whose tail he spray paints <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Mr. Jinx while desperately seeking Jack's approval.|$|E
5000|$|... "Perjury, perjury, in {{the highest}} degree." [...] How does this quote relate to the {{character}} of James Sizela?James Sizela is an African, grey-haired old man with cinnamon bark skin, high cheek bones, a high forehead and gently slanting eyes.As headmaster of the local school he wears an old-fashioned pinstripe suit, which fits his general behaviour as he is stern and unmoving. He sees himself as a man of the old school and follows the principles of probity, morality and integrity. He teaches those principles at school and also raised his son, Steve, in that manner.Even though he wants to bury his long dead and missing son he does not really do a lot to support Sarah Barcant, who fights in court to find the body. James even gets angry when she wants to talk to him during class while he should be teaching. This is one example for his attitude towards work and duty, which is one of his higher priorities. He even misses the amnesty hearing of his son's murderer to go <b>to</b> work. This <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> uninterested and not caring. In general he is quiet and it seems James doesn't allow emotions at all, and doesn't comfort his wife after Steve's remains are recovered. The latter shows that James Sizela has a problem with bonding and relationships which Pieter Muller proves when he talks to James about Steve.This is one of the moments James shows the one emotion he knows: anger. In fact he gets angry enough, when Pieter Muller tells him he is responsible for his son's death, to lose control and to kill Pieter, even though he is not himself at that moment, in doing so, he commits [...] "Perjury of the highest degree" [...] to his principles of probity, morality and integrity.As Muller's wife wrongly insists on her husband having killed himself she further denies James to deal with his action. He resigns from his teaching position.The character James Sizela is quite important to interpret Red Dust, because he shows that everybody can become a killer given the [...] "right" [...] circumstances.|$|R

500|$|The episode's {{concern with}} the nature of free will and {{determinism}} grew out of Morgan's difficulties with plotting and constructing plot-twists; he explained that Bruckman and the killer interact in ways [...] "that were really easy to plot, but which makes the story seem complicated." [...] While writing the character's lines, Morgan realized that Mulder, were he to interact with a [...] "normal person", would come off as sounding insane when in fact he {{is supposed to be a}} smart person. As such, Morgan decided to [...] "shake up Mulder's image" [...] <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> slightly ridiculous; in the episode, Mulder views Bruckman [...] "only as a phenomenon" [...] and not as a person. To counter this, Morgan wrote Scully to see Bruckman, not as a psychic, but as a human.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Robert Blackman {{created the}} costume for Arturis, who {{noted that the}} character was [...] "diabolical" [...] but didn't {{want this to be}} given away through the costume immediately. In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> [...] "curious and affable", he placed the character in a shirt and pair of trousers. Where the script called for him to be shot by weapons fire, a burn on the shirt was created by key costumer Kimberley Shull using the hair color product Streaks and Tips. It was initially darker than intended, but the residue cleaned off to the desired level. Prop creator Alan Sims created Arturis' pistol weapon, intending for it to be held horizontally to give it a more alien appearance.
