5|$|There {{have also}} been several {{developments}} along the Missouri River waterfront in downtown. The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge was opened to foot and bicycle traffic on September 28, 2008. Started in 2003, RiverFront Place Condos first phase was completed in 2006 and is fully occupied and the second phase was opened in 2011. The development along Omaha's riverfront is attributed with prompting the City of Council Bluffs <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> own riverfront development time line forward.|$|E
5|$|Universities in South Dakota host {{a variety}} of sports programs. For many years, South Dakota {{was one of the}} only states in the country without a NCAA Division I {{football}} or basketball team. However, several years ago SDSU decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> teams from Division II to Division I, a move followed by the University of South Dakota. Other universities in the state compete at the NCAA's Division II or III levels, or in the NAIA.|$|E

5|$|With the {{scarcity}} of Los Angeles-based animators willing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> families so far north, give up traditional animation, and try computer animation, Pixar's new hires at this time either came directly from college or had worked outside feature animation. For those who had traditional animation skills, the Pixar animation software Marionette was designed so that traditional animators would require a minimum amount of training before becoming productive.|$|E
5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|After Celtic won the 1967 European Cup Final, {{the home}} leg of their Intercontinental Cup tie against Racing Club {{was held at}} Hampden. Celtic won 1–0 at Hampden, but lost the tie after a {{play-off}} in Montevideo. In 1970, Celtic played in the semi-finals of the European Cup against English league champions, Leeds United. Celtic chose <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> home leg of the tie from their Celtic Park home to Hampden, which had a far greater capacity. A crowd of 136,505, a record for any match in UEFA competition, saw Celtic win 2–1 (3–1 on aggregate) {{to advance to the}} 1970 European Cup Final. Celtic also played European Cup ties against Ajax and Rosenborg at Hampden during the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, both sides had large numbers of troops available for redeployment, and the British decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> Suez Canal defences from positions on the canal eastwards into the Sinai desert. Murray aimed to extend the railway and water pipeline to Katia, so that a permanent forward Imperial base of 50,000 men could be established. In February 1916, he requested permission from the War Office in London to extend this infrastructure further across the Sinai to El Arish. He considered that such an advance along the northern route, combined with the destruction of the central route's water sources and regular patrols from a base at El Arish, would permanently secure the Suez Canal. An advance to Katia was agreed by the War Office, but no decision was made regarding an advance to El Arish.|$|E
5|$|As winter {{broke in}} 1799, on 1 March, General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25,000, the Army of the Danube, crossed the Rhine at Kehl. Instructed {{to block the}} Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in {{northern}} Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, and use the routes <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{responded by}} putting {{commercial}} pressure on shipping companies {{to abandon the}} Glamorganshire Canal and using his feudal rights to force shippers <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> wharfs to his docks. His efforts paid off and although trade through the docks only came to 8,000 tons in 1839, they then rose quickly, reaching 827,000 tons by 1849. Between 1841 and 1848 the docks brought in a gross income of just under £68,000, a relatively disappointing figure compared {{to the size of}} the investment. Successive marquesses would find themselves under huge pressure to continue investing and expanding in the docks and subsequent phases of construction over the coming decades.|$|E
50|$|In 1874, {{representatives of}} the Christian Indians of Rossville, led by Chief David Rundle, wrote the federal {{government}} requesting support <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> southernmost hunting region around Grassy Narrows and the present day White Mud River.|$|R

5|$|In 1998 Salon {{reported}} that Scientologists were now blocked from viewing sites critical of Scientology including Operation Clambake and alt.religion.scientology, {{through the use}} of a content-control software program referred to by critics as Scieno Sitter. The Church of Scientology was unable to shut down Operation Clambake's internet service provider in Norway. The organization succeeded in shutting down the upstream connection to the site's internet service provider, Netherlands-based Xtended Internet. In November 2002, Xtended Internet's upstream provider, Cignal Global Communications received a letter from Church of Scientology counsel alleging copyright and trademark infringement involved with Xenu.net. This letter led to Cignal Global Communications, a United States-based company, terminating its service with Xtended Internet, which had <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> company to a new backbone provider.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would have limited {{movement of the}} neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine {{the flexibility of the}} neck of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. He found that the neck of Apatosaurus was very flexible.|$|E
5|$|On 4 December, Stabæk Fotball {{stated that}} they were willing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> training, Norwegian Football Cup and UEFA matches to either Nadderud or Ullevaal, as a {{compromise}} to free up more available time in the arena. This was rejected by NFF, who stated that the licensing rules required that a club's main arena be available for all league, cup and UEFA matches, and that a general exemption would not be given for the cup. In mid-December, Stabæk Fotball started the process of a judicial registration {{of the right to}} lease the venue, which was permitted according to the contract. This would grant Stabæk Fotball the right to continue to lease the venue even if the holding company went bankrupt. A preliminary injunction for this was granted by Asker and Bærum District Court.|$|E

5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> ears in various directions, and {{it has been said that}} it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E
5|$|Space Race is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released on July 16, 1973.

In the game, two players each control a rocket ship, with the goal of being the first <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> ship from the bottom of the screen to the top. Along the way are asteroids, which the players must avoid. Space Race was the first racing arcade video game and the first game with a goal of crossing the screen while avoiding obstacles.|$|E

5|$|The Army of the Danube {{advanced}} on Pfullendorf and Ostrach, {{the former}} an imperial city in Upper (southern) Swabia, {{and the latter}} a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance. Jourdan's objective was simple and direct: cut the Austrian line at {{the border of the}} southwestern German states and Switzerland, preventing the Coalition's use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe. Isolation of the two theaters would prevent the Austrians from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could use these routes <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>their</b> own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Ostrach, {{also called}} the Battle by Ostrach, {{occurred}} 20–23March 1799. In early March, the Army of the Danube pressed forward toward Pfullendorf and Ostrach, the former an imperial city in Upper Swabia and the latter a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem. Their goal was to cut the Austrian line at Switzerland, preventing the Coalition use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe.
