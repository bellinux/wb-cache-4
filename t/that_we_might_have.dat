2500|$|In 2007, the Quebec Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs, Benoît Pelletier, {{expressed}} his opinion {{that it was}} [...] "not impossible <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> to reconsider {{the role of the}} monarch, the lieutenant governor, and the governor general... I'm not saying that the monarchy must be abolished, but it will take some thought, especially on its usefulness and relevance. Two years later, Andrew Coyne called for importing [...] "not just a King of Canada, but a Canadian King" [...] that would reside permanently in Canada.|$|E
2500|$|At the Science Media Centre in London in July 2013, journalists met Met Office {{scientists}} and {{were given a}} briefing document with three papers on [...] "the recent pause in global warming" [...] in surface temperatures. These said other indicators continued to show warming, {{at least part of}} the pause related to heat being exchanged into deep oceans, and it did not alter the risks of future warming or invalidate the physics behind the models: it meant only a 10% reduction in the most probable projection, so [...] "the warming <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> expected by 2050 would be delayed by only a few years".|$|E

D.H. Hill was even more direct: [...] "Had all our troops been at Frayser's Farm, {{there would have been}} no Malvern Hill." [...] Confederate Brig. Gen. Edward Porter Alexander wrote after the war that, [...] "Never, before or after, did the fates put such a prize within our reach. It is my individual belief that on two occasions in the four years, we were within reach of military successes so great <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> hoped to end the war with our independence. ... The first was at Bull Run [...] July 1861 ... This [...] chance of June 30, 1862 impresses me as the best of all." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Hick {{used the}} term [...] "soul-making" [...] in his theodicy Evil and the God of Love to {{describe}} the kind of spiritual development that he believes justifies the existence of evil. This defense is employed by Michael Murray, who explains how, in his view, divine hiddenness is essential to soul-making. It may seem {{that it is not}} hard to imagine a world where God is known and yet believers act freely with ample opportunities for spiritual development. But Murray gives a deep and careful analysis of the argument, concluding that if God's existence were revealed in such a way as to remove reasonable non-belief, then [...] "any desire <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> to believe or act in ways contrary to that which has been revealed would be overwhelmed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Voice {{production}} started {{six months}} before the game's beta release. The voice production team were given the script 90% complete to work with. [...] "There were a few changes made during recording, but most of the remaining 10 percent will be dealt with in our pickup session," [...] O'Farrell said, [...] "The pickup session is right {{at the end of the}} project, where we catch performance issues, tutorial lines, verbal hints, and anything else <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> overlooked." [...] A game the size of Knights of the Old Republic would typically take seven weeks to record; two weeks of recording all-day and all-night meant LucasArts were able to record all voices in five weeks. Actors were recorded one at a time, as the non-linear nature of the game meant it was too complicated and expensive to record more than one actor at a time.|$|E

2500|$|Slocum {{agreed to}} a request by the Brazilian {{government}} to deliver the Destroyer to Pernambuco, Brazil. His motive was also financial. As Slocum describes, his contract with the commander of government forces at Pernambuco was, [...] "to go against the rebel fleet, and sink them all, if we could find them – big and little – for a handsome sum of gold …" [...] In addition, Slocum saw the possibility of getting even with the [...] "arch rebel" [...] Admiral Melo (whom he writes as [...] "Mello"): [...] "Confidentially: I was burning to get a rake at Mello and his Aquideban. He it was, who in that ship expelled my bark, the Aquidneck, from lIha Grand some years ago, under the cowardly pretext <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> sickness on board. But that story has been told. I was burning {{to let him know}} and palpably feel that this time I had in dynamite instead of hay".|$|E
2500|$|Similarities between Spinoza's {{philosophy}} and Eastern philosophical traditions {{have been discussed}} by many authorities. The 19th-century German Sanskritist Theodore Goldstücker {{was one of the}} early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the Vedanta tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was [...] "... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing in The Sunday Times in 2008, Dan Cairns had suggested: [...] "many {{consider}} {{him to be}} one of the greatest bass players of all time." [...] Steve Anderson, writing in The Independent said [...] ".. he became one of the most famous and influential bass players in rock." [...] Roger Waters of Pink Floyd recently described Bruce as [...] "probably the most musically gifted bass player who's ever been." [...] Eric Clapton posted on Facebook about Bruce [...] "He was a great musician and composer, and a tremendous inspiration to me" [...] and composed an acoustic song in his honour and Ginger Baker wrote [...] "I am very sad to learn of the loss of a fine man, Jack Bruce... My thoughts and wishes are with his family at this difficult time." [...] Guitarist Leslie West, of rock group Mountain, posted on Facebook, [...] "It is with great sadness that one of the worlds greatest musicians and bass players, who I had the honor of playing with in West Bruce and Laing, Jack Bruce has died. I was hoping somehow <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> gotten together one last time. Rest in Peace my friend." [...] Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi said on Twitter that Bruce had been his favourite bass player, saying [...] "He was a hero to so many" [...] and Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler regarded him as his [...] "biggest influence and favourite bass player". Guitarist John McLaughlin said on Twitter, [...] "Very sad to have lost my old friend Jack Bruce." [...] Long-standing collaborator Robin Trower wrote on Facebook, [...] "It has always been a great source of pride to me to have made music with Jack (one of the few musicians that can be truly called a force of nature) and Jack and I were proud of that music. He will be greatly missed". Fellow bassist Billy Cox also posted a tribute to Bruce on Facebook. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick said, [...] "There was a time when Jack Bruce was synonymous with the bass guitar in rock history, when he was widely revered as the best there was on four strings." [...] Rush bassist and singer Geddy Lee wrote: “The sudden passing of Jack Bruce is terribly sad news. One of the greatest rock bassists to ever live and a true and profound inspiration to countless musicians. He was one of my first bass heroes and was a major influence on my playing and my music. My heartfelt condolences to his family and fans.” In March 2015, a tribute concert at London's Roundhouse scheduled for October 2015 was announced. Guest artists confirmed were, Joss Stone, Phil Manzanera, Ginger Baker, Ian Anderson and Mark King and musical director Nitin Sawhney.|$|E
