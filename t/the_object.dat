5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of <b>the</b> <b>object</b> directly superimposed over the original object itself while <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is being subjected to some stress. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from <b>the</b> <b>object.</b> This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{had also}} speculated that Persephone, {{the wife of}} the god Pluto, would be a good name for <b>the</b> <b>object.</b> The name had been used several times in science fiction, and was popular with the public, having handily won a poll {{conducted}} by New Scientist magazine ("Xena", despite only being a nickname, came fourth). This was not possible once <b>the</b> <b>object</b> was classified as a dwarf planet, because there is already an asteroid with that name, 399 Persephone.|$|E

50|$|Aggregation {{is a kind}} of {{association}} that specifies a whole/part relationship between the aggregate (whole) and component part. This relationship between the aggregate and component is a weak “has a” relationship, as the component may survive <b>the</b> aggregate <b>object.</b> <b>The</b> component <b>object</b> may be accessed through other objects without going through <b>the</b> aggregate <b>object.</b> <b>The</b> aggregate <b>object</b> does not take part in the lifecycle of <b>the</b> component <b>object,</b> meaning <b>the</b> component <b>object</b> may outlive <b>the</b> aggregate <b>object.</b> <b>The</b> state of <b>the</b> component <b>object</b> still forms part of <b>the</b> aggregate <b>object.</b>|$|R
5|$|Double- and multi- {{exposure}} holography is one {{of three}} methods used to create holographic interferograms. A first exposure records <b>the</b> <b>object</b> in an unstressed state.

The composite image depicts the difference between the stressed and unstressed states.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} over whether <b>the</b> <b>object</b> would {{be classified as}} a planet or a minor planet, because different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects, the decision on what to name <b>the</b> <b>object</b> {{had to wait until}} after the August 24, 2006, IAU ruling.

5|$|Electronic {{speckle pattern}} {{interferometry}} (ESPI), {{also known as}} TV holography, uses video detection and recording to produce an image of <b>the</b> <b>object</b> upon which is superimposed a fringe pattern which represents the displacement of <b>the</b> <b>object</b> between recordings.

5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} <b>the</b> <b>object</b> at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for <b>the</b> <b>object</b> under Location A, where <b>the</b> <b>object</b> was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate <b>the</b> <b>object</b> in Location B, demonstrating flexibility.

5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration <b>the</b> <b>object</b> of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers <b>the</b> <b>object</b> of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to <b>the</b> <b>object</b> sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where <b>the</b> <b>object</b> does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between <b>the</b> <b>object</b> and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and <b>the</b> <b>object.</b>|$|E
