The stations were indeed vulnerable to dive bombers and low flying aircraft, however the British had mobile units {{which could be}} moved around to cover any gaps. Rapid repair services were also quick. Rarely were radar stations out of action for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> However snow is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

40|$|The British TV show Pop Star to Opera Star (2010 / 2011) was a {{contribution}} to a well-worn reality TV genre {{in which people are}} challenged to undertake a professional activity in which they have no prior experience. In this article I examine the way in which popular challenge programmes such as Pop Star to Opera Star, which suggest that highly skilled activities can be ‘faked’ with no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>day’s</b> training, stage what art theorist John Roberts describes as ‘the generalised deskilling of labour under capitalism’. And I argue that in particular, the historical transvaluation of musical performance skills throughout the capitalist era exposes the contradictions that are inherent in both social and cultural constructions of the value of labour under capitalism...|$|R

5|$|The Luftwaffe command {{understood}} that their support would be {{crucial for the}} success of Operation Citadel, but problems with supply shortfalls hampered their preparations. Partisan activity, particularly behind Army Group Center, slowed the rate of re-supply and cut short the Luftwaffe's ability to build up essential stockpiles of petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and, unlike Red Army units there were no reserves of aircraft {{that could be used to}} replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation. Fuel was the most significant limiting factor. To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June. Despite this conservation of resources, the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air effort for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after the operation began.|$|E
5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver {{for weeks at a time}} when they had never been together for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked when they found out, as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E

Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow {{was surprised at}} the gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May said that he had not been away from New York for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities.

25|$|Volume risk {{is often}} used to denote the {{phenomenon}} whereby electricity market participants have uncertain volumes or quantities of consumption or production.

A compounding factor is also the common correlation between extreme price and volume events.

The introduction of substantial amounts of intermittent power sources such as wind energy may affect market prices.|$|E

Temporary repairs were meanwhile made to Chauncey Vibbard, allowing her to complete the passage to New York at a slow speed, where she arrived about 10 pm.

25|$|The female lays {{her eggs}} {{as close to}} the food source as possible, and {{development}} is very rapid, allowing the larva to consume as much food as possible {{in a short period of}} time before transforming into the adult. The eggs hatch immediately after being laid, or the flies are ovoviviparous, with the larva hatching inside the mother. Larval flies, or maggots, have no true legs, and little demarcation between the thorax and abdomen; in the more derived species, the head is not clearly distinguishable from the rest of the body. Maggots are limbless, or else have small prolegs. The eyes and antennae are reduced or absent, and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci. This lack of features is an adaptation to a food-rich environment, such as within rotting organic matter, or as an endoparasite. The pupae take various forms, and in some cases develop inside a silk cocoon. After emerging from the pupa, the adult fly rarely lives more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> and serves mainly to reproduce and to disperse in search of new food sources.|$|E
