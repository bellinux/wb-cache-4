25|$|Microblogging: Microblogging is the {{practice}} of posting small pieces of digital content—which could be text, pictures, links, short videos, or other media—on the Internet. Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic and spontaneous to many users. It has captured the public imagination, {{in part because the}} short posts are easy to read on the go or when waiting. Friends use it to keep in touch, business associates use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources, and celebrities and politicians (or their publicists) microblog about concert dates, lectures, book releases, or tour schedules. A wide and growing range of add-on tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications. The resulting profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> Examples of these include Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and, by far the largest, WeiBo.|$|E

This study {{is to find out}} two research questions about the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> strategies and the differences and similarities in their use by high and low achievers. In order to answer the research questions, the writer uses Brown 2 ̆ 7 s communication strategies (2007) as the main theory and Littlewood 2 ̆ 7 s (1984) as the supporting theory. There are three findings: First, the high achievers used nine <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> strategies and the low achievers used seven <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> strategies. Second, the high achievers used a lot <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> strategies, but their frequency of using them was lower than the low achievers.

40|$|This {{is a study}} {{about the}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Strategies used by thirty {{students}} of English Department of Petra Christian University with different levels <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Apprehension. The writer chooses this topic because she observes that many students experience Communication Apprehension, which can influence the use <b>of</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Strategies. The writer attempts {{to find out the}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Strategies used by students with high and low levels <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Apprehension and the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Strategies mostly used by them. In addition, she intends to find out whether students with high level <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Apprehension use more numbers <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Strategies rather than those with low level <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Apprehension. Language Anxiety by Horwitz et al. and Brown, Communication Apprehension by Daly and McCroskey, and Communication Strategies by Dornyei are the theories used in this study. The data are collected in a classroom created by the writer from two tasks-pictorial story telling and pictorial instruction. The writer finds that there are twelve <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Strategies used by students with high Communication le vel; repetition, approximation, and using fillers are the Communication Strategies mostly used by them. There are thirteen <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Strategies used by students with low Communication Apprehension level; and approximation, using fillers, and repetition are the Communication Strategies mostly used by them. It is also true that students with high Communication Apprehension level use more numbers <b>of</b> <b>Communication</b> Strategies than those with low Communication Apprehension level.

2500|$|Pramukh Swami was {{approached}} by many followers for guidance {{in all aspects of}} life. [...] Devotees frequently took to him matters of personal, family, and business affairs and seek his guidance. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> was thought to be an important aspect of the guru-disciple relationship. [...] Accordingly, Pramukh Swami spent much time counseling devotees in person or by letters or telephone. [...] Women could not directly receive advice from Pramukh Swami due to his vows as a sadhu in the Swaminarayan tradition that prohibit him from interacting directly with females. Women had to ask male relatives to approach Pramukh Swami on their behalf, or had written messages sent to him to ask for guidance.|$|E
2500|$|Autocommunication is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> {{in which}} the sender and {{receiver}} are the same individual. The sender emits a signal that is altered by the environment and eventually is received by the same individual. The altered signal provides information that can indicate food, predators or conspecifics. Because the sender and receiver are the same animal, selection pressure maximizes signal efficacy, i.e. {{the degree to which}} an emitted signal is correctly identified by a receiver despite propagation distortion and noise. [...] There are two types of autocommunication. [...] The first is active electrolocation found in the electric fish Gymnotiformes (knifefishes) and Mormyridae (elephantfish) and also in the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). [...] The second type of autocommunication is echolocation, found in bats and Odontoceti.|$|E
2500|$|Communication is {{critical}} for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care. [...] The patient provider relationship {{is dependent on the}} ability of both individuals to effectively communicate. [...] Language and culture both {{play a significant role in}} communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians. [...] Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask. In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time. Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes. Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers. [...] Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among limited English proficient patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater. [...] Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one. [...] The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications. Poor communication contributes to poor medical compliance and health outcomes. [...] Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient. [...] However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience. Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization. [...] Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers. [...] It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients’ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting. [...] Understanding a patients’ view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment. [...] So providers need to assess patients’ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care. Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with. Other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> problems are seen in LGBT health care with the spoken heterosexist (conscious or unconscious) attitude on LGBT patients, lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men (lesbians, gynecologic examinations) and other issues.|$|E

In this case, the writer divides the learners into two groups. Group A consists of students who have studied English for 6 - 8 years and group B consists of students who have studied English for 9 - 11 years. The writer chooses this topic because she interested in observing people?s way to communicate with others by using their second language (English) that they do not master yet. The writer attempts to find out the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> strategies used by two groups of different length of exposure in English and tries to find out the differences or similarities of the two groups. In addition, she intends to find out whether the length time of studies brings more influences on the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> strategies used. The communication strategies by Dornyei, Tarone, and Littlewood are the theories that are used in this study. Whereas, the data are collected in a classroom situation created by the writer from the interview and the sharing session on a certain topic. The writer finds that there are ten <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> strategies used by students who have studied English for 6 - 8 years and there are nine <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> strategies used by students who have studied English for 9 - 11 years.
