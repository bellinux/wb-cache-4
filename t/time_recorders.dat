Pitrat patented the computing scale in 1885; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888); Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine; and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889. On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York. The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto. They manufactured machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial <b>time</b> <b>recorders,</b> meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards. Thomas J. Watson, Sr., fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson, called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered CTR. [...] Watson joined CTR as General Manager then, 11 months later, was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.

5000|$|Recorders {{are known}} to have been made in {{different}} sizes since at least the 15th century, but a consistent terminology did not exist until the 20th-century revival of the instrument. In the early 16th century, books were published by Sebastian , Martin , and Sylvestro , all of which describe the smallest of three sizes of recorder (tuned in fifths) as an instrument with the bottom note G. Appropriate to the highest instrument of the set, it is given a name used for the highest vocal part in music from that time: discant ( [...] ; , Virdung also calls it clain flöte—"small flute", kleine Flöte in modern German) and sopran or soprano [...] At this <b>time,</b> <b>recorders</b> were made in a single piece. This type of instrument continued to be produced through the 17th century and into the early 18th, though around 1650 it began to be made in three separate parts. It was sometimes called the flauto italiano, particularly after about 1670 when a new type of recorder appeared in France, called flûte douce (sweet flute), what today would be called an alto (treble) in F. In contrast to the bright-toned flauto italiano, which was easy to play in the high register, the flüte douce was full and resonant in the low register, but was weak on the upper notes. This new version of recorder (first depicted in a painting from 1672) was first made in Paris and, shortly later and under French influence, in London. The redesign is traditionally attributed to the Hotteterres, particularly to Jean Hotteterre, though the evidence is rather tenuous. In 1696, Johann Christoph Denner and Johann Schell applied for permission to make the French type of instrument in Nuremberg, and it quickly became the dominant type of instrument across Europe. In most languages, this was the instrument meant by the word for flute alone: German Flöte, Dutch fluyt, Italian flauto, Spanish flauta. In England, it was usually simply [...] "flute", but when necessary to differentiate from the transverse flute or other sizes of recorder, it was called [...] "common flute" [...] or [...] "consort flute" [...]|$|E

30|$|The {{tasks that}} are {{currently}} set up as the objective of a work study do not differ substantially from those formulated by F.W. Taylor over 100  years ago: “A piece-rate system being a step toward partial solution of the labour problem” (Koŝir et al. 2015). The weight of research has shifted slightly towards the optimisation of production systems, and traditional (manual) measurement methods are partly replaced by automated bases. The StanForD control and measurement standard (Dvořák et al. 2011), applied in harvesters, enables the acquisition of a huge database. The problems of using such measurements consist in the lack of verification of certain categories of time and in treating a work cycle as a whole (Purfürst and Erler 2011). For this reason, microcomputers are still used in manual measurements with the manual feeding of time points. The effect of the “human factor” is marked very clearly {{in the form of}} errors {{due to the lack of}} skill of <b>time</b> <b>recorders</b> and their fatigue, especially in long-term measurements (Nurminen et al. 2006). In the present study, thanks to determination of the reference level (video material), an additional factor was identified which consists of recording short-term activities with difficult-to-establish border points.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} summarises {{some major}} results obtained during experiments conducted {{in collaboration with}} the Reunion Island (France) (20 °- 22 °N and 53 °- 57 °N) fishing industry. These studies may aid fishermen in modifying fishing operations and selecting a fishing strategy to increase economic benefits and also to reduce the impact on bycatch mortality. Firstly, we investigated the behaviour of the fishes when caught on the longline gear and the survivorship of fish hooked, using longline gears instrumented with hook <b>time</b> <b>recorders</b> (HT) and temperature depth recorders (TDR). We showed that the percentages of fish recovered alive at hauling varied among species. The percentages of fish recovered alive up to 8 h after capture provides a rough idea of the resistance of each species to the capture process; these rates were recorded for the blue shark (Prionace glauca), the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and for the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and were respectively 29 %, 23 % and 27 % while this rate was lower for the swordfish (8 %). Moreover, we demonstrated that shortening the soaking time during the fishing operation could be beneficial in many ways for fishermen. A second study on the reproduction dynamic of the swordfish in the vicinity of Reunion Island showed that the Big Old Fat Fecund Female Fish (BOFFFF) hypothesis could effectively apply to this species. Consequently, the removal of the larger, older individuals could b...|$|E
