5|$|Some {{payloads}} consist simply of {{an application}} designed to lock or restrict the system until payment is made, typically by setting the Windows Shell to itself, or even modifying the {{master boot record}} and/or partition table to prevent the operating system from booting until it is repaired. The most sophisticated payloads encrypt files, with many using strong encryption <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> the victim's files {{in such a way}} that only the malware author has the needed decryption key.|$|E
5|$|The {{latest version}} of BitLocker, first {{included}} in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, adds the ability <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> removable drives. On Windows XP or Windows Vista, read-only access to these drives can be achieved through a program called BitLocker To Go Reader, if FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT filesystems are used. In addition, a new command-line tool called manage-bde replaced the old manage-bde.wsf.|$|E

5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, it {{was found}} that Netscape Communicator used ROT13 as part of an {{insecure}} scheme to store email passwords. In 2001, Russian programmer Dimitry Sklyarov demonstrated that an eBook vendor, New Paradigm Research Group (NPRG), used ROT13 <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> their documents; it has been speculated that NPRG may have mistaken the ROT13 toy example—provided with the Adobe eBook software development kit—for a serious encryption scheme. Windows XP uses ROT13 on some of its registry keys. ROT13 is also used in the Unix fortune program to conceal potentially offensive dicta.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, something that may take {{a considerable amount of}} time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted, when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> their communications for reasons of privacy. This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel {{taps into}} their {{connection}} and reveals {{that he has}} located McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy, and intends to kidnap her. McClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility, where Farrell discovers that Gabriel's men are downloading all the information. He manages <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> the data just in time before he is captured. Gabriel kidnaps Farrell and takes him as well as Lucy, who had been kidnapped earlier, with him as his team flees from Woodlawn. McClane pursues Gabriel, hijacking his semi and enlisting Warlock to trace Gabriel's vehicle. Gabriel accesses the communication system of a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II and, impersonating an air traffic controller, orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving. McClane barely escapes, then {{makes his way to}} a nearby warehouse where Warlock has tracked Gabriel. There, Gabriel is installing the remaining files and holding Lucy and Farrell. Although McClane kills most of Gabriel's remaining henchmen, Emerson shoots him in the right shoulder.|$|E

25|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} (QKD) is a secure communication method which implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics. It enables two parties {{to produce a}} shared random secret key known only to them, which can then be used <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> and decrypt messages. It is often incorrectly called quantum cryptography, {{as it is the}} best-known example of a quantum cryptographic task.|$|E
25|$|The 256-bit AES cipher. Encryption can be enabled {{for both}} files and the 7z {{hierarchy}}. When the hierarchy is encrypted, users {{are required to}} supply a password to see the filenames contained within the archive.

25|$|<b>To</b> <b>encrypt,</b> a {{table of}} alphabets can be used, termed a tabula recta, Vigenère square, or Vigenère table. It {{consists}} of the alphabet written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar ciphers. At different points in the encryption process, the cipher uses a different alphabet {{from one of the}} rows. The alphabet used at each point depends on a repeating keyword.|$|E

25|$|Key {{length in}} Word 97 and 2000 was {{strengthened}} up to 40 bit. However, modern cracking software allows removing such a password very quickly – a persistent cracking process takes one week at most.

Some password recovery software {{can not only}} remove a password, but also find an actual password that was used by a user <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> the document using brute-force attack approach. Statistically, the possibility of recovering the password depends on the password strength.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, Soghoian co-authored an {{open letter}} to Google with 37 {{prominent}} security and privacy experts, urging the company to protect the privacy of its customers by enabling HTTPS encryption by default for Gmail and its other cloud based services. In January 2010, Google enabled HTTPS by default for users of Gmail, and subsequently for other products, including search. According to Google, it was already considering HTTPS by default. Soghoian has in recent years continued his HTTPS advocacy, calling on news media, law firms, government agencies and other organizations <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> their own websites.|$|E
25|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} is only {{used to produce}} and distribute a key, not to transmit any message data. This key can then be used with any chosen encryption algorithm <b>to</b> <b>encrypt</b> (and decrypt) a message, which can then be transmitted over a standard communication channel. The algorithm most commonly associated with QKD is the one-time pad, as it is provably secure when used with a secret, random key. In real-world situations, it is often also used with encryption using symmetric key algorithms like the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm.|$|E
