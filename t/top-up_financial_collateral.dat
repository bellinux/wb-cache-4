The Author used a method consiting of describing the purpouses of traditional elements of those security instruments, which are broken and modified by the provisions enabling agreements on <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> {{in the first part}} of the thesis, and further applied the purposes to the provisions enabeling the agreements on <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> itself in the second part of this thesis.

These differences lie in the area of formation of such security instrument, the area of rights and duties of the contracting parties during the existence of the <b>financial</b> <b>collateral,</b> as well as the possibilities of the satisfaction of the creditor from the collateral.

40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1976, microfinance has boomed. As of December 31, 2007, 3, 552 microcredit institutions had reached 154 million clients worldwide, about 106. 6 million of whom were among the poorest when they took their first loan. Such expansion can be at least partly attributed to the widely adopted practice of group lending in microfinance programs. In contrast to individual lending, group lending (or joint liability) grants a loan to a group of borrowers, and the whole group is liable for the debt of any individual member in the group. This practice allows microfinance programs to rely mainly on accountability and mutual trust among group members rather than <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> to insure against default.

Furthermore, this European regulation is the expression of a trend favouring self-help remedies for the creditor, who can – if the debt is not paid – sell or appropriate the collateral, subject to the condition that he will give the debtor the difference between the price obtained (or the value of the collateral) and the amount of the debt. The challenge for the Italian doctrine shall therefore be to examine whether the above self-help remedies could be granted in every case in which the value of the collateral can be determined according to objective criteria, such as whether the collateral consists of currency, receivables or financial instruments negotiable in the market...|$|R

The paradigm shift in understanding of poverty has evolved to include various dimensions of deprivations instead of one-dimensional income poverty.   Policy makers around the world as a part of long term strategy in eradicating poverty, however, consider access to financial resources as the most important constituent of the multi-pronged strategy. Further, the various socio-political dimensions and economic dimensions of poverty are believed to interact with each other and manifest itself in an intertwined relationship. Financial inclusion is believed to encourage micro entrepreneur to take on profitable activities which in turn provide an enabling environment for him to gather access to social networks which may be beneficial to him in terms of access to raw material, marketing support and business ties. Whereas financial inclusion is believed to {{have a positive impact on}} social capital, the reverse is also true; the amount and quality of social capital provides a micro-entrepreneur with easy access to diverse sources of finance. Microfinance Institutions around the world heavily rely on group financing mechanism by leveraging on social collateral as a replacement to <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> in financing micro-entrepreneurs. Obviously they perceive lending to micro-entrepreneurs having rich social capital as less riskier and thus his/her social capital substitutes for the <b>financial</b> <b>collateral</b> in gaining access to credit.

This brief examines whether and how much repayment is affected by three factors: the source of the loan, groups’ provision of public goods in the form of insurance substitutes, and the monitoring and repayment rules of the federations of groups. The data come from more than 2, 000 self-help groups (SHGs), federated in 299 village organizations in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The SHGs under study were supported by a large World Bank program called the Indira Kranti Patham (IKP) program, with a cost of US$ 260 million. The program has been replicated in other states in India and may be replicated in other countries.
