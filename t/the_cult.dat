5|$|Details {{about the}} {{religious}} life in Qatna {{are not available}} due to the rarity of written evidence from the city; in general, many cults seems to have existed and mixed in Qatna, most prominently the royal ancestor cult, <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of gods and <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of the dead.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{initiation}} may have affected a devotee's rank within <b>the</b> <b>cult.</b> After going through his third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, {{a member of a}} particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros, it is possible that members moved up in <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within <b>the</b> <b>cult.</b> Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one.|$|E
5|$|Mary's {{investigation}} {{leads her}} to Jacqueline's secret husband, Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont); a failed poet, Jason Hoag (Erford Gage); and a mysterious psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway). Jacqueline had been Judd's patient, seeking treatment for depression stemming from her {{membership in a}} Satanic cult called the Palladists. She was lured into joining <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> by her former co-workers. Mary enlists a private detective, Irving August (Lou Lubin), but he is stabbed to death while investigating at the La Sagesse headquarters. Judd eventually helps Mary locate Jacqueline, who has gone into hiding. Gregory Ward {{falls in love with}} Mary. Jacqueline is later kidnapped by <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> members and condemned to death for revealing <b>the</b> <b>cult.</b> She would be the seventh person so condemned since the founding of <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> (hence the film's title).|$|E

[...] Bowman's review concluded, [...] "... Ruth Tucker's Another Gospel is, in several respects, the best general textbook on <b>the</b> <b>cults.</b> It is more up-to-date, more readable, and more respectful of <b>the</b> <b>cults</b> than any other such textbook. But, because it is lacking in biblical critiques of <b>the</b> <b>cults</b> (which is understandable, given the author's areas of expertise), it cannot replace those books which do provide such critiques, however much fresh treatments are needed." ...|$|R

5|$|Because not all local cults of Isis held mystery rites, not all her devotees {{would have}} {{undergone}} initiation.

5|$|Malhari Mahatmya {{states that}} Khandoba first {{appeared}} on Champashasti, which was a Sunday, at Premapur, which identified as Pember (Adimailar, Mailarapur) near Bidar. Marathi traditions tell that Khandoba came originally from Premapuri, now Pember in Karnataka, then went to Naldurg, Pali and finally to Jejuri. Sontheimer suggests that <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of Mailara may have originated in Pember and then spread to Maharashtra, merging with <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> of Khandaka— the patron yaksha (demi-god) of Paithan giving it its distinct Maharashtrain characteristics. Maharashtrains call the god - Kanadya Khanderaya, the god from Karnataka. <b>The</b> <b>cult</b> possibly was spread by Lingayat, Jain and other merchants, associated with Mailara-Khandoba, {{to other parts of}} the Deccan. Besides Mailara, Khandoba is identified with other deities of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, and is called as Mallanna, Mairala, and Mallu Khan. Other traditions like Shakta cults of folk goddesses were assimilated into the Khandoba cult, identifying the goddesses with Khandoba's wives Mhalsa or Banai.|$|E
