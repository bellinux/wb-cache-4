The map leads {{to the location of}} the king's most prized possession, hidden in a secret place shortly before his death. Donald <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> his path to riches. Unfortunately Big Bad Pete overhears and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure.|$|E
25|$|After {{her death}} on the pyre, the woman is finally {{transformed}} {{into the shape of}} the satimata, an spiritual embodiment of goodness, with her principal concern of being a family protector. Typically, the satimata occurs in the dreams of the family members, teaching for example, the women how to be good pativratas, herself through her sacrifice having proved she was the perfect pativrata. However, although the satimata's intentions are always {{for the good of the}} family, she is not averse to let, for example, children become sick, or the cows' udders wither, if she <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an appropriate lesson to the living wife who had neglected her duties as pativrata.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. The show runner of The Simpsons at the time, Bill Oakley, <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most}} [...] "beautifully" [...] directed episodes of the show. He called the [...] "hand-colouring" [...] very [...] "vivid" [...] and [...] "bright". The episode is the first Christmas episode the producers had done since the first episode of the series, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". Oakley said that nobody in the writing staff wanted to [...] "try on Christmas" [...] because it was [...] "so famous" [...] as being the first episode.|$|E

5000|$|In 1951, {{with the}} U.S. Congress now under Democratic control, HUAC {{launched}} a second investigation of Hollywood and Communism. As actor Larry Parks said when called before the panel,Don't present {{me with the}} choice of either being in contempt of this committee and going to jail or forcing me to really crawl through the mud to be an informer. For what purpose? I don't {{think it is a}} choice at all. I don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> really sportsmanlike. I don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> American.

500|$|AIP heads Arkoff and Nicholson had {{originally}} contributed their {{portion of the}} budget as a tax write-off, but when they were screened the completed film they were astonished by its quality. Nicholson told Louis Heyward, [...] "It {{is one of the}} best we have gotten from England. Everybody <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> about the best production in the Poe series for the past few years." [...] Arkoff noted that [...] "Michael Reeves brought out some elements in Vincent that hadn't been seen in a long time. Vincent was more savage in the picture. Michael really brought out the balls in him. I was surprised how terrifying Vincent was in that... I hadn't expected it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title page}} of the {{collection}} Cathay (1915), refers to the poet [...] "Rihaku", the pronunciation in Japanese of the Tang dynasty Chinese poet, Li Bai, whose poems were much beloved in China and Japan for their technical mastery and much translated in the West because of their seeming simplicity. Alexander <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the most attractive [...] of Pound's work. Chinese critic Wai-lim Yip writes of it: [...] "One can easily excommunicate Pound from the Forbidden City of Chinese studies, but {{it seems clear that}} in his dealings with Cathay, even when he is given only the barest details, he is able to get into the central concerns of the original author by what we may perhaps call a kind of clairvoyance." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hammond {{was a key}} {{instrument}} in progressive rock music. Author Edward Macan <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because of its versatility, allowing both chords and lead lines to be played, and a choice between quiet and clean, and what Emerson described as a [...] "tacky, aggressive, almost distorted, angry sound." [...] Emerson first found commercial success with the Nice, with whom he used and abused an L-100, putting knives in the instrument, setting fire to it, playing it upside down, or riding it across stage {{in the manner of}} a horse. He continued to play the {{instrument in}} this manner alongside other keyboards in Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Other prominent Hammond organists in progressive rock include the Zombies' and Argent's Rod Argent, Yes's Tony Kaye and Rick Wakeman, Focus's Thijs van Leer, Uriah Heep's Ken Hensley, Pink Floyd's Rick Wright, Kansas's Steve Walsh, and Genesis's Tony Banks. Banks later claimed he only used the Hammond because a piano was impractical to transport to gigs.|$|E

2500|$|Some time later, Bree and Rex visit Andrew at the camp. Andrew asks to see {{his father}} alone; Bree <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because he blames her for sending him to the camp and storms into the meeting room to tell him she did the right thing. There, Rex reveals that Andrew {{wanted to see him}} alone because he fears he is gay. Bree is horrified, and despite Rex's misgivings, insists Andrew come home with them immediately, saying [...] "Our son just told us that he might be gay. There are two hundred other boys in this camp. Now, I could explain to you what might happen if we left him here, but I'm a lady and I don't use that kind of language." [...] Rex reminds her that he is still her son and Bree tries to comfort Andrew by telling him [...] "I would love you even if you were a murderer".|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare sets up {{the dispute}} between {{the heart and the}} eye as a legal battle that is to be decided by a jury ("quest of thoughts"). [...] Legal {{terminology}} is abundant throughout the sonnet, with both the heart and eye making [...] "pleas" [...] for their cases. [...] Eventually, a [...] "verdict is determined" [...] that the [...] "outward part" [...] of the body belongs to the eye while the [...] "inward love of heart" [...] belongs to the heart. Critic Paul Hammond focuses on the word [...] "'cide" [...] in line 9. [...] He argues that neither [...] "'cide" [...] as in [...] "decide" [...] nor [...] "side" [...] as in [...] "to support" [...] or [...] "to side with" [...] make sense {{in the context of the}} poem. He states that the word was originally printed as [...] "fide", which was a misprint of [...] "finde", meaning [...] "to determine and declare". He gives two reasons why he <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the correct word: (1) [...] "side" [...] does not make sense in the context of the poem and (2) that [...] "finde" [...] continues the legal imagery of the sonnet.|$|E

[...] Amaya did not really kidnap Toby. [...] When Amaya {{explained}} to Toby who her father really was, Amaya was able to enlist Toby (using the magic of Santa Muerte) to help exact an even worse revenge on Jack/Roberto. [...] Amaya tells Toby that her father will kill her mother (which in fact happened earlier when Jack was duped by the assassin he tortured into killing Katie to find Toby). [...] Amaya told Toby that Santa Muerte magic would give her the strength to carry out a terrible revenge on her father for that murder. [...] So Amaya purposefully let Jack and Toby escape. [...] Her plan was for them to live happily for many years and then for Toby to kill her father. [...] In the final scene, we see Jack and Toby fleeing deeper into Mexico on an old bus. [...] As she sits and watches the countryside go by, we hear Toby reciting the same Santa Muerta chant for power that others (including Jack) said throughout the movie.|$|E
2500|$|Testaverde was {{the first}} overall draft pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1987 NFL Draft. In his second season, Testaverde {{struggled}} heavily, with a 47.6% completion rate for 3,240 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 35 interceptions. During his tenure in Tampa, Testaverde received taunts from fans and radio personalities about his color blindness. In 1988, a radio station in Tampa rented a billboard that had Testaverde {{standing in front of}} a blue background. The billboard read: [...] "Vinny <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> orange!" [...] The high number of errors caused his intelligence to be called into question. National Football League Players Association president Gene Upshaw, unaware that his comments could be heard by anyone viewing through a direct satellite uplink, once commented during an NFL Live! commercial break that Testaverde was so dumb that he would drag the electric cord through his swimming pool while trimming the hedges, and claimed himself to be a better quarterback (Upshaw was a retired offensive guard) than Testaverde. His numbers continued to improve, and in the 1992 season, his last with Tampa Bay, he threw for a 57.5% completion rate for 2,554 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions.|$|E

[...] Eboli, who still thinks Don Carlos loves her, enters. [...] Don Carlos mistakes her for Elisabeth in the dark, and passionately declares his love. When he sees Eboli's face, he realizes his error and recoils from her. [...] Eboli guesses his secret - that he was expecting the Queen, whom he loves. Carlos, terrified, begs for mercy. Posa enters. Eboli threatens to tell the King that Elisabeth and Carlos are lovers. [...] Posa warns her not to cross him; he is the King's confidant. [...] Eboli replies by hinting darkly that she a formidable and dangerous foe, with power which Posa does not yet know about. (Her power {{is that she is}} having an affair with the King, but she does not reveal this yet.) [...] Posa draws his dagger, intending to stab her to death, but reconsiders, spares her, and declares his trust in the Lord. Eboli exits in a vengeful rage. Posa advises Carlos to entrust to him any sensitive, potentially incriminating political documents that he may have and, when Carlos agrees, they reaffirm their friendship.|$|E

2500|$|Ben confides to Sally {{that his}} life is empty. She yearns for him to hold her, but young Sally slips {{between them and the}} three move {{together}} ("Too Many Mornings"). Ben, caught in the passion of memories, kisses Sally as Buddy watches from the shadows. Sally <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a sign that the two will finally get married, and Ben is about to protest until Sally interrupts him with a kiss and runs off to gather her things, thinking that the two will leave together. Buddy leaves the shadows furious, and fantasizes about the girl he should have married, Margie, who loves him and makes him feel like [...] "a somebody", but bitterly concludes he does not love her back ("The Right Girl"). He tells Sally that he's done, but she is lost in a fantasy world, and tells him that Ben has asked her to marry him. Buddy tells her she must be either crazy or drunk, but he's already supported Sally through rehab clinics and mental hospitals and cannot take any more. Ben drunkenly propositions Carlotta, with whom he once had a fling, but she has a young lover and coolly turns him down. Heidi Schiller, joined by her younger counterpart, performs [...] "One More Kiss", her aged voice a stark contrast to the sparkling coloratura of her younger self. Phyllis kisses a waiter and confesses to him that she had always wanted a son. She then tells Ben that their marriage can't continue the way it has been. Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Ben denies this, but still wants Phyllis out. Angry and hurt, Phyllis considers whether to grant his request ("Could I Leave You?").|$|E
