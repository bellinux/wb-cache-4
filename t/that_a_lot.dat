5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up.

5|$|Stefan Kieniewicz, {{in a more}} {{critical}} treatment in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, notes <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of her exploits are poorly documented, {{and it is not}} always possible to separate legend from facts. He notes it is not certain she ever commanded any unit, and that her role as the commander of the 25th Regiment was more honorary than real; he also notes that she is known to have fainted on the battlefield, distracting her comrades, and in at least one instance (at the battle of Šiauliai), she was purposefully held behind front lines, as her comrades tried to ensure she would not endanger herself.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music.
