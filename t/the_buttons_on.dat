5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the controller.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} {{successfully}} matches {{a number of}} consecutive notes correctly, they boost their individual scoring multiplier up to a maximum 4x value; missing a note will reset to the multiplier back to 1x. Throughout each song's respective charts for the instruments are special highlighted phrases; completing all the notes in this phrase, and for guitar/bass players, using the whammy bar on marked sustained notes, fills part of a Star Power meter. When this meter is at least half full, the player can activate Star Power by performing special actions on their controllers: either tilting the guitar controller upward briefly or pressing the Star Power activation button for guitar and bass; striking two pads simultaneously on the drums; and either double tapping the microphone or pressing one of <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the game console's regular controllers for vocals. When Star Power is activated, the overall band scoring multiplier is increased for a limited time until the Star Power meter is drained. After completing a song, the band is awarded a number of stars based on the overall score; in normal modes for Warriors of Rock, up to six stars can be earned; the final being achievable only through zero misses and zero extra strums.|$|E

The subject adopts the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left opens the door in question. A direct test of this hypothesis would be pressing <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left; an indirect test would be pressing <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right. The latter is still a valid test because once {{the result of the}} door's remaining closed is found, <b>the</b> left <b>button</b> is proven to be <b>the</b> desired <b>button.</b> (This example is parallel to Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin's example in the psychology classic, A Study of Thinking.) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{directing}} staff has worn uniforms of differing style to the marching band since its inception. The uniforms {{took on a}} style similar to the U.S. Navy’s double-breasted dress jacket in the 1940s and 1950s. Directing staff had two thin golden stripes running around the circumference of the cuff area of the sleeves, similar to the U.S. Navy’s ranking system stripes. Directing staff also wore two lapel lyre-shaped insignia. These were gold along with all of <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the uniforms. The directors wore the same hat as the marching band minus the plume.|$|E
25|$|Buttons and Buttonholes: the three-roll-two {{construction}} {{features a}} lapel that hides the third button, {{in order to}} provide extra freedom of movement thanks to a longer opening in the front. The buttonhole on the lapel is called “occhiello” in Italian, and it means “little eye” for its elongated almond shape. There isn’t really a tradition for a specific type of buttonhole in Naples, but there is a tendency of Neapolitan tailors to prefer slightly shorter and thicker buttonholes that resemble those of a shirt, while “regular” buttonholes of English tradition are more elongated and slender. Some tailors add a little teardrop shape {{at the end of the}} buttonhole, but that’s an aesthetic choice that does not refer to a particular tradition. For what concerns <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the sleeves, they are always working buttons, and they are always overlapping, as if they were kissing each other.|$|E

Reaction times are typically slower when the red stimulus appears on the left hand side of the screen and the participant must push <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right of their panel (incongruent trials).

25|$|A {{computer}} then instructs {{the user}} {{to go to a}} certain teletext page which has been assigned to the customer for that session. Usually the page initially contains a menu with options and the user chooses among the options using <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the telephone. When a choice has been made, the selected page is immediately broadcast and can be viewed by the user. This is in contrast with usual teletext where the customer has to wait for the selected page to be broadcast, because the pages are broadcast sequentially. This technology enables teletext to be used for games, chat, access to databases etc. It allows one to overcome the limitations on the number of available pages. On the other hand, {{only a limited number of}} users can use the service at the same time, since one page is allocated per user. Some channels solve this by taking into account where the user is geographically calling from and by broadcasting different teletext pages in different geographical regions. In that way, two different users can be assigned the same page number at the same time as long as they do not receive the TV signals from the same source. Another drawback to the technology is the privacy concerns in that many users can see what a user is doing because the interactive pages are received by all viewers. Also, the user usually has to pay for the telephone call to the TV station. For these reasons, these services have since been superseded by the World Wide Web.|$|E
500|$|The Naga Hex {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with the}} most prevalent dislike being its surface. Sean Buckley of Engadget disliked the Naga Hex because of its plastic surface and how the arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the side resulted in them feeling cramped. Brian Westover of PC Magazine said the hexagonal layout of the buttons made them easier to understand and use, but felt the placement of them was sub-par. Westover said that after using the mouse {{for long periods of}} time, the surface becomes [...] "slick". The redesigned League of Legends version of the Hex was praised by Westover.|$|E
500|$|Whedon uses several disorienting {{effects to}} heighten {{the reality of}} the {{situations}} in the episode {{to the point that they}} seem surreal. The long opening shot of Buffy coming home and finding Joyce was filmed with one hand-held camera in constant movement as she walks through the house to the phone and back to her mother again. <b>The</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> Buffy's phone are abnormally large, an effect that Whedon added because he experienced it when his mother died. Buffy is so bewildered by the paramedic telling her that Joyce is dead that she can only focus on his mouth in an attempt to understand what he is saying. The camera uses her perspective and only the bottom part of the paramedic's face is in view. Instead of a normal [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] view, Buffy is shot at the same height as the paramedic's shoulder, barely squeezed into the frame as if to portray her, according to Whedon, as trapped by reality. Kristine Sutherland stated that the script was [...] "amazing", specifically at capturing the detachment: [...] "It's not something you can process. I mean mortality is just not part of your vocabulary when you're that age." ...|$|E

500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. The rear cover is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The power button contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on the bezel (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on the bezel were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie when the phone is held. Alongside the power button, the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, and turned off by double-tapping on the status bar or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". When the phone is off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E
500|$|In the game, {{the player}} uses the {{directional}} pad to move Wonder Boy left or right, crouch down (only possible as Hu-Man or Lizard-Man), or to enter doors. <b>The</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the controller {{are used to}} attack enemies and to jump. Wonder Boy can attack with his main weapon or with secondary weapons by holding down on the directional pad and pressing the attack button. Pressing the pause button brings up the Status Screen (and pauses the game if Wonder Boy is fighting a dragon). Wonder Boy has a life meter shown {{on the top of}} the gameplay area by a series of hearts. When all hearts turn black, Wonder Boy dies and the game ends, but if he has a life potion ("medicine vial" [...] in Dragon's Curse) remaining, he will revive with some of the hearts refilled. After the game ends, the player is taken to a [...] "continue screen"; there the player has an opportunity to win a free life potion before restarting the game at the town. Players can visit the town's church to receive a password in order to continue the game at a later time. The password saves the current player's form, equipment, and amount of gold; but it does not save any secondary weapons or life potions in stock. Dragon's Curse has a [...] "file cabinet" [...] which allows players to store passwords into the game's memory.|$|E
500|$|While {{the game}} had fast-paced action {{and a high}} difficulty, its control scheme was {{designed}} to be relatively simple. This was because Sakurai had observed equivalent console games using all <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> a console's controller, creating a barrier for first-time players. To open up the game for newcomers while keeping gameplay depth, the team took the three basic controls and combined them with the game's structure. In later interviews, Sakurai said that the team had great difficulty properly incorporating the control scheme into the game. Their initial goal was to fully utilize the 3DS' processing power, which left little room for incorporation of elements such as the Circle Pad Pro, which was created fairly late in the game's own development cycle. Due to the lack of space, providing independent analogue controls for left-handed players was impossible. The inclusion of a stand for the system to help players properly experience Uprising as part of the game's package was requested by the team from an early stage. A major element of the 3DS' design that influenced development was the touch screen, used for aiming Pit's weapons. While similar touch-based aiming had been used for first-person shooters on the Nintendo DS, Sakurai was dissatisfied with the resulting experience, phrasing it as [...] "like trying to steer with oars." [...] With the 3DS' touch screen, the team was able to create a more responsive experience similar to a computer mouse, creating the system of flicking the 3DS stylus to change camera and character direction. The team also attempted to tackle the ingrained problem of trying to move the character and camera while 3D graphics were activated. The multiplayer functionality was decided upon from an early stage, with the main focus being on balancing it with the single-playing campaign. The design for weapon usage was inspired by fighter choices in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, contrasting with weapon systems from other equivalent Western shooters.|$|E

Buttons, D-pads, and rudder controls are placed directly onto either the flight stick or the throttle. Although the Flightstick 2 does not offer force feedback, it does have a vibration feature.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> {{the dress}} and service coats are {{reminiscent}} of Marine insignia prior {{to the adoption of}} the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor. The quatrefoil—the cross-shaped braid worn atop an officer's cover—is a distinguishing part of the Marine officer's uniform. The design is of French origin, and is a tradition from the pre-Civil War era when officers wore a rope cross on their caps to allow sharpshooters high in the rigging of a sailing ship to identify his allies in a battle. Enlisted Marines wear service stripes on the cuff of the dress and service coats, each stripe denoting four years of service as a Marine. The standing collar of the dress coat is reminiscent of the uniform that earned Marines the nickname [...] "Leatherneck".|$|E

Buttons with the symbol were imported into the United States in 1960 by Philip Altbach, a freshman at the University of Chicago. [...] Altbach had traveled to England to meet with British peace groups as a delegate from the Student Peace Union (SPU) and, on his return, he persuaded the SPU to adopt the symbol.

2500|$|Traditionally, manga stories {{flow from}} top to bottom and from right to left. Some {{publishers}} of translated manga keep to this original format. Other publishers mirror the pages horizontally before printing the translation, changing the reading direction to a more [...] "Western" [...] left to right, so as not to confuse foreign readers or traditional comics-consumers. This practice is known as [...] "flipping". For the most part, criticism suggests that flipping goes against the original intentions of the creator (for example, if a person wears a shirt that reads [...] "MAY" [...] on it, and gets flipped, then the word is altered to [...] "YAM"), who may be ignorant of how awkward it is to read comics when the eyes must flow through the pages and text in opposite directions, resulting in an experience that's quite distinct from reading something that flows homogeneously. If the translation is not adapted to the flipped artwork carefully enough it is also possible for the text to go against the picture, such as a person referring to something on their left in the text while pointing to their right in the graphic. Characters shown writing with their right hands, the majority of them, would become left-handed when a series is flipped. Flipping may also cause oddities with familiar asymmetrical objects or layouts, such as a car being depicted with the gas pedal on the left and the brake on the right, or a shirt with <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the wrong side, but these issues are minor when compared to the unnatural reading flow, and some of them could be solved with an adaptation work that goes beyond just translation and blind flipping.|$|E
