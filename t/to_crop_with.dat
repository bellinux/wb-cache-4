This review discusses the improvement of the nutritional status of <b>crops</b> <b>to</b> make a positive impact on global human health. Several examples of nutritionally enhanced crops which have been developed using biotechnological approaches will be discussed. These range from biofortified <b>crops</b> <b>to</b> <b>crops</b> <b>with</b> novel abilities <b>to</b> fight disease.

30|$|While corn acreage {{negatively}} {{responds to}} fertilizer price index (except safra in Brazil), it has statistically insignificant response to international {{crude oil prices}} (with an exception of Ukraine). As it is theoretically expected, high (input) fertilizer price reduces producers’ profit expectations {{and they tend to}} shift land away <b>to</b> <b>crops</b> <b>with</b> little or no fertilizer demand. In contrast, a high crude oil price has two opposite effects. On the one hand, higher oil price implies large production cost and hence its effect is expected to be negative. On the other hand, higher oil price imply larger demand for biofuel, and hence for corn, and hence its acreage effect is positive. The net effect seems to be statistically negligible in our empirical estimations, except in Ukraine where the positive demand effect outweighs.|$|R

40|$|This article {{estimates}} {{a worldwide}} aggregate supply response for key agricultural commodities— wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans—by employing a newly-developed multi-country, crop-calendar-specific, seasonally disaggregated model with price changes and price volatility applied accordingly. The findings reveal that, although higher output prices {{serve as an}} incentive <b>to</b> improve global <b>crop</b> supply as expected, output price volatility acts as a disincentive. Depending on the crop, {{the results show that}} own-price supply elasticities range from about 0. 05 to 0. 40. Output price volatility, however, has negative correlations <b>with</b> <b>crop</b> supply, implying that farm-ers shift land, other inputs, and yield-improving investments <b>to</b> <b>crops</b> <b>with</b> less volatile prices. Simulating the impact of price dynamics since 2006, we find that price risk has reduced the production response of wheat in particular—and to a lesser extent, rice—thus dampening price incentive effects. The simulation analysis shows that the increase in own-crop price volatility from 2006 – 2010 dampened yield by about 1 – 2 % for the crops under consideration.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{consequences}} of considering environmental and economic risk {{in the analysis of}} cost-effective nitrogen abatement options in crop production. A farm-level mathematical programming model incorporating nitrogen leaching variability, field time variability, yield variability, and output price variability is developed. The empirical results reveal that requiring a high reliability with respect to a desired abatement target can be extremely costly, due to the high variability of nitrogen emissions. It appears to be sufficient to reduce average nitrogen load {{in order to reduce the}} environmental risk associated with nitrogen leaching variability, since a change <b>to</b> <b>crops</b> <b>with</b> lower average load also results in lower variability of nitrogen emissions. A farmer's degree of risk aversion has some effect on the economically optimal choice of crop mix. However, it is more important to consider the utilisation of machinery and labour resources and crop rotation effects, than considering risk aversion. nitrogen abatement, risk aversion, diversification, chance constraints, discrete stochastic programming, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R
