[...] "The BBC didn't care tuppence about what they were doing, because they really don't know what they're doing, certainly not in radio... must have been pretty ill when <b>this</b> <b>nonsense</b> was going on." ...|$|E

[...] Can we please end <b>this</b> <b>nonsense</b> and get into a main storyline that isn't bad and offensive?" [...] However, he also added, [...] "so yeah, other than the faked rapes, this was a largely entertaining episode." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club was very negative towards the episode, calling it [...] "downright weird" [...] and that it [...] "veers wildly in tone". He also was critical of Hearst's plotline, saying that it was too referential to real-life events and fictional works to stand well on its own. Concluding, the reviewer wrote, [...] "The oscillations between drama and comedy, normally the show's strength, seem excessive. [...] And the rape storyline continues to be tonally difficult at best, tone-deaf at worst." ...|$|E

2500|$|Andrew Billen of The Times {{reviewed}} the show's 500th episode, {{noting that he}} had lost interest in the series following the departure of Anton Meyer (George Irving) in 2002.

2500|$|According to Dylan biographer Robert Shelton, [...] "Million Dollar Bash" [...] epitomizes {{what he sees}} as one of The Basement Tapes {{principal}} themes, joy. Griffin {{named his}} detailed book about The Basement Tapes after this song, which has a similar instrumentation to 1950s rockabilly hits. According to Griffin, [...] "Like Elvis's earliest single on Sun Records, the lack of a drummer does not prevent the assembled from swinging on <b>this</b> <b>nonsense</b> like the experienced players they are." [...] Heylin heard in this song two references to the Coasters: [...] "'Along came Jones'—a song title in itself—and 'emptied the trash'—a reference to 'Yakety Yak'." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1888 Clarke {{published}} his Manual of Orchestration described by The Musical Times as an excellent little book. [...] "As far {{as can be}} gathered, either from direct statements or implied directions, Gounod would be the model suggested for imitation, Wagner for avoidance." [...] Clarke's conservatism caused comment from other reviewers; The Musical Standard mocked him for denying that Wagner was a master of orchestration: [...] "Mr. Clarke should re-edit his work, cutting out all <b>this</b> <b>nonsense.</b> It might then form an admirable book for the beginner". [...] Clarke also wrote several other books and articles about orchestration, {{as well as some}} fiction and song lyrics.|$|E
2500|$|Kaiser Wilhelm II came {{to share}} {{the views of the}} German General Staff and {{declared}} on 4 July that he was entirely for [...] "settling accounts with Serbia". He ordered the German ambassador in Vienna, Count Heinrich von Tschirschky, to stop advising restraint, writing that [...] "Tschirschky will be so good to drop <b>this</b> <b>nonsense.</b> We must finish with the Serbs, quickly. Now or never!". In response, Tschirschky told the Austro-Hungarian government that same day that [...] "Germany would support the Monarchy through thick and thin, whatever action it decided to take against Serbia. The sooner Austria-Hungary struck, the better". On 5 July 1914, Count Moltke, the Chief of the German General Staff, wrote that [...] "Austria must beat the Serbs".|$|E
2500|$|Milligan {{also wrote}} verse, {{considered}} to be within the genre of literary nonsense. His poetry {{has been described by}} comedian Stephen Fry as [...] "absolutely immortal—greatly in the tradition of Lear." [...] One of his poems, [...] "On the Ning Nang Nong", was voted the UK's favourite comic poem in 1998 in a nationwide poll, ahead of other nonsense poets including Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. <b>This</b> <b>nonsense</b> verse, set to music, became a favourite Australia-wide, performed week after week by the ABC children's programme Playschool. Milligan included it on his album No One's Gonna Change Our World in 1969, to aid the World Wildlife Fund. In December 2007 it was reported that, according to OFSTED, it is among the ten most commonly taught poems in primary schools in the UK.|$|E

[...] Dylan approached the songwriting process differently this time than he had for the Wallflowers' two previous albums, explaining that he didn't want to avoid the subject of his personal life, as he had done in the past: [...] "(Breach) was the first record that I realized that it's necessary and I have a right to write about anything that I want to write about. [...] I'm not going to dance around these subjects anymore [...] [...] [...] I don't have any interest in writing songs that are defensive or that address anything that don't come naturally to me but I also realized that I needed to stop <b>this</b> <b>nonsense</b> of pretending that hiding any of this information counts to anybody; it just doesn't really matter anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|The biggest {{argument}} Powell and Heath {{had during}} Powell's {{time in the}} Shadow Cabinet was over a dispute {{over the role of}} Black Rod, who would go to the Commons to summon them to the Lords to hear the Royal Assent of Bills. In November 1967, Black Rod arrived during a debate on the EEC and was met with cries of [...] "Shame" [...] to [...] "'Op it". At the next Shadow Cabinet meeting Heath said this [...] "nonsense" [...] must be stopped. Powell suggested that Heath did not mean it should be ended. He asked whether Heath realised that the words Black Rod used went back to the 1307 Parliament of Carlisle and were ancient even then. Heath reacted furiously, saying that the British people [...] "were tired of <b>this</b> <b>nonsense</b> and ceremonial and mummery. He would not stand for the perpetuation of this ridiculous business etc".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} whether there was {{intentional}} homoerotic content between K/S in the show, and in particular in the episode [...] "Amok Time", Star Trek's writer D.C. Fontana replied, [...] "In answer to your question, NO — there were no homosexual double-entendres in the script — at least none that were deliberate. If some viewers chose to read that into the dialogue, etc., that's their point of view, but certainly not ours. Writer Theodore Sturgeon was trying to reveal Spock's inner human in a struggle with what his culture, his upbringing and his half-human/half-Vulcan heritage had instilled in him about emotion and controlling it in an out-of-control situation. It also was a peek into the Vulcan culture {{that no one had}} seen before. That's ALL we were doing. I've heard <b>this</b> <b>nonsense</b> (especially about Kirk/Spock) for years. There is no basis to it. I hope this answer is helpful to you" ...|$|E

2500|$|The word gained {{currency}} {{with the}} overly literal interpretations of Wagner's music by Hans von Wolzogen, who in 1876 published a Leitfaden (guide or manual) to the Ring. In it {{he claimed to}} have isolated and named all of the recurring motifs in the cycle (the motif of [...] "Servitude", the [...] "Spear" [...] or [...] "Treaty" [...] motif, etc.), often leading to absurdities or contradictions with Wagner's actual practice. Some of the motifs he identified began to appear in the published musical scores of the operas, arousing Wagner's annoyance; his wife Cosima Wagner quoted him as saying [...] "People will think all <b>this</b> <b>nonsense</b> is done at my request!". In fact Wagner himself never publicly named any of his leitmotifs, [...] preferring to emphasise their flexibility of association, role in the musical form, and emotional effect. The practice of naming leitmotifs nevertheless continued, featuring in the work of prominent Wagnerian critics Ernest Newman, Deryck Cooke and Robert Donington.|$|E
2500|$|The era of Industrial Revolution weaving {{machinery}} {{gave rise}} to technological jargon {{in places such as}} Yorkshire with a strong local dialect. [...] The resultant inscrutability of linguistic terms has given rise to such jokes as the one from Monty Python's Trouble at Mill sketch: One on't cross beams gone owt askew on treadle. <b>This</b> <b>nonsense</b> may have been written so on the script as a joke, but what Graham Chapman could have said correctly in dialect is, [...] "One o't crossbeams 'as gone out o' skew on't treadle", meaning [...] "One of the crossbeams has gone askew on the treadle". The treadle was a rocking pedal, powered by the worker's foot. [...] The treadle in turn powered a reciprocating beam, and the power from that was transferred to the machinery. On a loom, these reciprocating beams were called lams, and were connected with the treadles by strings which were also connected with jacks to work the yelds. [...] In big factories, power could be transferred from one large drive wheel to another across a wide room via a reciprocating beam, called in that situation a crossbeam. Out of skew is a dialect expression meaning in incorrect position. Whether a foot-driven treadle could power a mighty crossbeam is a moot point, and may be a joke in itself, but the explanation of the above phrase and its humour is tightly connected with the mechanism of the weaving machinery described below.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Nutting {{recalled}} that Eden told him, [...] "What's all <b>this</b> <b>nonsense</b> about isolating Nasser or 'neutralising' him {{as you call}} it? I want him destroyed, can't you understand? I want him murdered, and if you and the Foreign Office don't agree, then you'd better come to the cabinet and explain why." [...] When Nutting pointed out {{that they had no}} alternative government to replace Nasser, Eden apparently replied, [...] "I don't give a damn if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt." [...] At a private meeting at Downing Street on 16 October 1956 Eden showed several ministers a plan, submitted two days earlier by the French. Israel would invade Egypt, Britain and France would give an ultimatum telling both sides to stop and, when one refused, send in forces to enforce the ultimatum, separate the two sides – and occupy the Canal and get rid of Nasser. When Nutting suggested the Americans should be consulted Eden replied, [...] "I will not bring the Americans into this ... Dulles has done enough damage as it is. This {{has nothing to do with}} the Americans. We and the French must decide what to do and we alone." [...] Eden openly admitted his view of the crisis was shaped by his experiences in the two world wars, writing, [...] "We are all marked to some extent by the stamp of our generation, mine is that of the assassination in Sarajevo and all that flowed from it. It is impossible to read the record now and not feel that we had a responsibility for always being a lap behind ... Always a lap behind, a fatal lap." ...|$|E

2500|$|In response, {{the firm}} {{responsible}} for the device, EMP Pad Limited, said it {{did not agree with}} his claim [...] "in any way, shape or form", and that they had not paid him in relation to it. While EMP Pad Limited said it did not pay Edmonds to promote the product, the company's owner Maria Robertson, previously worked as an assistant to the TV presenter and acknowledged having known Edmonds for 25 years and having worked with him and his daughter. Cancer Research UK produced an article to reassure the public that [...] "the best studies looking at this topic have failed to show a link between emotional stress and an increased risk of cancer" [...] and that [...] "no reliable evidence has ever been produced that Rife machines – or any similar devices producing low-frequency electromagnetic pulses – have any benefit for cancer patients. Nor have organisations that scrutinise new treatments and devices (like the US Food and Drug Authority or the European Medicines Agency) approved any as a therapy for any type of disease". Dr David Grimes, a cancer researcher at Oxford University, told ‘This Morning’: [...] "It’s not just untrue, it’s patronising and victim blaming, cancer is bad luck... the healthiest people in the world get cancer and it’s not because they are negative". Prof. John Gribben, Chair of Medical Oncology at Queen Mary University of London, said: “This is complete gibberish and undermines all the good work everyone does with evidence-based medicine and targeted approaches". Prof. Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor at the University Of Exeter said “The reason why most of us put ‘negative energy’ in inverted commas is simple: it is a pure figment of the imagination of fantasists. That would not be so bad except that, as we see, some VIPs seem to take <b>this</b> <b>nonsense</b> seriously. The result might be that some desperate patients believe them, and choose the nonsense over the best that real medicine has to offer. And that could hasten deaths.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its {{theatrical}} {{release in}} the United States, critics generally responded with enthusiasm to Bava's film, {{many of whom}} recognized the director as a potential master of the horror genre. Variety noted, [...] "There is sufficient cinematography ingenuity and production flair [...] to keep an audience pleasantly unnerved." [...] Time said the film was [...] "a piece of fine Italian handiwork that atones for its ludicrous lapses with brilliant intuitions of the spectral." [...] The Motion Picture Herald stated that [...] "A classic quality permeates this gruesome, shocking, horrifying story of a vengeful, bloodthirsty vampire." [...] Castle of Frankenstein described the film as [...] "one of the best horror thrillers of recent years." [...] David Pirie, in The Time Out Film Guide, called the movie, [...] "A classic horror film [...] The exquisitely realized expressionist images of cruelty and sexual suggestion shocked audiences in the early '60s and occasioned a long-standing ban by the British censor. The visual style still impresses..." [...] Carlos Clarens felt that [...] "the quality of the visual narrative was superb—the best black-and-white photography to enhance a horror movie {{in the past two}} decades. Bava also showed himself as a director of a certain promise..." [...] Eugene Archer in The New York Times, however, hated the film, noting that [...] "Barbara Steele, a blank-eyed manikin with an earthbound figure and a voice from outer space, is appropriately cast as a vampire: not the Theda Bara kind, but the genuine blood-drinking variety. Mario Bava, ostensibly the director of <b>this</b> <b>nonsense,</b> allows this female Bela Lugosi to quench her thirst four times before she burns, screaming, at the stake [...] As a setting for unadulterated horror, it will leave its audiences yearning for that quiet, sunny little motel in Psycho." [...] Ivan Butler opined that the film [...] "appears to offer horror, beauty and the ludicrous in about equal proportions." ...|$|E
