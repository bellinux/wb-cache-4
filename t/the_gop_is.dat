25|$|The Iowa Caucuses are {{the kickoff}} for the {{national}} presidential selection process. Iowa holds a powerful position in that process because it {{can serve as a}} sounding board for the strength of a candidate's campaign. A win in the Iowa Caucuses can validate a candidate or propel them from relative obscurity. In particular the Iowa Republican Caucuses hold the most power when either <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>is</b> not the party in the presidency or an incumbent is not on the ballot. As Iowa is the first state to cast its votes on the nominee the media often focus heavily on opinion polls from the state to determine which way Republican voters are leaning.|$|E

Maen Achwyfan Cross is a carved 10th century wheel cross depicting Celtic and Viking symbols. The castles of Rhuddlan and Flint [...] were built by the Normans during their invasion of North Wales and Castell Dinas Brân was a Welsh fortress of the same period. St Asaph Cathedral also dates from the thirteenth century as does the medieval Cistercian abbey of Valle Crucis.|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{response}} to the controversies was negative, and some commentators blamed them for Republican losses during the election. Republican political consultant and policy advisor Karl Rove wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, [...] "Offensive comments about rape by [...] Senate candidates in Missouri and Indiana gave the media an excuse to put social issues at the election's center {{in a way that}} badly hurt the entire party, as well as costing Republicans two Senate seats." [...] The comments from otherwise low-profile candidates may have cost Mitt Romney the election and reinforced some voters' concerns that <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>is</b> out of touch with women. They also were credited with helping President Obama win the women's vote at the 2012 presidential election.|$|E

2500|$|The {{growth of}} {{conservatism}} within the Republican Party attracted white conservative Southern Democrats in presidential elections. A few big names {{switched to the}} GOP, including South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond in 1964 and Texas Governor John Connally in 1973. Starting in 1968, in the South the GOP dominated most presidential elections (1976 was the lone exception), but not until the 1990s did the GOP become dominant {{in state and local}} politics in the region. Through the Southern strategy, Republicans built their strength among Southern Baptists and other religious Fundamentalists, white social conservatives, middle-class suburbs, migrants from the North, and Cubans in Florida. Meanwhile, starting in 1964, African American voters in the South began to show overwhelming support for the Democratic Party at both the presidential and local levels. They elected a number of congressmen and mayors. In 1990 there were still many moderate white Democrats holding office in the South, but when they retired they were typically replaced by much more conservative Republicans or by liberal blacks. In the 21st century, political scientists point to the strong base of social conservatism in the South. The evangelical Protestants, comprising the [...] "Religious Right", have since the 1980s strongly influenced the vote in Republican primaries, for [...] "it is primarily in the South where the evangelical core of <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>is</b> strongest." ...|$|E

[...] Peggy Noonan expressed concern that after winning the nomination in 2012 [...] "and <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> <b>is</b> fully behind him, he will begin baying at the moon." ...|$|E

However, he lost his bid for an eighth term in the 59th District House seat to fellow Republican Eddie J. Lambert, an attorney from Gonzales. For several months, Diez was the 51st Republican state representative, but his term soon ended. In 2011, the Louisiana Republican Party , after a number of other defections by former Democratic members, won a majority of state House seats {{for the first time since}} Reconstruction.|$|E

5000|$|District 37 is Democratic in {{part because}} it is 37 percent African American in voter registration. There are also unionized plant workers, sugar cane farmers, and {{government}} employees.
