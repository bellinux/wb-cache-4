5|$|Prior to the 1993 season, the Jets {{obtained}} Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason, who {{had worked}} with Coslet in Cincinnati. Steinberg signed veteran safety Ronnie Lott to shore up the defense. O'Brien's career with the Jets ended with an offseason trade to the Green Bay Packers, and running back Freeman McNeil retired after twelve seasons. The Jets suffered another December collapse: they lost four of their last five to finish 8–8. The Jets would have made the playoffs by winning their last game, but were shut out at <b>the</b> <b>Astrodome</b> by the Oilers. Following the season, Steinberg fired Coslet and replaced him with defensive coordinator Pete Carroll.|$|E

5|$|Upon their arrival, {{many were}} in disbelief that the Rockets could thrive in Houston. They {{were coming to}} a city {{that did not have}} a {{suitable}} arena, and had not shown much interest in professional basketball. Houston was previously home to the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association for only two seasons between 1967 and 1969, where the average attendance was only 200. The city's largest indoor arena was 34-year-old Sam Houston Coliseum, but the Rockets quickly ruled out playing there even on a temporary basis. As the team owners planned out on building a proper arena, the Rockets were forced to play most of their games at the University of Houston's Hofheinz Pavilion, while playing occasional games at <b>the</b> <b>Astrodome</b> and San Antonio's HemisFair Arena.|$|E
5|$|Only three pitchers, Lefty Grove, Warren Spahn, and Early Wynn, {{joined the}} 300win club between 1924 and 1982, {{which may be}} {{explained}} by a number of factors: the abolition of the spitball, World WarII military service, such as Bob Feller's, and the growing importance of the home run in the game. As the home run became commonplace, the physical and mental demands on pitchers dramatically increased, which led to the use of a four-man starting rotation. Between 1982 and 1990, the 300win club gained six members: Gaylord Perry, Phil Niekro, Steve Carlton, Nolan Ryan, Don Sutton and Tom Seaver. These pitchers benefited from the increased use of specialized relief pitchers, an expanded strike zone, and new stadiums, including Shea Stadium, Dodger Stadium and <b>the</b> <b>Astrodome,</b> that were pitcher's parks, which suppressed offensive production. Also, the increasing sophistication of training methods and sports medicine, such as Tommy John surgery, allowed players to maintain a high competitive level for a longer time. Randy Johnson, for example, won more games in his 40s than he did in his 20s.|$|E

5000|$|Originally {{named the}} ASISU Minidome, it opened [...] in 1970 {{at the north}} end of the ISU campus. Holt Arena is the oldest {{enclosed}} stadium on a college campus in the United States and the second-oldest overall. Only <b>the</b> Houston <b>Astrodome,</b> completed in 1965, predates it. Since <b>the</b> <b>Astrodome's</b> 2006 closure Holt Arena has been the oldest enclosed stadium in use. The original artificial turf installed in 1970 was Poly-Turf. The venue was renamed in 1988 to honor Milton W. [...] "Dubby" [...] Holt (1914-2007), ISU's athletic director from 1967 to 1989.|$|R
25|$|After {{years at}} <b>the</b> {{outdated}} <b>Astrodome,</b> <b>the</b> Astros moved into their new stadium in 2000. Originally called Enron Field, the stadium {{was one of}} the first to feature a functional retractable roof, considered a necessity in Houston. Additionally the ballpark featured more intimate surroundings than <b>the</b> cavernous <b>Astrodome.</b> It is believed by some that the departure of the NFL's Houston Oilers, after Houston refused to build them a new stadium, contributed to the construction of Enron Field.|$|R

25|$|The park's {{original}} layout {{was created}} by Hollywood designer and architect, Randall Duell. The park name, {{as well as the}} names of <b>The</b> <b>Astrodome,</b> the Astros baseball team, and all other Astrodomain properties, were a homage to the nation's manned space programs after Houston was selected to be the home of the Johnson Space Center in 1965.|$|E

This leads to the large chamber, <b>the</b> <b>Astrodome,</b> which houses a large colony of bats.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps most significantly, {{with its}} short left field fence (only {{slightly}} longer to left field than Fenway Park), overall shorter dimensions, {{and exposure to}} the elements, including the humid Texas air, Enron Field played like a hitters' park. This was a dramatic difference from <b>the</b> <b>Astrodome,</b> which {{was considered to be}} an extreme pitchers' park. In a challenge to home run hitters, owner Drayton McLane's office windows, located in the old Union Station above left field, are made of glass and marked as 442' from home plate.|$|E

25|$|Orbit is {{the name}} given to MLB's Houston Astros mascot, a lime-green {{outer-space}} creature wearing an Astros jersey with antennae extending into baseballs. Orbit was the team's official mascot from the 1990 through the 1999 seasons until the 2000 season, where Junction Jack was introduced as the team's mascot with the move from <b>the</b> <b>Astrodome</b> to then Enron Field. Orbit returned on November 2, 2012 at the unveiling of the Astros new look for their 2013 debut in the American League.

25|$|With the $38 million {{deficit of}} <b>the</b> <b>Astrodome,</b> {{control of the}} Astrodomain was passed from Judge Roy Hofheinz to GE Credit and Ford Motor Credit.
