5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> foreign alliances.

In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
