5|$|Current {{practice}} {{involves a}} celebrity turning <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> on in mid- to late-November, and they remain lit until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 {{due to the}} assassination of John F. Kennedy and in 1989 to fit Kylie Minogue's touring commitments. In 2015, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> were switched on earlier, on Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> go out. However, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> went out before he {{had the chance to}} do so, and as a result <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E

5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the {{scenarios}} for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios {{are available in}} {{what is called the}} School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of Clannad, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> was simplified and made less intrusive.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lighting</b> Programmer, is {{a person}} {{familiar}} with <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> board being used who sits next to or in communication with <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> designer during [...] "tech". He or she is responsible for programming in <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> cues as dictated {{to him or her}} by <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> designer. This saves the designer the time and attention of using <b>the</b> <b>light</b> board and allows him or her to concentrate on building the cues.

5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> were kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E
5|$|Every Christmas, Oxford Street is {{decorated}} with festive lights. The tradition of Christmas lights began in 1959, {{five years after the}} neighbouring Regent Street.

50|$|Three {{years after}} {{improvements}} to the keeper's house were made in 1890, the bridge to <b>the</b> <b>light</b> was destroyed by a storm. Rather than rebuild it, the headlight {{was moved to the}} exterior of <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> and <b>the</b> keeper took up residence in <b>the</b> <b>light</b> itself. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> was electrified and automated in 1929. Although there are some claims that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> was rebuilt in 1938, this is believed to be a misunderstanding based on discrepancies in the reported height of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> over <b>the</b> years.|$|R

5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of {{scissors}} {{and for the first time}} removes the child's swaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and white noise crescendo.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E

50|$|Before modern strobe lights, lenses {{were used}} to {{concentrate}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> from a continuous source. Vertical <b>light</b> rays of <b>the</b> lamp are redirected into a horizontal plane, and horizontally <b>the</b> <b>light</b> is focused into {{one or a few}} directions at a time, with <b>the</b> <b>light</b> beam swept around. As a result, in addition to seeing the side of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> beam, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> is directly visible from greater distances, and with an identifying light characteristic.|$|R
50|$|Constructed in 1864 from cast iron, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> {{was first}} lit on 1 January 1865. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> was first {{automated}} in 1925 and used an acetylene burning revolving light. Keepers returned to <b>the</b> <b>light</b> in 1947 and it remained manned until 1984 when <b>the</b> <b>light</b> was fully automated. <b>The</b> <b>light's</b> last keeper, Ray Walter, {{remained on the}} island working with his wife Barbara as Department of Conservation rangers until their retirement in 2006.|$|R
5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E
5|$|Andrew's sketch {{leads to}} the {{identification}} of the kidnapper as Joanne Ostler (Gillian Jacobs), a MIT neurologist who was previously believed deceased. Joanne tricks Ben into helping her complete an unfinished equation by using the image of his mother, who died in the car accident. Meanwhile, Walter suddenly remembers that he heard about <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> from former mathematician Dashiell Kim (Randall Duk Kim), an old bunkmate at St. Claire's Hospital who disappeared under similar circumstances. To discover the child's whereabouts, Olivia encourages Walter to return to St. Claire's. The visit does not go well, and Walter is held by hospital administrator Dr. Bruce Sumner (William Sadler), who remains unconvinced of Walter's sanity.|$|E
5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent lucite, allowing the audience to move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included one with tentacles, one with bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main idea was to create an immersive rave experience with <b>the</b> <b>lights.</b> They were also designed to accommodate minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E
50|$|This {{light was}} erected in 1855 {{to mark the}} western edge of the channel. Ice damaged <b>the</b> <b>light</b> in <b>the</b> {{following}} year, and again in 1867; in the latter case <b>the</b> <b>light</b> had to be rebuilt completely, at which time <b>the</b> <b>light</b> was upgraded to a sixth-order Fresnel from <b>the</b> previous masthead <b>light.</b> During <b>the</b> Civil War <b>the</b> <b>light</b> was extinguished by confederate forces; relit in 1862, the Lighthouse Board reconsidered and removed <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> apparatus to Fort Monroe for safekeeping.|$|R

5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were made. A new LED lighting package, {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel. Towers with LED graphics and a new sound and light system were installed along the main midway from the front gate to Corkscrew. Gobo patterns are projected from the towers onto the midway and buildings. More than one million lights, including <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> on the stage, rides and buildings were added. Chauvet Professional supplied 700 lights for Luminosity. They also added 36 wash lights {{to the base of}} Millennium Force and 16 lights to the base and top of Power Tower.|$|E
5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope.

Both Finn and Jake are terrified that Marceline will kill them and drink their blood, but she reveals that she has no intentions of killing them, noting that she really only eats the color red. However, she explains that the tree house used to belong to her, and she promptly evicts them from their residence.|$|E
