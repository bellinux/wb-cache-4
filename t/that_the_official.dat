5|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory to}} the corpse's identity was {{suggested in the}} history The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004). This suggested that in March 1943 {{there was an explosion}} on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion, and observes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> records of the operation state that Michael was the body.|$|E

Together with further funds collected via PayPal, its budget rose to $4,163,208. In December 2013, Obsidian announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> title for the game would be Pillars of Eternity, dropping the working title Project Eternity. They also launched a poll asking backers whether or not they would support further fundraising.|$|E

50|$|Prince Heng's advisors {{were mostly}} suspicious. They, {{apparently}} feeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> massacre of the Lü clan was without cause, were concerned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> in fact had intended on making Prince Heng a puppet and {{were ready to}} take over themselves. However, one of those advisors, Song Chang (宋昌), had a different opinion. He believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people were supportive of the Han dynasty and would not tolerate a takeover; and that given {{that there were many}} other principalities outside <b>the</b> capital, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>officials,</b> even if they had wanted, would be unable to usurp imperial power. Still hesitant, Prince Heng sent his uncle Bo Zhao (薄昭) to Xi'an to meet with Zhou, who guaranteed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>officials</b> were sincere. Bo believed them and urged Prince Heng to accept the offer.|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{who work on}} cases called X-Files, which {{are linked to the}} paranormal.

Meanwhile, Mulder meets a ufologist who he believes may be a former abductee.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to Guderian, von Kleist, his {{immediate}} superior, had contacted Loerzer and banned Guderian's proposed long systematic approach {{in favour of}} one big assault. Guderian complained.

Loerzer would later say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> order from Hugo Sperrle had arrived too late to make changes.|$|E
5|$|During July 1914, Australia {{and other}} {{units of the}} RAN fleet were on a {{training}} cruise in Queensland waters. On 27 July, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board learned through press telegrams that the British Admiralty thought {{that there would be}} imminent and widespread war in Europe following the July Crisis, and had begun to position its fleets as a precaution.

5|$|Final reports {{indicate}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> death toll, {{according to the}} Louisiana Department of Health, was 1,464 people. The first deaths were reported shortly before midnight on August 28, 2005, as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to Baton Rouge. On September 4, Mayor Nagin speculated that the death toll could rise as high as ten thousand after the clean-up was completed. Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections, especially in {{the east of the}} city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} he did not believe the wording of the 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, the City {{announced}} that its official annual Christmas tree lighting, {{which had been}} held at Daley Center since 1966 (except for 1982), would {{be held at the}} park in order <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> Christmas tree of the city could be closer to ice skating at McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink, the annual Christmas caroling at Cloud Gate and to the new offerings of the nearby Maggie Daley Park. The annual lighting will occur near Michigan Avenue and Washington Street. Some parties opposed the move that separated the annual tree from the Christkindlmarket and the Chicago Picasso. The city's first official tree lighting by Mayor Carter Harrison, Jr. in 1913 had been held in Grant Park on Michigan Avenue two blocks south of the new location.|$|E

5|$|On 12 January 2016, Alton Towers {{announced}} that Air would be re-themed as Galactica for the 2016 season and would include on-ride virtual reality headsets simulating a {{ride through the}} cosmos. The announcement was made at an event held at the Science Museum. Each seat on the roller coaster is fitted with a Samsung Gear VR headset and pouch. The virtual reality experience is optional, as guests can choose to ride without using the headsets. A promotional website was also released explaining {{more information about the}} ride and its new storyline.

5|$|The company bought five bogie trams. They {{had pointed}} ends to ease meeting the shorter trams in the city, {{and had a}} low-floor center section, with {{internal}} steps. The body and mechanical equipment was built by Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk, while the electrical components were built by Siemens-Schuckertwerke. Capacity was for 40 or 38 seated passengers. In early 1917, Barth was replaced by H. A. Mørk as director. Trial runs of the tramway started on 11 June 1917. It was retrospectively decided by the ministry <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> opening date was 1 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} {{baseball}} require <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> scorer view the game {{only from the}} press box, for two basic reasons. First, this ensures that every scorer has nearly the same perspective of the game. One of the intentions of this rule is to improve consistency in scorekeeping decisions between different official scorers working on different games at the same stadium, and between scorers in different stadiums. Second, the press box is the most neutral position within the stadium. Seated in the press box, the official scorer is surrounded by writers and broadcasters who are ostensibly neutral, and the scorer {{is less likely to}} be unduly influenced by the players, the coaches, and the crowd.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in around 125 prints in the overseas markets, grossing a total of $8.9 million {{at the end of}} its theatrical run. It performed very well in the United Kingdom, with a gross of $689,000 in its opening weekend. It thus debuted at the third position at the British box-office. The total earnings of the film reached over $3.2 million in the UK. The film also had the biggest opening ever for a Bollywood film in North America, with a gross of $1.1 million in 73 screens. However, according to a report by Rediff, the numbers were so high <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> reporting agency did not believe it, and asked for evidence that could not be furnished until after the reporting deadline had passed. If reported on time, the film would have opened at the number 10 spot in the North American box-office. However, according to figures from Box Office Mojo, the film debuted at the 32nd place at the American box office during the week of 4 January 2002. It eventually gathered a total of $2.9 million there. Additionally, in 2003, the film became the first from India to be given a theatrical release in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The three {{language}} formula was {{not strictly}} enforced either in South or Hindi-speaking areas. The changes to public services exams were impractical and not well received by government officials. The only real concession {{to the south}} was the assurance <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Official</b> Languages Act would be modified. However, any effort {{to follow through with}} that pledge received stiff resistance. In April 1965, a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee comprising Gulzari lal Nanda, A. K. Sen, Satyanarayan Sinha, Mahavir Tyagi, M. C. Chagla and S. K. Patil and but no southern members debated the issue and could not come to any agreement. The sub-committee recommended the continuation of English and Hindi as joint link languages and was not in favour of either quota system or use of regional languages in public services exams. They drafted an amendment to Official Languages Act incorporating Nehru's assurances explicitly. This Bill guaranteeing the use of English in inter-state and state-Union communications as long as desired by Non-Hindi states was approved for discussion by the Speaker on 25 August. But it was withdrawn after a bitter debate citing inopportune time due to the ongoing Punjabi Suba movement and Kashmir crisis at that time.|$|E
5|$|Two expeditions between 1860 and 1869 by Charles Francis Hall, {{who lived}} among the Inuit near Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island and later at Repulse Bay on the Canadian mainland, found camps, graves, and relics on the {{southern}} coast of King William Island, {{but none of the}} Franklin expedition survivors he believed would be found among the Inuit. Though he concluded that all of the Franklin crew were dead, he believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> expedition records would yet be found under a stone cairn. With the assistance of his guides Ebierbing and Tookoolito, Hall gathered hundreds of pages of Inuit testimony. Among these materials are accounts of visits to Franklin's ships, and an encounter with a party of white men {{on the southern}} coast of King William Island near Washington Bay. In the 1990s, this testimony was extensively researched by David C. Woodman, and was the basis of two books, Unravelling the Franklin Mystery (1992) and Strangers Among Us (1995), in which he reconstructs the final months of the expedition.|$|E
