5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> and dried during winter.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, 2005, {{the park}} officially {{announced}} Goliath, a $20,000,000 steel Hyper Coaster. By {{the end of}} the 2005 season, the rides Great Gasp and Looping Starship were closed and removed from the park {{to make room for the}} new roller coaster. Foundations for Goliath's supports began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> in September 2005. In early October, track began to arrive at the park; erection of the supports and track began soon after. In November and December, construction on the lift hill was complete. In March 2006, Goliath's trains were delivered to the park. After construction on the track and testing was complete, the roller coaster opened to the public on April 1, 2006.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a popular}} myth that {{so-called}} murder-holes– openings in {{the ceiling of the}} gateway passage– were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E

5|$|Many {{attempted}} {{methods of}} eradicating meat ants have proven unsuccessful. The first investigations {{were made in}} the 1930s to control meat ant populations in urban areas by fumigation, using carbon disulfide and calcium cyanide. Although these methods successfully eradicated some nests, they were rapidly reoccupied by those living in satellite or rival nests. However, the reoccupation of these nests by incipient colonies (young colonies beginning to develop) does not occur. This is because colony founding is often difficult and rare when most areas are nested by mature colonies. This behaviour has led to long-term maintenance and repeated treatments to ensure the nests are not resettled. In addition, not all nests can be treated, and some may remain undetected from pest controllers. In 1973, Greaves notes that the poor penetration of insecticides into all nest galleries may be the reason why nests are reoccupied, but owing to the nest structure, the insecticides have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> into each individual hole as no gallery connects to one another. Missing a single gallery can mostly lead to the reoccupation of the nest site. Greaves concludes that dieldrin is the most effective insecticide to control meat ants, capable of killing the ants quickly and being the most long-lasting chemical used.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the Dunstan Government {{stepped up}} its {{legislative}} efforts. Some bills, {{such as the one}} to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage {{for the first time in}} Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.|$|E
25|$|Soy sauce (shōyu) is {{not usually}} poured over most foods at the table; a dipping dish is usually provided. Soy sauce is, however, meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> {{directly}} onto tōfu and grated daikon dishes, and in the raw egg when preparing tamago kake gohan ("egg on rice"). In particular, soy sauce should never be poured onto rice or into soup.|$|E

25|$|In making injera, teff flour {{is mixed}} with water and allowed to ferment for several days, as with sourdough starter. As {{a result of this}} process, injera has a mildly sour taste. The injera is then ready to be baked into large, flat pancakes. Unusual for a yeast or sourdough bread, the dough's {{viscosity}} allows it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> onto the baking surface, rather than rolled out.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{structural}} concrete differs from Roman concrete in two important details. First, its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> into forms rather than requiring hand-layering {{together with the}} placement of aggregate, which, in Roman practice, often consisted of rubble. Second, integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension, whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon {{the strength of the}} concrete bonding to resist tension.|$|E
25|$|Most stores stock {{imperial}} sizes: 1 pint (568mL), 2 pints (1.136L), 4 pints (2.273L), 6 pints (3.408L) or {{a combination}} including both metric and imperial sizes. Glass milk bottles delivered to the doorstep by the milkman are typically pint-sized and are returned empty by the householder for repeated reuse. Milk is sold at supermarkets in either aseptic cartons or HDPE bottles. Supermarkets have also now begun to introduce milk in bags, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> from a proprietary jug and nozzle.|$|E

25|$|Bradmore {{instructed}} honey <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> {{into the}} wound and invented {{an instrument to}} be used in the extraction. Two threaded tongs held a centre threaded tong, which could be inserted into the wound: the shape not unlike a corkscrew inside a split cylinder. The centre rod, once it located the shaft of the arrowhead, could be inserted into the socket and it, along with the device could be extracted. The instrument was quickly made, either by Bradmore or by a blacksmith to Bradmore's specifications. Bradmore himself guided it into the wound to extract the arrowhead successfully. The wound was then filled with alcohol (wine) to cleanse it.|$|E
25|$|Long-distance {{electromagnetic}} telegraph {{systems from}} 1820 onwards used {{two or more}} wires to carry the signal and return currents. It was then discovered, probably by the German scientist Carl August Steinheil in 1836–1837, that the ground {{could be used as}} the return path to complete the circuit, making the return wire unnecessary. However, there were problems with this system, exemplified by the transcontinental telegraph line constructed in 1861 by the Western Union Company between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. During dry weather, the ground connection often developed a high resistance, requiring water <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> on the ground rod to enable the telegraph to work or phones to ring.|$|E
25|$|Although {{drilling}} finished on 9 October 2010, Laurence Golborne, Chilean Minister of Mining, {{announced that}} the rescue operation was not expected to begin before 12 October due to the complex preparatory work required on both the escape shaft and the extraction system site. These tasks included a borehole inspection {{to determine how much}} of the shaft needed casing to prevent rockfalls from jamming the escape capsule. Depending on the shaft casing requirement, installation of the requisite steel pipes could take up to 96 hours. After that, a large concrete platform for the winching rig to raise and lower the capsule had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> while the winching rig required assembly. Finally, thorough testing of the capsule and winching system together was required.|$|E

25|$|Such {{a stance}} of {{dividing}} blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> {{out onto the}} ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid per se is not the real issue. They say the real issue is respect and obedience regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} the pretannin tea without requiring it all <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> into cups, a second teapot may be used. The steeping pot is best unglazed earthenware; Yixing pots {{are the best}} known of these, famed for the high-quality clay from which they are made. The serving pot is generally porcelain, which retains the heat better. Larger teapots are a post-19th century invention, as tea before this time was very rare and very expensive. Experienced tea-drinkers often insist the tea should not be stirred around while it is steeping (sometimes called winding or mashing in the UK). This, they say, will do little to strengthen the tea, but is likely to bring the tannins out {{in the same way that}} brewing too long will do. For the same reason, one should not squeeze the last drops out of a teabag; if stronger tea is desired, more tea leaves should be used.|$|E
25|$|Manila Film Center: A major {{component}} of the Cultural Center of the Philippines, the facility {{was the site of}} a construction accident in 1981. When construction of the building was rushed for a film festival, the ceiling scaffolding collapsed, killing several workmen. Rather than halt construction to rescue survivors and retrieve the bodies of the dead workmen, First Lady Imelda Marcos, the main financier of the project, was believed to have ordered cement <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> into the orchestra, entombing the fallen workmen, some of whom were even buried alive. Various ghostly activities have been reported, including mysterious sounds, voices and poltergeist activity. In the late 1990s, a group called the Spirit Questors began to make visits to the film center, in an attempt to contact and appease the souls of the workmen who were killed in the building. Some of these spirits claimed to have moved on, but a few allegedly remain. The facility, formerly abandoned due to its reputation, is now in use after restoration works.|$|E

50|$|Foamed {{concrete}} mixture may <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> or {{pumped into}} moulds, or directly into structural elements. The foam enables the slurry to flow freely {{due to the}} thixotropic behaviour of the foam bubbles, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easily <b>poured</b> into the chosen form or mould. The viscous material requires up to 24 hours to solidify (or as little as two hours if steam cured with temperatures up to 70 °C to accelerate the process.), depending on variables including ambient temperature and humidity. Once solidified, the formed produce may be released from its mould.|$|R
500|$|Himeji Castle {{contains}} advanced defensive {{systems from}} the feudal period. [...] {{in the shape}} of circles, triangles, squares, and rectangles are located throughout Himeji Castle, intended to allow defenders armed with tanegashima or archers to fire on attackers without exposing themselves. Roughly 1,000 loopholes exist in the castle buildings remaining today. Angled chutes called [...] were also set at numerous points in the castle walls, enabling stones or boiling oil <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> on the heads of attackers passing by underneath, and white plaster was used in the castle's construction for its resistance to fire.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{started after}} the 1993 {{season with the}} site {{clearing}} of the Mill Race log flume water ride. The Midway Carousel and Calypso were relocated in October {{to other areas of}} the park to make room for Raptor. Footers also began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> that month. The lift hill was topped off in December with track construction continuing through January 1994. The first trains were tested about two months later in March. Final preparations were made in March with the entrance plaza being built and [...] of midway replaced. Media day was held on May 6 before the ride opened to the public the next day for the first time. The ride was originally painted with dark green supports, bright green track and unpainted rails. It was repainted for the 2002 season and the rails were painted dark green, matching the supports.|$|E
500|$|The {{contract}} {{called for}} the complete construction of the bridge, including the approaches {{on each side of}} the river and four piers with each consisting of two cylindrical columns of reinforced concrete. Construction of the bridge was complicated by the contract which stipulated that concrete had to be pumped dry, the concrete of each cylinder had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>poured</b> in [...] "one continuous operation" [...] and that the wooden piles for the pier must project at least six feet into the concrete base. These stipulations required the use of a cofferdam to deposit the concrete, but boring in the river showed that it did not have a suitable bottom upon which to build. Tompkins would have to construct a [...] thick artificial bottom in order to proceed. To deposit in accordance with the contract, a tremie would be needed. A tremie is a pipe that concrete is passed through so it doesn't contact the water and disintegrate.|$|E
