5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} <b>the</b> <b>ascent.</b> Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> rate is slower, then the whole of <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E
5|$|A PDIS {{is not a}} {{mandatory}} stop, nor is it considered {{a substitute for the}} more important shallow safety stop on a no-stop dive. Switching breathing gas mix during <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> will influence the depth of the stop.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after launch and during <b>the</b> <b>ascent,</b> flight systems reported {{problems with a}} hydrogen tank transducer and a circuit breaker; the crew was immediately advised to disregard the resultant alarms and continue to orbit.|$|E

5|$|The Recognitions of Clement {{contains}} a source document (Rec. 1.27–71), conventionally {{referred to by}} scholars as <b>the</b> <b>Ascents</b> of James, which {{is believed to be}} of Jewish–Christian origin. <b>The</b> <b>Ascents</b> shares a similarity to the Gospel of the Ebionites with regard to the baptism of the Pharisees by John (Pan. 30.13.4; Rec. 1.54.6–7) and the command to abolish the Jewish sacrifices, adding that a Christian water baptism is to be substituted for the remission of sins. Based on these similarities, scholars Richard Bauckham and F. Stanley Jones have postulated a direct dependence of <b>the</b> <b>Ascents</b> of James on the Gospel of the Ebionites.|$|R
50|$|The Zurbriggen Ridge on Aoraki/Mount Cook in New Zealand {{is named}} after him. On 14 March 1895, Zurbriggen made <b>the</b> first <b>ascent</b> of <b>the</b> ridge {{and in the process}} made <b>the</b> second <b>ascent</b> of <b>the</b> {{mountain}} and <b>the</b> first solo <b>ascent.</b> He missed <b>the</b> honour of claiming <b>the</b> first <b>ascent</b> of Mount Cook, which was achieved on Christmas Day 1894 by a party of New Zealanders determined to prevent <b>the</b> first <b>ascent</b> being credited to a foreigner.|$|R

5|$|In 1868–1869, German geologists Wilhelm Reiss and Alphons Stübel {{were the}} first to attempt to climb Ruiz. In 1936, W. Cunet and Augusto Gansser-Biaggi made the first {{successful}} ascent, partly by ski; they repeated <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> in 1939.|$|E

5|$|A Diver {{breathes}} a {{compressed gas}} mixture that contains inert gas which dissolves {{in the various}} tissues during the pressure exposure. When <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> is initiated, the inert gas is off-loaded {{as soon as a}} suitable gradient is created.|$|E
5|$|Decompression in {{the context}} of diving derives from the {{reduction}} in ambient pressure experienced by the diver during <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> {{at the end of a}} dive or hyperbaric exposure and refers to both the reduction in pressure and the process of allowing dissolved inert gases to be eliminated from the tissues during this reduction in pressure.|$|E
5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, where <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> {{is interrupted}} by stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation.|$|E
50|$|On Feb 2, 2007; Philipp Kunz, Lhakpa Wangel, Temba Nuru and Lhakpa Thinduk made <b>the</b> first winter <b>ascent.</b> <b>The</b> team {{followed}} {{the route of}} <b>the</b> first <b>ascent</b> from <b>the</b> north.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> second <b>ascent</b> {{followed}} {{very shortly}} after the first, on July 23, 1984.

5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, where <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> {{is interrupted}} by stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation. Staged decompression may include deep stops depending on the theoretical model used for calculating <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> schedule. Omission of decompression theoretically required for a dive profile exposes the diver to significantly higher risk of symptomatic decompression sickness, and in severe cases, serious injury or death. The risk is related to the severity of exposure and the level of supersaturation of tissues in the diver. Procedures for emergency management of omitted decompression and symptomatic decompression sickness have been published. These procedures are generally effective, but vary in effectiveness from case to case.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. <b>The</b> <b>ascent</b> rate and the depth and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression {{is that it is}} far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|Dive {{computers}} {{also provide}} a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. If the diver exceeds a no-decompression limit, decompression additional to <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> rate will be necessary. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded.|$|E

5|$|In a {{significant}} departure from conventional practice, {{the tables are}} not based on a bottom time defined as time of leaving the surface to time leaving the bottom, but on time to reach a depth of 6m during <b>the</b> <b>ascent.</b>|$|E
5|$|John Scott Haldane was {{commissioned}} by the Royal Navy to develop a safe decompression procedure. The current method was a slow linear decompression, and Haldane was concerned that this was ineffective due to additional nitrogen buildup in the slow early stages of <b>the</b> <b>ascent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Flavians {{initiated}} {{economic and}} cultural reforms. Under Vespasian, new taxes were devised to restore the Empire's finances, while Domitian revalued the Roman coinage by increasing its silver content. A massive building programme was enacted to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>ascent</b> of the Flavian dynasty, leaving multiple enduring landmarks {{in the city of}} Rome, the most spectacular of which was the Flavian Amphitheatre, better known as the Colosseum.|$|E
