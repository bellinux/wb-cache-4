5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E

50|$|Various {{groups have}} {{also pointed out}} that, given the two phase {{approach}} <b>to</b> implementing <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> there will be little benefit to residents of Navan until the line is extended there, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>planned</b> positioning of <b>the</b> toll collection points at Pace/M3. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>planned</b> station being 30 km from Navan itself, the toll point is positioned before drivers reach the station.|$|R
50|$|Owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> for <b>the</b> {{transformation}} of <b>the</b> Reichshauptstadt <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> for this curve was not realised. Instead, spurs for a junction to Anhalter Bahnhof were built with <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> {{for a further}} underground section to Görlitzer Bahnhof and, south of the Landwehr Canal, four tunnel spurs taking <b>the</b> North-South Line <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>planned</b> S-Bahn station Hornstraße.|$|R
5|$|Observers {{were posted}} to Spanish ports and borders, and both Ribbentrop and Grandi {{were told by}} their governments to agree <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> {{significant}} shipments already having taken place. The cost of the scheme was put at £898,000, of which Germany would pay 16%. The German delegation appears to have hoped the control plan was effective.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also be considered when setting energy prices. The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions consume more electricity during summer while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. during peak and off-peak hours) and the consumption demand (i.e. whether it is low or high) will be taken into consideration.|$|E
5|$|After the 1793 {{beheading}} of Louis XVI {{sparked a}} war between Britain and France (see the French Revolutionary Wars), Nova Scotia Governor John Wentworth rented Kavanagh's Island to house 600 French prisoners that had been captured on St. Pierre and Miquelon. The commander of the Halifax garrison, Brigadier General James Ogilvie, objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> and instead housed the prisoners at Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax. Several prisoners were able {{to escape from the}} makeshift prison, and the rest were sent to Guernsey in June 1794.|$|E

5|$|At Nhu's request, Tung was {{reported}} to have been planning an operation under the cover of a government-organised student demonstration outside the US Embassy, Saigon. In this plan, Tung's men would assassinate ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. and other key officials among the confusion. Another target was the Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang, who had been given asylum in the embassy after being targeted in the pagoda raids. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> Tung's men would then burn down the embassy.|$|E
5|$|During his campaign, Chandler {{had promised}} {{that he would}} fund a medical school at the University of Kentucky, {{despite the fact that}} the University of Louisville already had a medical school and a poll of state {{physicians}} showed overwhelming opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> because of this. Nevertheless, Chandler delivered on his promise, allocating $5million to the establishment of what became known as the Albert B. Chandler Medical Center. Chandler said the establishment of the school was his proudest achievement as governor.|$|E

Impressed by Hines' plan, Davis agreed to back him. Davis urged Hines to tell Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin and Secretary of War James Seddon his plan. Both men agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> and encouraged Hines to proceed, with the only hesitation by Davis, Benjamin and Sheldon being the effect on public opinion on such a plan, including what Great Britain and France would think of Hines' actions.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, {{he wrote to his}} rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan stuck <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> and signed an oath that he had come with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the offensive, in May 1942, U.S. Major General Alexander Vandegrift was ordered to move his 1st Marine Division from the U.S. to New Zealand. Other Allied land, naval, and air force units were sent to establish bases in Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides {{was selected as the}} headquarters and main base for the impending offensive—codenamed Operation Watchtower—with the commencement date set for 7 August 1942. At first, the Allied offensive was planned just for Tulagi and the Santa Cruz Islands, omitting Guadalcanal. However, after Allied reconnaissance discovered the Japanese airfield construction efforts on Guadalcanal, capture of that airfield was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> and the Santa Cruz operation was dropped.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Allied decision to evacuate, the cabinet sent Koht to Luleå in Sweden to try to reinvigorate a previously rejected plan to create a demarcation line between the Germans and Norwegian in Northern Norway. Swedish troops were planned to occupy Narvik. The plan was named the Mowinckel plan, after its initiator, {{the former prime minister}} Johan Ludwig Mowinckel. During a meeting with the Swedish minister of foreign affairs, Christian Günther, who was to act as a middle man with Germans in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> Koht revealed that the Allies were about to evacuate Norway. Although Günther never revealed the evacuation plans to the Germans, Koht was heavily criticised for doing so by his colleagues upon his return to Norway.|$|E

Thi followed Khánh to the capital on the same day, and the plotters met in obscure places around town.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's plan envisaged {{that the}} Allies would throw many troops to envelop his right flank {{in order to}} cut the French {{communication}} line from Vienna. As a result, the Allies' centre and left flank would be exposed and become vulnerable. To encourage them to do so, Napoleon abandoned the strategic position on the Pratzen Heights, faking the weakness of his forces and his own caution. Meanwhile, Napoleon's main force was to be concealed in a dead ground opposite the Heights. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> the French troops would attack and recapture the Pratzen Heights, then from the Heights they would launch a decisive assault {{to the center of}} the Allied army, cripple them, and encircle them from the rear.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Airborne forces would need to endure another day in their perimeter.

5|$|Prince George's County {{officials}} {{continued to}} worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county. Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate purchase of land and rights-of-way in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> {{with the proviso that}} $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> {{on the basis that}} it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E
