5|$|At {{the request}} of the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, a panel of former justices and {{selected}} MPs was tasked with sorting through <b>the</b> <b>documents,</b> <b>and</b> determining the need to release or withhold them. To date, only about 4,000 out of the estimated 40,000 documents have been released, A final report released in June 2012 found no wrongdoing by Canadian Forces members, but did issue recommendations related to improving military policing and MPCC access to information and witnesses. The Canadian public generally held views that there was knowledge of detainee abuse by military or government officials. The issue has also led to scrutiny on detainee treatment by other Canadian departments and the armed forces of other nations.|$|E

Conservative activists challenged the authenticity of the documents used for the report. A number of bloggers analyzed scans of <b>the</b> <b>documents,</b> <b>and</b> rapidly concluded they were forgeries. Subsequently, CBS commissioned an independent inquiry into the matter and several CBS staffers were fired or asked to resign.|$|E

Mitrokhin, who was by that time the head of the Archives department, was assigned by the director of the First Directorate, Vladimir Kryuchkov, with the task of cataloging <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> overseeing their orderly transfer to the new Headquarters.

25|$|Terry Brink, {{a student}} of Alfred Adler, {{published}} an essay The case of Hitler (1975) in which he, similar to the above-mentioned authors, concluded that after a conscientious evaluation of all records there is not sufficient evidence that Hitler had a mental disorder. Many of Hitler's behavior must be understood as attempts to overcome a difficult childhood. However, many of <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> statements that have been quoted in order to proof a mental illness were to be considered untrustworthy. Too strong consideration has been given, for example, to allied propaganda and to fabrications {{of people who have}} tried to distance themselves from Hitler for personal reasons.|$|E

Despite these risks, Pygmy populations generally have poor access to health services and information about HIV.

According to the report, even where health care facilities exist, many people do not use them because they cannot pay for consultations and medicines, they do not have <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> identity cards needed to travel or obtain hospital treatment, and they are subjected to humiliating and discriminatory treatment.|$|E

Archibald and Marjory nonetheless decide to continue looking for the treasure, which they find (with some danger) in the cave under Archibald's house.

Amid glasnost and democratization in the late 1980s, Viktor Zemskov and other Russian researchers managed {{to gain access to}} <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> published the highly classified statistical data collected by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD and related to the number of the Gulag prisoners, special settlers, etc. In 1995, Zemskov wrote that foreign scientists have begun to be admitted to the restricted-access collection of these documents in the State Archive of the Russian Federation since 1992. However, only one historian, namely Zemskov, was admitted to these archives, and later the archives were again “closed”, according to Leonid Lopatnikov.|$|E

Televisa published an article supposedly showing discrepancies in The Guardian documents and denying accusations. Televisa covered the protests of Yo Soy 132 in detail.Televisa, the largest media network in the Spanish-speaking world, owns around two-thirds of the programming on Mexico's TV channels. In Mexico, newspaper readership is low and research on the Internet and cable TV is largely limited to the middle classes; consequently, the country's two major television networks – Televisa and TV Azteca – exert a significant influence in national politics.|$|E

URIs symbolically identify services, servers, and other databases, and <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> resources that they can provide. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web.
