5|$|A {{concession}} {{road between}} Hoyle and Matheson already existed at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> {{over the next}} several years it was reconstructed to provincial standards. On June26, 1940, the route was designated as a provincial highway. However, it was not numbered on official maps.|$|E
5|$|The first GWR {{service from}} the new station {{departed}} on 16 January 1854, though the roof had not been finished at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> there were no arrivals. It was formally opened on 29 May, and the older temporary station was demolished the following year.|$|E
5|$|After the 1836 election, Tyler {{thought his}} {{political}} career was at an end, and planned to return to private law practice. In the fall of 1837 a friend sold him a sizable property in Williamsburg. Unable to remain away from politics, Tyler successfully sought election to the House of Delegates and took his seat in 1838. He was a national political figure by <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> his third delegate service touched on such national issues as the sale of public lands.|$|E

5|$|After the inactivation, the Regiment {{was broken}} up and its {{subordinate}} elements were redesignated. The regimental Headquarters and Headquarters Company and Service Company were reorganized on 25 February 1949 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 411th Engineer Brigade, allowing them a larger staff {{with the ability}} to take command of more subordinate units. The regiment's 1st Battalion was reorganized and redesignated on 25 February 1949 as the 928th Engineer Construction Battalion. The 2nd Battalion was reorganized and redesignated on 15 March 1949 as the 929th Engineer Construction Battalion. The 3rd Battalion disbanded on 9 July 1953. The two separated battalions retained separate lineage from <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> the 355th Engineer Regiment ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 20th century, the {{building}} underwent three major renovations. In the first, from 1905 to 1907, Frank Lloyd Wright was retained to remake the interior spaces. In keeping with contemporary tastes, Wright's design covered Root's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved Carrara marble surfaces. Wright was highly regarded by the public at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> his changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery {{one of the most}} sought after buildings of Chicago. Some of Wright's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding his trademark style planters and light fixtures.|$|E
5|$|Formally, the Culver Line ends as {{the track}} curve enters {{the lower level}} of the double-decked station along the BMT Brighton Line's right-of-way, and the {{chaining}} track designation changes from IND tracks B1 and B2 to BMT tracks A1 and A2 of the Brighton Line. However, {{there is no longer}} a connection to the Brighton Line at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> for all practical purposes the Culver Line continues into tracks 5 and 6 of the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue Terminal.|$|E

5|$|However, the discontent {{within the}} locker room and the team's overall struggles culminated with Holmes criticizing and arguing with {{teammates}} in the huddle against Miami. Holmes was benched in the fourth quarter while the Jets subsequently lost 19–17, ending their postseason pursuit. After the Jets finished the season with a disappointing 8–8 record, Ryan admitted to having lost the pulse of the team. Then free agent running back LaDainian Tomlinson remarked that Ryan's Super Bowl predictions had an adverse effect on {{the locker room}} by placing undue pressure on the players. Ryan conceded <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> announced that he would refrain from making such statements publicly in the future.|$|E
5|$|Hu {{remained}} with Union {{and directed the}} company's next production, Soeara Berbisa, with peranakan sound technician Boen Kin Nam serving as assistant director. Written by Djojopranoto, the work followed two young men who compete {{for the love of}} a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers. Djoewita had left the company at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> the studio hired Raden Soekarno for the leading role of this late 1941 release. The company's final completed production, Mega Mendoeng, was directed by Boen and announced soon after shooting for Soeara Berbisa had begun. This film, a romance starring Soekarno and new find Sofiati, was released in early 1942. In producing both films, Union emphasised realism and targeted educated audiences.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Goss, then bishop, {{awarded the}} {{commission}} {{for the building}} of the new cathedral to Edward Welby Pugin (1833–1875). By 1856 the Lady chapel of the new cathedral had been completed. Due to financial resources being diverted to the education of Catholic children, work on the building ceased at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> the Lady chapel now named Our Lady Immaculate served as parish church to the local Catholic population until its demolition in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Most {{stations}} are sited {{within a few}} kilometres of a suitable grid connection point. This network needs {{to be capable of}} absorbing the output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity. The project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> making the connection; in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid, so it can accommodate the output from the plant.|$|E
5|$|That {{same day}} in Baltimore, {{hundreds}} of manufacturing workers declared a strike, and the box-makers and sawyers walked out, demanding a ten {{percent increase in}} wages. Newspaper reports counted 140 of the union's 180 members who went on strike. Tin can makers in the city had already been striking for higher wages for a week at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> their number now amounted to 800, while not more than 100 can makers in the city remained at work according to reports by The Sun.|$|E
5|$|The column or trunk is {{generally}} {{more or less}} cylindrical and may be plain and smooth or may bear specialist structures; these include solid papillae (fleshy protuberances), adhesive papillae, cinclides (slits) and small protruding vesicles. In some species the part immediately below the oral disc is constricted and {{is known as the}} capitulum. When the animal contracts, the oral disc, tentacles and capitulum fold inside the pharynx and are held in place by a strong sphincter muscle part way up the column. There may be a fold in the body wall, known as a parapet, at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> this parapet covers and protects the anemone when it is retracted.|$|E

5000|$|The {{task in the}} [...] "Reconnaissance and Surveillance" [...] {{setting is}} to reach a given area and explore it.

5|$|The highway {{begins at}} Exit34 and {{progresses}} north towards Lake Huron. This mostly straight {{section of the}} route lies within Lambton County and passes through the town of Forest. Near Kettle Point, the route abruptly curves north west and begins to parallel {{the shore of the}} lake, providing access to the village of Port Franks and The Pinery Provincial Park prior to entering Grand Bend. North of that village, the highway crosses into Huron County and intersects former Highway83. Between <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> Goderich, {{the west side of the}} highway is dominated by roads providing access to shoreline cottages.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} scenarios converge at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> Jones {{starts to}} explore the Lost City. He saves Sophia from a prison, and {{they make their way}} to the center of Atlantis, where her medallion guides them to the home of Nur-Ab-Sal. The Atlantean god takes full possession of Sophia and it is only by a trick that Indy rids her of the necklace and destroys it, thus freeing her. Meanwhile, they notice grotesquely deformed bones all over the place. They advance further and eventually reach a large colossus the inhabitants of the city built to transform themselves into gods.|$|E
5|$|With the Ordos now {{adequately}} fortified, the Mongols avoided {{its walls}} by riding east to invade Datong and Xuanfu (宣府; present-day Xuanhua, Hebei Province), which were two major garrisons guarding {{the corridor to}} Beijing where no walls had been built. The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming had deteriorated by <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> {{for all intents and}} purposes the inner line was the capital's main line of defence.|$|E

5|$|A {{report in}} the American Chess Bulletin (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had {{resigned}} the world title in favor of Capablanca because {{the conditions of the}} match were unpopular in the chess world. The American Chess Bulletin speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match. When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in Havana had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5|$|As-Salih Ayyub was ill and {{his health}} {{deteriorated}} further {{due to the}} mounting pressure from the Crusader offensive. His wife Shajar al-Durr called a meeting of all the war generals and thus became commander-in-chief of the Egyptian forces. She ordered the fortification of Mansurah and then stored large quantities of provisions and concentrated her forces there. She also organized a fleet of war galleys and scattered them at various strategic points along the Nile River. Crusader attempts to capture Mansurah were thwarted and King Louis {{found himself in a}} critical position. He managed to cross the Nile to launch a surprise attack against Mansurah. Meanwhile, as-Salih Ayyub died, but Shajar al-Durr and as-Salih Ayyub's Bahri Mamluk generals, including Rukn al-Din Baybars and Aybak, countered the assault and inflicted heavy losses on the Crusaders. Simultaneously, Egyptian forces cut off the Crusader's line of supply from Damietta, preventing the arrival of reinforcements. As-Salih Ayyub's son and the newly proclaimed Ayyubid sultan al-Mu'azzam Turan-Shah reached Mansurah at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>and</b> intensified the battle against the Crusaders. The latter ultimately surrendered at the Battle of Fariskur, and King Louis and his companions were arrested.|$|E
