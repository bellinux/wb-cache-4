The results were analysed using generalised additive models <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the tansy patches should be managed towards volumes of 3m and that these patches should be targeted within 200m of existing beetle subpopulations on the same river bank in order to help the beetle population disperse and survive.|$|E
5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E

5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E

Strong absorption features observed at 1.5, 1.65 and 2 µm in its infrared spectrum are consistent with nearly pure crystalline water ice covering much of its surface.

We <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> {{this is not the}} case. No accelerating TM solves the halting problem. The argument rests on an analysis of the reasoning that leads to Thomson's paradox. The key point is that the paradox rests on a conflation of different perspectives of accelerating processes.
