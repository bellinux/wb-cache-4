40|$|The {{nonuniform}} abrasion {{failure and}} high-temperature thermal failure of packing rings {{have a significant}} influence on compressor reliability, particularly that of oil-free compressors. In this study, a test rig was constructed to measure the dynamic temperature of packing rings under different operational conditions in an oil-free reciprocating compressor. The dynamic axial and radial temperature distributions of <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> rings were obtained using an innovative internal temperature testing device that kept <b>the</b> thermocouples and <b>packing</b> <b>box</b> relatively static during compressor operation. A three-dimensional heat transfer model was also developed to analyze the temperature distribution of <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> <b>boxes,</b> piston rod, and cylinder during such operation. Good agreement was observed between the simulation results and experimental data, which showed an average relative error of less than 2. 35 %. The {{results indicate that the}} pressure ratio exerts a significant effect on the axial temperature distribution and determines which <b>packing</b> ring reaches <b>the</b> maximum temperature.

Moreover, a sequence triple-based solution methodology is proposed, simulated annealing is used as modeling technique, and the situation where some boxes are preplaced in the container is investigated. These preplaced boxes represent potential obstacles. Numerical experiments are conducted for containers with and without obstacles.

A new heuristic based on the wall-building approach is proposed, which decomposes the problem into a number of layers which again are split into a number of strips. <b>The</b> <b>packing</b> of a strip may be formulated and solved optimally as a Knapsack Problem with capacity equal to the width or height of the container. The depth of a layer as well as the thickness of each strip is decided through a branch-and-bound approach where at each node only a subset of branches is explored. Several ranking rules for the selection of the most promising layer depths and strip widths are presented and the performance of the corresponding algorithms is experimentally compared for homogeneous and heterogeneous instances. The best ranking rule is then used in a comprehensive computational study involving large-sized instances. These computational results show that instances with a total box volume up to 90...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of direct current field (DCF) on powder-pack boriding {{has been investigated}} by applying DCF between boriding agent and specimen during the soaking. Experimental results show that DCF has the function of heating the agent and the specimen and thus enhancing boriding. It is shown that the specimen’s side facing anode has the deepest boride case when the specimen is taken as cathode. It is proposed that DCF forces active boron-containing species to diffuse toward the specimen at the cathode. This makes boron concentration around the specimen as cathode higher than that at the anode or other position {{and that in the}} conventional powder-pack boriding (CPB), which relatively decreases boron’s absorption by inner wall surface of <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> <b>box</b> and <b>the</b> non-working surface of the specimen. DCF’s physical effect of enhancing chemical reaction in the agent increases the activity and concentration of active boron atoms and boron-containing species, which overcomes the shortcoming that CPB can not produce enough boron-containing species by conventional way of heating...|$|R
