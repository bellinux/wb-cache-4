5|$|William Rolleston, at {{the time}} Provincial Secretary, {{proposed}} to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 {{at the time}}, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to this marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, well educated, successful, and even of higher social standing. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too old for their daughter, {{and that she was}} too young to marry. Perhaps Sophia Brittan did not want to lose her daughter, who was in effect running the household and entertaining guests, as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself. Despite parental objections, an engagement was announced, soon after which Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs, requiring a move to Wellington. Hence, the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church, after which the newly-weds moved to the capital.|$|E

When Ickis, Oblina and Krumm saw him <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a real monster betraying them. Tired of making them a {{laughing}} stock, Oblina caused {{him to have a}} nightmare. She, Krumm and Ickis theatened him but he woke up. That's when they scared him for real during a stage show. Murray then retired and started working at a toy store. He also appeared on a talk show in another episode with Simon the monster hunter and two other characters and everyone laughed at him. This character was scrapped after season 1.|$|E

500|$|Batman: Arkham Asylum {{was first}} {{announced}} in August 2008; {{it was developed}} by British studio Rocksteady Studios {{under the aegis of}} Eidos Interactive and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Eidos obtained the rights to make a Batman game in spring 2007, and approached then little-known Rocksteady after viewing the developer's prototype. At Eidos' request, Rocksteady presented their approach to the Batman license, and by May 2007, they had begun developing the game's concept, with full production beginning in September. Writer Paul Dini ( [...] , Detective Comics) was first approached by DC Comics around late 2007 about the prospect of creating a story for an original Batman video game. Dini found the idea intriguing, believing that few Batman games were based on an original idea, instead being adapted from film or television. DC Comics asked Dini what his approach to writing a new Batman film or graphic novel would be, but one that was designed for gameplay. He later met with the Rocksteady team, where it was decided that Dini's ideas were in line with what Rocksteady wanted to achieve. By the time Dini joined the project, Rocksteady were investigating the idea of setting the game within Arkham, and had produced preliminary designs depicting it as a huge estate on an island connected to mainland Gotham City by a bridge. The cast had not been finalized, but given the setting it was certain that the Joker would play a large role. The game and story were developed together, with the limitations of mechanics requiring the story to be built around them. The core aim was to make the game engaging enough for players to spend 8–10 hours completing it, especially those uninterested in Batman-franchised media. Rocksteady would guide Dini when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> writing too much story or character motivation.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Davros {{was designed by}} Nation to have created the Daleks in his image, and to also be a [...] "spokesperson" [...] for the Daleks as {{he felt it was}} [...] "boring" [...] listening to Daleks giving speeches. The design was inspired by the Mekon, a comic book character with no body but a [...] "green, dome-like head" [...] which Hinchcliffe remembered from his childhood. Davros attracted the attention of BBC prosthetics designer John Friedlander who agreed to come off another show to make Davros' mask. The latex mask was moulded to Michael Wisher's face by make-up artist Sylvia James. Wisher could even eat while wearing the mask. Regular latex instead of the more mouldable foam latex was used because the latter was too expensive. [...] The cast and crew regarded Davros' effects as a great technical achievement considering the budget and time period they worked in. Two children visiting Baker at the BBC studios were scared by Wisher in costume; <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a statue at first. When sitting in Davros' Dalek-like base, Wisher wore knee pads and a kilt because trousers were too uncomfortable. To prepare during rehearsals, Wisher acted in a wheelchair with a paper bag over his head that only had slits cut out for his eyes so he would be used to the [...] "disorienting" [...] situation and be able to express himself without using his whole face. Wisher, a heavy smoker, put two holes {{in the top of the}} bag so he could smoke underneath it in rehearsals. Wisher also provided some of the voices for the Daleks with Roy Skelton; in some scenes, he was acting to his own pre-recorded dialogue.|$|E
2500|$|Paraguayans often {{referred}} to him simply as [...] "Dr. Francia" [...] or Karaí Guazú ("great lord" [...] in Guaraní). A few Indians meanwhile believed he had supernatural powers: when some saw him measuring the stars with his theodolite, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking to night demons. Francia would later use it to straighten the streets of Asunción.|$|E

2500|$|Bill Fernandez, {{a fellow}} {{electronics}} hobbyist {{who was in}} Jobs's grade at Cupertino Junior High, was his first friend after the 1967 move. Fernandez later commented that [...] "for some reason {{the kids in the}} eighth grade didn't like [...] because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> odd. I was one of his few friends." [...] Fernandez eventually introduced Jobs to 18-year-old electronics whiz and Homestead High alumn Steve Wozniak, who lived across the street from Fernandez.|$|E
2500|$|Ted Curson remembers, [...] "That really broke me up. When Eric {{got sick}} {{on that date}} , and him being black and a jazz musician, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a junkie. Eric didn't use any drugs. He was a {{diabetic}} – {{all they had to}} do was take a blood test and they would have found that out. So he died for nothing. They gave him some detox stuff and he died, and nobody ever went into that club in Berlin again. That was the end of that club." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alliance {{leaders also}} were alarmed at Lee's behaviour, which they {{considered}} unseemly for the Chief Minister of a state. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{acting as if}} he were the Prime Minister of a sovereign nation. Finance Minister Tan Siew Sin of the MCA labelled Lee as the [...] "greatest, disruptive force in the entire history of Malaysia and Malaya." [...] Lee now seemed determined to press forward politically and continue contesting elections nationwide, with the formation of the Malaysian Solidarity Council —- a coalition of political parties which called for a [...] "Malaysian Malaysia", duplicating the effort introduced earlier by Dato' Onn Ja'afar.|$|E

50|$|The {{officers}} {{think that}} the stranger could be a suspect whom they arrested {{a year ago when}} they were investigating the disappearance of Mary Black. Unable to prove his guilt, they tortured and beat him to get a confession, though he continually maintained his innocence. However, they realize that the victim of their violence should still be in a coma that resulted from their brutal torture, stationed at a medical facility. The officers telephone the facility and discover that the victim had died earlier that evening, {{at the same time as}} the stranger entered the police station, which proves that the stranger <b>is</b> not who <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In , Jesus {{returns home}} from {{performing}} miracles, but a crowd gathers: [...] "There {{were so many}} people that Jesus and his followers could not eat. When his family heard this, they went to get him because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> out of his mind. But the teachers of the law from Jerusalem were saying, 'Beelzebul is living inside him! He uses his power from the ruler of demons to force demons out of people'." [...] In his response to this accusation, Jesus says that speaking out against the Holy Spirit is an unforgivable sin: [...] "Jesus said this because the people were saying that he had an evil spirit in him." [...] clarifies that [...] "if you speak against the Son of Man, you can be forgiven, but if you speak against the Holy Spirit, you cannot be forgiven." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, {{producer}} Daniel Melnick {{found the}} screenplay for Punchline among twelve other unrealized scripts in the vaults of Columbia Pictures. Seltzer's screenplay {{had gone through}} three changes of studio management because the executives didn't like the mix of comedy and drama {{as well as the}} Steven Gold character because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> according to Melnick, [...] "obsessive, certainly self-destructive and could be considered mean-spirited." [...] The studio couldn’t get a major star to commit to the material and so Melnick decided to make the movie for $8 million and with no stars. Interim studio president Steve Sohmer didn't like that idea and sent the script to Sally Field, who had a production deal with Columbia. Field agreed to star in and produce the movie. Once Field signed on, the budget was set at $15 million.|$|E

50|$|A more {{reliable}} report tells {{a somewhat different}} story. On the morning of 2 June 1919, he took off from Tyringham toward the south, then turned west, away from Boston. He drew a crowd of spectators for his departure because the local populace {{was not used to}} aircraft. Because of his direction of flight, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might <b>be</b> returning to the field he departed, but he did not reappear.|$|R
2500|$|Ginsberg {{travelled}} {{to several}} communist countries to promote free speech. He claimed that communist countries, such as China, welcomed him because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{an enemy of}} capitalism, but often turned against him when they saw him as a trouble maker. For example, in 1965 Ginsberg was deported from Cuba for publicly protesting the persecution of homosexuals and referring to Che Guevara as [...] "cute". The Cubans sent him to Czechoslovakia, where one week after being named the Král majálesu ("King of May" [...] – a students' festivity, celebrating spring and student life), Ginsberg was arrested for alleged drug use and public drunkenness, and the security agency StB confiscated several of his writings, which they considered to be lewd and morally dangerous. Ginsberg was then deported from Czechoslovakia on May 7, 1965 by order of the StB. Václav Havel points to Ginsberg as an important inspiration.|$|E
2500|$|The Super Furry Animals had {{originally}} intended {{to work on the}} album with Gorwel Owen, who co-produced 1996's Fuzzy Logic and 1997's Radiator with the band. According to Rhys, however, Owen felt [...] "burned out" [...] after producing other bands solidly {{for a year and a}} half and asked the group to wait until he had chance to rest. The Super Furry Animals were so keen to record that they decided to produce the album themselves. Guerrilla was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire during the middle of 1998. Although Rhys has stated that the group met Gabriel several times during recording, and that <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "a good old guy", Real World was chosen because it was near to the band's homes in Wales rather than because of its association with the former Genesis frontman. Sessions were [...] "much less volatile than usual" [...] according to Rhys, as the five members of the band felt they had to reach consensus over everything because they were producing the record themselves—while recording their previous albums the band would often fall out and shout at each other safe in the knowledge that Owen would act as a mediator and take the final decisions. Bassist Guto Pryce has stated that the band also felt happier during recording sessions for Guerrilla because they had their pets with them at Real World, and were able to relax and enjoy the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the British summer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{night before}} the balloting Stevenson began working {{actively}} for the nomination, calling the leaders of several state delegations to ask for their support. The key call went to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, {{the leader of the}} Illinois delegation. The delegation had already voted to give Kennedy 59.5 votes to Stevenson's 2, but Stevenson told Daley that he now wanted the Democratic nomination, and asked him if the [...] "delegates' vote might merely indicate <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not a candidate." [...] Daley told Stevenson that he had no support in the delegation. Stevenson then [...] "asked if this meant no support in fact or no support because the delegates thought he was not a candidate. Daley replied that Stevenson had no support." [...] According to Stevenson biographer John Bartlow Martin, the phone conversation with Daley [...] "was the real end of the [...] Stevenson candidacy...if he could not get the support of his home state his candidacy was doomed." [...] However, Stevenson continued to work for the nomination the next day, fulfilling what he felt were obligations to old friends and supporters such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Agnes Meyer. Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota delivered an impassioned nominating speech for Stevenson, urging the convention to not [...] "reject the man who has made us proud to be Democrats. Do not leave this prophet without honor in his own party." [...] However, Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot with 806 delegate votes; Stevenson finished in fourth place with 79.5 votes.|$|E

2500|$|In 309 BC Lucius Papirius Cursor won {{a massive}} {{battle against the}} Samnites and celebrated the finest triumph there had been thanks to the spoils. [...] The Etruscan cities broke the truce and Quintus Fabius easily {{defeated}} the remnants of their troops near Perusia and would have taken the city had it not surrendered. In 308 BC, Quintus Fabius was elected consul again. His colleague was Publius Decius Mus. Quintus Fabius took on Samnium. He refused peace offers by Nuceria Alfaterna and besieged it into surrender. He also fought an unspecified battle where the Marsi joined the Samnites. The Paeligni, who also sided with the Samnites, were defeated next. In Etruria Decius obtained a forty-year truce and corn supplies from Tarquinii, seized some strongholds of Volsinii and ravaged wide areas. All Etruscans sued for a treaty, but he conceded only a one-year truce and required them to give each Roman soldier one year's pay and two tunics. There was a revolt by Umbrians who, backed by Etruscan men, gathered a large army {{and said that they}} would ignore Decius and march on Rome. Decius undertook forced marches, encamped near Pupinia, to the north-east of Rome, and called on Fabius to lead his army to Umbria. Fabius marched to Mevania, near Assisi, where the Umbrian troops were. The Umbrians were surprised as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in Samnium. Some of them fell back to their cities and some pulled out of the war. Others attacked Fabius while he was entrenching his camp, but they were defeated. The leaders of the revolt surrendered and the rest of Umbria capitulated within days.|$|E
2500|$|At 10:25am, Bravo Company de-bussed as the Iraqis were {{swarming}} {{around them}} and the ringleaders in the crowd were encouraging the locals to attack Bravo Company. As they de-bussed to throw back the crowd, the rear vehicle noticed that the Iraqi Militia contingent were {{no longer in the}} convoy. Such was the intensity of the rock throwing and the sheer numbers of locals in the crowd, Bravo took the decision to fire rubber bullets at the ringleaders. Whilst the soldiers were well aware that using rubber bullets could either calm or inflame a situation, they felt that they had no choice given the intensity of the crowd, who were being told via the loudspeakers on the minarets that the British were here to [...] "rape the women [...] attack them!" [...] One of the ringleaders was identified, and a Corporal using the baton gun fired and felled the ringleader from [...] away. After two more baton rounds were fired, the crowd surged forward and the Non-commissioned officer (NCO) of Bravo Company (Sgt Gordon Robertson) fired warning shots into the air from his rifle and other troops followed suit. At this the crowd moved back and allowed them space to move, but it was later realized that the local Iraqis had gone to get their weapons. In their minds, the British had fired first, so {{it was a matter of}} pride that they returned fire. At 10:30am, Iraqi gunmen would return fire and Bravo would defend themselves with the result of the first Iraqi's dying. One witness in the crowd claimed that children were throwing stones at the Paratroopers and when one of the paratroopers went into a firing position, a local man called Tassir thought a child would be shot, so he levelled his weapon at the paratroopers. The British troops fired on him first as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to shoot, and after that, the crowd became completely hostile. At this point, the RMPs were only [...] away from the Paratroopers. Ahmed Younis, a member of the crowd on the morning, said The market was very crowded. I threw myself on the ground and shouted to everyone to run away or get down. The shooting lasted about five minutes but there were bullets going everywhere. They were firing on automatic. I couldn't believe it when they started shooting. Sheikh Shejar said [...] The Iraqi side fired first. Later they went to the police station and attacked there. The mob wanted to shelter at the police station and use it as a base to attack the British.|$|E
