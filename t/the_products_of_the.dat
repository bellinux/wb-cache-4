5|$|The most {{apparent}} lava flows at a seamount are the eruptive flows that cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in {{the forms of}} dikes and sills, are also {{an important part of}} seamount growth. The most common type of flow is pillow lava, named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosive activity of seamounts that are near the water's surface, and can also form from mechanical wear of existing volcanic rock.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{plants and}} {{therefore}} incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single-celled algae species that {{reside in the}} animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food {{in the form of}} glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The algae also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the anemone is largely dependent on the proportions and identities of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden anemone (Lebrunia coralligens) has a whorl of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner whorl of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for photosynthesis, but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey.|$|E

5|$|Chicago {{initially}} {{led the way}} in skyscraper design, {{with many}} constructed {{in the center of the}} financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicago school of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by {{their attempts to}} outcompete and disgrace each other, but they made important contributions to science and the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further workâ€”both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths.

5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E

5|$|The Nationalists {{returned}} {{to focus on}} the capture of northern Spain. German test aircraft, with the latest models, faced an outdated Basque section (Escuadrilla vasca) of the Spanish Republican Air Force. Heavy aerial bombardment from 200 Nationalist, German and Italian aircraft was used far behind Basque lines in August 1937, leading to the fall of Santander after the Battle of Santander on 1 September. The formal battle in Asturias ended with the fall of GijÃ³n on 21 October. Germany immediately began to ship <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region's industry back to Germany.

5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by {{using some of the}} liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-burner, giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E

5|$|The {{occurrence}} of Boletopsis nothofagi {{seems to be}} strongly connected to the {{occurrence of}} the southern beech Nothofagus fusca, a species of Fagales that is endemic to New Zealand. B.nothofagi has been found exclusively in N.fusca forests spread through New Zealand below 37Â° S. The fungus forms a mycorrhizal association with the trees of N.fusca, in which the hyphae of the fungal mycelium wrap around {{the roots of the}} tree and penetrate the cortex, but not its cells. Subsequently, B.nothofagi takes over the function of the root hair and directs water and soil nutrients to the tree. In return, the fungus can, through contact with the root tissue, access <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree's photosynthesis. The fruit bodies of the species have so far always been found in May, the end of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these various interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use.
