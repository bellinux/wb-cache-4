5|$|Foreign {{migration}} to Copenhagen, rising {{over the last}} three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014.

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> 20th century, <b>Copenhagen</b> had become a thriving industrial and administrative city.

40|$|In 2015 a new {{political}} platform named <b>The</b> Greater <b>Copenhagen</b> Collaboration emerged in the capital region of Denmark. This Master Thesis investigates the new collaboration {{with a focus on}} its urban governance strategies. The thesis argues that <b>The</b> Greater <b>Copenhagen</b> Collaboration sets new standards in the general urban governance of <b>the</b> Greater <b>Copenhagen</b> area with a strong focus on growth, collaboration and internationalization. This focus is related to a procedural and network-oriented rationality, characterized by the marketization and fragmentation of the urban governance. It is argued that <b>The</b> Greater <b>Copenhagen</b> Collaboration obtains <b>the</b> procedural and network-oriented rationality due to changes in the urban capital flows and the urban organizational field’s orientation towards Stockholm and other successful city regions. The thesis analyses <b>The</b> Greater <b>Copenhagen</b> Collaboration and its role in policy-making process of the state-government’s capital strategy “Hovedstaden – en metropol i vækst” from 2015. By doing so, the thesis investigates the consequences of a procedural and networkoriented rationality, when engaging in a traditional and bureaucratic policy process with a substantive rationality. It is argued that the rationality obtained by <b>The</b> Greater <b>Copenhagen</b> Collaboration characterized by marketization and fragmentation leads to depoliticisation in the urban governance and a decoupling between formal policy-processes and actual urban organizational practices...|$|R
5|$|There are 22 {{stations}} in <b>the</b> <b>Copenhagen</b> Metro, a driverless rapid transit system serving Copenhagen, Frederiksberg and Tårnby in Denmark. Nine of these metro stations are underground, twelve are elevated, {{and one is}} street-level. Christianshavn Station offers transfer between the system's two metro lines (M1 and M2), which share track between Vanløse and Christianshavn stations. From Christianshavn, M1 branches south traveling to Vestamager Station, while M2 heads southeast to Lufthavnen Station, which serves Copenhagen Airport. Flintholm, Nørreport and Vanløse stations offer transfer to the S-train, the city's other rapid transit system which <b>the</b> <b>Copenhagen</b> Metro was built to supplement. Transfer from <b>the</b> <b>Copenhagen</b> Metro to regional trains is possible at Lufthavnen, Nørreport and Ørestad stations. The City Circle Line, which is under construction and {{scheduled to open in}} 2019, is planned to have 17 stations, with transfer between the current and new lines at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv stations. The new lines will have a stop at Copenhagen Central Station (København H), the largest train station in Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{founding}} in 1889, the Danish Football Association (DBU) inaugurated The Football Tournament contested by Copenhagen clubs only, though the winners are not considered official Danish champions. Upon the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Copenhagen</b> Football Association (KBU) in 1903, the administration of The Football Tournament was {{handed over to the}} newly founded regional football association, who went on to arrange yearly Copenhagen football championships. As the five other regional football associations emerged – namely Jutland FA (JBU), Zealand FA (SBU), Funen FA (FBU), Lolland-Falster FA (LFBU) and Bornholm FA (BBU) – they also started arranging championships for their own regions, parallel with <b>the</b> <b>Copenhagen</b> Championship.|$|E
