5|$|Casinos {{and race}} tracks were closed because {{official}} monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission, respectively, {{were categorized as}} non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight. Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later. <b>The</b> <b>casinos</b> attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing <b>the</b> <b>casinos</b> were not paid by the state but by <b>the</b> <b>casinos</b> themselves, but the appeal was rejected at the New Jersey Supreme Court; therefore {{they were forced to}} close.|$|E
5|$|As the Cambodian {{economy was}} stagnating due to {{systemic}} corruption, Sihanouk opened two casinosin Phnom Penh and Sihanoukvillein January 1969. While <b>the</b> <b>casinos</b> satisfied his aim of generating state revenues {{of up to}} 700 million riels in that year, it also caused {{a sharp increase in}} the number of bankruptcies and suicides. In August 1969 Lon Nol was reappointed as Prime Minister, with Sisowath Sirik Matak as his deputy. Two months later, Lon Nol left Cambodia to seek medical treatment, leaving Sirik Matak to run the government. Between October and December 1969, Sirik Matak instituted several policy changes that ran contrary to Sihanouk's wishes, such as allowing private banks to re-open in the country and devaluing the riel. He also encouraged ambassadors to write to Lon Nol directly, instead of going through Sihanouk, angering the latter. In early January 1970 Sihanouk left Cambodia for medical treatment in France. Shortly after he left, Sirik Matak took the opportunity to close down <b>the</b> <b>casinos.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rosecroft {{was sold}} to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several {{mistakes}} that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland. Three years later, {{he was arrested for}} possession of cocaine, and his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft {{was sold to}} Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to lawsuits and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized casinos to help their racetracks. Money generated from <b>the</b> <b>casinos</b> was used to increase the purses and handle (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce the same amount of money. After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010.

5|$|In 1927, a spur of Route 4, Route S4A, was {{proposed}} as a route running from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton in Ocean County south to Little Beach. In 1929, this route was to continue south through Brigantine to Atlantic City, with the portion south of Little Beach {{to be built}} by Atlantic County. The state of New Jersey took over the proposed extension of Route S4A from Little Beach to Atlantic City in 1938. However, the portion of this route between Brigantine and the Atlantic/Ocean County line was never built, and the portion of road that existed in Ocean County {{was removed from the}} state highway system by 1941. In 1945, another route called Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now U.S. Route 30), {{was proposed}} to run north along Brigantine Boulevard (present-day Route 187 and Route 87) from Atlantic City to Brigantine. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 87 was designated as an unsigned route along the former alignment of Route S4A and the proposed Route S56 between U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City and Brigantine. Following the 1953 renumbering, the southern portion of Route 87 in Atlantic City split into two alignments, with one following Huron Avenue and the other following Brigantine Boulevard. Eventually, the alignment of Route 87 along Brigantine Boulevard between U.S. Route 30 and Huron Avenue became Route 187. In 2001, the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector was completed, linking Route 87, <b>the</b> <b>casinos</b> in the Marina District, and Brigantine with the Atlantic City Expressway.|$|E
