500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words I will ever write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is a good movie {{but it is not}} the movie I thought we could make. [...] I do like Great Moments but there is another film in <b>there</b> <b>somewhere</b> that has got lost." ...|$|E

[...] Patton became a [...] "household name" [...] and has been called [...] "an unqualified star to the 5-and-under set and their parents". [...] He was subjected to [...] "the same kind of scrutiny" [...] as Burns, {{who was involved in}} Patton's selection and helped train him, to earn the role. [...] Patton was selected out of 1,500 auditions. [...] He had never seen the show before his audition, but like Burns was the favorite with preschool test audiences. [...] He said, [...] "I am convinced that I got that part because of a Christopher Walken impression I sometimes do.

Juskalian described his capture as follows: [...] "One of our intelligence officers had gone out to check on the situation, and word came back that he'd been wounded and was out <b>there</b> <b>somewhere.</b> So another officer and I went out in a Jeep and found him, but he was dead. Then we came under fire, so we couldn't drag him out of there." [...] After telling the driver to return to the command post, Juskalian investigated the conditions of the other U.S. soldiers. [...] "I thought they were all right because we hadn't heard anything from them, but they'd been overrun by the Germans." [...] Having lost his glasses, Juskalian could not distinguish the soldiers that were approaching him from 50feet (15m) away. The soldiers were Germans and took him prisoner. Juskalian said about his capture, [...] "I was irritated with myself for being so foolhardy, I shouldn't have been there." [...] Juskalian later learned, while still a prisoner of war (POW), that he had been awarded the Silver Star for his rescue attempt.

500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out <b>there</b> <b>somewhere.</b> Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E

Mosi Reeves from Spin criticized Gaga's [...] "wanna-be-M.I.A. cadences", calling it [...] "unnecessarily crass". Another review from Spin by Brandon Soderberg panned the song, saying that [...] "t wasn't a Wale song and it wasn't a Gaga song with Wale wedged in <b>there</b> <b>somewhere,</b> either. 'Chillin' became {{something of an}} Internet rap watershed moment". Sean Fennessey from Pitchfork Media described the song as [...] "much-maligned", adding that [...] "there won't be much to gain from ... This {{was the first step}} in Wale's multiple personality debacle and he seems to know as much—nothing else on Attention Deficit resembles the goofy sneakers-shouting writing here." [...] In another review, Ryan Dombal from the same website criticized Wale's repetition of his name and the usage of the samples calling it [...] "unnecessary". [...] Brian Howe from Paste described the track as [...] "flashy and hollow". The Greyhound gave the song a negative review and believed that [...] "with a lackluster hook and the repetition of the name 'Wale,' the airplay and sales of this single will depend greatly upon the vocals of Lady Gaga." [...] Wilson McBee from Slant Magazine criticized both [...] "Chillin" [...] and the follow-up single, [...] "World Tour", as [...] "tepid Cool & Dre productions in which Wale seems to be attempting Black Eyed Peas-style halftime-show rap." [...] McBee believed that the songs did not represent {{the true nature of the}} album.

500|$|Title {{was entirely}} written and {{composed}} by Meghan Trainor and Kevin Kadish, and produced by Kadish. The pair recorded the EP at The Carriage House in Nolensville, Tennessee. It was mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York City, New York. Besides writing and composing the record, Trainor was {{also responsible for}} its drum programming, percussion instrumentation, clapping and ukulele melodies, as well as handling the EP's executive production with Kadish. Title was developed using {{a wide range of}} other instrumentation; drums, acoustic guitar, electric guitar and bass—all produced by Kadish. David Baron and Jim Hoke were the only two other musicians involved in the EP's production, and were responsible for the record's piano, baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone and hammond organ instrumentation. In an interview with The Baltimore Sun, Kadish spoke of the record's conception, [...] "We were like, 'Let's do a '50s EP and see if anybody likes it, just for fun.'" [...] Regarding the title of the EP, Trainor told Popjustice, [...] "So I've called the EP Title. Cos obviously everyone was going, 'what's the title', and I was like, 'hey, I'm clever, I'm gonna make it this'." [...] The name was deemed [...] "creative" [...] by Idolator's Mike Wass. Dear Future Husband" [...] was inspired by a joke Trainor made with her father, where she would say that her future husband [...] "is out <b>there</b> <b>somewhere,</b> chilling". Trainor described the EP as having a [...] "doo-wop feel" [...] reminiscent of [...] "All About That Bass," [...] but being different lyrically. Trainor noted that Title takes on themes that [...] "not {{a lot of people think}} about," [...] such as commitment and staying true to one's self. The EP was Epic Records' idea to prove that Trainor was not a one-hit wonder, following the success of her debut single, [...] "All About That Bass". In an interview with James Sullivan of The Boston Globe, the singer said that Title focuses on [...] "an awkward 19-, 20-year-old, when you're pretty sure you're an adult but you're not, yet." [...] She went on to add, [...] "All the songs sound very similar—very personal, girl power anthems." [...] Trainor felt the EP's album tracks showcased her better than what [...] "All About That Bass" [...] did.|$|E

2500|$|After {{these three}} novels, Beckett {{struggled}} {{for many years}} to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief [...] "stories" [...] later collected as Texts for Nothing. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, Comment c'est (1961; How It Is. An early variant version of Comment c'est, L'Image, was published in the British arts review, [...] (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.). This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching telegraphese: [...] "You are <b>there</b> <b>somewhere</b> alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark" [...] Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. How It Is is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Tomasky {{reviewed}} {{the work for}} The New York Review of Books, and echoed the assessment by On the Issues, it was a political tool for Trump's 2012 presidential aspirations. Tomasky observed, the genre of the work was placed within marketing himself and conservative ideology. He pointed out Trump used Regnery Publishing, a conservative book outlet. Tomasky wrote Trump's domestic policy proposals were boring. Stephan Lee, in a review for Entertainment Weekly, wrote that the book, [...] "reads like a 190-page diatribe against the Obama presidency, illegal immigration, and the people and media outlets who have dared to criticize him." [...] Carlos Lozada, nonfiction book critic for The Washington Post, pointed out the timing and purpose of the book. Lozada highlighted the contradictory nature of Trump's harsh criticism {{on the campaign trail}} for The New York Times, while simultaneously touting the book as a New York Times Best Seller on its cover. The Washington Post noted the name change of the book, writing, the 2011 version did not sync with his 2016 new political identity. Lozada wrote of the book's reissue with repackaging, i.e., minimal changes to content and significant changes to its exterior, that was a fitting [...] "metaphor in <b>there</b> <b>somewhere</b> for the campaign of a real-estate developer." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005's Infinite Crisis miniseries, it was {{revealed}} that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis DC Universe from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she {{is the only one who}} still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her octogenarian status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband, Superman, in Infinite Crisis #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he could not let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy-Prime at the end of Infinite Crisis #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words [...] "It's... not... going..." [...] as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out <b>there</b> <b>somewhere.</b> After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside Kon-El's, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.|$|E
