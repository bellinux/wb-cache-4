5|$|The {{station has}} two {{entrance}}s and exits. The main station entrance and ventilation building {{consists of four}} escalators and an elevator {{on the west side}} of Hudson Boulevard between 33rd and 34th Streets. The main entrance has a turtle shell-shaped glass canopy above it that allows light to shine on the upper mezzanine. The elevator is located south of 34th Street in Hudson Park, while the escalator entrance is located further east, closer to the boulevard. At the time of construction, <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> building was designed so developers could built on top of it later. The 55 Hudson Yards skyscraper, whose structure is partially atop <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> tower, started construction in January 2015, and pictures in May 2016 showed that the skyscraper had so far been constructed to the height of <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> tower.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street {{opened on}} March 20, 1933, {{as the first}} station of the IND Culver Line. Service began {{one month after the}} {{expansion}} of the IND into Brooklyn to Jay Street–Borough Hall. The station's construction was expedited in order to both connect with and compete with the Bergen Street and Smith Street streetcar lines of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). Construction was slightly stalled due to delays in the delivery of steel flues for <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{decorative}} {{features of the}} building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built. An ascending orchestra pit and independent Wurlitzer organ platform allowed the musicians to be raised up to main stage height or to orchestra pit level from the basement below. <b>The</b> <b>ventilation</b> system had thermostatic controls throughout the building, and allowed the air to be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.|$|E

Incremental exercise is frequently prescribed {{to the elderly}} and elite athletes, specifically <b>the</b> first <b>ventilation</b> threshold (VT1) {{for the elderly and}} <b>the</b> second <b>ventilation</b> threshold (VT2) for elite athletes.VT is the point of transition between predominantly aerobic energy production to anaerobic energy production. The thresholds reflect the heart rates so as it makes the difficulty of the exercise sensible to participants.|$|R
5|$|Early {{on in the}} project, it was {{announced}} that the new stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations in the Upper East Side) would include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has ventilation towers, rather than <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> grates ubiquitous {{in the rest of the}} subway system.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Bloomberg's {{ceremonial}} ride, {{the opening}} {{date of the}} subway extension was pushed back from June to early fall 2014, then to November 2014, then to February 2015, and then to May 2015. Most of the problems were attributed to the incline elevators being installed in the station, and to <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> fans along the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} {{gateway to}} the northbound tunnel was Grade II listed in 1973, while <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> towers were listed in 2000. In April 1986, the tunnel {{became part of the}} UK trunk road network. It was detrunked and control handed to TfL in September 1999.|$|E
30|$|The {{secondary}} {{outcome measures}} were {{the number of}} scores prescribed and assessed per day of <b>ventilation,</b> <b>the</b> mean COMFORT score, the mean dosages of analgesics and sedatives, <b>the</b> duration of <b>ventilation,</b> <b>the</b> duration of hospitalization, {{and the number of}} nosocomial infections.|$|R
40|$|Increase in {{high-rise}} {{residential building}} {{has changed the}} envelope of residential building to aluminum curtain wall which {{requires the use of}} <b>the</b> single-sided <b>ventilation</b> to be used instead of <b>the</b> cross <b>ventilation.</b> It causes dissatisfaction mainly with indoor air velocity and <b>ventilation</b> volume. Therefore, <b>the</b> objective {{of this study is to}} improve <b>the</b> natural <b>ventilation</b> performance of high-rise residential building by opening design. To improve <b>the</b> natural <b>ventilation</b> performance in single skin façade, the effect of different types of window will be evaluated. Furthermore, evaluation will be performed to evaluate the improvement when double skin façade is applied. This evaluation will be continued to know how to plan openings of double skin façade, such as inlets, outlets and outside façade windows. The evaluations will be carried out using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation program...|$|R

5|$|The episode's {{establishing}} exterior shots, {{and those}} of Tooms' house, were filmed around Hastings Street in Vancouver. When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a storm drain, the production crew arrived too late to secure the street for filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. <b>The</b> <b>ventilation</b> system through which the first victim is attacked at night {{was meant to be}} of a multistory car park. However, to avoid a costly tenting operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> system was built in a lower level of the car park. Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the pilot episode. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the limited range of shots it afforded; most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street.|$|E
5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E

None of the employees care to join him, much to the disappointment of Michael, who plays music through <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> system to try tempting them to come.|$|E
50|$|The {{piston effect}} {{is used in}} tunnel {{ventilation}}. In railway tunnels, the train pushes out the air {{in front of it}} toward <b>the</b> closest <b>ventilation</b> shaft in front, and sucks air into the tunnel from <b>the</b> closest <b>ventilation</b> shaft behind it.

5|$|The Confederate Navy {{originally}} had devised a plan where the James River Squadron would swarm Monitor {{with a party}} of men {{with the intention of}} capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilot house with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot. Others would throw combustibles down <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> openings and smoke holes. At one point Jones made such an attempt to board the vessel but she managed to slip away around the stern of Virginia in time.|$|E
5|$|The fire on {{the boat}} deck {{penetrated}} to a magazine. Evidence given to the second board indicated that the doors for the 4-inch ammunition supply trunks were closed throughout the action. It remains possible that a door or trunk could have been opened up by an enemy shell, admitting flames to the magazine. Alternative routes for admission of flame could have been <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> or venting arrangements of the magazines or, as Ted Briggs suggested, through {{the floor of a}} 15-inch gunhouse.|$|E
5|$|Two {{shipboard}} accidents {{occurred during}} Tritons post-launch fitting-out. On 2 October 1958, {{prior to the}} nuclear reactor fuel being installed, a steam valve failed during testing, causing a large cloud of steam that filled the number two reactor compartment, and on 7 April 1959, a fire broke out during the testing of a deep-fat fryer and spread from the galley into <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> lines of the crew's mess. Both incidents, neither nuclear related, were quickly handled by ship personnel, with Lt. Commander Leslie B. Kelly, the prospective chief engineering officer, being awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his quick action during the incident on 2 October.|$|E

5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the disused tunnels between Borough and King William Street {{stations}} were converted {{for use as}} an air-raid shelter, with entrances to the shelter at King William Street and at six sites south of the Thames (of nine planned). In the 1960s the disused tunnels were used to assist <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> of London Bridge station and all the entrances bar that at 9 London Bridge Street were infilled with concrete. It is now only possible to access the tunnels from Three Castles House or a passage from the Jubilee line at London Bridge. Most of the C's six original station buildings were rebuilt or modified during the improvements to {{the line in the}} 1920s or during more recent modernisations. Only the building at Kennington retains its original exterior and the dome over the lift shaft, a feature of all the original stations.|$|E

5|$|In {{the belief}} {{that it would be}} {{operated}} by smokeless locomotives, the line had been built with little ventilation and a long tunnel between Edgware Road and King's Cross. Initially the smoke-filled stations and carriages did not deter passengers and <b>the</b> <b>ventilation</b> was later improved by making an opening in the tunnel between Gower Street and King's Cross and removing glazing in the station roofs. With the problem continuing after the 1880s, conflict arose between the Met, who wished to make more openings in the tunnels, and the local authorities, who argued that these would frighten horses and reduce property values. This led to an 1897 Board of Trade report, which reported that a pharmacist was treating people in distress after having travelled on the railway with his 'Metropolitan Mixture'. The report recommended more openings be authorised but the line was electrified before these were built.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside.

While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
5|$|Skye {{tries to}} defend them both, {{but when the}} team finds {{evidence}} that Lydon was paid substantially for the information, she turns on him and cooperates with the agents. The team tracks the buyer, Raina, to a Project Centipede facility in Hong Kong, where they are draining Chan's fire-resistant platelets against his will, to use as stabilizers for the extremis serum within their super-soldiers. Chan, angry with this betrayal and with S.H.I.E.L.D. for constricting him, attacks both. He kills, among others, Quan and the Centipede head doctor Debbie. Realizing that Chan can't be reasoned with, Coulson and May inject him with a large dose of extremis, causing him to explode.
