5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. However, all three sessions were disrupted and little running took place. During {{the first session}} on Friday morning, a spillage of diesel on track prevented the cars from going out on until very late in the session. Eventually, Nico Hülkenberg topped the session for Force India, ahead of his compatriots Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Since water was used to clear the surface, the first laps were run on intermediate tyres by most drivers, with both Williams cars being equipped with full wet tyres, but Valtteri Bottas spun on them entering the pit lane. Later, the track dried enough to use slick tyres, Fernando Alonso being the first to do so. Due to the limited running, the last minutes were busy with most cars out on track. Marcus Ericsson however was confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> as he stopped with an engine problem. As Lewis Hamilton spun on his last timed lap, he needed to settle for seventh fastest.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, {{following}} Prussia's victories, the German {{states were}} united into the German Empire, with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent {{to the new}} German monarchy. Although William thought {{the day when he}} became Emperor the saddest of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to a great day in German history. Bismarck, now Chancellor, disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess. Often at odds with his father's and Bismarck's policies and actions, Frederick sided with the country's liberals in their opposition to the expansion of the empire's army. The Crown Prince also became involved in many public works projects, such as the establishment of schools and churches in the area of Bornstedt near Potsdam. To assist his father's effort to turn Berlin, the capital city, into a great cultural centre, he was appointed Protector of Public Museums; it was largely due to Frederick that considerable artistic collections were acquired, housed in Berlin's new Kaiser Friedrich Museum (later known as the Bode Museum) after his death. In 1878, when his father was incapacitated by injury from an assassination attempt, Frederick briefly took over his tasks but was soon relegated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> once again. His lack of influence affected him deeply, even causing him to think about suicide.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the final}} game in the Hall of Fame {{coaching}} career of Bill Parcells, who resigned his position with the Cowboys two weeks later. Parcells would later take a front office position with the Miami Dolphins but never returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b>|$|E
30|$|Although {{the video}} {{reviewer}} was blinded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> assessment {{results and the}} medical diagnosis of concussion for this study, they were only partially blinded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of the HIA. Given that the process for enacting a use of this rule requires <b>the</b> trainer <b>to</b> provide a signal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> and <b>the</b> official on <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> identifies <b>the</b> interchange, the video reviewer was able to identify many instances where the HIA was used.|$|R
30|$|Having a {{reliable}} form for coding and analysing concussion {{can be a}} useful adjunct <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> clinical management strategy of the athletic trainer and team physician.|$|R
50|$|In February 2016, Guðni {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> when he {{took over}} as head coach of KFÍ along with Neil Shiran Þórisson after Birgir Örn Birgisson resigned as coach.|$|R
25|$|The first {{bowl game}} {{scheduled}} for New Year's Day (January 1) was the Outback Bowl, which was played at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, with the SEC's No. 17 University of Tennessee Volunteers challenging the Big Ten's unranked Pennsylvania State University Nittany Lions. Legendary Penn State coach Joe Paterno {{was set to}} return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> after an accident on the sidelines {{left him with a}} knee injury during their game at Wisconsin, but a steady drizzle throughout the game convinced the 80-year-old that he was not ready to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> instead staying in the press box and coaching the game from there. Thanks to an 88-yard return of a fumble for a touchdown by Nittany Lions' cornerback Tony Davis, JoePa won his record-extending 22nd post-season game 20–10. The schools each received a $3 million payment for their conferences. The win left Penn State ranked 24th in the nation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} game of the regular season, Colts Coach Tony Dungy made his return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> {{after the death of}} his eldest son. The Colts faced the Arizona Cardinals at the RCA Dome, and in front of an {{emotional}} and proud crowd. The Colts won this game, 17–13 over the Cardinals, and they dedicated the last two games of the regular season to James Dungy. Colts QB Peyton Manning only played on the first drive of this game, just like the previous game, and Jim Sorgi played at the quarterback position for the rest of the game.|$|E
25|$|The Redskins {{opened up}} the scoring with an 8-play, 78-yard drive that culminated in Rypien's 31-yard {{touchdown}} completion to receiver Art Monk. San Francisco struck back by driving 74 yards in eight plays {{to tie the game}} on a 1-yard touchdown run by fullback Tom Rathman. A key play of the drive was an unnecessary roughness call against Redskins defensive back Darrell Green for throwing Jerry Rice to the ground during a tackle, turning Rice's reception into a 25-yard gain. Green was stunned by the penalty, stating he didn't realize the call was against him until he made his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b> Near the end of the quarter, Redskins kicker Chip Lohmiller made a 44-yard field goal that put Washington back in front at 10-7.|$|E
50|$|His {{highlight}} {{of the year was}} a vicious hit he put on wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. in week one, that forced an incompletion, sent Beckham <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> <b>to</b> recover and broke Wilcox's nose.|$|R
50|$|He {{had a rough}} {{start to}} his stint at Kalmar FF, when he injured his {{anterior}} cruciate ligament in February 2012 during the pre-season. He was forced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> throughout <b>the</b> rest of the year.|$|R
25|$|Lineouts {{are used}} to restart play when the ball has crossed <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b> Players form two {{parallel}} lines perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> and <b>the</b> team that did not put the ball out throws it straight down the middle. Players in the line-out can be lifted by teammates as they attempt <b>to</b> win <b>the</b> ball.|$|R
25|$|The team {{began the}} season {{starting}} 0–5, but rebounded to win six straight. After 8 games, Arenas underwent {{surgery to repair}} a torn medial meniscus in his left knee, {{as well as a}} microfracture surgery. This was the same knee he had injured the previous year. The injury forced Arenas out for a total of 68 games. Midway through the season, Butler was forced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> for a total of 20 games with what initially was a strained hip flexor, but {{turned out to be a}} labral tear. Despite all of the injuries, the Wizards managed to go 43–39 on the regular season, good for 5th place in the Eastern Conference and a first-round playoff matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the third straight season.|$|E
25|$|However, Dravid's {{achievements}} in the ODIs were dwarfed by his {{failures in the}} shorter format of the game. 14 runs from two games in the 1996 Pepsi Sharjah Cup; 20 runs from two innings in the Singer World Series; 65 runs from four innings in the 1997 'Friendship' Cup; 88 runs from four games in the 1998 Coca-Cola Triangular Series including a 22-ball five runs and a 21-ball one run innings, both coming against Bangladesh; 32 runs from four games in the 1998 'Friendship' Cup; a slew of such poor performances often forced him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> of the India ODI squad. By the end of 1998, Dravid had scored 1709 runs in 65 ODIs at a humble average of 31.64 with a poor strike rate of 63.48.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} poor compared {{to his first}} season; his role in Juventus' attack changed, as he became less of a goalscorer and moved more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> taking much part in the build-up play, especially as a target player, and his assist numbers increased. In the 2005–06 season, Juventus fans often got frustrated with him due to his anonymous presence in certain important games such as the Champions League defeat to Arsenal. Juventus were stripped of their last two Scudetti {{as part of the}} verdict from the Calciopoli scandal, and were relegated to Serie B. The new staff tried to persuade Ibrahimović and other top players to stay with Juventus, but the player and his agent were adamant to move on, with Raiola threatening legal action in order to extricate Ibrahimović from his contract.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} league's {{deal with}} Microsoft, coaches will be {{equipped}} with Surface tablets to transmit images of plays taken {{from the top of}} <b>the</b> stadium <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> eliminating <b>the</b> traditional practice of using printed photos and notebooks.|$|R

25|$|In {{the opening}} {{minutes of the}} game, {{it seemed that the}} game would live up to the hype. On the opening kickoff, 49ers rookie kick {{returner}} Derrick Harmon caught the ball too close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> and stepped out of bounds at the San Francisco 6-yard line. The 49ers managed to advance to the 41-yard line but were forced to punt, and Dolphins defensive back Fulton Walker returned the punt 9 yards to the Miami 36-yard line. Then on their first play of the drive, Marino completed a 25-yard pass to Tony Nathan. Five plays later, Miami reached the San Francisco 23-yard line. But on third down, 49ers cornerback Eric Wright tackled wide receiver Mark Clayton 2 yards shy of the first down. Miami had to settle for a 37-yard field goal from Uwe von Schamann.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} drive {{of the second}} half, New England had a 4th-and-2 and chose to punt. However, after the play had been run, Patriots' head coach Bill Belichick {{challenged}} that New York had too many players {{on the field and}} replay confirmed that was the case as Giants linebacker Chase Blackburn was unable to get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> as the ball was being snapped. Therefore, referee Mike Carey reversed the play, and the Giants were penalized 5yards for having too many players on the field, giving the Patriots a first down. The Patriots then drove to the Giants' 25, but Strahan sacked Brady for a 6-yard loss on third down. Then on 4th-and-13, with the ball on the Giants' 31, Belichick decided against a long field goal attempt by Stephen Gostkowski and tried to pick up a first down instead. Brady's pass to Jabar Gaffney was incomplete as it went {{out of the back of}} the end zone and the Giants took over on downs.|$|E

50|$|After beating Rutgers and , the Mountaineers were 9-0. In one of {{the biggest}} games in Mountaineer history, the #4 University of Miami came to Morgantown and played before a record Mountaineer Field crowd of 70,222, a mark that still stands today. The game was close, but Robert Walker won the game when he took a run <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> in <b>the</b> fourth quarter. Up 17-14, with four minutes left, Jake Kelchner threw a 40-yard bomb <b>to</b> seal <b>the</b> game.|$|R
50|$|Cover 6 has the {{disadvantages}} of both Cover 2 and Cover 4. The field side is generally soft on flat coverage. The field side corner {{can be left}} in single coverage deep as well.

The Boundary side is hard behind <b>the</b> corner <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> {{as well as in}} the seam between corner and linebacker.|$|R
25|$|Tebow started against Kentucky despite {{suffering}} from a respiratory illness and taking two bags of intravenous fluids before the game. He ran for two touchdowns {{to put him in}} 2nd place on the all-time SEC touchdown list and he also threw for a touchdown. Late in the third quarter, he was hit in the chest by Kentucky defensive end Taylor Wyndham, fell backwards, and hit {{the back of his head}} on the knee of Florida tackle Marcus Gilbert, who was wearing a hard knee brace. Upon impact, Tebow briefly displayed a prominent fencing response with his left arm, indicating that a concussion had taken place. He lay motionless for several minutes before being helped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> where he vomited. He was taken by ambulance to the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center. A CT scan showed no bleeding in the brain, with the injury described as a mild concussion. Coach Urban Meyer stayed the night in the hospital with Tebow, who was discharged in the morning. Coincidentally, Florida did not have a game scheduled for the following Saturday, and Tebow was cleared to play in the Gators' next contest at LSU on October 10, two weeks after the incident.|$|E
500|$|Congressional expert Norm Ornstein {{writes that}} Hastert [...] "blew up" [...] the House's [...] "regular order," [...] which is [...] "a mix {{of rules and}} norms that allows debate, deliberation, and {{amendments}} in committees and on the House floor, that incorporates and does not shut out the minority (even if it still loses most of the time), that takes bills that pass both houses to a conference committee to reconcile differences, [...] that allows time for members and staff to read, digest, and analyze bills." [...] Ornstein commented that [...] "no speaker did more to relegate the regular order <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> than Hastert. ... The House is a very partisan institution, with rules structured to give even tiny majorities enormous leverage. But Hastert took those realities to {{a new and more}} tribalized, partisan plane." [...] Despite this shift, Hastert was widely seen as [...] "affable" [...] and low-key; he did not seek the limelight, [...] "become a regular on Sunday talk shows or anything close to a household word or figure," [...] or [...] "openly exhibit the kind of snarling or mean partisan demeanor that made Tom DeLay such a mark of hatred for Democrats." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B on an A+ to F scale, writing that the [...] "episode didn’t really take {{advantage}} of Jack Burton's return to the show. Instead, it pushed him off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> {{to make room for}} a storyline that had no earthly business in this episode." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a nice break from the Volkoff drama". Melody Simpson of Buzz Focus wrote, [...] "This story line has the potential to bring lots of drama but the way that it has been building up to this moment." [...] Stephen Lackey of Mania called the episode [...] "fun stuff just lacking in drama where drama was required." [...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse wrote that the episode reminded her [...] "of all the reasons I fell in love with this show a year ago. It's fun, and funny without being campy, but more importantly, it's got heart. It's an episode that made me think, 'This is why people fight for this show season after season.' If it helps turn out more episodes like these, Gary Cole can drop by anytime he likes. I, for one, will be glad to see him." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 31, 2011, Tanev had to {{be helped}} off the ice during {{a game against the}} Los Angeles Kings after {{opposing}} forward Kyle Clifford pushed him head-first into the end-boards. While recovering from the upper-body injury, he was returned to the Moose on April 7, as several regular defencemen returned to the Canucks line-up from injury at that time. Averaging 13 minutes of ice time per game over 29 NHL contests with one assist, Tanev was commended by Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault for being [...] "very dependable...making the high-percentage plays." [...] Vigneault also added that he had a good chance of playing with the Canucks [...] "on a regular basis down the road." [...] Completing the 2010–11 regular season with the Moose, he finished with 1 goal and 8 assists over 39 AHL games. Tanev added a goal and 2 assists in 14 playoff games as the Moose were defeated in the second round. Following Manitoba's elimination, he was called up to the Canucks for their playoff run as a reserve. In the Canucks' Game 3 contest against the San Jose Sharks in the third round, defencemen Christian Ehrhoff and Aaron Rome were both injured. Tanev was inserted into the line-up for the following game and made his NHL playoff debut on May 22, 2011. As the Canucks moved on to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Boston Bruins, Ehrhoff and Rome returned to action, temporarily sending Tanev back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b> Following injuries to Dan Hamhuis and Rome's suspension, Tanev played in the final three contests of the series, which the Canucks lost in seven games.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{looked to}} rebound to their {{championship}} ways in 1988 but {{the start of}} the season was marred by controversy surrounding Taylor. He tested positive for cocaine and was suspended by the league for thirty days, as it was his second violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy. The first result in 1987 had been kept private and was not known to the public at the time. He was kept away from the press during this period and checked himself into rehab in early September. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. This was especially true given the eventual career paths of talented players like Hollywood Henderson and others whose drug problems derailed their careers. The Giants went 2–2 in the games Taylor missed. When Taylor returned he was his usual dominant self as he led the team in sacks again, with 15.5 in 12 games played. The season also contained some of the more memorable moments of Taylor's career. In a crucial late-season game with playoff implications against the New Orleans Saints, Taylor played through a torn pectoral muscle to record seven tackles, three sacks, and two forced fumbles. Taylor's presence in the lineup was important as the Giants' offense was having trouble mounting drives, and was dominated in time of possession. Television cameras repeatedly cut <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> to show him in extreme physical pain as he was being attended to by the Giants staff. Taylor had already developed a reputation for playing through pain; in a 1983 game against the Eagles the team's training staff had to hide his helmet to prevent the injured Taylor from returning to the field. Taylor's shoulder was so injured that he had to wear a harness to keep it in its place. The Giants held on for a 13–12 win, and Parcells later called Taylor's performance [...] "he greatest game I ever saw." [...] However, the Giants narrowly missed the playoffs in 1988 at 10–6 by losing tie-breakers with the Eagles in their division and the Rams for the Wild card.|$|E
