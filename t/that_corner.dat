This irregularity {{is due to the}} Town of Hanover's 1873 seizure of part of the southeast corner of the Green, which it used to straighten Wheelock Street.

The defense argued {{that they might have}} died even with medical attention, and Corner was acquitted. To the dismay of the Christian Scientists' Association (the secretary resigned), Eddy distanced herself from Corner, telling the Boston Globe <b>that</b> <b>Corner</b> had only attended the college for one term and had never entered the obstetrics class.|$|E

40|$|In {{this series}} of experiments, based on Biederman 2 ̆ 7 s Recognition by Components theory, we {{postulate}} <b>that</b> <b>corners</b> (vertices) of objects are crucial in programming and execution of goal-directed action. We used a distractor interference paradigm to present line drawings of letters (M and W) with distractors (also M and W), which were either nondegraded or degraded (<b>that</b> is, <b>corners</b> or line segments missing). Degraded distractors caused less interference overall (reduced response times and errors) than Nondegraded distractors, when these were presented peripherally or at fixation (Experiments 1 and 2). When presented at fixation, however, distractors with corners missing caused greater interference than distractors with line segments missing. This pattern was not replicated with non-identical, non-mirror reversed stimuli (H and E: Experiment 3). We speculate <b>that</b> <b>corners</b> are critical in determining the extent of distractor interference. When missing from view, and given sufficient attentional resources and structural similarity, they may be reconstructed by the visuomotor system to aid performance to the target...|$|R

25|$|From 1940–65, the University of Miami {{baseball}} team played their games at {{a field in}} {{the southwest corner of}} the block where the stadium sat.

There was also a softball field to the east across the driveway—during football season, the baseball and softball fields were both used for parking. The Hurricanes opened a new ballpark in 1973, and Miami Field's small seating area was demolished, with the land occupied by the two fields reconfigured into full-time parking areas.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{straightforward}} to verify by a case analysis that this function ' satisfies the required monotonicity property of a haven. If [...] and X has fewer than two vertices, or X has two vertices {{that are not}} the two neighbors of a corner vertex of the grid, then {{there is only one}} X-flap and it contains every Y-flap. In the remaining case, X consists of the two neighbors of a corner vertex and has two X-flaps: one consisting of <b>that</b> <b>corner</b> vertex, and another (chosen as '(X)) consisting of the six remaining vertices. No matter which vertex is added to X to form Y, there will be a Y-flap with at least four vertices, which must be the unique largest flap since it contains {{more than half of the}} vertices not in Y. This large Y-flap will be chosen as '(Y) and will be a subset of '(X). Thus in each case monotonicity holds.|$|E
