For this reason [...] pholcids have sometimes been called [...] "vibrating spiders", although {{they are not the}} only species to exhibit this behavior. Doing so might make it difficult for a predator <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> where the spider is, may be intended to signal an assumed rival to leave, or may increase the chances of capturing insects that have just brushed their web and are still hovering nearby.

It was half-past six when we reached Benson’s lock, and dusk was drawing on, {{and she began to}} get excited then. She said she must be in to supper.

He felt confused and rattled. He had known, {{when he went to the}} manager's room to make his statement, that there would be trouble. But, then, trouble is such an elastic word. It embraces a hundred degrees of meaning. Mike had expected sentence of dismissal, and he had got it. So far he had nothing to complain of. But he had not expected it to come to him riding high on the crest of a great, frothing wave of verbal denunciation. Mr Bickersdyke, through constantly speaking in public, had developed the habit of fluent denunciation to a remarkable extent. He had thundered at Mike as if Mike had been his Majesty's Government or the Encroaching Alien, or something of that sort. And that kind of thing is a little overwhelming at short range. Mike's head was still spinning.|$|E
50|$|If {{a genetic}} cause is {{suspected}} {{and little else}} {{is known about the}} illness, then it remains <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>exactly</b> how many genes are involved in the phenotypic expression of the disease.

Generally, what makes the two individuals different are likely to be environmental factors. Due to the involved nature of genetic investigations needed to determine such inheritance patterns, this is not usually the first avenue of investigation one would choose to determine etiology.|$|R

50|$|If the {{defendant}} impedes the probation officer's investigation, e.g. {{by failing to}} disclose all prior convictions and arrests, his sentence may be increased for obstruction of justice and failure to accept responsibility, even if the undisclosed information {{has no effect on}} his criminal history score.

60|$|On the {{following}} day he again acknowledged the necessity of going about the place,--so that the feeling of mystery might, if possible, be gradually dissipated,--and he {{went out for a}} walk. He roamed down towards the cliffs, and there sat in solitude, looking out upon the waters. His mind was still intent upon the book. Oh, if the book could be buried there below the sea,--be drowned and no hand of his be necessary for the drowning! As he sat there, feeling himself constrained to remain away from the house for a certain period, he fell asleep by degrees and dreamed. He dreamt that he was out there in a little boat all alone, with the book hidden under the seats, and that he rowed himself out to sea till he was so far distant from the shore that no eye could see him. Then he lifted the book, and was about to rid himself for ever of his burden,--when there came by a strong man swimming. The man looked up at him so as <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> what he was doing, and the book was not thrown over, and the face of the swimming man was the face of that young Cantor who had been so determined in his assertion that another will had been made.|$|E

When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound {{that there was a}} slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose.

6000|$|Mike, when night fell, {{moved away}} toward the castle, which lay {{about a quarter}} of a mile from the village. Approaching to within fifty yards of the gate, he sat down to watch. About eleven o'clock he heard the creak of the gate, and {{presently}} was startled by seeing two horsemen ride past him. [...] "They must have muffled their horses' feet," [...] he said to himself. [...] "They are up to no good. I wish there had only been one of them." [...] Mike slipped off his shoes and started in pursuit, keeping just far enough behind the horsemen to enable him to observe the outline of their figures. For half a mile they proceeded quietly. Then they stopped, dismounted, removed the cloths from their horses' feet, and remounting rode forward at a gallop. Mike's old exercise as a runner now rendered him good service. He could already tell, by the direction which the horsemen were taking, that they were bearing to the east of Edinburgh, but he resolved to follow as far as possible in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> whither they went. The road, or rather track, lay across a moorland country. The ground was often deep and quaggy, and the horsemen several times checked their speed, and went at a slow walk, one advancing on foot along the track to guide the way. These halts allowed breathing time for Mike, who found it hard work to keep near them when going at full speed. At last, after riding for an hour, the horsemen halted at a solitary house on the moorland, Here several horses, held by troopers, were standing. Mike crept round to the back of the house, and looked in at the window. He saw two English officers sitting by a fire, while a light burned on a table. Mike at once recognized in one of them the dreaded General Cromwell, whom he had seen at Drogheda.|$|E
