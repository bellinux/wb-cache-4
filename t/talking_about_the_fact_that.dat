2500|$|The last of McManaman's caps came in 2001 when Sven-Göran Eriksson {{utilised}} him for {{his first}} games in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, including a game back at Anfield against Finland – where McManaman set up David Beckham's winner– but then apparently {{left a message on}} McManaman's answering machine to inform him {{that he was not going}} to be in the final World Cup squad in early 2002. Despite the pleas of McManaman's Real Madrid team mates Zidane and Fernando Hierro for McManaman's case, McManaman said he never ever heard from or met Eriksson again. Zidane went on to state England had made a mistake, and described McManaman with a rare passion as one of the highest quality players he ever played with: [...] "I was surprised when McManaman was left out of the last England squad. I couldn't believe they would ignore a player of his quality. Now people are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> maybe he will get his chance because David Beckham is injured. But McManaman is far better than just being a replacement for Beckham. McManaman should be in the starting line-up anyway." [...] Support for McManaman also came before the 2002 World Cup in the British media, after Sky Sports published an article based on OPTA statistics, revealing that despite a poor goalscoring record, McManaman had in fact an 88% dribbling completion rate (having embarked on a run every 17 minutes), and an 84% pass completion rate, all three of which were higher by over 15% than any English midfield Premiership player at the time.|$|E

Gyula Hegedűs recalled the new public in this way: [...] "the face of the theatre's viewership has changed. Again it is filled with flashy, loud folks. Again they arrive late, and again they cough often and loudly. This newly enriched layer of society had never seen the boom created by the Vígszínház.

5000|$|Rothman and Swartz left Dimension in 1975. She {{tried to}} break out the {{exploitation}} field but struggled. I had good agents and together we {{tried very hard to}} get me work, but we repeatedly discovered I was stigmatized by the films I had made. The irony was that I made them in order to prove that I had the skills to make more ambitious films, but no one would give me the chance. Then there was the other reason, the so-called elephant in the room: I was a woman. No one told me directly, but I often learned indirectly that this was the decisive reason why many producers wouldn't agree to meet me. If that sounds exaggerated, remember that I worked in the American film industry from 1965 to 1974, and some of those years I was the only woman directing feature films.She later elaborated:I couldn't get any work in television. No one would even meet me... When it came to feature films, I was once invited by an executive at MGM to go and meet her, which was in the days when there were very few female filmmakers at all. I went and met her and she said to me, [...] "We were in a story meeting yesterday.

[...] Rothman sold a script, Carhops, which was later filmed as Starhops (1978), but it was changed {{to such a degree that}} Rothman took her name off it.

One is a race to the bottom – local authorities undercutting their competitors and undermining tax basis. The other fears relate to the opposite scenario, a `race to the top'. Would some councils set very high tax rates and waste the revenues on useless programmes and bureaucracy?
