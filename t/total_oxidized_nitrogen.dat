MATCH is an Eulerian atmospheric dispersion model, including physical and chemical processes goveming sources, atmospheric transport and sinks of oxidized sulfur and <b>oxidized</b> and reduced <b>nitrogen.</b> Using a combination of air and precipitation chemistry measurements and the MATCH model, the national and long-range transport contributions to air pollution and deposition can be quantified in the model region. The calculations for the year 1991 show that the Swedish import was about 4. 5 times larger than the export for sulfur and about six times larger for reduced nitrogen, while the Swedish import of <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> only exceeded the export by 10 %. Using the MATCH system we estimate the long-range transport in an independent way compared to EMEP.

A multiday pollution episode occurred during which elevated NOx and NOy were observed with enhanced levels of O 3, CO, and condensation nuclei.

The correlation between ozone and CO is reasonably good, although the relation is driven by the single pollution episode observed during the study. The correlation of O 3 with NOy and with NOy-NOx is complicated by the presumed NOy removal processes in the marine boundary layer.

Differences in the water quality of six tributaries to the lagoon following wet and dry weather periods are compared for 19 parameters, including nutrients and toxicant metals. The results suggest that dry weather flows tend to transport pollutants at higher concentrations but have lower total pollutant loads than wet weather flows. Comparisons with national water quality standards indicate that guideline values are routinely exceeded, especially during wet weather events, for the following parameters: nutrients (<b>total</b> <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> ammonia, and phosphate), turbidity, aluminium, copper, iron and zinc.

This leachate was used as feed to a pilot-scale BAF at influent COD and ammoniacal-nitrogen concentrations of 765 mg/l and 568 mg/ l respectively. During an initial period of stable operation without pH control, 33 % of influent ammonia was removed. The reactor pH was 9. 2 with little conversion to <b>total</b> <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (< 45 mg/l). Therefore this removal was accounted for primarily by air stripping. In a second period of stable operation, the reactor pH was reduced to pH 7. 2 by addition of hydrochloric acid.

For five sites representing different benthic cover types across the reef system, carbonate production is determined using hydrochemical techniques that incubate substrates in a local aquarium and measure total alkalinity, total ammonia nitrogen, and <b>total</b> <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> Local estimates are scaled up to the reef-system scale using a WorldView- 2 satellite image, which is ground truthed against a field data set of 350 spatially referenced records of benthic assemblage.

The minimal difference (0. 3 %) between these estimates is attributed to under representation of small carbonate producers, such as benthic foraminifera, which are difficult to incorporate in the underwater video methodology employed to populate census budgets.

3000|$|The {{multiple}} regression analyses indicated salinity was significantly correlated with the coverage of P. tuberculosa, however, {{the range of the}} salinity did not fluctuate much among locations. Salinity ranged from 29.8 to 32.2 ‰, levels that are within normal seawater ranges (Coles and Jokiel 1992). Despite some locations in this study being located close to river mouths, salinity did not reach the low levels as seen in Meng et al. (2008), where locations next to stream outlets dropped to 5 - 15 ‰. The non-significant correlation observed in this study between the abundance of P. tuberculosa and nutrient input may be due to nutrient levels being low compared to Costa et al. (2008). Furthermore, the sampling timing of this study may have influenced the results of water parameters as all the water was sampled during high tide, when runoff of nutrients into the sea maybe more difficult to observe than during low tide. This could explain why the range for salinity was small and no strong relationships were observed between other environmental parameters and P. tuberculosa distribution in this study.

Longrange transport from outside the Neuse/Pamlico system in North Carolina is an important contributor to the total (wet + dry) deposition of nitrogen to the watershed, estuary and Sound. We need to delimit the extent of long-range transport that significantly contributes to deposition and thus loadings.

40|$|In {{contrast}} with the textbook view of remote chemistry where HNO 3 formation is the primary sink of nitrogen oxides, recent theoretical analyses show that formation of RONO 2 (ΣANs) from isoprene and other terpene precursors is the primary net chemical loss of nitrogen oxides over the remote continents where the concentration of nitrogen oxides is low. This then increases the prominence of questions concerning the chemical lifetime and ultimate fate of ΣANs. We present observations of nitrogen oxides and organic molecules collected over the Canadian boreal forest during the summer that show that ΣANs account for ~ 20 % of <b>total</b> <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and that their instantaneous production rate is larger than that of HNO 3. This confirms the primary role of reactions producing ΣANs as a control over the lifetime of NO x (NO x = NO + NO 2) in remote, continental environments. However, HNO 3 is generally present in larger concentrations than ΣANs indicating that the atmospheric lifetime of ΣANs is shorter than the HNO 3 lifetime. We investigate a range of proposed loss mechanisms that would explain the inferred lifetime of ΣANs finding that in combination with deposition, two processes {{are consistent with the}} observations: (1) rapid ozonolysis of isoprene nitrates where at least ~ 40 % of the ozonolysis products release NO x from the carbon backbone and/or (2) hydrolysis of particulate organic nitrates with HNO 3 as a product.

40|$|The {{formation}} of organic nitrates (RONO 2) represents an important NO x (NO x = NO + NO 2) sink in remote and rural continental atmosphere thus impacting ozone production and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. In these remote and rural environments, the organic nitrates are primarily derived from biogenic {{volatile organic compounds}} (BVOCs) such as isoprene and monoterpenes. Although there are numerous studies investigating the {{formation of}} SOA from monoterpenes, there are few studies investigating monoterpene gas phase chemistry. Using a regional chemical transport model with an extended representation of organic nitrate chemistry we investigate the processes controlling the production and fate of monoterpene nitrates (MTNs) over the boreal forest of Canada. MTNs account for 5 – 12 % of <b>total</b> <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> over the boreal forest and production via NO 3 chemistry {{is more important than}} production via OH when the NO x mixing ratio is greater than 75 pptv. The regional responses are investigated for two oxidation pathways of MTNs: one that returns NO x to the atmosphere and one that converts MTNs to a nitrate that behaves like HNO 3. The likely situation is in between and these two assumptions bracket the uncertainty about this chemistry. In the case where the MTNs return NO x after oxidation, their formation represents a net chemical NO x loss that exceeds the net loss to peroxy nitrate formation. When oxidation of MTNs produces a molecule that behaves like HNO 3, HNO 3 and MTNs are nearly equal chemical sinks for NO x. This uncertainty in the oxidative fate of MTNs results in changes in NO x of 8 – 14 %, in O 3 of up to 3 %, and in OH of 3 – 6 % between the two model simulations...|$|E

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) O 3 measurements, and EPA Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) nitrate deposition data. CASTNet data show declining wet and dry nitrate deposition since the late 1990 s, with total (wet plus dry) nitrate deposition fluxes decreasing linearly in proportion to reductions of NO x emissions in in Alabama and Georgia. Annual nitrate deposition rates at Georgia and Alabama CastNet sites correspond to 30  % of Georgia emission rates and 36  % of Alabama emission rates, respectively. The fraction of NOx emissions lost to deposition has not changed over time. SEARCH and EPA CASTNet sites exhibit comparable downward trends in mean annual nitric acid (HNO 3) concentrations. Mean annual <b>total</b> <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (NO y) mixing ratios at SEARCH sites declined in proportion to NO x emission reductions.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the application and effects of pressure on an aerobic biological wastewater treatment process. For the purpose of the investigation two specially designed, identical, laboratory-scale rotating biological contactor (RBC) units were constructed. One of these was held in a steel pressure vessel while the reference unit was operated open to the atmosphere. The treatment capabilities of the pressurized unit, as compared to those of the reference unit, were determined for a variety of organic loadings at increasing pressures up to a limit of 6 bar. During the investigation, the substrate employed was a synthetic wastewater made up frequently in the laboratory. Most of the analytical work was carried out on composite druly samples of the feed wastewater and of the two effluents produced, both filtered and nonfiltered. In addition, sludge samples from both units were regularly tested for a variety of sludge parameters. The water quality parameters investigated were the 5 -day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5), the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Suspended Solids, pH, Temperature, Ammoniacal Nitrogen and <b>Total</b> <b>Oxidized</b> <b>Nitrogen</b> (TON). The yield of sludge produced and certain characteristics of sludge i. e. Specific Stirred Volume Index (SSVl). Specific Resistance to Filtration, were also obtained. The quantity of air required for the pressurized treatment unit was also investigated. The pressurized treatment unit has demonstrated the capability of operating {{with a high level of}} carbonaceous oxidation and nitrification at organic loadings of up to 13 g BOD 5 / m 2 of disc area per day. In comparison with the identical reference unit operated at atmospheric pressure, the pressurized unit demonstrated slightly improved BODs and COD removal efficiencies, a greatly improved level of nitrification and a substantially lower sludge production. All these characteristics improved with increasing pressure. Of particular importance the sludge yield coefficient was always significantly lower for the pressurized unit than for the reference unit and results such as 0. 12 kg dry solids/ kg BOD 5 removed at 6 bar pressure are highly signif 1 cant with regard to the requirements of the modern wastewater treatment industry. Additional investigations were carried out to determine the cost of a proposed full-scale pressurized treatment unit with a design based upon the findings of this investigation. These were compared with the costs of a conventional biological treatment process capable of treating an equivalent wastewater loading. The comparison between the pressurized unit and the selected processes were made for three populations (500, 1, 000 and 3, 000 persons). The sludge disposal costs of the pressurized unit were appreciably lower than those for the other processes. The results indicated that the cost of the pressurized unit (present value for a twenty-year period) and the costs of activated sludge and conventional RBC processes were found to be similar for the smaller populations. However a substantial saving could be obtained with the pressurized unit for the larger populations. In addition there is an indication that the land requirement of the pressurized treatment unit decreases appreciably as the flow rate increases...|$|E
40|$|The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) {{province}} is {{subjected to}} a range of episodic physical disturbances, the most dramatic of which are tropical cyclones. On average, two tropical cyclones cross the coast between 15 ° S and 21 ° S per year. These disturbances of the shelf system result in the elevation of the concentrations of suspended solids, particulate and dissolved nutrients in the water column. This study attempts to quantify the potential input of nutrients into GBR waters as a result of resuspension of shelf sediments by cyclones, to describe shelf area differences in the magnitude of this process, to assess the changes in nutrient concentrations within the water column following a sediment resuspension event and in particular the processes contributing to the elevation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations following a cyclone. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory to investigate temporal trends in nutrient concentration and speciation after the initial prompt release of nutrients from resuspended sediment. Subsequent daily changes in the initially enhanced concentration were not large (< 2 -fold range). The pattern of temporal changes in nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations differed between individual experiments. Concentrations of particulate nitrogen (PN) and phosphorus (PP) were largely constant for a few days during the experimental periods after being released from sediments. For the most part, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) concentrations in seawater with suspended sediment and controls were similar and stable through time. Ammonium (NH₄⁺), nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻) concentrations fluctuated over time. Inorganic phosphate (P 0 ₄³⁻) and silicate (Si(OH) ₄) concentrations decreased after the initial release from the sediment. Chlorophyll a (chl a) released from sediment increased after about a week of the experimental period while phaeophytin concentrations were stable throughout the experimental period. Thus, the immediate effect of cyclonic sediment resuspension on nutrient concentrations and speciation can be assessed by the measurement of water samples taken up to several days after the passage of a cyclone. Comparison of amounts of nutrient release from both the inner and outer shelf sediments was carried out. The amounts of suspended solids (r² = 0. 8), PN (r² = 0. 7), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN, r² = 0. 6), DON (r² = 0. 4), PP (r² = 0. 4), P 0 ₄³⁻ (r² = Si(OH) ₄ (r² = 0. 4), phaeophytin (r² = 0. 4, 0. 6) released were directly related to the mass of sediment resuspended into the water column. However, not all nutrient species followed this pattern, most likely due to vertical patchiness of NH₄⁺, NO₂⁻ and DOP in the sediment column and the high variability in these nutrient stocks between sediment sites. Laboratory resuspension experiments showed that shelf sediments contributed significant amounts of total N, total P, PN, PP, NH₄⁺, <b>total</b> <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (NO₃⁻ plus NO₂⁻), P 0 ₄³⁻, Si(OH) ₄, chl a and phaeophytin to the water column as a result of sediment resuspension. The amounts of total phosphorus, chl a and total pigments promptly released differed between sediment types (P < 0. 05). Amounts of chl a and total pigments derived from resuspended inner shelf sediments were greater than from outer shelf sediments. More phosphorus was promptly released from outer shelf sediments. The prompt releases of the remaining nutrient species (total N, PN, DON, NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻, PP, DOP, P 0 ₄³⁻, Si(OH) ₄, phaeophytin) were unrelated to sediment type. DON, DOP, individual NO₃⁻ and NO₂⁻ concentrations in the water column, were not significantly increased as a result of simulated shelf sediment resuspension events. This was due to the difficulty of detecting small changes in concentrations of NO₃⁻ and NO₂⁻ which were low in sediment stocks and remained close to analytical detection limits and high existing DON and DOP concentrations in the water column. A comparison was made of the amount of nutrients released promptly by resuspension of sediment from sites within inner, mid- and outer shelf areas. The estimates of nutrient release are presented in three groups, normalized to volume of wet weight of sediment, volume of water-free sediment and estimated porosity of the sediment. The calculated amounts of 10. 5 - 28. 0 μmol of total N, 0. 1 - 0. 6 μmol of total P and 0. 2 - 2. 6 μmol of Si(OH) ₄ promptly released from cubic centimetre of wet sediment. The calculated amounts of 0. 1 - 3. 8 μg of chl a and 0. 7 - 5. 7 μg of phaeophytin were accumulated by stimulation of sediment resuspension. Ammonium and nitrite oxidation rates in sediment-amended seawater were compared using two techniques: dark ¹⁴C-bicarbonate uptake with and without added nitrification inhibitors (Nitrapyrin, Allylthiourea, Hach 2533) and the oxidation of ¹⁵N labelled tracers. Nitrapyrin (N-serve) was found to be the most efficient inhibitor of ammonium oxidation. Higher concentrations of nitrapyrin (50 mg 1 ⁻¹) were required as compared to previous studies, because sediment particles adsorbed nitrapyrin and also hindered the isotope measurements. The high concentration of nitrapyrin required may have affected nitrification rate, resulting in an apparent high rate of N-serve sensitive dark carbon bicarbonate uptake. Ammonium oxidation rates measured by ¹⁵N techniques ranged from 0. 4 to 6. 0 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹. Ammonium oxidation rates in seawater with either freshly collected sediment (range 1. 2 - 6. 0 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) or frozen-thawed sediment (0. 9 - 4. 7 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) were significantly higher than rates in the control seawater (range 0. 4 - 3. 9 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) (P < 0. 05). Ammonium oxidation rates in the seawater with frozen-thawed sediment did not differ from rates measured in seawater mixed with freshly collected sediment. Nitrite oxidation rates were measured in experiments involving both ¹⁵NH₄⁺ and ¹⁵NO₂⁻ additions. The nitrite oxidation rates obtained from experiments with ¹⁵NO 2 additions were always higher than the rates obtained with ¹⁵NH₄⁺ addition. The differences resulting from ¹⁵NO₂⁻ additions compared to ¹⁵NH₄⁺ additions were likely due to contamination of the nitrate samples by pre-existing nitrite. Nitrite oxidation rates measured in samples with freshly collected sediment added were 2 - to 3 -fold higher than rates in seawater with frozen-thawed sediment added where ¹⁵NO₂⁻ was used as the ¹⁵N source. Nitrite oxidation rates measured in experiments with ¹⁵NH₄⁺ additions (range = 0. 2 to 1. 5 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) in seawater with sediment added were significantly higher than rates in control seawater (0. 2 to 1. 2 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹). Nitrite oxidation rates (with ¹⁵NH₄⁺ addition) measured in seawater with freshly collected sediment differed from rates measured in seawater with frozen-thawed sediment (by a factor of 0. 1 - 1. 2). Uptake rates of ammonium, nitrite and nitrate were measured by ¹⁵N techniques. Overall, ammonium uptake rates were higher (2. 6 - 82. 2 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) than uptake of either nitrate (0. 3 - 16. 8 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) or nitrite (0. 1 - 9. 8 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹). Ammonium uptake rates in seawater with freshly collected sediment added (37. 7 - 82. 2 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) were significantly higher than rates measured in seawater with frozen-thawed sediment (4. 3 - 57. 0 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) and in the control (2. 6 - 39. 1 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) (P < 0. 05). Likewise, nitrate uptake rates in seawater with the freshly collected sediment added were significantly higher than rates measured in the control (0. 3 - 1. 0 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹). The nitrate uptake rates measured in seawater with freshly collected sediment (9. 7 - 16. 8 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) did not differ from rates measured in seawater mixed with frozen-thawed sediment (8. 7 - 16. 5 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹). In contrast, nitrite uptake rates in seawater with frozen-thawed sediment added (0. 3 - 9. 8 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹) were significantly higher than control seawater (0. 1 - 1. 33 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹), but did not differ from rates measured in seawater with freshly collected sediment added (2. 8 - 3. 0 nmol N 1 ⁻¹ h⁻¹). Measured anaplerotic ¹⁴C uptake/¹⁵N oxidation ratios (0. 5 - 0. 7) were high compared to ratios reported from previous studies (0. 06 - 0. 2). This was due to potential differences between tropical and temperate systems, the differences between behaviour of bacteria populations in culture media and natural seawater, or side effects of the nitrification inhibitor. Therefore, to estimate nitrification rates in any systems by ¹⁴C method, calibration of the C uptake/N oxidation ratio for that system is required...|$|E
40|$|Nitrous oxide (N,O) {{concentrations}} in several lakes which varied in size, depth, and trophic state were {{strongly influenced by}} oxygen concentration. High concentrations of N 20 (343 pg N,O*litcr-l) {{were found in the}} metalimnion of a eutrophic lake during early spring stratifi-cation when hypolimnetic 0, and NO 3 - were already being depleted. Up to 4 Fg N 20 * liter-l were observed in oxygenated NO, [...] containing bottom waters where both nitrification and denitrification were likely occurring. Nitrous oxide is sometimes a major product of the dissimilatory reduction of N 03 - during denitrification (Knowles 1981) but it is also released during oxi-dation of NH 4 + to NO,- by nitrifying bac-teria, where it represents usually about 0. 3 %, but occasionally up to lo%, of the <b>total</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxidized</b> (Goreau et al. 1980). The actual mechanism by which N 20 is produced in specific ecosystems is a subject of current debate (Delwiche 1981). Many of the recent investigators of N,O in aquatic systems have sought to evalu-ate such systems as actual or potential sources or sinks for atmospheric N,O. Elkins et al. (1978) and Kaplan et al. (1978) showed that the shallow Concord Ponds and other freshwater lakes could act as either sources or sinks for N 20 de-pending on their trophic state and other properties, Lemon and Lemon (1981) showed that the shallower and warme...|$|R
40|$|Poland {{has one of}} {{the largest}} sulfur and {{nitrogen}} emissions in Europe. This is mainly because coal is a main fuel in industrial and nonindustrial combustion. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the amount of sulfur and nitrogen deposited from SNAP sector O- 2 (nonindustrial sources) coal combustion. To assess this issue, the Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multipollutant Exchange (FRAME) model was used. The results suggest that industrial combustion has the largest impact on deposition of oxidized sulfur, whereas the <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> national deposition budget is dominated by transboundary transport. The total mass of pollutants deposited in Poland, originating from nonindustrial coal combustion, is 45 Gg of sulfur and 2. 5 Gg of nitrogen, which,is over 18 % of oxidized sulfur and nearly 2 % of <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> deposited. SNAP O- 2 is responsible for up to 80 % of dry-deposited sulfur and 11 % of nitrogen. The contribution to wet deposition is largest in central Poland in the case of sulfur and in some areas can exceed 11 %. For <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> nonindustrial emissions contribute less than 1 % over the whole area of Poland. The switch from coal to gas fuel in this sector will result in benefits in sulfur and nitrogen deposition reduction...|$|R

40|$|Real-time control {{strategies}} were developed for biological systems requiring {{exposure to a}} number of different redox environments. The approach taken was to develop control strategies under static redox conditions, and then merge them into a unified scheme. The anoxic system studied consisted of the removal of <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> by Pseudomonas denitrificans. A control strategy that was based on detecting an inflection point in the transient ORP signal was applied. The inflection point was detected by searching for a minimum in the first derivative. Using this approach, all of the nitrate and nitrite was removed each cycle. Aerobic removal of toluene, performed by Pseudomonas putida, was then studied. In this system, the optimal strategy involved the second derivative of the transient ORP signal, and resulted in toluene removal efficiencies on the order of 95 % per cycle. Finally, an attempt was made to automate a process requiring exposure to both anoxic and aerobic environments. In this system, <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> was removed under anoxic conditions, while carbon removal continued under an aerobic environment. Both processes were mediated by Pseudomonas denitrificans. This attempt was only partially successful. While little <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> remained {{at the end of the}} anoxic cycle, a significant amount of nitrite reappeared in the medium upon exposure to aerobic conditions. This result served to indicate the importance of the transition zone, and the difficulties associated with controlling sequential environments...|$|R

Revising the NO 2 + HO · → HNO 3 rate coefficient improves model performance of <b>oxidized</b> <b>nitrogen</b> partitioning by increasing NO x concentrations in the upper troposphere and decreasing HNO 3 throughout the troposphere. The increase in NO x concentrations has a corresponding global increase in O 3 concentrations and local increases in sulfate aerosols, causing a perturbation in simulated radiative effects.
