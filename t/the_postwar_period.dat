5|$|After its {{founding}} in 1915, a large source of the Avery Brundage Company's business was wartime government contracts. Brundage, who applied for a commission in the Army Ordnance Corps but was rejected, in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> {{became a member of}} the Construction Division Association, composed of men who had built facilities for the military, and later became its president from 1926 to 1928.|$|E
5|$|The volume {{continues}} briefly through <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> where harsh experiences persisted {{even after}} slavery ended. For example, Black Codes apprenticeship laws were {{a means for}} former slaveowners to own the labor of the formerly enslaved children. Other topics covered in the book include gradual abolition, parental teachings, pregnancy, {{and the importance of}} the family.|$|E

50|$|Mr. Eckbo had {{a leading}} hand in {{planning}} what many scholars consider <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period's</b> finest subdivision scheme, the 256-acre Ladera Housing Cooperative near Palo Alto. But {{the project was}} never fully realized without Federal Housing Authority financing, which was probably withheld because the community was racially integrated.|$|R

5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. <b>The</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> {{he served}} {{on a number of}} {{government}} bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. In later life, he became more philosophical, and published The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics.|$|E
5|$|The Regia Marina demobilized {{after the}} end of the war in 1918 and the {{draw-down}} continued into the 1920s in large part due to severe budgetary shortfalls in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> The engines installed on Nino Bixio and her sister proved to be problematic throughout her time in service, which ultimately cut her career short. She was stricken from the naval register on 15 March 1929 and subsequently broken up for scrap; in contrast, the much more efficient Quarto, which had been built before Nino Bixio, remained in service for another decade.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> {{immediate}} <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> <b>the</b> remaining ethnic Poles were expelled. Most of them {{settled in}} the Recovered Territories. Ukrainians were resettled following Operation Vistula.|$|R

50|$|The {{useful life}} of the Black Widow was {{extended}} {{for a few years}} into <b>the</b> immediate <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> due to <b>the</b> USAAF's problems in developing a useful jet-powered night/all-weather fighter.|$|R
5|$|After leaving office, Voorhis {{remained}} in his Alexandria, Virginia, house, completing his book, Confessions of a Congressman. In early 1947, {{he was offered}} the job of {{executive director of the}} Cooperative League of the USA. The Voorhis family relocated to Winnetka, Illinois, near the League's Chicago headquarters. The League, which included both consumer and producer cooperatives, had fallen on hard times in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> Under his leadership, the League's financial position gradually improved and some major cooperatives that had remained aloof from the League were persuaded to join. The League expanded its purview, founding the Group Health Association of America and the National Association of Housing Cooperatives.|$|E
5|$|Feeling unsuited to a {{managerial}} role {{in such an}} environment, he left Oak Ridge at the end {{of summer}} in 1947 and returned to Princeton University, although he maintained a consulting role with the facility for many years. In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> he served on a number of government bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. He also contributed to civil defense.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> Lawton {{underwent}} tremendous growth {{during the}} late 1940s and 1950s, leading city officials to seek additional water sources to supplement existing water from Lake Lawtonka. In the late 1950s, the city purchased large parcels of land along East Cache Creek in northern Comanche County {{for the construction of}} a man-made lake with a dam built in 1959 on the creek just north of U.S. 277 west of Elgin. Lake Ellsworth, named for a former Lawton mayor, soft-drink bottler C.R. Ellsworth, was dedicated in the early 1960s. It offered additional water resources, but also recreational opportunities and flood control along Cache Creek.|$|E
50|$|The Percival Prince was a British light {{transport}} of <b>the</b> early <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> It was a twin-engine, high-wing, cantilever monoplane of all-metal stressed-skin construction; the undercarriage was of retractable, tricycle type.|$|R
50|$|In {{its first}} few years, the Prize {{contributed to the}} rise of major poets of <b>the</b> Spanish <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> <b>The</b> Adonais is similar to the Premio Hiperi√≥n, which also {{promotes}} young authors.|$|R
50|$|The Bayeux speeches are two speeches {{delivered}} by General Charles de Gaulle of France {{in the context}} of liberation after the Normandy landings in June 1944 and in <b>the</b> immediate <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> in June 1946.|$|R
5|$|With city jobs {{moved to}} the towns and villages around Utica during the {{suburbanization}} of <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> This led {{to the expansion of}} the nearby Town of New Hartford and the village of Whitesboro. Utica's lack of quality academic and educational choices, when compared to Syracuse under an hour away, contributed to its decline in local businesses and jobs as some economic activity moved to Syracuse during the 1990s. Utica's population fell while population in the county increased, reflecting a statewide trend of decreasing urban populations outside New York City. Residents who remain in the city struggle to handle poverty issues stemming from social and economic conditions caused partially by a smaller tax base; this adversely affects schools and public services.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> saw {{considerable}} deflation; {{the shortage}} of labor and materials during the war had led to much higher wages and prices, and in the postwar economic readjustment, wages were cut heavily. In Chicago, employers in the building trades attempted a 20%wage cut; when this {{was rejected by the}} unions, a lockout followed. Both sides agreed to submit the matter to a neutral arbitrator, and settled on Landis, who agreed to take the case in June 1921. By this time, Landis was Commissioner of Baseball, and still a federal judge. In September, Landis issued his report, cutting wages by an average of 12.5%. To improve productivity, he also struck restrictions on machinery which saved labor, established a standardized overtime rate, and resolved jurisdictional conflicts between unions. The labor organizations were not completely satisfied, but Landis's reforms were adopted in many places across the country and were credited with reviving the building industry.|$|E
5|$|By March 1943 Conant {{decided that}} British help would benefit {{some areas of}} the project. James Chadwick and one or two other British {{scientists}} were important enough that the bomb design team at Los Alamos needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. In August 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which resulted in a resumption of cooperation between scientists working on the same problem. Britain, however, agreed to restrictions on data on the building of large-scale production plants necessary for the bomb. The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement in September 1944 extended this cooperation to <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee to coordinate the efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Stimson, Bush and Conant served as the American members of the Combined Policy Committee, Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members, and C. D. Howe was the Canadian member. Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, in early 1945. Sir John Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and {{as a member of the}} Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson.|$|E
25|$|The formal accords at the Yalta Conference, {{attended}} by U.S President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, were key in shaping Europe's {{balance of power}} in <b>the</b> early <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beyond Sleep {{is one of}} the {{canonical}} novels of <b>the</b> Dutch <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> and a prime example of what is perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of the author's work, the intense cohesion between theme and narrative strategy.|$|R
25|$|USS West Loquassuck {{undertook}} several transport missions for the Navy in <b>the</b> immediate <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> {{prior to}} decommission, and subsequently operated as the merchant ship SS West Loquassuck into the 1930s. She was scrapped in Baltimore in 1936.|$|R
25|$|The Petes {{have won}} the OHL Championship nine times, second-most in OHL history and the most in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> They won the Memorial Cup once, in 1979.|$|E
25|$|In {{the twenty}} years {{following}} the end of the war, Pforzheim was gradually rebuilt. The town reflects the architecture of <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> and has some landmark buildings of the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|In February 1934, {{some time}} after his {{memorial}} service, his literary friends held an event where they organized his unpublished manuscripts. These were slowly published over the following decade, and his fame increased rapidly in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1934 JAWA {{introduced}} its first car, the JAWA 700, which was DKW-based. In 1937, the modified JAWA 600 Minor was introduced. Production continued in limited numbers throughout WWII, {{and some were}} assembled in <b>the</b> immediate <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> {{immediate}} <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> it had {{diplomatic relations}} with Mexico, Panama, Guatemala, Venezuela, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Albania. By contrast the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union did not recognise it.|$|R
50|$|USS West Loquassuck {{undertook}} several transport missions for the Navy in <b>the</b> immediate <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> {{prior to}} decommission, and subsequently operated as the merchant ship SS West Loquassuck into the 1930s. She was scrapped in Baltimore in 1936.|$|R
25|$|Unlike his competitors, John Roach {{had been}} able to {{maintain}} his profits in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> by diversifying his plant into the manufacture of machine tools and selling them to the U.S. Navy, which {{was in the process of}} upgrading its shipyards. By contrast, the Morgan Iron Works, like most other New York engine builders, had struggled in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> building only two engines in the two years following the war. It remained in business only because Morgan could afford to weather the losses, but in 1866 he suffered an additional financial setback when his newly established shipping lines to Mexico were aborted due to the overthrow of Maximilian I of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{steelband}} {{developed during}} wartime. They were preceded by the Tambu Bamboo bands, which used percussion instruments based on bamboo. The steelband movement developed in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> with many bands taking names from war movies like Casablanca, Tokyo, Free French and Tripoli.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> the {{remaining}} anti-aircraft artillery {{divisions of the}} PVO were re-equipped with newer 57mm, 100mm, and 130mm guns. By 1960, when AA guns were superseded by Surface-to-air missiles (SAM), all of the PVO divisions had been disbanded or converted into other units.|$|E
50|$|The Percival Prentice {{is a basic}} trainer of the Royal Air Force in <b>the</b> early <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> It was a low-wing {{monoplane}} with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Front seating was in a side-by-side configuration with a {{rear seat}} provided.|$|R
50|$|The third USS Comet (AP-166) was a United States Navy La Salle-class {{transport}} in commission from 1944 to 1946. She saw {{service in}} the Pacific Theater of Operations during the latter stages of World War II and <b>the</b> immediate <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R
