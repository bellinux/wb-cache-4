5|$|According to Karl Potter {{and other}} scholars, Hinduism {{developed}} various <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> relations such as satkaryavada, asatkaryavada, avirodhavada and others. The anekantavada overlaps with two major theories found in Hindu and Buddhist thought, according to James Lochtefeld. The Anekantavada doctrine is satkaryavada in explaining causes, and the asatkaryavada in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects. The different schools of Hindu philosophy further elaborated and refined the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> pramanas and the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> relations to establish correct means to structure propositions in their view.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{successfully}} introduce responsibility-sensitivity into <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> justice (distributive and relational) and <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> political morality (broadly conceived) {{it is not}} enough to merely draw distinctions between (1) different models of what responsibility-sensitivity requires in itself and (2) different normative grounds of, or justifications for, responsibility-sensitivity. We must also draw distinctions between (3) different roles played by responsibility-sensitivity within our theories; (4) different accounts of the strength <b>of</b> responsibility-sensitivity within <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> justice; (5) different accounts of the strength <b>of</b> responsibility-sensitivity within <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> political morality; and (6) different conceptions of the other requirements also incorporated into <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> justice and <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> political morality. The intended payoff of all this distinction-drawing is twofold: first, a more accurate, comprehensive, and illuminating account of the nature of the position <b>of</b> responsibility-sensitivity within <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> justice and <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> political morality; and, second, paving the way for a more sophisticated and analytically sharp research agenda on the subject of whether or not responsibility-sensitivity should have a position in our <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> normative political concepts in the face of mounting scepticism over its doing so, owing in part to the harshness/abandonment objection and the unfreedom objection...|$|R

5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and—with his subsequent <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> gravitation in 1916—he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} {{deficiencies of}} the Laplacian model stimulated scientists {{to find a}} replacement for it.

In 1978 Andrew Prentice resurrected the initial Laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed the modern Laplacian theory.

Causal theory is the key example for epidemiologic science, although <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> selection processes, <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> health, and <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> probability and statistics are also core. <b>Theories</b> <b>of</b> ethics provide principles, warrants, and methods for acting upon the knowledge gained in epidemiology’s scientific pursuits.
