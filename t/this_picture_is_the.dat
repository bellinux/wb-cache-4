The artist thinks of big things first– and the design in <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> biggest thing in it. It is like a symphony of music. All the {{instruments}} are playing a part, and none is out of harmony with the whole... the theme of a painting is a movement in space. The upright lines of the tree trunk give it serenity; the horizontal lines of the shore supplement this and give it strength; the rounded masses of the hills repeat the circular rhythm of the foliage masses, giving movement and powerful rhythm to the whole composition." ...|$|E

I much [...] doubt if Tintoret ever imitated any body; but <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> [...] expression of his perception of what Veronese delighted in, the [...] nobility {{that there may be}} in mere golden tissue and colored drapery. [...] It is, in fact, a picture of the moral power of gold and color; and [...] the chief use of the attendant priest is to support upon his shoulders [...] the crimson robe, with its square tablets of black and gold; and yet [...] nothing is withdrawn from the interest or dignity of the scene. [...] Tintoret has taken immense pains {{with the head of the}} high-priest. I [...] know not any existing old man's head so exquisitely tender, or so [...] noble in its lines. He receives the Infant Christ in his arms [...] kneeling, and looking down upon the Child with infinite veneration and [...] love; and the flashing of golden rays from its head is made the centre [...] of light, and all interest. The whole picture is like a golden charger [...] to receive the Child; the priest's dress is held up behind him, that [...] it may occupy larger space; the tables and floor are covered with [...] chequer-work; the shadows of the temple are filled with brazen lamps; [...] and above all are hung masses of curtains, whose crimson folds are [...] strewn over with golden flakes. Next to the [...] "Adoration of the Magi" [...] <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most laboriously finished of the Scuola di San [...] Rocco, and it is unquestionably the highest existing type of the [...] sublimity which may be thrown into the treatment of accessaries of [...] dress and decoration.|$|E

I was staying part of this summer in Turin, {{for the purpose of}} studying one of the Paul Veroneses there--the presentation of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon. Well, one of the most notable characters in <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> splendor of its silken dresses: and, in particular, there was a piece of white brocade, with designs upon it in gold, which it was one of my chief objects in stopping at Turin to copy. You may, perhaps, be surprised at this; but I must just note in passing, that I share this weakness of enjoying dress patterns with all good students and all good painters. It doesn't matter what school they belong to,--Fra Angelico, Perugino, John Bellini, Giorgione, Titian, Tintoret, Veronese, Leonardo da Vinci--no matter how they differ in other respects, all of them like dress patterns; and what is more, the nobler the painter is, the surer he is to do his patterns well.|$|E

60|$|Mr Condorcet's {{picture of}} what may be {{expected}} to happen when the number of men shall surpass the means of their subsistence is justly drawn. The oscillation which he describes will certainly take place and will without doubt be a constantly subsisting cause of periodical misery. The only point in which I differ from Mr Condorcet with regard to <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> period when it may be applied to the human race. Mr Condorcet thinks that it cannot possibly be applicable but at an era extremely distant. If the proportion between the natural increase of population and food which I have given be in any degree near the truth, it will appear, on the contrary, that the period when the number of men surpass their means of subsistence has long since arrived, and that this necessity oscillation, this constantly subsisting cause of periodical misery, has existed ever since we have had any histories of mankind, does exist at present, and will for ever continue to exist, unless some decided change take place in the physical constitution of our nature.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Parsons had {{therefore}} only to choose, at his leisure, and {{one might}} heartily have envied him the process, scarcely knowing which to prefer {{of all the}} pleasant pilgrimages that would make up such a quest. He had. fortunately, the knowledge which could easily lead to more, and a career of discovery behind him. He knew the right times for the right things, and the right things for the right places. He had innumerable memories and associations; he had painted {{up and down the}} land and looked over many walls. He had followed the bounty of the year from month to month and from one profusion to another. To follow it with him, in this admirable series, is to see that he is master of the subject. There will be no lack of confidence {{on the part of those}} who have already perceived, in much of Mr. Parsons' work, a supreme illustration of all that is widely nature-loving in the English interest in the flower. No sweeter submission to mastery can be imagined than the way the daffodils, under his brush (to begin at the beginning), break out into early April in the lovely drawings of Stourhead. One of the most charming of these--a corner of an old tumbled-up place in Wiltshire, where many things have come and gone--represents that moment of transition in which contrast is so vivid as to make it more dramatic than many plays--the very youngest throb of spring, with the brown slope of the foreground coming back to consciousness in pale lemon-colored patches and, on the top of the hill, against the still cold sky, the equally delicate forms of the wintry trees. By the time these forms have thickened, the expanses of daffodil will have become a mass of bluebells. All the daffodil pictures have a rare loveliness, but especially those that deal also with the earlier fruit-blossom, the young plum-trees in Berkshire orchards. Here the air is faintly pink, and the painter makes us feel the little blow in the thin blue sky. The spring, fortunately, is everybody's property and, in the language of all the arts, the easiest word to conjure with. It is therefore partly Mr. Parsons' good-luck that we enjoy so his rendering of these phases; but on the other hand we look twice when it's a case of meddling with the exquisite, and if he inspires us with respect it is because we feel that he has been deeply initiated. No one knows better the friendly reasons for our stopping, when chatting natives pronounce the weather [...] "foine," [...] at charming casual corners of old villages, where grassy ways cross each other and timbered houses bulge irregularly and there are fresh things behind crooked palings; witness the little vision of Blewbury, in Berkshire, reputedly of ancient British origin, with a road all round it and only footways within. No one, in the Herefordshire orchards, masses the white cow-parsley in such profusion under the apple blossoms; or makes the whitewashed little damson-trees look so innocently responsible and charming on the edge of the brook over which the planks are laid for the hens. Delightful, in <b>this</b> <b>picture,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sense of the clean spring day, after rain, with the blue of the sky washed faint. Delightful is the biggish view (one of the less numerous oil-pictures) of the Somersetshire garden, where that peculiarly English look of the open-air room is produced by the stretched carpet of the turf and the firm cushions of the hedges, and a pair of proprietors, perhaps happier than they know, are putting in an afternoon among their tulips, under the flushed apple-trees whose stems are so thin and whose brims so heavy. Are the absorbed couple, at any rate, aware of the surprising degree to which the clustered ruddy roofs of the next small town, over the hedge, off at the left, may remind the fanciful spectator of the way he has seen little dim Italian cities look on their hill-tops? The whole thing, in this subject, has the particular English note to which Mr. Parsons repeatedly testifies, the nook quality, the air of a land and a life so infinitely subdivided that they produce a thousand pleasant privacies. The painter moves with the months and finds, after the earliest things, the great bed of pansies in the angle of the old garden at Sutton, in which, for felicity of position and perfect pictorial service rendered--to say nothing of its polygonal, pyramidal roof--the ancient tool-house, or tea-house, is especially to be commended. Very far descended is such a corner as this, very full of reference to vanished combinations and uses; and the artist communicates to us a feeling for it that makes us wish disinterstedly it may be still as long preserved.|$|E

5000|$|Georgia was {{released}} in the U.S. on December 8, 1995. It received a positive critical reception. Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today described the film as [...] "a painful though sadly humorous portrait of sisterhood," [...] and Roger Ebert said Georgia was [...] "a complex, deeply knowledgeable story about a truly lost soul and her downward spiral" [...] in his 3.5/4-star review. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said “Georgia is Leigh’s high-wire act, and her fierce, funny, exasperating and deeply affecting portrayal commands attention.” James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised it as “a tour de force for Leigh... {{there are times when}} it's uncomfortable to watch this performance because it's so powerful”, adding “Georgia doesn't possess an amazingly original narrative, but what distinguishes <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> depth of the characters and the amazing power with which the two leads breathe life into them.” Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said “Leigh’s exceptional performance tears you apart… we’ve {{never seen anything like it}} before”, adding that [...] "Georgia is not an easy film, but in the American independent arena, it outperforms everything in sight.” It was also voted one of 1995’s ten best films by Interview, New York Post, Detroit Free Press, Los Angeles Daily News and ABC Radio Network.|$|E

[...] This painting reveals confusion and lost. The crowd does not know where to go and where to look. The gray scale of this painting reflects the uncertainty as well as the strong emotion of people during this era. There is a sense of loss in direction which represents the youths and artists in China who are uncertain about the future. Fang Lijan painted the crowd with non distinctive figures to reveal his feeling during that time. The definitions of self-identity and nation-identity are lost. The figures' faces are distorted from suffering through searching for something that is nowhere to be found.
