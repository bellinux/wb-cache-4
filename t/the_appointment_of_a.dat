5|$|At dawn on May23, the Cabildo {{informed}} {{the population that}} the Viceroy would end his mandate. The highest authority would be transferred temporarily to the Cabildo until <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> governing junta. Notices were placed at various points throughout the city, which announced the imminent creation of a junta and the summoning of representatives from the provinces. The notices also called {{for the public to}} refrain from actions contrary to public policy.|$|E
5|$|Historian Katharine Glover {{argues that}} women had less means of public {{participation}} than men {{and that as}} a result piety and an active religious life may have been more important for women from the social elite. Church going played an important part in the lives of many women. Women were largely excluded from the administration of the kirk, but when heads of households voted on <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate.|$|E

5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were {{to be in charge of}} the reform of the royal government. Arundel was one of eight earls among the twenty-one Ordainers.|$|E

5|$|As the 19th century wore on non-conformist ministers {{increasingly}} {{began to}} conduct services within the workhouse, but Catholic priests were rarely welcomed. A variety of legislation {{had been introduced}} during the 17th century to limit {{the civil rights of}} Catholics, beginning with the Popish Recusants Act 1605 {{in the wake of the}} failed Gunpowder Plot that year. But although almost all restrictions on Catholics in England and Ireland were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great deal of anti-Catholic feeling remained. Even in areas with large Catholic populations, such as Liverpool, <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Catholic chaplain was unthinkable. Some guardians went so far as to refuse Catholic priests entry to the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|Despite the splendidly sized new {{building}} (albeit a plain one), the church declined in {{status as the}} college gradually died. It {{is possible that the}} community ceased in 1212, when the Gloucester monks were killed by the locals; we don't know whether they were replaced. Nor do we know whether the clas resumed after Llywelyn the Great retook the area. Community life probably ended with <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rector by King Henry III in 1246, although this latter is not conclusive; a college might be headed by a rector, although they were usually styled provost. There have been suggestions that there were one or more chantry chapels, which could suggest the presence of more than one priest.|$|E
5|$|Heffron's reformist {{attitude}} in education also {{extended to the}} tertiary level, in which he intended to significantly expand NSW's capacity for higher-level learning. On 9 July 1946 he presented a proposal to the cabinet outlining {{the creation of a}} technological-based university in NSW, as a separate institution to the existing Sydney Technical College and a year later cabinet authorised <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Developmental Council, chaired by Heffron, to bring the new tertiary institution into existence. First meeting in August 1947, the council established all the guidelines and regulations that would set-up the future institution and by March 1948, 46 students had already enrolled to study.|$|E

5|$|In 1911 another Royal Commission {{investigation}} into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility.

However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and {{the election of a}} Labor government with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912.|$|E

5|$|On 29 June, Croatia and Slovenia {{agreed to}} suspend their {{declarations}} of independence to allow {{time for a}} negotiated settlement. The EC delegation appeared to make progress when Serbia responded to the move by ceasing their opposition to <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Croatian member of the federal presidency, Stjepan Mesić, as the body's chairman on 30 June. The appearance of a success was reinforced when the JNA ordered its troops posted in Slovenia {{to return to their}} barracks. On 1 July, de Michelis was replaced by João de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister, to maintain the formula of current, former and future EC presidencies comprising the EC delegation as the Netherlands took over the presidency from Luxembourg, while Portugal was scheduled to assume the presidency after the Dutch.|$|E
50|$|Although each {{situation}} will vary, {{one of the}} primary reasons for seeking <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interim examiner is to facilitate him commencing his work immediately rather than waiting until after the full hearing. In addition, it is often felt that <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interim examiner offers <b>a</b> certain level <b>of</b> reassurance to creditors and suppliers and to the company's employees who are frequently unaware of the intended application until after it has been made.|$|R

5|$|Protestantism {{was focused}} on the Bible and family worship was {{strongly}} encouraged. The kirk sessions applied personal and moral discipline. They discouraged group celebrations. Sessions had an administrative burden in the system of poor relief, the administration of the parish school system. They also took over the pursuit of witchcraft cases. The most intense hunt was in 1661–62, but improving economic conditions and increasing scepticism led the practice to peter out {{towards the end of the}} century. The numbers of Roman Catholics and the organisation of the Church probably deteriorated, but began to revive with <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Vicar Apostolic over the mission in 1694.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{government}} is responsible to the National Assembly and serves as the Deputy Chairman of the Council for Defence and Security. Moreover, prime minister is also Chairman of the Council for National Education. The tenure of a prime minister is five years, and the term is renewable once. The current prime minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc has served since 2016. In case of incapacity, a deputy prime minister assumes the office of acting prime minister until the prime minister resumes duty, or until <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new prime minister.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare {{was made clear}} to the Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{commander in chief of}} the three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent. The absence of a central authority resulted in poor co-ordination between the services, with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine.|$|E

5|$|Under Asad's successor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, the Muslim armies {{recovered}} most of Transoxiana, {{and with}} the Battle of Talas in 751 and the turmoil of the An Shi Rebellion, which terminated Chinese influence in Central Asia, Muslim dominance in the region was secured. Nevertheless, the losses suffered by the Syrians under Asad's command in the 737 campaign in Khuttal were of particularly grave importance in the long term, as the Syrian army was the main pillar of the Umayyad regime. Its numerical decline in Khurasan meant that the Khurasan-born Arabs {{could no longer be}} completely controlled by force; this opened the way not only for <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> native Khurasani Arab governor in the person of Nasr ibn Sayyar, but also, eventually, for the outbreak of the Abbasid Revolution that toppled the Umayyad regime.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Treaty, Bohemond agreed to become a vassal of the Emperor and to defend the Empire {{whenever}} needed. He also accepted <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Greek Patriarch. In return, he was given the titles of sebastos and doux (duke) of Antioch, and he was guaranteed the right to pass on to his heirs the County of Edessa. Following this, Bohemond retreated to Apulia and died there. His nephew, Tancred, who was regent in Antioch, refused to accept {{the terms of}} the Treaty. Antioch came temporarily under Byzantine sway in 1137, {{but it was not until}} 1158 that it truly became a Byzantine vassal.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2013 budget the Dunderdale {{government}} announced that the province's four English school boards would be consolidated into one, while the one French school board would remain as is. The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004, from 10 boards to five. Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14,000, or 17 per cent. The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, {{with a plan to}} have the new school board in place for September of that year. The budget also saw reductions in the Department of Education that would affect areas such as administration, learning resources support and district-based numeracy supports. However, the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of regular classroom teachers, and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student-teacher ratio in the country.|$|E
