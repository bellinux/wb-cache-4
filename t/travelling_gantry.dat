5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A <b>travelling</b> timber <b>gantry</b> had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|R
40|$|Known {{handling}} {{units are}} designed as headers which <b>travel</b> on a <b>gantry</b> crane for the filling process. The filling nozzle and the filling tube {{are attached to}} the header, the filling tube is pulled out of the header for filling and inserted in the fuel tank filler neck. If the vehicle moves while the filling tube is approached and inserted, there is a risk that the filling tube no longer enters into the filler neck. In order to introduce the filling tube easily into the filler neck of the vehicle, the handling unit is fitted with a docking element to which a position detector is assigned; the position detector is connected to a control unit on the handling unit. Before inserting the filling tube into the filler neck, the docking element is docked onto the fuel tank cap. The docking element can be guided precisely to the tank cap and attached to it by means of the position detector. The handling unit is also suitable if there are relative movements between the vehicle and the unit while t he filling tube is approached...|$|R

5000|$|The sugar {{storage shed}} was {{constructed}} in 1923. An electrical conveyor system was installed in the shed to move sugar bags to and from ships' holds and railway wagons, and was fully operational by 1926. The system consisted of an inclined covered conveyor extending from railway tracks {{on the west side}} of the shed up to the shed's roofline. This conveyor provided the linkage with the wharf railway system. A complicated set of conveyors and chutes was built into the roof of the sugar shed, and this system was used to stack bagged sugar at a rate of up to 80 tons per hour. A second conveyor extended between the roof of the sugar shed eastwards to the roof of number 4 wharf shed. This conveyor joined another in a T-configuration on the eastern side of the wharf shed's roof. The overhead conveyors from White's Shed to number 3 wharf were reconstructed in 1946, while maintenance and repairs to both [...] "shore and floating plant" [...] were made in 1947. The 27-year-old facility was apparently modernised during the overhaul. Two <b>travelling</b> <b>gantry</b> cranes moved up and down the number 4 wharf's edge, loading and unloading the sugar bags into ship's holds via a set of conveyors mounted on the gantry cranes and connected to the T-conveyor.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the salient {{features of the}} design of the Railway viaduct over Axios River on the new high-speed double railway line, which is the longest (800 m) railway bridge in Greece constructed using the <b>travelling</b> <b>gantry</b> method. Located in a high seismic hazard area, the viaduct is provided with an isolation system aiming to reduce the structural response to seismic loading, a solution that presents several challenges in the case of railway bridges and cannot be implemented {{solely on the basis of}} existing codes. Lead-rubber bearings are provided at each pier to deck connection and system damping is further increased through fluid viscous dampers at each abutment. To verify the performance of the isolation system, analysis for seismic actions is conducted in three discrete stages of increasing complexity. Seismic forces and displacements are found to be within acceptable limits and serviceability requirements are also met. Conclusions are drawn regarding the feasibility of using passive systems in railway bridges in seismic areas...|$|E

Then follows four lectures covering x-ray imaging positron emission tomography imaging blood flow by ultrasound magnetic resonance 10 June 2002 100 Years of Medical Imaging Pr. Gustav K. von Schulthess MD, PhD, University of Zurich History and overview of Medical Imaging 11 June 2002 X-rays: still going strong Dr. Simon Wildermuth, MD, University Hospital Zurich Multidetector computed tomography: New developments and applications Since its introduction in 1992, spiral computed tomography (CT) scanners constructed with a single row of detectors have revolutionized imaging of thoracic and abdominal diseases. Current state-of-the-art models use up to 16 detectors and are capable of acquiring 16 contiguous slices of data with each gantry rotation; systems with 32 data acquisition units (and more) are currently in development. The principal advantages offered by these systems are increased scanning speed and the ability to obtain volumetric data in high resolution. These features enable imaging with enhanced contrast concentration, decreased contrast load, decreased respiratory and cardiac motion artifact, and multiplanar and 3 -dimensional reconstruction capabilities. This presentation reviews the technical aspects of multidetector spiral CT scanning. The arrangement and various combinations of the detector rows are discussed. Key scanning variables, including collimation (slice thickness), pitch (the rate of table <b>travel</b> per <b>gantry</b> rotation divided by the beam collimation), and gantry speed, are briefly addressed {{in the context of their}} interrelationships. Comparison is made with single-detector-row systems to emphasize the superior scanning speed and resolution. Furthermore, the various clinical applications of multidetector spiral CT, including CT pulmonary angiography, CT aortography, virtual bronchoscopy, and multiplanar and 3 -dimensional reconstructions are discussed. 12 June 2002 Nuclear Medicine: PET Positron Emission Tomography Dr. Alfred Buck, MD, MSc, University Hospital Zurich Elucidating healthy and pathological human physiology with PET Positron emission tomography (PET) is the only tool that allows to non-invasively and quantitatively investigate human physiology and biochemistry in vivo. The method allows to measure glucose metabolism, aminoacid biochemistry, blood flow, receptor densities and neurotransmitter synthesis. These parameters are of interest in the healthy human and in disease. Of special importance is glucose metabolism (GM). The ligand used to investigate GM is a glucose analogue labelled with 18 F, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG enters the cell like glucose but cannot be completely metabolised. The intermediary product is trapped in the cell, accumulates and allows for excellent imaging. The amount of accumulated tracer is a quantitative measure for GM. Initially one was especially interested in GM of the brain. In disease GM is highly important in tumors and PET with FDG has become one of the major methods to evaluate cancer patients. Another application of PET concerns the working of the brain. Such studies are performed with labelled water (H 215 O). This tracer measures blood flow. Whenever areas in the brain are active, blood flow is increased and this increase can be measured with PET. The pattern of activations during specially designed tasks allows conclusions about information processing in the brain. 13 June 2002 Ultrasound Pr. Kurt Jäger, MD, University Hospital Basel Imaging blood flow with ultrasound Diagnostic ultrasound relies on the reflection of short pulses of ultrasound (2 - 14 MHz) from structures within the body to construct images of an organ, or to measure/image velocities of moving structures such as blood. The most common modalities are pulse-echo B-scanning, spectral Doppler and color flow imaging. Many recent innovations including tissue harmonic imaging, contrast agents, 3 -D imaging and tissue Doppler have extended the scope of ultrasound. It is estimated that there are more installed ultrasound machines than all other diagnostic techniques combined. Arteriosclerotic narrowing of the arterial lumen and the resulting blood flow reduction are responsible for stroke, peripheral arterial disease and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thrombus formation in the venous system leads to pulmonary embolism and chronic venous insufficiency. Thus, the application of ultrasound in the diagnosis of vascular disease is an exciting medical innovation. 14 June 2002 Magnetic Resonance Pr. Roland Kreis, M. Sc., PhD, University Hospital Bern Magnetic Resonance in Medicine: Morphology and Way Beyond Nuclear magnetic resonance is a phenomenon with extremely wide-varying applications ranging from solid-state physics to conformation analysis of macromolecules, to a plethora of uses in medicine. The most basic one is the determination of soft tissue morphology by MR imaging (MRI). MRI's success relies on the fact that it is truly non-invasive and that different contrast mechanisms can be invoked by simply changing the data acquisition parameters. MR contrast can be based on proton density, molecular mobility, water diffusivity, blood perfusion, water-macromolecule interaction, motion, or magnetic susceptibility gradients. Furthermore, nuclei other than protons can be interrogated, or extrinsic and intrinsic contrast media can be used to image morphology and pathology. Metabolism and function can be elucidated specifically. The basic methodology and various applications will be presented to prove that magnets can also be put to good use outside of CERN...|$|R
40|$|The {{crossing}} of rivers in Katanga (Democratic Republic of Congo) by railway {{lines in the}} 1920 s and 1930 s gave Belgian engineers and contractors the opportunity to build record spans for railway bridges. The {{crossing of}} the Lualaba River at Bukama consists of four Vierendeel steel girders each with a 62 m span, which were the largest of their type {{at the time of}} their erection in 1925. The crossing of the Lualaba at Kongolo, built in 1937 – 1939, required a 495 m long reinforced concrete continuous beam bridge with 14 spans, the largest measuring 70 m. It was the first significant concrete beam bridge constructed with a <b>travelling</b> <b>gantry</b> supporting movable formwork. The crossing of the Lukaga River (1938 – 1939) is a three-span concrete bridge with the 70 m long central span built using the cantilever method, which makes this bridge the oldest of its type in the world. This paper highlights the landmark characteristic of these forgotten bridges. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
