500|$|Skelton {{was invited}} to play a four-week date at the London Palladium in July 1951. While flying to the engagement, Skelton, Georgia and Father Edward J. Carney, were on a plane from Rome with {{passengers}} from an assortment of countries that included 11 children. The plane lost the use of two of its four engines and seemed destined to lose the rest, meaning that the plane would crash over Mont Blanc. The priest readied himself to administer last rites. As he did so, he told Skelton, [...] "You <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> department, Red, and I'll take care of mine." [...] Skelton diverted {{the attention of the}} passengers with pantomimes while Father Carney prayed. They ultimately landed at a small airstrip in Lyon, France. He received both an enthusiastic reception and an invitation to return for the Palladium's Christmas show of that year.|$|E
500|$|Finally, on May 19, Giuliani held what The New York Times again {{described}} as [...] "an emotional, riveting news conference" [...] that [...] "reached {{a new level}} of introspection" [...] to announce that he was dropping out of the senate race: [...] "This is not the right time for me to run for office. If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't. When you feel your mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> health." [...] He said that he would instead devote the remainder of his mayoralty trying to overcome the hostile relations he had with many of the city's minority groups.|$|E
500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed, the crowd around Private White grew {{larger and more}} boisterous. Church bells were rung, which usually {{signified}} a fire, bringing more people out. Over fifty Bostonians pressed around White, led by a mixed-race runaway slave named Crispus Attucks, throwing objects at the sentry and challenging him to fire his weapon. White, who had taken up a somewhat safer position {{on the steps of}} the Custom House, sought assistance. Runners alerted the nearby barracks and Captain Thomas Preston, the officer of the watch. According to his report, Preston dispatched a non-commissioned officer and six privates of the 29th Regiment of Foot, with fixed bayonets, to relieve White. The soldiers Preston sent were Corporal William Wemms, Hugh Montgomery, John Carroll, William McCauley, William Warren, and Matthew Kilroy. Accompanied by Preston, they pushed their way through the crowd. En route, Henry Knox, again trying to reduce tensions, warned Preston, [...] "For God's sake, <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> men. If they fire, you must die." [...] Captain Preston responded [...] "I am aware of it." [...] When they reached Private White on the custom house stairs, the soldiers loaded their muskets, and arrayed themselves in a semicircular formation. Preston shouted at the crowd, estimated to number between three and four hundred, to disperse.|$|E

500|$|... "Next" [...] {{was written}} by Jenna Bans and Kevin Murphy and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. While developing storylines for the second season, series creator Marc Cherry stated, [...] "I want to keep {{finding new ways to}} talk about issues that relate to everyday women," [...] explaining that the show needs to focus on [...] "small, real, everyday issues" [...] {{in order to keep the}} audience interested. Cherry cited the Lynette storyline as an example of this strategy: [...] "Lynette will have a job next season (returning to her advertising roots), so I want to address how difficult it is to go to work all day and then come home and be expected to also <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> house." [...] Huffman recognized that her character's storylines needed a change of pace, but hoped that Lynette's domestic life would still play an integral role this season. [...] "My hope is to not get lost in the corporate world; that it's still a home and family/husband and children story," [...] she explained. [...] "But how many times can you go, 'Kids, clear your plates!'" [...] The episode also introduced Joely Fisher as Lynette's new boss, Nina Fletcher. Fisher describes her character as [...] "nasty," [...] elaborating: [...] "Lynette suddenly has to come up against this tiger lady who never stops reminding Lynette that she's childless by choice. Even though Nina is not a housewife, she is desperate in her own way." [...] Due to the death of his character, Steven Culp did not return to the series for the second season. For the open casket scene in [...] "Next", producers created a life mask of the actor. Savant was promoted to series regular after appearing as a recurring guest star throughout the first season.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of December 3, 1988, Ruiz, Reyes, their son Fernando, and Fernando's wife Leticia, who was {{pregnant}} with their fourth child, were all praying the Rosary. [...] Ruiz in particular was praying for her son Reyes Jr., who was struggling with cocaine addiction and for Fernando and Leticia's marriage. [...] During the final decade, Ruiz says she saw a light emanating from {{a portrait of the}} Immaculate Heart of Mary that grew brighter until it forced her to close her eyes. [...] At that moment, the Virgin spoke to her: [...] "Don't you know that I am going to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> children?" [...] Ruiz was overcome with emotion and began to cry, calling out, [...] "Qué linda! Qué linda!" [...] ("She's beautiful! She's beautiful!").|$|E
2500|$|On 20 November, Darwin told Lyell of his {{revisions}} {{for a third}} {{edition of}} the Origin, including removing his estimate {{of the time it}} took for the Weald to erode: [...] "The confounded Wealden calculation, to be struck out. & a note to be inserted to effect that I am convinced of its inaccuracy from Review in Saturday R. & from Phillips, as I see in Table of Contents that he attacks it." [...] He later told Lyell that [...] "Having burnt my own fingers so consumedly with the Wealden, I am fearful for you", and advised caution: [...] "for Heaven-sake <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> fingers; to burn them severely, as I have done, is very unpleasant." [...] The third edition, as published on 30 April 1861, stated [...] "The computation of time required for the denudation of the Weald omitted. I have been convinced of its inaccuracy in several respects by an excellent article in the 'Saturday Review,' Dec. 24, 1859." ...|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1985 season, Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog commented on facing the season without Sutter. [...] "To me, Bruce is the best there ever was", Herzog said.

2500|$|After {{switching}} to ABC Records {{in the late}} 1960s, he found himself {{at the top of}} the charts again, beginning with the first song he recorded, [...] "I'll <b>Take</b> <b>Care</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Cares". Written as a waltz in the mid-1920s, [...] "Cares" [...] had become the unofficial theme song of the Las Vegas call girls, but was virtually unknown outside of the Strip. Laine recorded a swinging version that made it to number 39 on the national and number 2 on the adult contemporary charts. A string of hits followed including [...] "Making Memories", [...] "You Wanted Someone to Play With", [...] "Laura (What's He Got That I Ain't Got)", [...] "To Each His Own", [...] "I Found You", and [...] "Lord, You Gave Me A Mountain" [...] (which was written by Marty Robbins). The last song was a number one hit on the adult contemporary chart (#24 national), and proved that Laine was as big a hit-maker as ever. His last single to hit the Billboard Hot 100 chart (peaking at No.86 national) was [...] "Dammit Isn't God's Last Name".|$|E
2500|$|Stuart now {{sought to}} take a useful role in the {{campaign}} and perhaps, according to some historians, to redeem his reputation and to secure the glory of another ride around the Union Army. On June 22, Lee gave Stuart discretionary orders for his movement to Pennsylvania with the important point being: [...] "If you find that he [...] is moving northward, and that two brigades can guard the Blue Ridge and <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> rear, you can move with the other three into Maryland, and take position on General Ewell's right." [...] Lee wrote to Stuart again on June 23 in an apparent effort to clarify his orders as follows: [...] "You will, however, be able to judge whether you can pass around their Army without hindrance, doing them all the damage you can, and cross the river east of the mountains. In either case, after crossing the river, you must move on and feel the right of Ewell's troops." [...] Lee's orders did not give Stuart a specific route to follow. Confederate Colonel Edward Porter Alexander, chief of artillery of Longstreet's corps, stated [...] "Stuart made to Lee a very unwise proposition, which Lee more unwisely entertained." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murat Kurnaz {{was born}} in Bremen, Germany, and grew up there. He was {{considered}} a Turkish citizen because his parents were immigrants, but they had {{lived and worked in}} Germany for years. He was a legal German resident and married a Turkish woman in Germany. In October 2001 Kurnaz at age 19 traveled from Germany to Pakistan, hoping to study at the Mansura Center (which turned him down); he spent the next two months as a tablighi, a Muslim pilgrim sojourning from mosque to mosque. In December 2001, while Kurnaz was on a bus to the airport to return to Germany, Pakistani police at a checkpoint detained him. After questioning him for a few days, they [...] turned him over to American soldiers. [...] Later Kurnaz learned that, after its invasion of Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks, the United States had distributed fliers there and in Pakistan promising “enough money to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family, your village, your tribe {{for the rest of your}} life” as a bounty for suspected terrorists. [...] Kurnaz says [...] "a great number of men wound up in Guantánamo as a result." [...] One of Kurnaz's interrogators at Guantanamo confirmed that he'd been [...] "sold" [...] for a $3,000 bounty.|$|E
