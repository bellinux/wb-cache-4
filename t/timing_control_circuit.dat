40|$|Abstract—Negative-bias {{temperature}} instability (NBTI) and positive-bias {{temperature instability}} (PBTI) weaken PFET and NFET over {{the lifetime of}} usage, leading to performance and reliability degradation of nanoscale CMOS SRAM. In addition, most of the state-of-the-art SRAM designs employ replica <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> to mitigate the effects of leakage and process vari-ation, optimize the performance, and reduce power consumption. NBTI and PBTI also degrade the timing control circuits and may render them ineffective. In this paper, we provide comprehensive analyses on the impacts of NBTI and PBTI on a two-port 8 T SRAM design, including the stability and Write margin of the cell, Read/Write access paths, and replica timing control circuits. We show, for the first time, that because the Read/Write replica timing control circuits are activated in every Read/Write cycle, they exhibit distinctively different degradation behavior from the normal array access paths, resulting in degradation of timing control and performance. We also discuss degradation tolerant design techniques to mitigate the performance and reliability degradation induced by NBTI/PBTI.

40|$|The CMOS imager is now {{competing}} with the CCD imager, which still dominates the electronic imaging market. By {{taking advantage of the}} mature CMOS technology, the CMOS imager can integrate A/D converters, digital signal processing (DSP) and <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> <b>circuits</b> on the same chip. This low cost and high-density integration solution to the image capture is the strong driving force in industry. Silicon on insulator (SOI) is considered as the coming mainstream technology. It challenges the current bulk CMOS technology because of its reduced power consumption, high speed, radiation hardness etc. Moving the CMOS imager from the bulk to the SOI substrate will benefit from these intrinsic advantages. In addition, the blooming and the cross-talk between the pixels of the sensor array can be ideally eliminated, unlike those on the bulk technology. Though there are many advantages to integrate CMOS imager on SOI, {{the problem is that the}} top silicon film is very thin, such as 2000 Å. Many photons can just pass through this layer without being absorbed. A good photo-detector on SOI is critical to integrate SOI CMOS imagers. In this thesis, several methods to make photo-detectors on SOI substrate are investigated. A floating gate MOSFET on SOI substrate, operating in its lateral bipolar mode, is photon sensitive. One step further, the SOI MOSFET gate and body can be tied together. The positive feedback between the body and gate enables this device have a high responsivity. A similar device can be found on the bulk CMOS technology: the gate-well tied PMOSFET. A 32 X 32 CMOS imager is designed and characterized using such a device as the light-sensing element. I also proposed the idea of building hybrid active pixels on SOI substrate. Such devices are fabricated and characterized. The work here represents my contribution on the CMOS imager, especially moving the CMOS imager onto the SOI substrate...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedSmall animal {{research}} is gaining more attention since {{mice and rats}} are preferred animal models for gene and drug therapy. High-frequency (HF) ultrasound imaging, capable of achieving superior spatial resolution at an affordable price, {{has been shown to}} be useful for imaging and visualizing blood flow in small animals for biological and pharmaceutical research. The utilization of HF arrays in a HF imaging system can alleviate the limitations of the current systems with single element transducers, such as the uneven image quality and frame rate.; In this dissertation, a HF ultrasound B-mode imaging system and a HF ultrasound Doppler system using 30 ~ 35 MHz linear arrays and an analog beamformer were investigated, visualizing both the movements and blood flow of the mouse heart. First the B-mode imaging system, which included HF linear arrays, <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> <b>circuits,</b> analog front-end circuits, a 16 -channel analog receiving beamformer and an 8 -bit digitizer, was developed. The system with the 48 -element linear arrays was used to image rabbit eyes in vitro and mice heart in vivo in real time. Furthermore, this system was used to successfully acquire images of mouse heart movements at 100 frame/s. For further improving the performance of the B-mode imaging system, efficient bipolar pulsers, low-noise front-end electronics, and a 14 -bit digitizer were studied. Meanwhile, a HF pulsed-wave Doppler system, which can be interfaced to either a single element transducer or the analog beamformer with arrays, was developed. The Doppler system was capable of detecting blood flow in vessels with diameters less than 200 [microns] and measuring velocities from 100 [microns]/s to 1 m/s. In addition, this Doppler system with intraocular needle transducers can be used to evaluate the treatment of retinal vein occlusion. Finally, based on the Doppler system and part of the improved B-mode imaging system, an array-based HF Doppler system, which can perform pulsed-wave Doppler, color Doppler, and power Doppler measurements, was implemented and used in small animal cardiovascular research. The experimental results have demonstrated that the HF ultrasound system with the arrays and analog beamformer may achieve better performance and higher frame rate than current systems with single element transducers...|$|R
