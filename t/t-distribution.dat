40|$|Abstract. Expressions for {{the entries}} of the {{information}} matrix and skewness tensor of a general multivariate elliptic distribution are obtained. From these the coefficients of the a-connections are derived. A general expression for the asymptotic efficiency of the sample mean, when appropriate as an estimator of the location parameter, is obtained. The results are illustrated by examples from the multivariate normal, Cauchy and Student's <b>t-distributions.</b> Key words and phrases: Multivariate lliptic distributions, information matrix, skewness tensor, a-connections, sample mean, asymptotic efficien-cy, normal, Cauchy and Student's <b>t-distributions...</b>|$|R

If the experimental errors are normally distributed the parameters will belong to a Student's <b>t-distribution</b> with m'n degrees of freedom. When m>>n Student's <b>t-distribution</b> approximates a normal distribution. Note, however, that these confidence limits cannot take systematic error into account. Also, parameter errors should be quoted to one significant figure only, as {{they are subject to}} sampling error.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a class of}} time- frequency distributions (TFDs) characterized by time-lag kernels which are functions of time only. If {{the parameters of the}} time-only kernels are properly chosen, their corresponding TFDs, the <b>T-distributions,</b> are more efficient than their two-dimensional counterparts in terms of cross-terms sup-pression while keeping a high energy concentration (resolution) around the IF law of non-stationary signals. The proposed class is a subclass of Cohen’s Class of quadratic TFDs. We have shown that separable time-lag kernels should be lag-independent (or: time-only) for best resolution. In addition, non-parametric amplitude estimation is possible directly from the <b>T-distributions</b> in case of FM signals, a property that is not verified by other TFDs. Two examples of the <b>T-distributions</b> are given and their performance is compared to other TFDs with numerical examples using synthetic and real-life signals. Key words: Time- frequency analysis, non-parametric amplitude estimation, multicomponent signals, resolution, cross-terms, Gaussian noise. PACS: 07. 50. Qx 1...|$|R

40|$|A novel model-based {{classification}} {{technique is}} introduced based on mixtures of multivariate <b>t-distributions.</b> A {{family of four}} mixture models is defined by constraining, or not, the covariance matrices and the degrees of freedom to be equal across mixture components. Parameters {{for each of the}} resulting four models are estimated using a multicycle expectation-conditional maximization algorithm, where convergence is determined using a criterion based on the Aitken acceleration. A straightforward, but very effective, technique for the initialization of the unknown component memberships is introduced and compared with a popular, more sophisticated, initialization procedure. This novel four-member family is applied to real and simulated data, where it gives good classification performance, even when compared with more established techniques.

25|$|The <b>t-distribution</b> {{is often}} used as an {{alternative}} to the normal distribution as a model for data, which often has heavier tails than the normal distribution allows for; see e.g. Lange et al. The classical approach was to identify outliers and exclude or downweight them in some way. However, it is not always easy to identify outliers (especially in high dimensions), and the <b>t-distribution</b> is a natural choice of model for such data and provides a parametric approach to robust statistics.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new class}} of time-frequency distributions (TFDs) suitable for efficient amplitude and instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation of mono- and multicomponent FM signals. The main characteristic of these TFDs, referred to as <b>T-distributions,</b> is that their kernels are functions of time only in the time-lag domain, hence the name time-only kernels. It is shown that separable time-lag kernels should be lag-independent for best resolution. In addition, amplitude estimation is possible directly from the <b>T-distributions</b> in the case of FM signals, a property that is not verified by other TFDs. The exponential and hyperbolic members of this class are analyzed. Numerical examples are incorporated to show the superior performance of the time-only kernels as compared to their two-dimensional counterparts...|$|R

40|$|Recently an {{efficient}} fixed point algorithm, called maximization by parts (MBP), for finding maximum likelihood estimates {{has been applied}} to models based on Gaussian copulas. It requires a decomposition of a likelihood function into two parts and their iterative maximization by solving score equations. For the first time, the MBP algorithm is applied to multivariate meta <b>t-distributions</b> based on t-copulas. Since score equations for meta <b>t-distributions</b> do not have closed forms the proposed MBP algorithm in two variations maximizes the decomposed parts of the likelihood iteratively. Superiority of the proposed MBP algorithm over standard estimation methods such as inference for margins and direct maximization is illustrated in a simulation study. The usefulness of the proposed algorithm is shown in two data applications. Copula Inference for margins Maximum likelihood estimation Maximization by parts Meta-t distribution Rolling windows...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{statistics}} {{can be shown}} to have t-distributions for samples of moderate size under null hypotheses that are of interest, so that the <b>t-distribution</b> forms the basis for significance tests. For example, the distribution of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ρ, in the null case (zero correlation) is well approximated by the t distribution for sample sizes above about 20.|$|E
25|$|If {{experimental}} error follows a normal distribution, then, {{because of the}} linear relationship between residuals and observations, so should residuals, but since the observations are only {{a sample of the}} population of all possible observations, the residuals should belong to a Student's <b>t-distribution.</b> Studentized residuals are useful in making a statistical test for an outlier when a particular residual appears to be excessively large.|$|E
40|$|Normal mixture {{models are}} being {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} way of clustering sets of continuous multivariate data. They provide a probabilistic (soft) clustering of the data in terms of their fitted posterior probabilities of membership of the mixture components corresponding to the clusters. An outright (hard) clustering can be subsequently obtained by assigning each observation to the component to which it has the highest fitted posterior probability of belonging. However, outliers in the data can affect the estimates of the parameters in the normal component densities, and hence the implied clustering. A more robust approach is to fit mixtures of multivariate <b>t-distributions,</b> which have longer tails than the normal components. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm can be used to fit mixtures of <b>t-distributions</b> by maximum likelihood. The application of this model to provide a robust approach to clustering is illustrated on a real data set. It is demonstrated how the use of t-com [...] ...|$|R
