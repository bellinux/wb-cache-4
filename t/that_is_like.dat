Researchers argue that {{this is similar to}} labor supply behavior in humans. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>like</b> humans (who, even in need, will only work so much for a given wage), the pigeons demonstrate decreases in pecking (work) when the reward (value) is reduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{material}} {{of the floor}} of the canyon system between Candor and Melas chasmata is grooved.

Also there is etched massive floor material <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> the younger and older massive material except that it has wind erosion features on it.

25|$|When a {{young worker}} leaves the nest {{for the first}} time, it will {{generally}} make 2 to 3 'orientation flights' in order to familiarize itself with {{the entrance to the}} colony amidst the surrounding landscape. In the first flight, the worker flies approximately 25nbsp&cm out of the nest at once and then quickly turns around to face the entrance. The wasp slowly flies {{back and forth to the}} nest several times, surveying an angle that is approximately 90 degrees, while facing the entrance. Then, the wasp promptly returns to the nest, the whole flight lasting only about one minute or less. Soon after returning from the first flight, the wasp will leave the nest in a similar fashion, but this time ventures out approximately 15 to 20 meters and covers an angle of approximately 280 degrees. Once 2 meters away, V. rufa will fly back and forth repeatedly in a figure-eight pattern, while facing the entrance to the nest. In some cases, after this second flight the wasp will have gathered all of the knowledge necessary to fly off. Other wasps must make a third orientation flight <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> the second one. At first, the worker may miss the entrance to the nest many times; however, after six to twelve trips, the wasp gains its bearings; flights become longer, and reentry into the colony becomes more precise.|$|E

500|$|According to the Upanishad, {{the entire}} {{universe}} evolves by Sankalpa (a thinking, ideation process), one becomes what one thinks, metaphysics affects physics, and it is ideation that helps retain the appearances of the world.
