5000|$|<b>The</b> leading-tone <b>seventh</b> chord is half {{diminished in}} C major (B-D-F-A) and fully diminished in C minor (B-D-F-A). However, composers {{throughout}} the Common practice period often employed modal mixture when using <b>the</b> leading-tone <b>seventh</b> chord {{in a major}} key, allowing for the substitution of <b>the</b> half-diminished <b>seventh</b> chord for <b>the</b> fully diminished <b>seventh</b> chord. This mixture is commonly used when <b>the</b> leading-tone <b>seventh</b> chord is functioning as a secondary leading-tone chord. <b>The</b> leading-tone <b>seventh</b> chord contrasts with <b>the</b> subtonic <b>seventh</b> chord in that the subtonic has a flatted seventh (chord root): in C minor, B-D-F-A. <b>The</b> leading-tone <b>seventh</b> chord has a dominant function and {{may be used in}} place of V or V7 [...]|$|R
50|$|Most notably, <b>the</b> <b>Seventh's</b> airmen pioneered Very Long Range (VLR) fighter {{operations}} {{across the}} Pacific with missions of historic length and duration: Kauai to Midway Atoll, Midway to Kaneohe and Makin to Jaluit and Maloelap. By late 1944, Lockheed P-38s of the 318th were routinely flying missions to Truk and Iwo Jima from Saipan—1500 mi, 8-hour trips. And by 1945, with new long range P-47Ns, VLR sorties were the rule {{rather than the}} exception for <b>the</b> <b>Seventh's</b> fighters.|$|R

5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> season aired, Duchovny filed {{a lawsuit}} against 20th Century Fox. He was upset because, he claimed, Fox had undersold the rights to its own affiliates, thereby costing him huge sums of money. Eventually, the lawsuit was settled, and Duchovny was awarded a {{settlement}} of about $20 million. The lawsuit put strain on Duchovny's professional relationships. Neither Carter nor Duchovny was contracted to work on the series beyond <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of that season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> season. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, but it was decided that Mulder would be abducted at the end of <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> seasons and would return in 12 episodes the following year. The producers then announced that a new character, John Doggett, would fill Mulder's role.|$|E

50|$|It is {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> harmonic <b>seventh</b> on <b>the</b> dominant {{not be used as}} a suspension, since this would create a mistuned fourth over the tonic. <b>The</b> harmonic <b>seventh</b> of G, F, is lower than the perfect fourth over C, F, by Archytas' comma (27.25 cents). 22 equal temperament avoids this problem because it tempers out this comma, while still offering a reasonably good approximation of <b>the</b> harmonic <b>seventh</b> chord.|$|R

50|$|In music theory, <b>the</b> {{dominant}} <b>seventh</b> flat five chord is {{a seventh}} chord {{composed of a}} root note, together with a major third, a diminished fifth and a minor seventh from root (1, 3, 5 and 7). For example, <b>the</b> dominant <b>seventh</b> flat five built upon C (C75) would be C-E-G-B. It can be represented by the integer notation {0, 4, 6, 10}. In diatonic harmony, <b>the</b> dominant <b>seventh</b> flat five chord does not naturally occur on any scale degree (as does, for example, <b>the</b> dominant <b>seventh</b> on <b>the</b> fifth scale degree: C7 in F major). This chord is enharmonically equivalent to its own second inversion.|$|R
