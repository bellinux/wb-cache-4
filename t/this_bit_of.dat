5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé. <b>This</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> evidence {{has been used to}} show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E
5|$|Dausprungas is not {{mentioned}} anywhere else. However, {{it is known}} that Mindaugas had two nephews, Tautvilas and Gedvydas, who waged a war against their uncle. Since historians do not have any data on other brothers of Mindaugas, it is generally assumed that the two were sons of Dausprungas. During the civil war of 1249–1252 Tautvilas and Gedvydas asked Daniel of Galicia, their brother-in-law, for help. <b>This</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> information indicates that they also had a sister. The sister was the second wife of Daniel and they did not have children. Dausprugas' wife must have been Duke of Samogitia Vykintas' sister since Vykintas was an uncle of Tautvilas and Gedvydas. It is believed that Gedvydas died in 1253 in a campaign against Bohemia, as it is the last message about him. Tautvilas was killed by his cousin Treniota in 1263. Some historians suggest that Tautvilas had a son, Constantine, who ruled Vitebsk, however others disagree and claim that his son might have been Aigust, who was sent by Novgorod to Pskov in 1271.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the release}} of The Lost Weekend in late 1945, Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett began to {{collaborate}} on a film about the problems faced by American military personnel stationed in Europe following World War II. Wilder went to Europe to research the project, but his visits to the concentration camps so disturbed him he returned to Hollywood determined to write and direct a musical comedy instead. He had known Bing Crosby since the crooner's days with Paul Whiteman, and he and Brackett had contributed to Crosby's 1940 film Rhythm on the River. Since Crosby was Paramount's leading star and Wilder was the studio's top director, {{it was easy to}} convince executives to greenlight a collaboration between the two. Wilder recalled reading about a Danish inventor who had demonstrated a magnetic recording device for Franz Joseph I of Austria in the hope the Emperor would help finance his invention, and he and Brackett used <b>this</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> historical fact as the starting point for their screenplay, which initially was titled Viennese Story.|$|E

2500|$|Noble {{titles are}} ranked {{according}} to an order of precedence so that, for example, a member who has been created a duke takes precedence over a member who has been created a countess. The main effect of this hierarchy involves the order that members are introduced during [...] "protocol", a ceremonial procedure endemic to the Imperial Court in which courts are presented with courtiers titles read by the master of ceremonies as members approach the presiding monarchs of the coronation. <b>This</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> pageantry, which is typically reserved for coronations and similar large events, gives Imperial Court members an opportunity to display their titles as well as costumes to the assembled crowd.|$|E
2500|$|In most camps, {{libraries}} {{were opened}} {{at the end of}} October 1915. The books were generally offered by prisoners’ aid committees. For example, in 1914, the camp at Münsigen received 220 books from the Stuttgart Red Cross. In 1915, the camp’s library featured 2,500 titles in French and a thousand in Russian. Most of the books were gathered by donations from the public and by 1918 they were dispatching 1,000 to 2,000 books every week to various camps. Newspapers were also highly valued as they could bring news from the outside and the discovery of the smallest sheet excited a prisoner’s eyes: “Read a fragment of a newspaper from Orléans [...] Finally <b>this</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> paper did us some good, for we were sick of all these German victories that they never stopped talking about”. Then around January 1918, the CPWC (Central Prisoners of War Committee) started the monthly journal, The British Prisoner of War, which ran until end of the war. Sometimes, theatrical troupes and orchestras performed, while camp newspapers saw publication in places like Zwickau, Ohrdruf and Stendal.|$|E
2500|$|For {{many years}} a popular myth has persisted {{that in the}} Japanese version of this film, Godzilla emerges as the winner. The myth {{originated}} {{in the pages of}} Spacemen magazine, a 1960s sister magazine to the influential publication Famous Monsters of Filmland. In an article about the film, it is incorrectly stated that there were two endings and [...] "If you see King Kong vs Godzilla in Japan, Hong Kong or some Oriental sector of the world, Godzilla wins!" [...] The article was reprinted in various issues of Famous Monsters of Filmland in the years following such as issues 51 and 114. <b>This</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> incorrect info would be accepted as fact and persist for decades, transcending the medium and into the mainstream. For example, decades later in the 1980s the myth was still going strong. The Genus III edition of the popular board game Trivial Pursuit had a question that asked [...] "Who wins in the Japanese version of King Kong vs. Godzilla?", and states that the correct answer is [...] "Godzilla". As well, through the years, this myth has been misreported by various members of the media, and has been misreported by reputable news organizations such as the Los Angeles Times. Since seeing the original Japanese-language versions of Godzilla movies was very hard to come by from a Western standpoint during this time period, it became easily believable.|$|E
