5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
500|$|On 15 July 2015, he {{was found}} guilty of being an {{accessory}} to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews. Reacting to the sentence, Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor said that she was [...] "disappointed" [...] adding: [...] "They are trying to teach a lesson that if you commit such a crime, you will be punished. But I do not think the court has acted properly in sentencing him to four years in jail. It is <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> kind of sentence... My preference would have been to sentence him to community service by speaking out against neo-Nazis. I would like the court to prove to me, a survivor, how four years in jail will benefit anybody." [...] Gröning's defence lawyer, Hans Holtermann, was quoted as saying that he would review the verdict before deciding whether to appeal. On 28 November 2016, the appeal was declined by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH). In August 2017 Oskar Gröning was considered to be fit for prison.|$|E

Amaterasu produces black flames at {{the focal point of the}} user's vision. Once created, it can continue burning for seven days and seven nights. The flames cannot be extinguished with water or any other normal method; only the user can put the flames out. Said to be [...] "the fires from hell" [...] and to burn as hot as the sun itself, Amaterasu burns virtually any material, including other flames, until nothing but ash remains. However, the flames cannot burn through chakra or materials infused with chakra, as they fail to burn into Naruto's Kurama chakra cloak or through Gaara's chakra-infused sand. This technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person. Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks. For more advanced users, they can shape Amaterasu into more specialized configurations. Use of Amaterasu puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing their eyes to bleed. For all its lethal potential, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> remove the burning body parts before it spreads. Other defensive options are pushing the flames away, absorbing them, certain space–time ninjutsu, or being the host of the Ten Tails.|$|E

Dame Plomaert took the news philosophically. She was a woman of phlegmatic disposition, and objected to sudden movement and changes, and to her it seemed far less terrible to await quietly the fortunes of the siege than to undergo the fatigues of a journey on horseback and the uncertainty of an unknown future.|$|E

50|$|At {{daylight}} on December 24, {{the huge}} fleet got underway, formed in line of battle before the formidable Confederate works, and commenced a furious bombardment.

60|$|The {{question}} which Aaron asked himself that night, {{and which he}} hardly knew how to answer, was this. Should he offer the drawing to Susan {{in the presence of}} her mother and sister, or on some occasion when they two might be alone together? No such occasion had ever yet occurred, but Aaron thought that it might probably be brought about. But then he wanted to make no fuss about it. His first intention had been to chuck the drawing lightly across the table when it was completed, and so make nothing of it. But he had finished it with more care than he had at first intended; and then he had hesitated when he had finished it. It was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> now <b>for</b> <b>that</b> plan of chucking it over the table.|$|R

So we went back to our own camp to rest and await the dawn before taking up the trail, only to find ourselves confronted with a new trouble. All the Strathmuir half-breeds whom we had left behind as useless, had taken advantage of our absence and that of the Zulus, to desert. They had just bolted back upon our tracks and vanished into the sea of bush. What became of them I do not know, as we never saw them again, but my belief is that these cowardly fellows all perished, for certainly not one of them reached Strathmuir.|$|R

True he had taken no actual part in the engagement. It had been too brief and he had arrived <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> But his had been the daring to conceive an ambush at so remote a western point, and his the brain that had guided them to this swift sweet victory in the name of Allah the One.|$|E
60|$|CZAR. No, Baron, the Czar. Traitors! There {{would be}} no bad kings in the world {{if there were no}} bad ministers like you.

6000|$|Darius {{expressed}} amazement and consternation at {{the terrible}} spectacle. He leaped from his throne and rushed toward Zopyrus, demanding who had dared to maltreat {{one of his}} generals in such a manner. When Zopyrus replied that he had himself done the deed, the king's astonishment was greater than before. He told Zopyrus that he was insane. Some sudden paroxysm of madness had come over him. Zopyrus replied {{that he was not}} insane; and he explained his design. His plan, he said, was deliberately and calmly formed, and it should be steadily and faithfully executed. [...] "I did not make known my design to you," [...] said he, [...] "before I had taken the preliminary steps, for I knew that you would prevent my taking them.

5000|$|One verse was not {{included}} in the first publication: Colum soon realised that he had not put in the poem the fact that the woman had died before the marriage, and so he wrote the verse that begins: [...] "The people were saying, that no two were e'er wed, but one had a sorrow that never was said ..." [...] and sent it on to Hughes, <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> publication in <b>that</b> particular collection.

(Historians commonly accept Sima Yue as the culprit, but the motive is not clear.) Thus ended the reign of an emperor who suffered much and under whose reign the Jin dynastic system came crashing down, even though he himself should probably not be blamed for it. Crown Prince Chi succeeded him (as Emperor Huai) and would try to restrengthen the empire, but it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> Jin by <b>that</b> point.
