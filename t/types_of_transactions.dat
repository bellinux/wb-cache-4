25|$|Helpful here is J. K. Gibson-Graham's complex {{topology}} of {{the diversity}} of contemporary market economies describing different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions,</b> labour, and economic agents. Transactions can occur in black markets (such as for marijuana) or be artificially protected (such as for patents). They can cover the sale of public goods under privatization schemes to co-operative exchanges and occur under varying degrees of monopoly power and state regulation. Likewise, there are a wide variety of economic agents, which engage in different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> on different terms: one cannot assume the practices of a religious kindergarten, multinational corporation, state enterprise, or community-based cooperative can be subsumed under the same logic of calculability. This emphasis on proliferation can also be contrasted with continuing scholarly attempts to show underlying cohesive and structural similarities to different markets.|$|E

2500|$|A 2014 {{meta-analysis}} found extensive {{evidence of}} racial discrimination in the American housing market. Minority applicants for housing needed to make many more enquiries to view properties. Geographical steering of African-Americans in US housing remained significant. A 2003 study finds [...] "evidence that agents interpret an initial housing request {{as an indication of}} a customer's preferences, but also are more likely to withhold a house from all customers when it is in an integrated suburban neighborhood (redlining). Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas (steering); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white. These three findings are consistent with the possibility that agents act upon the belief that some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> are relatively unlikely for black customers (statistical discrimination)." ...|$|E

40|$|In the article, {{the authors}} {{show that the}} main {{institutions}} of scientific efficiency are the institutions that publish scientific articles in Russian and international journals as well as monographs, scientific conference abstracts, pre-prints, reviews, reports, and also the institutions that register patents. The purpose of the research {{is the development of}} the indicator for the evaluation of the dysfunction of the institutions of scientific efficiency depending on different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> coasts; and verification of the authors’ indicator of scientific efficiency by the empirical study of the scientific organizations’ activities. In the research, we applied the methods of the system, logical and economic analysis. The empirical information was processed using the methods of statistical analysis and correlation analysis. On the basis of different scientific efficiency of the central and regional institutions confirmed by Scopus data, the authors have proved that the scientific efficiency of regional scientific institutions and central ones need to be analysed separately. We have determined the dysfunctions of these institutions depending on different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> coasts. We have developed the indicator for the assessment of the dysfunction of scientific efficiency institutions depending on different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> coasts. The authors have introduced the indicator of scientific efficiency equal to the ratio of the dynamics of the increment of scientific results to the dynamics of the increase <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> coasts. Depending on a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> the analyzed <b>transaction</b> coasts, the indicator of scientific efficiency illustrates the efficiency of various economic institutions. On the basis of the analysis of the research findings of the middle Urals’ scientific organizations, we have arrived at the conclusion that the institutions that publish articles in the Russian and foreign scientific journals are efficient. We defined the dysfunctions of the institutions that publish articles in the Russian and foreign scientific journals depending on different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> coasts. The authors conclude that it is efficient to increase certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> coasts. The received results can be applied by regional scientific institutions to increase the efficiency of their scientific activit...|$|R
