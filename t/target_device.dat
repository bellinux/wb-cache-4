25|$|In cryptography, {{electromagnetic}} {{attacks are}} side-channel attacks performed {{by measuring the}} electromagnetic radiation emitted from a device and performing signal analysis on it. These attacks are a more specific type of what is {{sometimes referred to as}} Van Eck phreaking, with the intention to capture encryption keys. Electromagnetic attacks are typically non-invasive and passive, meaning that these attacks are able to be performed by observing the normal functioning of the <b>target</b> <b>device</b> without causing physical damage. However, an attacker may get a better signal with less noise by depackaging the chip and collecting the signal closer to the source. These attacks are successful against cryptographic implementations that perform different operations based on the data currently being processed, such as the square-and-multiply implementation of RSA. Different operations emit different amounts of radiation and an electromagnetic trace of encryption may show the exact operations being performed, allowing an attacker to retrieve full or partial private keys.|$|E

50|$|EAPOL-Logoff frames {{transmitted}} by the 802.1X supplicant are {{sent in the}} clear and contain no data derived from the credential exchange that initially authenticated the client. They are therefore trivially easy to spoof on shared media, {{and can be used}} as part of a targeted DoS on both wired and wireless LANs. In an EAPOL-Logoff attack a malicious third party with access to the medium the authenticator is attached to, repeatedly sends forged EAPOL-Logoff frames from the <b>target</b> <b>device's</b> MAC Address. The authenticator (believing that the <b>targeted</b> <b>device</b> wishes to end its authentication session) closes the target's authentication session, blocking traffic ingressing from the target, denying it access to the network.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and {{introduction of the}} closed locked intramedullary nail into clinical practice has revolutionized the treatment of fractures of long bone. The most difficult and technically demanding part of the procedure is often the insertion of the distal interlocking screws. A lot of efforts have been made during the past years to make it easier. In according with Whatling and Nokes, we can divide the different approaches to this issue in four main groups: Free-hand (FH) technique; Mechanical <b>targeting</b> <b>devices</b> mounted on image intensifier; Mechanical <b>targeting</b> <b>devices</b> mounted onto nail handle; Computer-assisted techniques. In addition of these, recently it has been proposed a navigational system using electromagnetic field. The main disadvantages of the FH technique, are prolonged exposure to radiation and results depend mostly on the dexterity of the surgeons. FH technique is however the most popular technique. Our <b>targeting</b> <b>device</b> is included into the mounted on image intensifier group. It consists of 2 radio-opaque rods at right angle to each over: one of this is fixed on the c-arm, whereas, {{the other is a}} sliding rod with a sleeve for the drill bit, which is the targeting guide itself. In the realization of this device, we have been inspired by the modification of the FH technique suggested by Kelley et al. To identify the distal holes we used the method described by Medoff (perfect circle). Once that the distal hole is seen as a perfect circle, with the C-arm in later view, the targeting guide is roughly positioned onto this and the drilling and the screwing operations are performed without the need for image intensifier. We used the device in bone models and in 9 clinical cases. In spite of authors demonstrated that the electromagnetic <b>targeting</b> <b>device</b> significantly reduced radiation exposure during placement of distal interlocking screws and was equivalent in accuracy when compared with the FH technique, the latter is the most used technique. Indeed, although all the studies have reported that the radiation exposure to orthopedic surgeon has been below the maximum allowable doses in all cases, there is still the risk of cumulative lifetime radiation exposure. From this point of view, namely the reduction of cumulative lifetime radiation exposure, we think that, paradoxically, our device could be more effective than electromagnetic <b>targeting</b> <b>device,</b> because it can be used in all the orthopedic operations that required a <b>targeting</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The USAF Air Materiel Command {{reactivated}} the JB-2 as Project EO-727-12 on 23 April 1948, at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, {{the former}} Alamogordo Army Air Field. The JB-2 {{was used for}} development of missile guidance control and seeker systems, testing of telemetering and optical tracking facilities, and as a target for new surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles (fulfilling the V1's covername, Flakzielgerät— anti-aircraft <b>target</b> <b>device).</b> The JB-2 project used the North American Aviation NATIV (North American Test Instrument Vehicle) Blockhouse and two launch ramps at Holloman: a , two-rail ramp on a 3° earth-filled slope, and a [...] trailer ramp. The trailer ramp {{was the first step}} toward a system which would eventually be adapted for the forthcoming Martin MGM-1 Matador, the first operational surface-to-surface cruise missile built by the United States. The program at Holloman was terminated on 10 January 1949 after successful development of a radio guidance and control system that could control and even skid-land a JB-2 under the control of an airborne or ground transmitter.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "GSM Active Key Extraction" [...] {{performed}} by the StingRay in step three merits additional explanation. A GSM phone encrypts all communications content using an encryption key stored on its SIM card with a copy stored at the service provider.
