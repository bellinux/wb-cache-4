5000|$|The ECL {{circuits}} usually {{operate with}} negative power supplies (positive {{end of the}} supply is connected to ground) in contrast to other logic families in which negative end of the supply is grounded. This is done mainly to minimize {{the influence of the}} power supply variations on the logic levels as ECL is more sensitive to noise on the VCC and relatively immune to noise on VEE. Because ground should be the most stable voltage in a system, ECL is specified with a positive ground. In this connection, when the supply voltage varies, the voltage drops across the collector resistors change slightly (in the case of emitter constant current source, they do not change at all). As the collector resistors are firmly [...] "tied up" [...] to ground, the output voltages [...] "move" [...] slightly (or not at all). If the negative end of the power supply was grounded, the collector resistors would be attached to the positive rail. As the constant voltage drops across the collector resistors change slightly (or not at all), the output voltages follow the supply voltage variations and the two circuit parts act as constant current level shifters. In this case, the voltage divider R1-R2 compensates the voltage variations to some extent. The positive power supply has another disadvantage - <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>voltages</b> <b>will</b> vary slightly (±0.4 V) against the background of high constant voltage (+3.9 V). Another reason for using a negative power supply is protection of the output transistors from an accidental short circuit developing between output and ground (but the outputs are not protected from a short circuit with the negative rail).|$|E
40|$|When {{a number}} is {{expressed}} in binary or binary-coded decimal and an analog voltage is to be produced to represent the number, the most practical way to perform this conversion is to add the currents having values proportional to the weights of the binary bits. Figure 1 represents a simplified binary weighted D/A converter. Switches S 1 to SN represent the binary bits and connect either to ground or a reference voltage. Figure 1 shows switch S 1 connecting R to the reference voltage and all other switches connected to ground; but since point A is a virtual ground, there is no current through 2 R, 4 R, up to 2 N- 1 R. The amplifier has, therefore, a gain of =- 0. 5 If the reference voltage is- 16 V, <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>voltages</b> <b>will</b> be: R = 8 V, 2 R = 4 V, 4 R = 2 V and for 8 R = 1 V. If S 1 and S 2 connect to the reference (the other switches to ground), the gain is [...] 6, 66 K- 5 K- 0. 75 and the output voltage 12 V. The output is inversely proportional {{to the value of}} R. The disadvantage of the circuit is high-value resistors representing lowweight bits. A better solution is a ladder configuration for groups of four bits as shown in Figure 2. Between each group of four resistors that represent weights of 1 - 2 - 4 - 8, there is a resistor that reduces the gain of the amplifier by 16 for binary and by 10 for BCD weights. This eliminates the need for high value resistors...|$|E

50|$|The {{capacitor}} CIN {{is required}} to reduce {{the effects of the}} parasitic inductance and internal resistance of the power supply. The boost/buck capabilities of the SEPIC are possible because of capacitor C1 and inductor L2. Inductor L1 and switch S1 create a standard boost converter, which generates a voltage (VS1) that is higher than VIN, whose magnitude is determined by the duty cycle of the switch S1. Since the average voltage across C1 is VIN, <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> (VO) is VS1 - VIN.

5000|$|This circuit {{has much}} better {{regulation}} than the simple shunt regulator, since the base current of the transistor forms a very light {{load on the}} Zener, thereby minimising variation in Zener voltage due to variation in the load. Note that <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>will</b> always be about 0.65V less than the Zener due to the transistor's VBE drop. Although this circuit has good regulation, it is still sensitive to the load and supply variation. This can be resolved by incorporating negative feedback circuitry into it. This regulator is often used as a [...] "pre-regulator" [...] in more advanced series voltage regulator circuits.|$|R
5000|$|The {{quiescent}} current {{has to be}} constant to ensure constant collector voltages at common mode. This requirement is not so important {{in the case of}} a differential <b>output</b> since <b>the</b> two collector <b>voltages</b> <b>will</b> vary simultaneously but their difference (<b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>voltage)</b> <b>will</b> not vary. But {{in the case of a}} single-ended output, it is extremely important to keep a constant current since <b>the</b> <b>output</b> collector <b>voltage</b> <b>will</b> vary. Thus the higher the resistance of the current source , the lower (better) is the common mode gain [...] The constant current needed can be produced by connecting an element (resistor) with very high resistance between the shared emitter node and the supply rail (negative for NPN and positive for PNP transistors) but this will require high supply voltage. That is why, in more sophisticated designs, an element with high differential (dynamic) resistance approximating a constant current source/sink is substituted for the “long tail” (Figure 3). It is usually implemented by a current mirror because of its high compliance voltage (small <b>voltage</b> drop across <b>the</b> <b>output</b> transistor).|$|R

In practice, the parasitic capacitance of whatever device {{is connected to the}} virtual ground of the op-amp may destabilize it, and a compensating capacitance must be added in parallel with the resistor between <b>the</b> <b>output</b> and inverting pins.

5000|$|R must {{be small}} {{enough that the}} current through D keeps D in reverse breakdown. The value of this current is given in the data sheet for D. For example, the common BZX79C5V6 device, a 5.6 V 0.5 W Zener diode, has a {{recommended}} reverse current of 5 mA. If insufficient current exists through D, then UOUT is unregulated and less than the nominal breakdown voltage (this differs to voltage-regulator tubes where <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>will</b> be higher than nominal and could rise as high as UIN).

40|$|The DC-AC converter, {{also known}} as inverter, {{converts}} DC power to AC power at desired <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> and frequency. <b>The</b> DC power input to the inverter is obtained from an existing power supply.

If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>will</b> not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|R
5000|$|Leakage {{inductance}} {{can be an}} undesirable property, as {{it causes}} the voltage to change with loading. [...] In many cases it is useful. Leakage inductance has the useful effect of limiting the current flows in a transformer (and load) without itself dissipating power (excepting the usual non-ideal transformer losses). Transformers are generally designed to have a specific value of leakage inductance such that the leakage reactance created by this inductance is a specific value at the desired frequency of operation.Commercial transformers are usually designed with a short-circuit leakage reactance impedance of between 3% and 10%. If the load is resistive and the leakage reactance is small (<10%) <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>will</b> not drop by more than 0.5% at full load, ignoring other resistances and losses. High leakage reactance transformers are used for some negative resistance applications, such as neon signs, where a voltage amplification (transformer action) is required as well as current limiting. In this case the leakage reactance is usually 100% of full load impedance, so even if the transformer is shorted out {{it will not be}} damaged. Without the leakage inductance, the negative resistance characteristic of these gas discharge lamps would cause them to conduct excessive current and be destroyed. Transformers with variable leakage inductance are used to control the current in arc welding sets. In these cases, the leakage inductance limits the current flow to the desired magnitude.|$|R
