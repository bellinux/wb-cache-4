5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{forms of the}} story, the woman's pig-like appearance {{was the result of}} witchcraft. Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of having her appear beautiful to him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and beautiful to others. When her husband told her <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> was hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, it follows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> was a correct one {{that leads to a}} satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} why Michelangelo {{selected}} the five particular Sibyls that were depicted, given that, as with the Minor Prophets, there were ten or twelve possibilities.

5|$|When the Republican {{convention}} {{began in}} Philadelphia that June, no {{vice presidential candidate}} had overwhelming support, but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country. McKinley affirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> belonged to the convention, not to him. On June 21, McKinley was unanimously renominated and, with Hanna's reluctant acquiescence, Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot. The Democratic convention convened the next month in Kansas City and nominated William Jennings Bryan, setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest.|$|E
5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over a {{province}} including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of Rochester {{was probably not}} {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway, and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus was probably not a monk (he was not called that by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E
5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting the consent of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent of anyone else.|$|E

5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} hearing in 2002 both DNK director Tor Helge Lyngstøl and Minister of Justice, Odd Einar Dørum, stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of TETRA would provide sufficient data capacity. In {{a parliamentary}} decision in 2004 {{it was decided}} to opt for the open European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as a data transmission standard, which is used by all other police TETRA systems in Europe, but this was later changed by the directorate to the proprietary TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS) owned by Motorola. The latter would limit the number of supplies and would increase the investment costs.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 and 1952, {{with the}} Korean War as a background, a congressional {{investigation}} chaired by Rep. Ray Madden and {{known as the}} Madden Committee investigated the Katyn massacre. It concluded that the Poles {{had been killed by}} the Soviet NKVD and recommended that the Soviets be tried before the International Court of Justice. However, the question of responsibility still remained controversial in the West as well as behind the Iron Curtain. In the United Kingdom in the late 1970s plans for a memorial to the victims bearing the date 1940 (rather than 1941) were condemned as provocative in the political climate of the Cold War. It has also been alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> made in 1969 for the location of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic war memorial at the former Belarusian village named Khatyn, the site of the 1943 Khatyn massacre, was made to cause confusion with Katyn.

Thus <b>the</b> axiom of <b>choice</b> is not generally available in constructive set theory.
