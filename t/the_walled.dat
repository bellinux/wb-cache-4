5|$|After Japan's {{surrender}} in 1945, China {{announced its}} intent to reclaim its rights to <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City. Refugees from mainland China {{because of the}} Chinese Civil War post 1945 poured in {{to take advantage of}} British protection (<b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City is a Chinese territory but surrounded by British lands), and 2,000 squatters occupied <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City by 1947. After a failed attempt to drive them out in 1948, the British adopted a 'hands-off' policy in most matters concerning <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 Shaw Brothers film Brothers from <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City {{is set in}} Kowloon Walled City. The 1984 gangster film Long Arm of the Law {{features}} <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City as {{a refuge}} for gang members before they are gunned down by police. In the 1988 film Bloodsport, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City is the setting for a martial arts tournament. The 1992 non-narrative film Baraka features several highly detailed shots of <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City shortly before its demolition. The 1993 film Crime Story starring Jackie Chan was partly filmed in the deserted Walled City, and includes real scenes of building explosions. A walled neighbourhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film Batman Begins was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City. The 2006 Hong Kong horror film Re-cycle features a decrepit, nightmarish version of <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City, complete with tortured souls from which the protagonist must flee. The 2016 TVB martial arts drama A Fist Within Four Walls {{takes place in the}} Triad-ridden Walled City in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Antiquities and Monuments Office {{conducted}} archaeological examinations as <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City {{was being}} demolished, and several cultural remains were discovered. Among them were <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City's yamen and remnants of its South Gate, which were officially designated declared monuments of Hong Kong on 4 October 1996.|$|E

5|$|With no {{government}} enforcement from the Chinese or the British {{aside from a}} few raids by the Hong Kong Police, <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By this time, however, <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as triads.|$|E
5|$|A few of {{the people}} who spent time in Kowloon Walled City have written {{accounts}} of their experiences. Evangelist Jackie Pullinger wrote a 1989 memoir, Crack in the Wall, about her involvement in treating drug addicts within <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City. In his 2004 autobiography Gweilo, Martin Booth describes his exploration of <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City as a child in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In January 1987, the Hong Kong {{government}} {{announced plans to}} demolish <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City. After an arduous eviction process, demolition began in March 1993 and was completed in April 1994. Kowloon Walled City Park opened in December 1995 and occupies {{the area of the}} former Walled City. Some historical artefacts from <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City, including its yamen building and remnants of its South Gate, have been preserved there.|$|E

5|$|The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898 handed {{additional}} {{parts of}} Hong Kong (the New Territories) to Britain for 99 years, but excluded <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City, {{which at the}} time had a population of roughly 700. China was allowed to continue to keep officials there as long as they did not interfere with the defence of British Hong Kong. The following year, the Governor, Sir Henry Blake, suspected that the Viceroy of Canton was using troops to aid resistance to the new arrangements. On 16 May 1899, British forces attacked <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City, only to find the Viceroy's soldiers gone, leaving behind only the mandarin and 150 residents. The Qing dynasty ended its rule in 1912, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City to the British.|$|E

5|$|Kowloon Walled City's early {{population}} fluctuated between {{zero and}} a few hundred, and began growing steadily shortly after World War II. However, there is no accurate population information available for much of <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City's later existence. Official census numbers estimated <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City's population at 10,004 in 1971 and 14,617 in 1981, but these figures were commonly considered to be much too low. Informal estimates, on the other hand, often mistakenly included the neighbouring squatter village of Sai Tau Tsuen. Population figures of about 50,000 were also reported.|$|E

5|$|Previously, {{the club}} played at <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> Meadow, {{near to the}} town centre. The ground had a main wooden stand along one side (which {{incorporated}} the changing rooms), and a bank of covered terracing on the opposite side. The ground was mainly accessed via the car park off London Road, with turnstiles also situated on Eastfield Road behind the main stand. Since the club left <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> Meadow in 1989, the ground has been demolished and the site is now used for a housing development of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The narrow bricks in {{the garden}} walls have been dated to around the 17th century. <b>The</b> <b>walled</b> garden would {{originally}} have been used predominantly for growing fruit, vegetables, and herbs for the household's consumption, as well as flowers to exhibit at shows and for pleasure.|$|E

5|$|A partial {{recreation}} of the Kowloon Walled City {{exists in}} the Kawasaki Warehouse, an amusement arcade that opened in 2009 in the Japanese suburb of Kawasaki, Kanagawa. The designer's desire to accurately replicate the atmosphere of <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City {{is reflected in the}} arcade's narrow corridors, electrical wires, pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches that provide an air of authenticity.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, a fire {{broke out}} that {{destroyed}} over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted the need for proper fire prevention in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated {{by the lack of}} political ties with the colonial and Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.|$|E
5|$|Postman's Park is a park {{in central}} London, a short {{distance}} north of St Paul's Cathedral.

The convent she was studying in was the Santa Catalina College of the Dominican nuns, an exclusive school for girls, established in <b>the</b> <b>Walled</b> City of Intramuros where she finished her elementary and secondary education. In college, she learned Spanish, music, the feminine crafts and social graces. She spent her girlhood partly in their hometown and partly in the convent. Accordingly, Agoncillo was skilled in needlework.|$|E
