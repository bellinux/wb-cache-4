5000|$|Zhou Youde {{was born}} in the late Ming period. He {{enrolled}} in the Hongwen Institution (宏文院) in around 1644 and studied prose-editing and poetry, graduating in 1661, the first year of Kangxi's reign. Thereafter he enlisted as a banner-man in the Qing military and served under the Bordered Red Banner (镶红旗). In 1663, he was appointed Governor of Shandong and became the ninth person to take the helm. In 1665, Zhou successfully petitioned the Kangxi Emperor <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the locals because they were experiencing sustained periods of drought and famine. He also sought for maritime trade bans to be lightened, following the capture or destruction of several Portuguese trading vessels. A year later, he spearheaded the modification of an abandoned German government palace into a prison hospital, rallying scores of villagers to assist in the construction with the promise of food; some officials and workers had to travel approximately 150 kilometres to Qingzhou to procure some of the necessary construction materials, including wood and stones. The compound is now referred to as [...] "Pearl Springs" [...] (珍珠泉) and is a historic landmark in Shandong. It is described as Zhou's [...] "greatest contribution to Shandong".|$|E
40|$|This article compares {{national}} income tax reforms during the last 25 years. There were two competing models of income tax reform, ‘comprehensive’ and ‘dual’ income taxation, the latter of which {{was in many ways}} more successful. The reason lies in the structural constraints policy makers face. While taxation of capital income is very costly, creating incentives to lower marginal tax rates, the high overall <b>tax</b> burden <b>on</b> labour makes it difficult <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>tax</b> rates <b>on</b> labour incomes. These conflicting pressures point towards separate tax rate schedules for capital and labour, as is characteristic of dual income taxes. The analysis has implications for the role of income taxation in achieving social policy outcomes. Most importantly, while progressive taxation of capital income is constrained by high costs, policy makers willing to separate capital and labour income taxation can use the income <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the <b>tax</b> burden <b>on</b> low wages...|$|R

40|$|The new {{government}} proposes a radical reform of corporations taxation. The first step {{has been to}} “freeze” the Dual income tax and to substitute the previous incentive to investments, so called legge Visco, with the old “legge Tremonti” that cannot add to the tax investment credit to firms in the South. Next step should be definitively to abandon the dual corporation tax model and to adopt a single rate model with a tax rate of 33 %. The principal aim of this reform is <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>tax</b> burden <b>on</b> firms cash flow. This paper tests empirically the impact of new and old <b>tax</b> instruments <b>on</b> cash flow of the Italian corporations, using a panel data of manufacture sector corporations (Centrale dei Bilanci) and simulating all tax measures with the micromodel Matis (Capp and Department of Economics of Bologna University). Our results cast doubts on the more effectiveness of the new incentive, with respects to the previous ones, in <b>reducing</b> corporations <b>tax</b> burden. The single rate model of corporation tax, as well, does not prove <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>tax</b> pressure <b>on</b> corporations cash flow more than the dual one...|$|R
5000|$|The ÖVP saw the {{lowering}} of brokerage commissions and the charges for arrears letters of debt collection agencies and winter fuel payments for lower-income households as appropriate measures against the inflation. The SPÖ proposed a stricter controlling of prices {{in addition to}} the reduction of brokerage commissions. FPÖ and BZÖ saw the main problem in the rising fuel prices; the FPÖ demanded a ceiling price for fuel, while the BZÖ in addition wanted <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> fuels. The BZÖ announced a people's initiative (Volksbegehren) calling for a stop to rising prices (by capping the price of fuel and reducing taxes on fuel, drugs and food); however, due to the necessary timeframe, the period during which people would be able to sign for the initiative would only start after the election, thus limiting its potential impact. [...] "Ecology against inflation" [...] was the concept proposed by the Greens; the Greens wanted to facilitate the changeover to renewable energy in order to reduce energy prices. The Greens stated that the rising oil price, which was the main reason for the high inflation, would quickly nullify other attempts at relief (like tax reductions, winter fuel payments or a higher commuter lump sum payment). The lower inflation would also come at a high cost through a higher trade deficit. In contrast, the Greens called for a conversion of oil and gas heating to wood heatings and for a prescribed redevelopment of badly insulated residential houses to reduce energy consumption and thereby costs. On 25 August 2008, the Greens called for a strong increase in funding for public transport, for a nationwide lorry toll and for a moratorium on road construction.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} five-region version (Canada, {{a group of}} oil {{exporting}} countries, the United States, emerging Asia and Japan plus the euro area) of the Global Economy Model (GEM) encompassing production and trade of crude oil, {{and use it to}} study the international transmission mechanism of shocks that drive oil prices. In the presence of real adjustment costs that reduce the short- and medium-term responses of oil supply and demand, our simulations can account for large endogenous variations of oil prices with large effects on the terms of trade of oil-exporting versus oil-importing countries (in particular, emerging Asia), and result in significant wealth transfers between regions. This is especially true when we consider a sustained increase in productivity growth or a shift in production technology towards more capital- (and hence oil-) intensive goods in regions such as emerging Asia. In addition, we study the implications of higher taxes on gasoline that are used <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> labor income, showing that such a policy could increase world productive capacity while being consistent with a reduction in oil consumption. ...|$|E
40|$|Environmental taxes {{constitute}} a crucial instrument {{aimed at reducing}} resource use through lower production losses, resource-leaner products, and more resource-efficient production processes. In this paper we focus on material use and apply a multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to study two types of taxation: tax on material inputs used by industry, energy, construction, and transport sectors, and tax on output of these sectors. We allow for endogenous adoption of resource-saving technologies. We calibrate {{the model for the}} EU 27 area using an IO matrix. We consider taxation introduced from 2021 and simulate its impact until 2050. We compare the taxes along their ability to induce reduction in material use and raise revenue. We also consider the effect of spending this revenue on reduction of labour taxation. We find that input and output taxation create contrasting incentives and have opposite effects on resource efficiency. The material input tax induces investment in efficiency-improving technology which, in the long term, results in GDP and employment by 15 %– 20 % higher than {{in the case of a}} comparable output tax. We also find that using revenues <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> labour has stronger beneficial effects for the input tax...|$|E
40|$|Although {{a global}} cap-and-trade system {{is seen by}} many {{researchers}} as the most cost-efficient solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, developing countries governments refuse to enter into such a system in the short term. Hence, many scholars and stakeholders, including the European Commission, have proposed various types of commitments for developing countries that appear less stringent, such as sectoral approaches. In this paper, we assess such a sectoral approach for developing countries. More precisely, we simulate two policy scenarios in which developed countries continue with Kyoto-type absolute commitments, whereas developing countries adopt an emission trading system limited to electricity generation and linked to developed countries' cap-and-trade system. In a first scenario, CO 2 allowances are auctioned by the government, which distributes the auctions receipts lump-sum to households. In a second scenario, the auction receipts are used <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on,</b> or to give subsidies to, electricity generation. Our quantitative analysis, led with a hybrid general equilibrium model, shows that such options provide almost as much emission reductions as a global cap-and-trade system. Moreover, in the second sectoral scenario, GDP losses in developing countries are much lower than with a global cap-and-trade system {{and so is the}} impact on the electricity price.

Furthermore, high estimates for the marginal efficiency costs of existing taxes weaken, rather than strengthen, the case for environmental taxes...|$|R
