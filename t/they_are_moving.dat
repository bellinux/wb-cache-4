5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found {{that the majority of}} these nebulae are moving away from us.|$|E
5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} environment in which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Munro also {{reported}} that, at the time, Rùm was highly forested, with {{an abundance of}} deer. Munro goes on to argue that the best way of slaying the deer would be when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> uphill (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} {{unveiling}} a {{new type}} of augmentation that will negate the use of Neuropozyne, Sarif Industries is attacked by the Tyrants. Adam Jensen attempts to save Megan Reed and her fellow scientists, but Tyrant leader Namir critically wounds him and apparently kills Megan and the scientists. David Sarif uses his most advanced technology to save Adam, giving him superhuman abilities: he also learns that the augmentations are bonding to him naturally without the need for Neuropozyne. Called back to deal with an attack on a Sarif Industries warehouse by anti-augmentation extremists, Adam discovers an augmented hacker attempting {{to gain access to the}} secret Typhoon weapon augmentation. Upon discovery, the hacker is forced by their controller to shoot himself. After Adam retrieves the deceased hacker's neural hub from his old Detroit police precinct, Frank Pritchard tracks the hacking signal to an abandoned factory in Highland Park. Adam discovers the Tyrants guarding a FEMA detention camp, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> out after the failure of the Sarif raid. Adam confronts and defeats one of the mercenaries, Barrett, who tells him to go to Hengsha before killing himself with a grenade.|$|E
5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of weapons to fight enemies. The game {{features}} a large arsenal of weapons, from two-handed pistols to rocket launchers, and a variety of sea, land and air vehicles. Players can drive them, jump on top of them or hide in front of them while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> and hijack enemy vehicles, triggering a series of quick-time events. Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. Early in the game, they encounter a black market supplier from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased (with optional delivery to the player's location by helicopter). As more chaos points are gained, additional weapons, vehicles and an extraction option become available on the black market. All black-market weapons and vehicles can be upgraded in steps with weapon and vehicle components in the game world; over 2,000 parts may be acquired. Players use a beacon to access the market.|$|E
5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level. When the right amount of ingredients has been put in the bowl, a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E

5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Vertigo {{can also}} be {{classified}} into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels as if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving.</b> The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it {{has little to do}} with the pathophysiology or treatment of vertigo.|$|E

25|$|Dead or diseased trees {{within the}} reach of saw team crews are evaluated, the {{strength}} {{and direction of the}} wind is evaluated. The lay of tree sections to be bucked or the lean of a tree to be felled is evaluated within the context of being aware of where the tree will fall or move to when cut, where {{the other members of the}} saw team are located, how <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving,</b> whether hikers are within the area of influence, whether hikers are moving or are stationary.|$|E
25|$|Players may {{point the}} bells of their {{instruments}} in the direction <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving,</b> or slide (also called traverse) with all the bells facing in the same direction. They may also point it towards {{the center of the}} field. Bands that march in time with the music typically also synchronize the direction of individuals' turns, and try to maintain even spacing between individuals in formations (called intervals). Sometimes bands specifically have wind players turn their instruments away from the audience to emphasize the dynamics of the music.|$|E
25|$|Honduran leaders {{refused to}} {{reinstate}} Zelaya before the elections, and {{international support for}} the elections remained scant {{leading up to the}} polls. Many Hondurans sought to move past the crisis with the elections, which had been scheduled previous to Zelaya's ouster. While Zelaya had urged abstention from the vote, initial returns indicated a larger than usual turnout, around 60%, a figure which was subsequently revised downward to 49%. Zelaya also disputed those figures at the time. Some Honduran activists have ended daily protests demanding the reinstatement of Zelaya since he was ousted in a coup, saying <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> on since Congress had voted to keep Manuel Zelaya out of office.|$|E

25|$|Under the Lebanese {{employment}} system, recruitment {{agencies are}} liable to provide a replacement within {{the first three months}} after a migrant domestic worker decides to discontinue work. These first three months are a preliminary “trial period”. In order to minimize having to do this, agencies advice employers to take measures to limit the freedom of the migrant domestic workers through the confiscation of their passport and restrict their communication with the outside world. Recruitment agencies have been known to encourage employers to place restrictions on migrant domestic workers which include the confiscation of their passport and confinement to the residence. Recruitment agencies in Lebanon receive very little state supervision. A Human Rights Watch report found that workers are often made false promises about the country <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> to, as well as the work they will do, and the conditions expected in the workplace. They are also misled about the salaries they can expect to receive.|$|E
25|$|Place field {{properties}} are similar between young and aged rats in the CA1 hippocampal region: rate of firing and spike characteristics (such as amplitude and width) are similar. However, while {{the size of}} place fields in the hippocampal CA3 region remains the same between young and aged rats, average firing rate in this region is higher in aged rats. Young rats exhibit place field plasticity. When <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> along a straight path, place fields are activated one after another. When young rats repeatedly traverse the same straight path, connection between place fields are strengthened due to plasticity, causing subsequent place fields to fire more quickly and causing place field expansion, possibly aiding young rats in spatial memory and learning. Recently, there has been debate as to whether there may be bidirectionality to place cell firing. However, this observed place field expansion and plasticity is decreased in aged rat subjects, possibly reducing their capacity for spatial learning and memory.|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds {{can move}} around on land, {{though not as}} well as {{terrestrial}} animals. Otariids and walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and under the body so they can [...] "walk" [...] on all fours. The fore-flippers move in a transverse, rather than a sagittal fashion. Otariids rely on the movements of their heads and necks more than their hind-flippers during terrestrial locomotion. By swinging their heads and necks, otariids create momentum while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving.</b> Sea lions have been recorded climbing up flights of stairs. Phocids are less agile on land. They cannot pull their hind-flippers forward, and move on land by lunging, bouncing and wiggling while their fore-flippers keep them balanced. Some species use their fore-flippers to pull themselves forward. Terrestrial locomotion is easier for phocids on ice, as they can sled along.|$|E

500|$|While {{returning}} to Hershel's farm, Shane stares at a walker {{in an abandoned}} field. Kirkman stated the walker symbolizes the growing scope of the zombie virus. [...] "We're really just trying to show {{that that kind of}} thing is inescapable," [...] he said. [...] "You're just driving down the street, you look over and, 'Oh, there you go, there’s a zombie.' We're trying to show that this world {{is becoming more and more}} populated by zombies. Our thinking is that large population centers like Atlanta are really where the heart of this began and as [...] moved out to Hershel’s farm they didn’t really encounter very many walkers because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving</b> out of the city center at a faster rate than the zombie population. And that zombie population is starting to catch up with them. The area is starting to become more and more dense with walkers." ...|$|E
500|$|Servals locate prey {{by their}} {{strong sense of}} hearing. To kill small prey, the serval will slowly stalk it, then pounce on it with the forefeet {{directed}} toward the chest, and finally land on it with its forelegs outstretched. The prey, receiving a blow from {{one or both of}} the serval's forepaws, is incapacitated, and the serval gives it a bite on the head or the neck and immediately swallows it. Snakes are dealt more blows and even bites, and may be consumed even as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>moving.</b> Larger prey, such as larger birds, are killed by a sprint followed by a leap to catch them as they are trying to flee, and are eaten slowly. Servals have been observed caching large kills to be consumed later by concealing them in dead leaves and grasses. Servals typically get rid of the internal organs of rodents while eating, and pluck feathers from birds before consuming them. During a leap, a serval can reach more than [...] above the ground and cover a horizontal distance of up to the cat can even change direction mid-air. Servals appear to be efficient hunters; a study in Ngorongoro showed that servals were successful in half of their hunting attempts, regardless of the time of hunting, and a mother serval was found to have a success rate of 62%. The number of kills in a 24-hour period averaged 15 to 16. Scavenging has been observed, but very rarely.|$|E
