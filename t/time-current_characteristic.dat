This testing is also consisted in principle of function, describing terms of distance protection and comparing with time-current characteristics. The next step after short estimation was describing digital distance protection SIPROTEC 7 SA 511. The advantages are included in this estimation. The next part contains some configurations and connections with a test equipment {{in order to take}} control of measuring through the computer. The extended configurations are also comprised of two programms – DIGSY and TZO 3. We had to make a suggestion of suitable methodics for measuring a <b>time-current</b> <b>characteristic.</b> We carried out three measurements where the test equipment was set to role of type TREND. A magnitude is generated at the output that is changed linearly in time with required rate (speed). We changed a current IX 1 for our measurements that was undertaken with a rate of current rise. This process was given by a test equipment when the set values were constant. In the second measurement we modified a size of shift phase in the test equipment. In the third measurement we tried to set up different sizes of particular impedance characteristics (zone) inside of the distance protection where was set a neutral breaking time for the measured zone. On the contrary, the previous measurements had an absolute time. We have introduced evaluated results of measuring and observations in the end of this bachelor’s thesis...|$|E

2500|$|Where several fuses are {{connected}} in series {{at the various}} levels of a power distribution system, it is desirable to blow (clear) only the fuse (or other overcurrent device) electrically closest to the fault. [...] This process is called [...] "coordination" [...] or [...] "discrimination" [...] and may require the <b>time-current</b> <b>characteristics</b> of two fuses to be plotted on a common current basis. Fuses are selected so that the minor, branch, fuse disconnects its circuit well before the supplying, major, fuse starts to melt. [...] In this way, only the faulty circuit is interrupted with minimal disturbance to other circuits fed by a common supplying fuse.|$|R

The fuse rating shall be selected to appropriately provide 125 percent of the transformers full-load rating continuously, sustain no damage from magnetizing in-rush currents, and provide protection against thermal damage from internal or secondary faults. The interrupting rating shall be sufficient to quickly and safely interrupt fault currents and prevent extensive damage to equipment.

Fault location in distribution systems is a challenging task {{because of the lack of}} homogeneity in the system and due to uncertainity in the data used for estimating the faulted sections. Fuzzy logic has widely been applied for handling uncertainities in the input data and its processing. Fuzzy logic has also been used to model human expertise and decision making capabilites and to determine the possibility of a fault on a particular section. This thesis presents the design and implementation of an operated device identification algorithm to be used as one of four modules in an automated modular scheme for fault section estimation on radial distribution systems. This algorithm will be executed in tandem with the other fault location modules that form the second stage of a three stage scheme. The operated device identification algorithm can assign section fault possibilities representing the possibility of involvement of each section of a distribution feeder in an event. The operated device algorithm uses the recorded current waveform of an abnormal event, the <b>time-current</b> <b>characteristics</b> and settings of various protective devices on a feeder, and feeder topology information as inputs. The algorithm then assigns a fault possibility value to each section of a feeder using fuzzy rules and fuzzy membership functions to compare a fault event with protective device settings and characteristics. The section fault possibility values can be superimposed on the feeder map by color coding the sections of a feeder according to their fault possibility values. This helps in easy visualization of possibly faulted sections. A detailed illustration of the results obtained from running the algorithm is presented in this thesis. They prove the effectiveness of the algorithm in locating faults in a distribution feeder. The operated device identification module was tested using real data measured at feeder substations. The results obtained by the algorithm were verified with feedback given by the utilities that owned the feeders. The results obtained from the tests were encouraging...|$|R
