40|$|<b>Tepoxalin</b> is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic {{properties and}} has been recently introduced into veterinary medicine. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile of <b>tepoxalin</b> to assess whether it would be suitable for clinical use in horses. Six female fasting/fed horses were given 10 mg/kg <b>tepoxalin</b> orally in a cross-over study. After administration, <b>tepoxalin</b> underwent rapid and extensive hydrolytic conversion to its carboxylic acid metabolite RWJ- 20142. In animals that had been fed, the plasma concentrations of <b>tepoxalin</b> were undetectable, whereas in fasting animals they were close to the limit of quantification of the method. No differences between the fasting/fed groups in RWJ- 20142 plasma concentrations were shown. <b>Tepoxalin</b> showed a strong and long-lasting ex vivo inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase (COX) - 1, mainly due to its main metabolite RWJ- 20142. <b>Tepoxalin</b> and RWJ- 20142 do not seem to possess either COX- 2 or 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitory activity in the horse. These features suggest that the drug is a selective COX- 1 inhibitor in horses, with no significant anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, its long term use in equine practice could be of concern...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{study the}} ability of <b>tepoxalin,</b> a dual {{inhibitor}} of cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) and its active metabolite to reduce the catabolic response of cartilage to cytokine stimulation in an in vitro model of canine osteoarthritis (OA). Grossly normal cartilage was collected post-mortem from seven dogs that had no evidence of joint disease. Cartilage explants were cultured in media containing the recombinant canine interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) at 100 ng/ml and recombinant human oncostatin-M (OSM) at 50 ng/ml. The effects of <b>tepoxalin</b> and its metabolite were studied at three concentrations (1 × 10 - 5, 1 × 10 - 6 and 1 × 10 - 7 M). Total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen (hydroxyproline) release from cartilage explants were used as outcome measures of proteoglycan and collagen depletion respectively. PGE 2 and LTB 4 assays were performed to {{study the effects of}} the drug on COX and LOX activity. Results Treatment with IL- 1 β and OSM significantly upregulated both collagen (p = 0. 004) and proteoglycan (p = 0. 001) release from the explants. <b>Tepoxalin</b> at 10 - 5 M and 10 - 6 M caused a decrease in collagen release from the explants (p = 0. 047 and p = 0. 075). Drug treatment showed no effect on GAG release. PGE 2 concentration in culture media at day 7 was significantly increased by IL- 1 β and OSM and treatment with both <b>tepoxalin</b> and its metabolite showed a trend towards dose-dependent reduction of PGE 2 production. LTB 4 concentrations were too low to be quantified. Cytotoxicity assays suggested that neither <b>tepoxalin</b> nor its metabolite had a toxic effect on the cartilage chondrocytes at the concentrations and used in this study. Conclusion This study provides evidence that <b>tepoxalin</b> exerts inhibition of COX and can reduce in vitro collagen loss from canine cartilage explants at a concentration of 10 - 5 M. We can conclude that, in this model, <b>tepoxalin</b> can partially inhibit the development of cartilage degeneration when it is available locally to the tissue. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} compares the {{analgesic}} {{effect of a}} tepoxalin-buprenorphine combination to that of buprenorphine alone in the 24 h peri-operative period in 20 dogs undergoing cranial cruciate ligament repair, which {{were randomly assigned to}} the two treatment protocols (n = 10). Additionally, possible side effects induced by <b>tepoxalin</b> were investigated. Analgesia was compared using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a multifactorial pain scale (MFPS), by an anaesthetist blinded from treatment. Analysis of the overall VAS-scores showed a significant decrease over time in both treatment groups. The decrease in the two groups was not significantly different from each other. No {{significant differences were found between}} the MFPS-scores of both protocols. Potential side effects of <b>tepoxalin</b> were investigated by venous blood sampling before premedication and 24 h after extubation, a buccal mucosal bleeding time test and recording of vomiting, diarrhoea and adverse effects at the surgical site. Analysis of the blood parameters showed that fibrinogen levels were overall higher 24 h after surgery in both protocols, but were significantly more elevated in the <b>tepoxalin</b> group. No significant differences were found for the other blood parameters. Statistically, <b>tepoxalin</b> failed to improve analgesia induced by buprenorphine. There was no convincing evidence that the administration of <b>tepoxalin</b> was not associated with gastrointestinal side effects. There were no significant adverse effects on renal function and primary haemostasis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tepoxalin</b> is a {{veterinary}} drug registered {{for use in}} the dog as a dual inhibitor (cyclooxygenase - 5 lipoxygenase). In the horse, it predominantly triggers a strong cyclooxygenase inhibition; this bias seems to be due to the action of its metabolite(s).

Hence, the identification of its main metabolic pathway is pivotal to better understand its clinical activity. A suitable high performance liquid chromatography method has been applied to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry for the characterization of the main metabolites in plasma of horses orally treated with <b>tepoxalin.</b> Mass spectrometry in full scan, product ion scan and precursor ion scan modes, provided information useful in elucidating large parts of the structure of the unknown metabolites detected.

The plasma samples (0. 5 mL) were directly extracted with acetonitrile 0. 9 mL; after high speed centrifugation to precipitate proteins 50 µL were injected into a HPLC. Separation was performed on a Gemini C 18 column (250 mm × 4. 6 mm i. d., 5 µm particles) with mobile phase A consisting of 0. 01 M 1 -octane-sulfonic acid in 0. 01 M acetic acid aqueous solution and mobile phase B consisting of tetrahydrofuran, using an isocratic elution at 50 % and 50 % at 1. 0 mL/min flow rate. Detection and quantitation were performed by fluorimetric detection at λex = 290 nm and λem = 440 nm.

40|$|Canine {{osteosarcoma}} (OSA) is {{an insidious}} disease {{accounting for the}} majority of skeletal malignancies. Recently, examination of dual cyclooxygenase and 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitors in human and canine oncology suggests that 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitors may be an effective approach for prevention and/or treatment. We examined 5 -lipoxygenase expression in primary canine osteosarcoma samples and have shown that approximately 65 % of osteosarcoma’s express cytoplasmic 5 -lipoxygenase. Further examination of a cell culture and a xenograft model shows similar 5 -lipoxygenase expression. Surprisingly, a canine 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitor (<b>tepoxalin)</b> significantly reduced cell proliferation at physiologic doses in-vitro and diminished xenograft tumor growth in nude mice suggesting therapeutic utility of this inhibitor. The lack of nuclear staining in primary and xenografted tumors, and lack of response to lipid mediator re-introduction, suggests that lipid mediator production is not the primary means by which <b>tepoxalin</b> acts to alter proliferation. Regardless of the mechanisms involved in retarding cell proliferation, <b>tepoxalin</b> might be a viable treatment option for canine osteosarcoma which warrants further clinical investigation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tepoxalin,</b> a novel {{inhibitor}} of cyclooxygenase (CO) and 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO), {{was investigated}} for biochemical activity and pharmacokinetics in two studies. Study I was a 4 -period, double-blind, randomized, single rising dose using 2 alternating panels (A, B) with interspersed placebo design (A: 25, 100, 400 mg, B: 50, 200, 800 mg p. o.). Study II was a 3 -panel, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple dose study (A: 100 mg, B: 200 mg, C: 400 mg). In both studies, CO inhibition {{was assessed by}} generation of serum thromboxane (TxB 2), 5 -LO activity by LTB 4 production ex vivo in Caionophore-stimulated blood. Plasma drug concentrations were assayed by HPLC for <b>tepoxalin</b> and its identified acid metabolite. It was found in both studies that at all dose levels the TxB 2 generation was markedly suppressed (> 95 % 2 h postdose). In study I, at 2 h postdose, % inhibition of LTB 4 biosynthesis was marginal for the 3 lower doses but significant at 200 (14 %), 400 (25 %) and 800 mg (43 %). In study II, the only significant inhibition occurred at the 400 mg dose at 6 h postdose on day 1 (17 %) and on day 8 at 4, 6 and 8 h postdose (32, 42 and 32 % respectively). In both studies and at all doses, plasma concentrations of <b>tepoxalin</b> varied widely between subjects. Linearity between plasma concentrations and dose could not be ascertained, and correlation between drug plasma levels and effect on LTB 4 synthesis was poor.

40|$|The {{pharmacodynamic}} {{properties of}} <b>tepoxalin,</b> Na-salicylate and ketoprofen were determined in an intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inflammation model in broiler chickens. The drugs were administered orally at {{a dose of}} 30, 50 and 3 mg/kg, respectively. LPS administration induces {{an increase in the}} intracellular expression of interleukin (IL) - 1 beta and IL- 6 and the secreted IL- 6 plasma concentration. Furthermore, an elevation in body temperature is noted. Despite pretreatment with a single dose of the drugs and LPS administration on the T-max of the drug after a second dose, no decrease was seen in systemic IL- 6 levels. The intracellular expression of IL- 1 beta in the heterophils was slightly decreased if LPS was administered in combination with each of the three drugs. <b>Tepoxalin</b> and Na-salicylate administration had no significant effect on the LPS-induced increase in prostaglandin E- 2 plasma concentration, in contrast to ketoprofen. None of the three drugs were able to influence the elevation in body temperature after LPS administration. The pharmacokinetic properties of Na-salicylate and ketoprofen were not altered in combination with LPS administration. However, LPS significantly decreased the AUC(0 -> 6 h) of the active metabolite of <b>tepoxalin,</b> RWJ- 20142, indicating a perfusion-limited elimination for this molecule...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the possible renal and hepatic toxicity of <b>tepoxalin</b> administered before or after isoflurane-induced hypotension, {{as well as for}} five consecutive days. Twelve healthy mixed-breed cats, adult males, weighing 4. 0 +/- 0. 8 kg were allocated into two groups. They received 25 mgkg(- 1) of <b>tepoxalin</b> orally, two hours before the anesthetic procedure (PRE) or after the procedure (POST) and daily for five days. Cats were anesthetized with isoflurane and the concentration was increased until mean arterial pressure reached 40 - 60 mmHg and kept at this level for 60 minutes. During hypotension, the physiological variables were measured at time 0 and every 10 minutes until 60 minutes, and bleeding time was measured at time 0, 30 and 60 minutes. Blood samples were drawn for a hemogram and determination of concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, creatinine and Na+ at baseline, 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days post-hypotension. Urine was collected at baseline, 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days post-hypotension for determination of concentrations of creatinine, gamma-glutamyltransferase, urine specific gravity, protein, albumin and Na+. During the anesthetic procedure there were no important variations in physiological variables and bleeding time. There were differences only in fractional excretion of Na+, which was elevated at 7 days of evaluation in PRE and in the urine protein/creatinine ratio in PRE, which was higher than in POST at 24 and 48 hours post-hypotension. We conclude that <b>tepoxalin</b> does not cause alterations in hepatic enzymes but can cause discrete renal injury, resulting in proteinuria, in cats subjected to 60 min of hypotension...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{eukaryotic}} {{transcription factor}} NF-κB is activated {{by a large}} variety of stimuli. We have recently shown that ER stress, caused by an aberrant accumulation of membrane proteins within this organelle, also activates NF-κB. Here, we show that activation of NF-κB by ER stress requires {{an increase in the}} intracellular levels of both reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) and ca 2 +. Two distinct intracellular Ca 2 + chelators and a panel of structurally unrelated antioxidants prevented NF-κB activation by various ER stress-eliciting agents, whereas only antioxidants but not the Ca 2 + chelators prevented NF-κB activation by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Consistent with an involvement of calcium, the ER-resident Ca 2 +-ATPase inhibitors thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), which trigger a rapid efflux of Ca 2 + from the ER, also potently activated NF-κB. Pretreatment with a Ca 2 + chelator abrogated this induction. The Ca 2 + chelator BAPTA-AM inhibited ROI formation in response to thapsigargin and CPA treatment, suggesting that the Ca 2 + increase preceded ROI formation during NF-κB activation. The selective inhibitory effect of the drug <b>tepoxalin</b> suggests that the peroxidase activity of cyclooxygenases or lipoxygenases was responsible for the increased ROI production in response to Ca 2 + release by thapsigargin...|$|E
