5|$|A {{critical}} and commercial success in 1990, Fear of a Black Planet sold two {{million copies in}} the United States and received rave reviews from critics, many of whom named {{it one of the}} year's best albums. Its immediate success contributed significantly to the popularity of Afrocentric and political subject matter in hip hop and the genre's mainstream resurgence at the time. Since then, it has been viewed as one of hip hop's greatest and most important records, as well as being musically and culturally significant. In 2003, Fear of a Black Planet was ranked number 300 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> 2005, the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry.|$|E

5|$|As of that <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the {{following}} decades, Western Pomerania, plus some of Greater Poland, Lower Silesia and some areas {{west of the}} middle and lower Oder River made up the Sukow-Dziedzice culture group. Its origin {{is the subject of}} debate among archeologists. First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived from any other Slavic archeological culture. They reveal certain similarities to the artifacts of the Dobrodzień group of the Przeworsk culture. According to scholars such as Siedow, Kurnatowska and Brzostowicz, it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition. According to allochthonists, it represents a variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage. The Sukow-Dziedzice group shows significant idiosyncrasies, such as no graves and (typical {{for the rest of the}} Slavic world) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span.|$|E

5|$|Belgium {{failed to}} {{progress}} {{past the first}} round of their earliest five World Cup participations. After two scoreless defeats at the inaugural World Cup in 1930, the team scored in their first-round knockout games in the 1934 and 1938 editions—but only enough to save their honour. In 1954, they tied with England (4–4 after extra <b>time),</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> 1970, they won their first World Cup match, against El Salvador (3–0). From 1982 until 2002, Belgium reached six successive World Cups by playing qualification rounds, advancing to the second phase five times. In the 1982 FIFA World Cup opener, Belgium beat defending champions Argentina 1–0. Their tournament ended in the second group stage, after a Polish hat-trick by Zbigniew Boniek and a 0–1 loss against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep <b>time,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names {{on the back of}} jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> {{addition}} it helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E

Methods: Screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks <b>in</b> screen <b>time</b> were assessed with questionnaires in a sample of 445 children (10 - 12 years) in Belgium, Greece, Hungary and Norway. Parents’ screen time, breaks in screen <b>time,</b> parents’ PA <b>and</b> demographics were also assessed with questionnaires. Accelerometers measured sedentary <b>time</b> per day <b>and</b> breaks <b>in</b> sedentary <b>time</b> per day <b>and</b> MVPA (children only). Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to assess the associations between the independent variables and the dependent variables.

Results: No statistical significant interactions were found between the significant independent variables.

While Melbourne had only been commissioned in 1955, the de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey Gannet maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) were becoming obsolete. It was believed that Melbourne {{was too small to}} operate more modern aircraft types, and the RAN investigated options to buy a larger carrier. The Government judged that the cost of a new aircraft carrier was too high, especially given the expense of the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) procurement programs at that <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> November 1959 it was announced that the FAA would cease to operate fixed-wing aircraft in 1963.|$|E

Eleanor, however, was kept under effective house arrest until the 1180s. The rebel barons were kept imprisoned for a short <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> some cases fined, then restored to their lands. The rebel castles in England and Aquitaine were destroyed.
