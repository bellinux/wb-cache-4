Outside of the various cities, most of US12 is a rural, two-lane state highway. One section runs concurrently with I-94 south of Ypsilanti. From there eastward, the US12 is a divided highway and then a boulevard into the Detroit area. The entire length of the highway east of Coldwater is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|East Lawn {{was laid}} {{out in front of}} the east window and was used for grand bazaars and fêtes until the early 20th century. A ha-ha was {{installed}} behind to keep cattle out of the grounds. To the south of the priory buildings the Long Terrace ran almost <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the grounds. It afforded access to the ruins via a flight of steps flanked by two carved demi-sea wolves, reflecting the coat of arms of the Chaloners.

The Lake Michigan Circle Tour was signed on maps by 1988. In May 2001, the section of US12 through Saline was designated a Michigan Historic Heritage Route. The segment through Clinton was given the same status in October 2002. On June 9, 2004, <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> US12 was dedicated as the US12 Heritage Trail. In December 2014, this became a Pure Michigan Byway when Governor Rick Snyder signed legislation renaming the Michigan Heritage Route System to the Pure Michigan Byway System.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{submarines}} resumed {{operations in}} Australian waters in January 1943. I-21 made {{a highly successful}} patrol in January and February, during which she sank five ships, and two other submarines operated off Sydney and Brisbane in March. A force of five boats from the IJN's 3rd Submarine Squadron subsequently attacked shipping along <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the Australian east coast during April and May {{in an attempt to}} disrupt the Allied supply line to New Guinea. This marked the peak of the Japanese submarine offensive against Australia and nine ships were sunk off the east coast within a month. In contrast with 1942, several successful attacks were made against ships travelling in convoys.|$|E
5|$|Sierra Highway or El Camino Sierra is a road in Southern California, United States. El Camino Sierra {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a trail {{formed in the}} 19th century, rebuilt as {{highways}} in the early 20th century, that ran from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe following parts of modern State Route 14, U.S. Route 395 and State Route 89. Two portions of this road are currently signed as Sierra Highway. The first is an old alignment of SR14/U.S. Route 6 from Los Angeles to Mojave. This road is also signed with the unusual designation of State Route14U through the city of Santa Clarita. The second part signed as Sierra Highway is a portion of US395 in Bishop.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Automobile Club took {{a one-year}} lease on the Silverstone {{airfield}} site in early 1948 {{and set about}} creating a race track. The airfield conformed to the standard model for WWII RAF sites: three long, wide runways formed a triangle, their ends joined by a narrow perimeter roadway. In this inaugural year the RAC decided to lay out a relatively long circuit, using <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two longest runways, as well as large portions of the perimeter road.|$|R
500|$|The town of Basin {{began as}} a 19thcentury mining camp near the {{confluence}} of Basin Creek with the Boulder River.

There are four tracks through the site {{although there are no}} platforms for the c2c lines. <b>The</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the platform is covered by a single station canopy with a central waiting room. The Art Deco red brick ticket office is located below platform level to which it is connected by a subway and stairway. Although similar to the other single-storey station buildings on this part of the route, it is notable for its high atrium roof and polygonal shape. The floor is tiled with a reversed swastika pattern, a popular decorative design at the time the station was constructed. The station is listed as a building of local heritage interest by Havering London Borough Council.|$|E

T service is planned to operate at a frequency of 14 trains per hour during rush hours, with the combined frequency north of 72nd Street with Q service being 28 trains per hour. With the opening of Phase 3, the frequency of Q service is planned to be reduced from 19 trains per hour back to 14 trains per hour.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{signed for}} Rangers in July 1995, for a club record fee of £4.3million, on wages of £15,000 a week. He made an {{immediate}} impact; {{in the fifth}} league {{game of the season}} in the Old Firm match at Celtic Park he scored a goal after running almost <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the pitch. On 30 December, in a match against Hibernian, Gascoigne was booked by referee Dougie Smith after he picked Smith's yellow card up from the ground and jokingly 'booked' the referee. Rangers {{went on to win the}} league in the 1995–96 season, clinching the title in the penultimate game of the season against Aberdeen at Ibrox Stadium; Gascoigne scored a hat-trick during the game. Rangers won the double as they also won the Scottish Cup by knocking out Keith, Clyde, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Celtic, before beating Heart of Midlothian 5–1 in the final at Hampden Park. He scored 19 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions, and was named as both PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year and SFWA Footballer of the Year.|$|E
50|$|The Adelaide {{suburban}} {{railway network}} consists of six lines {{operated by the}} Department of Planning, Transport & Infrastructure Public Transport Division. Until 2014, the suburban network {{was the only one}} in Australia to operate solely with diesel railcars. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seaford and Tonsley lines have been electrified, as well as the segment of the Belair line from Goodwood to its terminus at Adelaide. Although the original plans were to electrify the remaining three lines, they were abandoned in 2012 with the potential for a Gawler line upgrade in 2017-18.|$|R
50|$|The town of Basin {{began as}} a 19th century mining camp near the {{confluence}} of Basin Creek with the Boulder River.

5|$|Like {{other state}} {{highways}} in Michigan, I-196 is {{maintained by the}} Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 77,500vehicles used the highway daily between Lane Avenue and US131 in Grand Rapids and 12,778vehicles did so each day north of the split with US31 near Holland. These are the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-196 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In addition, the highway has been named by the Michigan Legislature the Gerald R. Ford Freeway to honor the 38th President of the United States. The original legislation from 1974 extended that name to <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the freeway, but when the various memorial highway names were re-codified in 2001, the name was not applied to the Berrien County segment. From the junction with M-63 north to the split with US31 except for the section that connects {{the ends of the}} South Haven business loop, the freeway is also a part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT), a tourist route that follows Lake Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Railroad-building expert Earl Vilmer {{created the}} track layout and {{operations}} for the DRR. Roger Broggie hired Vilmer because of his experience building railroads in Iran for the Allies during World War II, in France after the war, and later in Venezuela for U.S. Steel. Vilmer designed {{the operations of the}} DRR {{in such a way that}} each of its two trains would be assigned to a single station on the rail line, making only complete round trips possible. The Retlaw 1 passenger train pulled by the No. 2 locomotive only serviced Main Street, U.S.A. Station while the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the No. 1 locomotive only serviced Frontierland Station, and with sidings at both stations, each train would operate simultaneously and continue down the rail line even if the other train was stopped at its station. The first test run of the DRR's trains along <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> its route occurred on July 10, 1955, one week before Disneyland's opening. The steam trains of the DRR were the first of Disneyland's attractions to become operational.|$|E
5|$|The Ekeberg Line {{is served}} by lines 18 and 19 of the Oslo Tramway. Line 19 always runs <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the line, while Line 18 does not operate from Ljabru to Holtet during the morning and afternoon. Line 18 connects via the city center to the Ullevål Hageby Line while Line 19 runs onwards along the Briskeby Line. Travel time from Ljabru to Holtet is 7 minutes, to Oslo Hospital is 14 minutes and to Jernbanetoget is 20 minutes. Both of the lines run every 10 minutes during the day, every 20 minutes during the evenings {{and part of the}} {{weekends}} and every 30 minutes during early mornings on weekends. This gives a peak service of every 5 minutes along the Ekeberg Line. The service is provided using high-floor SL79 and low-floor SL95 trams. Because of the lack of a balloon loop at Rikshospitalet, Line 18 must be operated with SL95 units, while SL79 units are used on Line 19 because the Brikeby Line does not have a high enough permitted axle load to for the SL95 units.|$|E

All {{services}} operate with a fifteen-minute headway, except during late evenings and weekend mornings. This gives the stations Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion an average five-minute headway to the city center and all stations in the Common Tunnel, and an average ten-minute headway to Nydalen and Storo. On the east side of the city, Line 5 connects with the Ring Line, and makes a full loop before it leaves Oslo on the Grorud Line. Line 4 connects with the Lambertseter Line. Travel time from Stortinget to Sognsvann is 18 minutes. The Oslo Metro is operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter.|$|E
5|$|The primary uniform (jersey, {{shorts and}} socks) is red with {{alternating}} lighter and darker horizontal bands, black sleeves with red trim, and a vertical black band below each sleeve extending <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the jersey. The secondary uniform includes white jerseys {{with a large}} red horizontal band below a smaller blue band across the chest with blue and red trim, white socks with blue trim, and with either red or blue shorts (the choice of which {{is subject to the}} opponent uniform). In its first three seasons, Toronto FC's secondary uniform colours were light and dark grey. In the following four seasons the team wore white secondary uniforms, whereas in 2014, the secondary uniforms were changed to onyx. As with all MLS teams, the uniforms are produced by Adidas.

5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half {{the width of the}} flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E
