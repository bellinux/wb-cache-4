5|$|Due to {{the loss}} of the {{original}} multi-track tape, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been an official true stereo release of the final track until the 2012 remastered version of Smiley Smile. The stereo mix was made possible through the invention of new digital technology by Derry Fitzgerald, and received the blessing of Brian Wilson and Mark Linett. Fitzgerald's software extracted individual instrumental and vocal stems from the original mono master—as the multi-track vocals remained missing—to construct the stereo version that appears on the 2012 reissue of Smiley Smile.|$|E
5|$|Tribunes {{could use}} their sacrosanctity {{to order the}} use of capital {{punishment}} against any person who interfered with their duties. Tribunes could also use their sacrosanctity as protection when physically manhandling an individual, such as when arresting someone. On a couple of rare occasions (such as during the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus), a tribune might use a form of blanket obstruction, which could involve a broad veto over all governmental functions. While a tribune could veto any act of the senate, the assemblies, or the magistrates, he could only veto the act, and not the actual measure. Therefore, he had to physically be present when the act was occurring. As soon as that tribune was no longer present, the act could be completed as if <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been a veto.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-final {{match against}} {{eventual}} champions France, Baggio came on {{as a substitute}} for Del Piero in the second half, and managed to create some scoring opportunities. The score remained 0–0, and the match went to extra time, although Baggio came the closest to scoring the golden goal, with a volley from a lobbed pass by Albertini, but his shot was put just wide of Fabian Barthez's far post. The match eventually went to a penalty shootout. Although Baggio converted his penalty, the shootout was won by the host nation, as Italy were eliminated on penalties in a World Cup for the third consecutive time. Italy's coach, was criticised for starting the recovering Del Piero ahead of Baggio, and for not allowing the two players to play alongside each other. Despite rumours that the substitutions had created a rivalry between the players, Baggio and Del Piero remain friends. Baggio stated in 2008 that he has great respect for Del Piero, and that <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been disagreements between them. Del Piero in turn stated in 2011 that Baggio, along with Zinedine Zidane, was the best player with whom he had ever played.|$|E

Certain sections of the press predicted (or even called for) Leeds's expulsion from the Football League, but this was considered a difficult matter for the League, since <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been any precedent for expelling a club outside of the bottom division.|$|E

25|$|An {{interesting}} meteorological occurrence was {{the first}} snowfall, which occurred on 8 July 1994 in Pelotas from 11:00am to 1:30pm. Before this date, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been any record of snow in the city. The phenomenon was weaker in the urban parts of the city, and did not cover the ground. However, the snowfall was more intense further inland, in districts such as Cascata and Quilombo, {{and was able to}} cover the vegetation in a white blanket. Snow grains were recorded in Pelotas on 4 September 2006, on 5 September 2008, and on 3 August 2010, and graupel was registered on 12 July 2012, and on 25 September 2012.|$|E
25|$|Cain {{was elected}} in 1917 to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as MLA for Jika Jika, which was renamed Northcote in 1927, a seat he held for 40 years. Victoria was Labor's weakest state, and <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been a {{majority}} Labor state government. This was partly because of Labor's weakness in rural areas (dominated by the Country Party) {{and partly because of}} the strength of Deakinite liberalism among middle-class voters in Melbourne. Most notably the lack of a Labor majority government was however due to the high degree of rural malapportionment existing in the state's electoral system, strongly favouring the rural electorates to the disenfranchisement of inner-city electorates, where Labor's vote was centralised.|$|E
25|$|As <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been {{a single}} {{organizational}} body governing {{the teaching of the}} art, several variant styles and sub-styles developed. Although there are classical texts which include specific encoded instructions and general guidelines for practice, many of these are ignored by most modern practitioners, and interpreted in different ways by those who follow their instruction (this is depicted in the lineage chart further down this page). As a result, over the decades and especially over the last few dozen years, branches of the art have considerably differentiated and diverged. This trend was strengthened by cross influences various Xing Yi teachers had from other martial arts and martial artists, and the spread of Xing Yi to the Western World.|$|E

In December 2008, the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) withdrew Air Tanzania's Air Operator Certificate because the airline {{had failed to}} meet the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Two weeks later, the International Air Transport Association banned the air carrier from all aviation transactions and informed all travel agencies and other aviation companies to stop all transactions with Air Tanzania until further notice. The certificate was restored in January 2009, with both the TCAA and Air Tanzania claiming <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been any doubt about the airworthiness of its aircraft. In 2009, Air Tanzania flew 60,018 passengers, while Precision Air moved 583,000 passengers and Coastal Aviation 141,995 passengers.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{really been}} peace, the War of the Ring started in Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed the Fords of Isen. Théodred, {{the son of}} the King Théoden, had mustered his forces on the fords to launch a {{surprise}} attack against the enemy. On 23 February TA 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the orcs marching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard however, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an island in the fords, but they were soon surrounded and he was killed. Grimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if Elfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the first battle of the Fords of Isen ended in defeat for the Rohirrim.|$|E
25|$|Macneil's work {{is often}} {{considered}} inaccessible {{and difficult to}} read. And Macneil himself has expressed some disappointment at the reception of the work among legal scholars: 'I have now had over a decade to accept that <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been any race to a relational theory of contract, nor have the succeeding years seen either widespread acceptance of (or indeed much challenge to) my particular theory or the development of other relational theories.' However, the Northwestern symposium and other more recent work goes some way to correcting that omission. In particular, David Campbell has published an edited collection of Macneil's relational contract theory work. Macneil's work in particular has also been discussed by Richard Austen-Baker, who relates Macneil's system of norms to English contract law doctrine, and used Macneil's theory to discuss the need or otherwise of further regulation of consumer contracts.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the common belief among educated sectors of the European populace was that <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been any genuine cult of witches and that all those persecuted and {{executed}} as such had been innocent of the crime. At this time, two figures independently raised the prospect that the witch trials had been influenced by stereotypes and folk customs that had pre-Christian origins. In his 1749 work Del Congresso Notturno delle Lamie (On the Nocturnal Meeting of Witches), the Italian cleric Girolamo Tartarotti claimed that the stereotype of the witch in Early Modern Europe was influenced by pre-Christian folk beliefs. Similar ideas were echoed by the German folklorist Jacob Grimm in his Deutsche Mythologie (Teutonic Mythology), first published in 1835. Here, he claimed that the witch stereotype reflected an blending of pre-Christian folk traditions with the later Medieval views of heresy. Both Tartarotti and Grimm would subsequently be erroneously cited as claiming that the witches had been members of a surviving pre-Christian cult.|$|E
25|$|In 252, Sun Liang {{ascended the}} throne upon {{the death of}} his father. In January 253, he instated Lady Quan as the empress. Following that, Empress Quan's family and {{relatives}} rose to power as six members of the Quan clan (including Quan Shang) were enfeoffed as marquises and assumed high offices in the Wu government and military forces. This was regarded as a phenomenon because since the founding of Wu in 229, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been a case of waiqi (外戚; relatives of the emperor's wives) playing prominent roles in the Wu political scene. In 257, when Zhuge Dan (a general from Wu's rival state Cao Wei) started a rebellion in the Wei-controlled Shouchun (壽春; around present-day Shou County, Anhui), he requested help from Wu so Sun Liang ordered the Quans to lead troops to Shouchun to assist Zhuge Dan. However, the rebellion was suppressed by Wei forces and Zhuge Dan was killed, while four of the Quans surrendered and defected to Wei, thereafter the Quans' influence in Wu weakened drastically.|$|E
25|$|After the {{election}} he retained the Liberal leadership but {{proved to be}} less than suited for opposition. On 19 January 1977, the Granville rail disaster claimed the lives of 83 people—the worst rail disaster in Australian history at the time. In response to this, Willis declared that <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been as many deaths on the railways during the Liberal Government. The insensitive remark led several Liberal MLAs to introduce a no-confidence motion in Willis' leadership. While Willis survived the motion, speculation about a leadership challenge continued {{for the rest of his}} term. On 15 December four party MPs declared that they would oppose him in a leadership ballot the next day. On 15 December 1977, Willis called a press conference to announce his intention to resign as leader: On 16 December, he formally resigned as leader at the party meeting and was replaced by Peter Coleman. Willis resigned as Member for Earlwood on 16 June 1978, at the age of 56. At the resulting by-election, Earlwood fell to the Labor candidate, Ken Gabb.|$|E
