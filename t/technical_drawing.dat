5|$|Stanley {{designed}} {{and set up}} a factory in 1875 or 1876 (called The Stanley Works, it was listed in the 1876 Croydon Directories as Stanley Mathematical Instruments) in Belgrave Road near Norwood Junction railway station, which produced a variety of instruments for civil, military, and mining engineers, prospectors and explorers, architects, meteorologists and artists, including various <b>Technical</b> <b>drawing</b> tools. The firm moved out of the factory in the 1920s, with the factory being occupied by a joinery firm until, following a fire, it was converted into residential use in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Three-dimensional space can be {{represented}} convincingly in art, as in <b>technical</b> <b>drawing,</b> by means other than perspective. Oblique projections, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from {{the first or second}} centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the Ukiyo-e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815).|$|E
5|$|In July 1907, Dallas {{joined the}} assay {{office of the}} Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, and also {{enrolled}} in the local technical college, where he took night classes in chemistry and <b>technical</b> <b>drawing.</b> He showed an early interest in aviation, fuelled by the establishment in 1911 of the Mount Morgan chapter of the Queensland Aero Club. Dallas {{and his younger brother}} Norvel built a glider, which was wrecked by an untimely gust of wind the first time they tried to launch it. The two brothers continued to build model gliders in spite of this initial disaster, and Stan corresponded with pioneer aviators in France, England, and the United States. He later transferred to a higher-paying job driving trucks for Iron Island ironstone quarries. Stan and Norvel once again built their own flying machine while Stan was working on Iron Island. They experimented with this seaplane on nearby Marble Island, notorious for its treacherous waters; Stan lost this aeroplane in the sea.|$|E

5|$|William Stanley {{was born}} on Monday 2 February 1829 in Islington, London, one of nine {{children}} of John Stanley (a mechanic and builder) and his wife, Selina Hickman, and a direct descendant of Thomas Stanley, the 17th-century author of History of Philosophy. He was baptised on Wednesday 4 March 1829 at St Mary’s Church, Islington. At the age of 10 Stanley started going regularly to a day school run by a Mr Peil until he was 12. From the age of 12 until he was 14, his maternal uncle William Ford Hickman paid for his education at a different school. Despite having limited formal learning, Stanley taught himself mathematics, mechanics, astronomy, music, French, geology, chemistry, architecture and theology. He attended lessons in <b>technical</b> <b>drawing</b> at the London Mechanics’ Institution (now called Birkbeck College), where he enrolled in 1843, attending engineering and phrenology lessons.|$|E
25|$|Drafting or <b>technical</b> <b>drawing</b> is {{the means}} by which {{mechanical}} engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A <b>technical</b> <b>drawing</b> can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.|$|E
25|$|John Arthur 'Jack' Brabham {{was born}} on 2 April 1926 in Hurstville, New South Wales, then a {{commuter}} town outside Sydney. Brabham was involved with cars and mechanics from an early age. At the age of 12, he learned to drive the family car and the trucks of his father's grocery business. Brabham attended technical college, studying metalwork, carpentry, and <b>technical</b> <b>drawing.</b>|$|E

25|$|The primary graphic motifs of constructivism {{were the}} {{rectangular}} {{bar and the}} triangular wedge, others were the more basic geometries of the square and the circle. In his series Prouns, El Lizzitzky assembled collections of geometries at various angles floating free in space. They evoke basic structural units such as bars of steel or sawn lumber loosely attached, piled, or scattered. They were also often drafted and share aspects with <b>technical</b> <b>drawing</b> and engineering drawing. Similar in composition is the deconstructivist series Micromegas by Daniel Libeskind.|$|E
25|$|Drawing is a {{means of}} making a picture, using any {{of a wide variety of}} tools and techniques. It {{generally}} involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling, and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in <b>technical</b> <b>drawing</b> is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman.|$|E

25|$|Birmingham artists took leading {{international}} {{roles in}} several artistic developments during the post-war period. Peter Phillips, {{who was born}} in the city and both studied and taught at the Birmingham School of Art, was one of the central figures in the birth of Pop Art. In the early 1960s he produced some of the movement's earliest works, combining the influence of his Birmingham training in advertising and <b>technical</b> <b>drawing</b> with the layout and structure of early Italian Renaissance altarpieces. His presidency of the 1961 Young Contemporaries exhibition was pivotal to the emergence of British Pop Art as a coherent and widely recognised phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{who would later}} become the Yellow Kid first {{appeared on the scene}} in a minor supporting role in cartoon panel published in Truth magazine in 1894 and 1895. The four different black-and-white single panel cartoons were deemed popular, and one of them, Fourth Ward Brownies, was reprinted on 17 February 1895 in Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, where Outcault worked as a <b>technical</b> <b>drawing</b> artist. The World published another, newer Hogan's Alley cartoon less than a month later, and this was followed by the strip's first color printing on 5 May 1895. Hogan's Alley gradually became a full-page Sunday color cartoon with the Yellow Kid (who was also appearing several times a week) as its lead character.|$|E
25|$|Tyndall {{was born}} in Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, Ireland. His father was a local police constable, descended from Gloucestershire emigrants who settled in {{southeast}} Ireland around 1670. Tyndall attended the local schools (Ballinabranna Primary School) in County Carlow until his late teens, and was probably an assistant teacher {{near the end of}} his time there. Subjects learned at school notably included <b>technical</b> <b>drawing</b> and mathematics with some applications of those subjects to land surveying. He was hired as a draftsman by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland in his late teens in 1839, and moved to work for the Ordnance Survey for Great Britain in 1842. In the decade of the 1840s, a railroad-building boom was in progress, and Tyndall's land surveying experience was valuable and in demand by the railway companies. Between 1844 and 1847, he was lucratively employed in railway construction planning.|$|E

25|$|In 1814, {{increasingly}} {{opposed to}} the Greek-language teaching favored by the Phanariotes, Asachi proposed {{the first in a}} series of Romanian-language educational institutions, a course in engineering and topography to be held at the Princely Academy in Iaşi; once approved by the ruler and countersigned by Veniamin, the lectures attracted a number of young boyars (including the future Ottoman diplomat Alexandros Kallimachis, Scarlat's son, Teodor Balş (who was to serve as Moldvia's kaymakam in 1856-1857), Daniel Scavinschi, as well as Gheorghe Asachi's brother Petru. He gave various lectures, and offered additional training in drawing and art history, as well as in Romanian history. He organized several exhibits of his students' work in <b>technical</b> <b>drawing.</b> Despite a favorable report from its inspectors, Asachi's facility soon met with opposition from Greek teachers at the Academy, which led it to be closed soon after its original students graduated (1819).|$|E
25|$|Army officers' {{training}} {{was completed in}} the Military Academy (now Academia Militar de Agulhas Negras, also the only engineering school in Brazil up to 1874), {{although it was not}} obligatory for personnel to study there to advance in the profession. Personnel from the infantry and cavalry branches only needed to study the disciplines of the 1st year (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and <b>technical</b> <b>drawing)</b> and 5th year (tactical, strategy, camping, fortification in campaign, terrain reconnaissance and chemistry). Engineers and artillerymen were obliged to study the complete course, which resulted in their branches being considered the most prestigious. However, if they preferred, infantrymen and cavalrymen were allowed to study the disciplines of the 2nd year (algebra, geometry, analytical geometry, differential and integral calculus, descriptive geometry and technical drawing); 3rd year (mechanics, ballistics and technical drawing); 4th year (spherical trigonometry, physics, astronomy, geodesy, geography and technical drawing); 6th year (regular and irregular fortification, attacking and defending strongholds, civil architecture, roads, ports, canals, mineralogy and technical drawing); and 7th year (artillery, mines and natural history).|$|E
500|$|McNair's {{skills in}} <b>technical</b> <b>drawing,</b> engineering, {{prototype}} building, and statistical analysis {{began to be}} known Army-wide; in 1912 the commandant of the Field Artillery School requested him by name for assignment to his staff. [...] Instructors at the school had {{spent more than a}} year gathering information on 7,000 rounds fired during tests and field exercises; because the school was short-staffed, the commandant called on McNair to compile the data into firing tables that {{would make it easier for}} Artillery crews Army-wide to plan and control indirect fire. [...] While carrying out this assignment in 1913, he also spent seven months in France to observe and gather information on the French Army's artillery training, education, and employment.|$|E
