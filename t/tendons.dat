5|$|In the holotype of C. casuarius, {{the sides}} and tail of the body are covered in scales of several types. Polygonal tuberculate scales, covered in small bumps, vary in size over the body. Conical limpet-like scales are only {{preserved}} on a fold of skin preserved {{on the back of}} the tibia, but which was probably from the bottom of the belly, rather than the leg. Separating the polygonal scales of C. casuarius are shieldlike scales, arranged close together in rows. Ossified <b>tendons</b> are present on all the vertebrae, except for those in the cervical region. On no vertebrae do the <b>tendons</b> extend below the transverse processes. Each tendon is flattened at its origin, and transversely ovoid in the central rod, ending at a rounded point.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of <b>tendon</b> curvature on measurements of <b>tendon</b> length using 3 D-kinematic analysis. Curved and straight <b>tendon</b> models were employed for assessing medial gastrocnemius <b>tendon</b> length and strain during hopping (N = 8). <b>Tendon</b> curvature was identified using small reflective markers placed on the skin surface {{along the length of}} the <b>tendon</b> and a sum of vectors between the markers from the calcaneous up to the marker at the origin of <b>tendon</b> was calculated. The straight <b>tendon</b> was defined as a length of vector from the calcaneous to the marker at the origin of <b>tendon.</b> The curved <b>tendon</b> method yielded 5. 0 ± 1. 3 mm longer <b>tendon</b> (p < 0. 001) than the straight <b>tendon</b> model. <b>Tendon</b> elongation was 2. 1 ± 1. 6 mm and peak strain 1. 3 ± 0. 7 % smaller in curved than in straight <b>tendon</b> model (p < 0. 01).

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} surface-active phospholipid (SAPL, or surfactant) in equine <b>tendon</b> and <b>tendon</b> sheath fluid. METHODS: The left front flexor <b>tendon</b> and sheath were removed from five Thoroughbred horses. Phospholipid was extracted from <b>tendon</b> sheath fluid using Folch reagent and quantified using spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the <b>tendon</b> surfaces. RESULTS: The presence of phospholipid (90. 6 (SD 4. 3) mu g/ml) in <b>tendon</b> sheath fluid, plus the appearance of oligolamellar layers and lamellar bodies on the <b>tendon</b> surface were indicative of SAPL. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of SAPL was found in equine <b>tendon,</b> and may have a similar lubricating function as reported for synovial joints. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings may {{have important implications for}} normal <b>tendon</b> function and possible therapeutic adjuncts for <b>tendon</b> and <b>tendon</b> sheath injuries...|$|R
5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, <b>tendons</b> and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus.

40|$|Background: After {{ligament}} reconstruction, mechanical {{deterioration of}} the grafted <b>tendon</b> is observed with revascularization and cellular infiltration. However, the effect of cellular infiltration on the mechanical properties of the <b>tendon</b> matrix has not been fully understood. Methods: Cultured fibroblasts derived from the rabbit patellar <b>tendon</b> were seeded around an acellular rabbit patellar <b>tendon</b> that had undergone freeze–thaw treatment. At time- 0, 3, and 6 weeks after seeding the cells, we evaluated cellular distribution in the <b>tendon</b> using a confocal laser microscope and the mechanical evaluations of the <b>tendon</b> fascicles and the <b>tendon</b> bundles. Findings: The confocal laser microscopic analysis showed fibroblast infiltration ex vivo into the acellular <b>tendon</b> matrix. We could not find significant effects of the cellular infiltration on the tangent modulus of the <b>tendon</b> bundle, although the ex vivo cellular infiltration significantly reduced the modulus of the <b>tendon</b> fascicle. In addition, the tangent modulus of the incubated <b>tendon</b> without fibroblasts significantly decreased with time, particularly in the <b>tendon</b> bundle levels.

5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight.

The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes.

5|$|The neck {{consisted}} of nine cervical vertebrae, {{which would have}} formed an S-shaped curve, {{as indicated by the}} shape of the vertebral bodies in the side view of the skeleton. The vertebral bodies of the anterior cervical vertebrae are shaped like a parallelogram, those of the middle are rectangular and those of the posterior show a trapezoid shape. The trunk was short, consisting of 12 dorsal and 6 fused sacral vertebrae. The tail was long compared to the body; although incompletely known, it probably {{consisted of}} 34 to 37 caudal vertebrae. The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified <b>tendons,</b> beginning with the fourth dorsal vertebra. This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. In contrast to many other ornithischians, the tail of Heterodontosaurus lacked ossified <b>tendons,</b> and was therefore probably flexible. It had a long, narrow pelvis and a pubis which resembled those possessed by more advanced ornithischians.|$|E

Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club {{would have been able to}} break the metatarsal bones of large theropods.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Tendon</b> is an {{important}} supportive tissue of human body responsible for normal physical activity. However, <b>tendon</b> damage and defect remain {{an important}} factor for causing disability. The rise of tissue engineering technology provides {{an effective means of}} <b>tendon</b> reconstruction and repair, which will bring promise for functional recovery. In our center, <b>tendon</b> engineering is one of major research areas. We have performed the in vivo study by using tenocytes and polyglycolic acid fibers to reconstruct and repair <b>tendon</b> defect in hen and porcine models. The results demonstrated the successful regeneration and repair of <b>tendon</b> defects created in different models. In addition, <b>tendon</b> function was also well recovered by generated autologous <b>tendon</b> tissue that possesses strong biomechanical property. Recently, we have also successfully generated <b>tendon</b> tissue in vitro by using static strain device and bioreactors, which could be potentially transplanted as the <b>tendon</b> graft for <b>tendon</b> defect repair...|$|R
40|$|Background Acute {{ruptures}} of the Achilles <b>tendon</b> {{affect the}} tendon's structural and mechanical properties. The {{long-term effects of}} surgical repair on these properties remain unclear. Purpose To evaluate effects of early mobilization versus traditional immobilization rehabilitation programs 2 years after surgical Achilles <b>tendon</b> repair, by comparing force-elongation and stress-strain relationships of the injured <b>tendon</b> {{to those of the}} uninjured <b>tendon.</b> Methods A group of males with previous Achilles <b>tendon</b> rupture (n = 18) and a group of healthy male controls (n = 9) participated. Achilles <b>tendon</b> rupture group consisted of patients that had received early mobilization (n = 9) and patients that had received traditional immobilization with a plaster cast (n = 9). Comparisons of <b>tendon</b> structural and mechanical properties were made between Achilles <b>tendon</b> rupture and healthy control groups, and between the uninjured and injured sides of the two rehabilitation groups in Achilles <b>tendon</b> rupture group. Ultrasound was used to determine bilaterally <b>tendon</b> cross-sectional area, <b>tendon</b> resting length, and <b>tendon</b> elongation as a function of torque during maximal voluntary plantar flexion. From these data, Achilles <b>tendon</b> force-elongation and stress-strain relationships were determined. Findings The Achilles <b>tendon</b> rupture group uninjured side was not different from healthy control group. Structural and mechanical parameters of the injured side were not different between the Achilles <b>tendon</b> rupture early mobilization and the immobilization groups. Compared to the uninjured side, the injured side showed a reduction in stress at maximal voluntary force, in Young's modulus and in stiffness. Interpretation Two years post-surgical repair, the Achilles <b>tendon</b> mechanical properties had not returned to the uninjured contralateral <b>tendon</b> values...|$|R
30|$|Further {{research}} is needed regarding the stability of early repair, avoidance of repair separation, <b>tendon</b> lengthening and yet the maintenance of elasticity to optimize resumption of biomechanical characteristics. The avoidance of <b>tendon</b> lengthening, the reduction in Achilles <b>Tendon</b> Resting Angle and the restoration of normal gastrocsoleus strength and Achilles <b>tendon</b> viscoelastic properties are important aspects is recovery from an Achilles <b>tendon</b> rupture. The pre-conditioning of sutures within the <b>tendon</b> ends, prior to knot tying is recommended to optimise repair tension and minimize <b>tendon</b> end-to-end separation.|$|R

Hadrosaurids had slim hands with short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for propulsion, and the tail was also not useful for propulsion because of the ossified <b>tendons</b> that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved the tail from side to side.|$|E
5|$|Without treatment, {{episodes of}} acute gout may develop into chronic gout with {{destruction}} of joint surfaces, joint deformity and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% {{of those who}} are untreated for five years, often in the helix of the ear, over the olecranon processes, or on the Achilles <b>tendons.</b> With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people and occur due to low urine pH promoting the precipitation of uric acid. Other forms of chronic kidney dysfunction may occur.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified <b>tendons</b> underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E

5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days.

Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, <b>tendons,</b> or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{a paucity}} of data {{regarding}} molecular markers that identify the phenotype of the <b>tendon</b> cell. This study aims to quantify gene expression markers that distinguish between <b>tendon</b> fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells which {{may be used to}} investigate tenogenesis. Methods Expression levels for 12 genes representative of musculoskeletal tissues, including the proposed <b>tendon</b> progenitor marker scleraxis, relative to validated reference genes, were evaluated in matched samples of equine <b>tendon</b> (harvested from the superficial digital flexor <b>tendon),</b> cartilage and bone using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Expression levels of genes associated with <b>tendon</b> phenotype were then evaluated in healthy, including developmental, and diseased equine <b>tendon</b> tissue and in <b>tendon</b> fibroblasts maintained in both monolayer culture and in three dimensional (3 D) collagen gels. Results Significantly increased expression of scleraxis was found in <b>tendon</b> compared with bone (P = 0. 002) but not compared to cartilage. High levels of COL 1 A 2 and scleraxis and low levels of tenascin-C were found to be most representative of adult tensional <b>tendon</b> phenotype. While, relative expression of scleraxis in developing mid-gestational <b>tendon</b> or in acute or chronically diseased <b>tendon</b> did not differ significantly from normal adult <b>tendon,</b> tenascin-C message was significantly upregulated in acutely injured equine <b>tendon</b> (P = 0. 001). Relative scleraxis gene expression levels in <b>tendon</b> cell monolayer and 3 D cultures were significantly lower than in normal adult <b>tendon</b> (P = 0. 002, P = 0. 02 respectively). Conclusion The findings {{of this study indicate that}} high expression of both COL 1 A 2 and scleraxis, and low expression of tenascin-C is representative of a tensional <b>tendon</b> phenotype. The in vitro culture methods used in these experiments however, may not recapitulate the phenotype of normal tensional <b>tendon</b> fibroblasts in tissues as evidenced by gene expression. </p...|$|R
