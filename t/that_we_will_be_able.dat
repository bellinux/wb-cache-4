500|$|An {{important}} feature of the Big Bang spacetime {{is the presence of}} particle horizons. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a past horizon on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never [...] "catch up" [...] to very distant objects. This defines a future horizon, which limits the events in the future <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our universe.|$|E
