5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to <b>the</b> <b>gills.</b> Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through <b>the</b> <b>gills,</b> with blood being diverted away from <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E

5|$|In the Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia, {{water is}} {{drawn into the}} shell from the {{posterior}} ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through <b>the</b> <b>gills,</b> and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake. In burrowing species, there may be two elongated, retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed, one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water. <b>The</b> <b>gills</b> of filter-feeding bivalves are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on <b>the</b> <b>gills,</b> which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in {{a steady stream of}} mucus to the mouth. The filaments of <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves, and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> varies considerably, and can serve as a useful means for classifying bivalves into groups.|$|E

5|$|Marasmius subconiatus, {{known from}} Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is {{somewhat}} similar to M.sasicola. It can be differentiated as its stem does {{not enter the}} substrate, and <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> differ. In M.subconiatus, <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> are orange, and sport cheilocystidia which are pale yellow.|$|E
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through <b>the</b> <b>gills,</b> and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} teleost {{is largely}} {{impermeable}} to water, and the main interface between the fish's body and its surroundings is <b>the</b> <b>gills.</b> In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their gills by osmosis, while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea in one hour, it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content, with 75 percent of this entering through <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just {{two percent of the}} body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.|$|E
50|$|The {{indirect}} route of this nerve {{is the result}} of evolution of mammals from fish, which had no neck and had a relatively short nerve that innervated one gill slit and passed near <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> arch. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> it innervated has become the larynx and <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> arch has become the dorsal aorta in mammals.|$|R
40|$|High {{specific}} activity tritiated thymidine (50 - 3 Ci/mM and 56 Ci/mM) and autoradiographic techniques {{were used to}} study cell renewal in <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> epithelium of <b>the</b> freshwater mussel, Margaritifera margaritifera. The cell renewal system in <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> epithelium of M. margaritifera appears to consist of a stem-type population in <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> furrow and gill furrow edges which supplies, through division, cells for a maturing, dividing transient transitional population along <b>the</b> proximal <b>gill</b> ridge sides which, in turn, supplies cells to a simple transient, differentiated, functional population on <b>the</b> distal <b>gill</b> ridge sides and tip. Loss of cells from the cell renewal system appears to be through cell death and/or extrusion from <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> ridge tip. No emigration or immigration of labelled nuclei out of, or into, <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> epithelium was observed. The minimum transit time from the dividing transient population to the functional population in <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> ridge tip may {{be no more than}} 24 h. We were unable to detect any radiobiological effects or the presence of cytoplasmic labelling due to the use of high specific activities.

5|$|Bioluminescent {{tissue in}} the mature fruit body is {{restricted}} {{to the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> (as well as the cross-veins that connect them), the junction of <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> with the stem, and the inrolled cap edge. Distribution of bioluminescence along the gill edge corresponds to the position of the cheilocystidia. Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young and mature fruit bodies is from other tissues, including the fertile hymenial area and the stem. Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{ontogeny}} of <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> {{structure in}} starlet (Acipenser ruthenus) was studied histologically from hatching up to 50 days post hatching (dph). Based on the obtained results, the first developmental {{phase of the}} biological systems in this species was started from hatching with an intense organogenesis and the second phase from 9 dph {{with the beginning of}} exogenous feeding. <b>The</b> <b>gill</b> anlage was visible in the pharyngeal region at 1 dph. <b>The</b> mouth and <b>gill</b> slits opened at 2 dph along with the formation of four pairs of <b>the</b> primordial <b>gill</b> arches. At 3 dph, <b>the</b> primordial <b>gill</b> filaments formed. <b>The</b> development of the primordial lamellae and pseudobranch were observed at 8 dph. <b>The</b> primordial <b>gill</b> filaments of <b>the</b> pseudobranch were appeared at 9 dph. The chloride cells appeared at 8 dph on the base of <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> filaments. <b>The</b> <b>gill</b> structure of <b>the</b> sterlet larvae at 31 dph was {{similar to that of the}} adults.

5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the transfer of gases {{over the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through <b>the</b> <b>gills.</b> Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E

5|$|Epaulette {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger fishes such as other sharks. Its {{coloration}} provides protective camouflage, while its epaulette is speculated {{to be an}} eyespot for distracting or deterring predators. Epaulette sharks are almost all parasitized by the praniza (parasitic) larval stage of gnathiid isopods. The larvae feed on blood and mostly attach to the skin around the cloaca and the claspers, though they are also found inside the mouth and on <b>the</b> <b>gills.</b> These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect {{the health of the}} shark. Other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in the genus Kudoa, which infests the skeletal muscles, the hemogregarine protozoan Haemogregarina hemiscyllii, which infects the blood, the ostracod Sheina orri, which attaches to <b>the</b> <b>gills,</b> and the nematode Proleptus australis, which infests the stomach.|$|E
50|$|Bony fish use countercurrent flow to {{maximize}} the intake of oxygen that can diffuse through <b>the</b> <b>gill.</b> Countercurrent flow occurs when deoxygenated blood moves through <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> in one direction while oxygenated water moves through <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> in <b>the</b> opposite direction. This mechanism maintains the concentration gradient thus increasing {{the efficiency of the}} respiration process as well and prevents the oxygen levels from reaching an equilibrium. Cartilaginous fish do not have a countercurrent flow system as they lack bones which are needed to have <b>the</b> opened out <b>gill</b> that bony fish have.|$|R
50|$|P. oxyptera inhabits rivers with sandy to muddy bottom. This {{species is}} a parasite. It forages both {{during the day}} and at night, seeking <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> {{chambers}} of larger fishes, especially catfishes. It enters and leaves <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> chamber during <b>the</b> host's ventilating movements. There, it feeds on blood drawn from <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> filaments and may stay in <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> chamber for 1 - 3 min. When gorged with blood, the fish moves to the bottom and buries itself in the sand. A single large catfish tethered on the river bank may feed thousand of these parasitic catfish over a period of up to 6 hours. Large numbers of this fish may kill fishes tethered by fishermen.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{of the genera}} {{also have}} a gland {{situated}} in <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> cavity called a [...] "gill gland", a secondary sex characteristic found in sexually mature male glandulocaudines that is apparently suited to release chemical signals. No genus contains species that have glands and other species without glands. This gill gland is derived from anterior <b>gill</b> filaments of <b>the</b> first <b>gill</b> arch. Gland size and degree of gill modification varies with species. Though the true function of <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> glands {{has yet to be}} determined, they are probably used to release chemical signals into <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> current.|$|R
5|$|Fruit {{bodies are}} {{commonly}} parasitized by the ascomycete Hypomyces lactifluorum, transforming {{them into an}} edible known as a lobster mushroom. In this form, {{the surface of the}} fruit body develops into a hard, thin crust dotted with minute pimples, and <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> are reduced to blunt ridges. The flesh of the mushroom—normally brittle and crumbly—becomes compacted and less breakable.|$|E
5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where <b>the</b> <b>gills</b> curve up to {{join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. <b>The</b> <b>gills</b> are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).|$|E
5|$|In most fish, the {{esophagus}} is extremely short, {{primarily due to}} the length of the pharynx (which is associated with <b>the</b> <b>gills).</b> However, some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish, have no true stomach, so that {{the esophagus}} effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.|$|E

5000|$|The feeding {{mechanism}} of the female Nicothoe astaci has been studied extensively. The parasite feeds upon the haemolymph (blood) of the lobster by attaching to <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> filament using its circular ('oral disc') mouthparts and limbs. Recent cryo-scanning electron microscopy has revealed structural adaptations that facilitate attachment of these parasites to <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> filaments of their lobster host. It is thought that sharp mandibles pierce the wall of <b>the</b> <b>gill</b> filament before <b>the</b> suctorial oral disc attaches to <b>the</b> <b>gill,</b> which in conjunction with an observed peristaltic {{mechanism of the}} stomach, [...] ensures a ‘vacuum seal’ to the host, extracting haemolymph to be ingested. The aperture of the feeding channel, through which host haemolymph is drawn, is only approximately 5 micrometers in diameter.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{crustacean}} <b>gill</b> is a multi-functional organ,and it is {{the site}} of a number of physiological processes, including ion transport, which is the basis for hemolymph osmoregulation; acid-base balance; and ammonia excretion. <b>The</b> <b>gill</b> is also <b>the</b> site by which many toxic metals are taken up by aquatic crustaceans, and thus it {{plays an important role in}} the toxicology of these species. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the ecology, physiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology of the mechanisms of osmotic and ionic regulation performed by <b>the</b> <b>gill.</b> <b>The</b> current concepts of the mechanisms of ion transport, the structural, biochemical, and molecular bases of systemic physiology, and the history of their development are discussed. The relationship between branchial ion transport and hemolymph acid-base regulation is also treated.
