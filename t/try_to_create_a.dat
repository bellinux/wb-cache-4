5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} {{going to follow}} the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E
5|$|In 202 BC, Rhodes and her allies Pergamum, Cyzicus, and Byzantium {{combined}} their fleets {{and defeated}} Philip at the Battle of Chios. Just {{a few months}} later, Philip's fleet defeated the Rhodians at Lade. While Philip was plundering Pergamese territory and attacking cities in Caria, Attalus I of Pergamum went to Athens to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> diversion. He succeeded in securing an alliance with the Athenians, who immediately declared war on the Macedonians. The King of Macedon could not remain inactive; he assailed Athens with his navy and with some infantry. The Romans warned him, however, to withdraw or face war with Rome. After suffering a defeat {{at the hands of}} the Rhodian and Pergamese fleets, Philip withdrew, but not before attacking the city of Abydos on the Hellespont. Abydos fell after a long siege and most of its inhabitants committed suicide. Philip rejected the Roman ultimatum to stop attacking Greek states and the Romans declared war on Macedon. This left the Cretan cities with no major allies, and the largest city of Crete, Knossos, joined the Rhodians. Faced with this combination, both Hierapytna and Olous surrendered and were forced to sign a treaty favourable to Rhodes and Knossos.|$|E

He noted that it was misleading for a scholar to simply translate terms used by a people being studied into terms used by the scholar. He tried to define a system that used the numbers 1â€“6 to represent father, mother, son, daughter, husband and wife, and that reduced all other kinship terms to these basic terms.|$|E

25|$|During the Destiny War between Kang the Conqueror and Immortus, two {{versions}} of Hank Pym are drawn in: Giant-Man of the present and Yellowjacket immediately prior to his marriage to Janet van Dyne. Yellowjacket briefly betrays the team to Immortus and the powerful Time-Keepers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> timeline where he will not turn back into Pym, but he rejects this decision in time to help his allies. Observing the final battle, Libra - who brought the team together by using the Destiny Force to tap into his subconscious awareness of the cosmic balance - reflects that both Pyms were necessary so that Yellowjacket's betrayal could bring the team into the right position to attack the Time-Keepers, while Pym's presence as Giant-Man both provided a stable support and irritated Yellowjacket to provoke his own actions.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{revolves}} around Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) noticing {{a man named}} Jeff (Paul Rae) in the emergency room, whom he thinks is [...] "too nice".

500|$|Bush {{was fond}} of saying that [...] "if he made any {{important}} contribution {{to the war effort}} at all, it would be to get the Army and Navy to tell each other what they were doing." [...] He established a cordial relationship with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and Stimson's assistant, Harvey H. Bundy, who found Bush [...] "impatient" [...] and [...] "vain", but said he was [...] "one of the most important, able men I ever knew". Bush's relationship with the navy was more turbulent. Bowen, the director of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), saw the NDRC as a bureaucratic rival, and recommended abolishing it. A series of bureaucratic battles ended with the NRL placed under the Bureau of Ships, and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox placing an unsatisfactory fitness report in Bowen's personnel file. After the war, Bowen would again <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> rival to the NDRC inside the navy.|$|E

500|$|During script development, {{the crew}} spent {{four to five}} months {{scouting}} locations, creating a [...] "constant {{going back and forth}} between script and location". The film was shot entirely on location within England on an 11-week schedule during the 2004 summer. Co-producer Paul Webster noted that [...] "it is quite unusual for a movie this size to be shot entirely on location. Part of Joe 's idea was to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> reality which allows the actors to relax and feel at one with their environment." [...] Working under production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorator Katie Spencer, the crew filmed on seven estates in six different counties. Because [...] "nothing exists in the United Kingdom that is untouched by the twenty-first century", many of the sites required substantial work to make them suitable for filming. Visual effects company Double Negative digitally restored several locations to make them contemporaneous; they eradicated weeds, enhanced gold plating on window frames, and removed anachronisms such as gravel driveways and electricity pylons. Double Negative also developed the typeface used for the film's title sequence.|$|E
500|$|Williams's role in AC/DC was {{to provide}} steady but basic bass lines which {{followed}} the rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young, consisting mostly of eighth notes. His basslines were sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition, {{and at other times}} Williams developed them based on the other instrumental tracks. Williams said he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part. In AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it." [...] He added that [...] "complex [...] lines wouldn't add anything to a guitar-oriented band like ours, so I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> bottom layer that drives what our guys are doing on top." [...] Williams had no difficulty keeping his low profile within the band, declaring that [...] "I don't have any problem doing this, because I enjoy playing simply. I never feel angry or prisoner." [...] His playing technique was mostly centred around downpicking, with occasional use of plucking to mute the strings, which he says [...] "adds more definition and tightens up the notes, and it gives the sound less sustain".|$|E
500|$|The {{artists were}} chosen after the lyrics were written, and were {{selected}} based on how well Miyake and Takahashi felt they would [...] "gel {{with the world of}} Katamari Damacy and the content of the song lyrics". They were also chosen to create a [...] "pretty silly, goofy selection of singers" [...] that would appeal to [...] "a broad spectrum of people from different generations". Once the lyrics and singers had been chosen, the music was written specifically for each artist with the intention of creating songs that were [...] "familiar" [...] but not [...] "trendy" [...] so that they would not seem dated in the future. The [...] "humming" [...] in the opening song, described by Miyake as [...] "na-na-na-na-na-na-na-Katamari", was included as an experiment by Miyake to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> [...] "memorable" [...] theme associated with the game, in response to criticisms that modern game music was not as memorable as that of older games. Miyake says that [...] "Cherry Tree Times" [...] is his favorite piece from the series.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, {{aside from}} the three men, Carey worked with Carole King, a female singer-songwriter who had been {{predominantly}} popular in the 1970s. However, unlike with C+C Music Factory, King approached Carey, hoping {{to work with her}} after hearing her perform live on The Arsenio Hall Show. During a conversation with Carey, King suggested that she cover [...] "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman," [...] a song she had written with Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly. Still determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> ballad of some sort. The two ladies sat together by a piano {{over the course of the}} day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled [...] "If It's Over." [...] After working with Carey, King said in an interview [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." [...] After recording [...] "If It's Over," [...] Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory. When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him, and begin singing different notes and tunes she was thinking of, while he would follow her with the piano. In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as [...] "very unique," [...] and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies. While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and ClivillÃ©s proved different; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and key.|$|E
