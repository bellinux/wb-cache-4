40|$|Abstract—Differentiated service (DiffServ) {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} to assure the achievable minimum bandwidth to aggregate flows. However, analyses in the literature show that the current DiffServ networks are biased {{in favor of an}} aggregate flow that has a smaller committed information rate (CIR) when aggregate flows with different CIRs share a bottleneck link. In order to mitigate this unfairness problem, we propose an adaptive marking scheme which provides the relative bandwidth assurance in proportion to the CIRs of the aggregates. By introducing a virtual target rate (VTR) and adjusting it depending on the provision level of the network, each aggregate can obtain its <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the bandwidth, regardless of traffic load. This scheme is based on a feedback approach. It utilizes only two-bit feedback information conveyed in the packet header and can be implemented in a distributed manner. Furthermore, the proposed scheme does not require calculating <b>fair</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> aggregates or any additional signaling protocol. Using steady state analysis and extensive simulations, we show that the scheme can provide aggregate flows with <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> bandwidth, which is proportional to the CIRs, under various network conditions. Index Terms—Proportional bandwidth allocation, fairness, Quality of Service, DiffServ networks, distributed algorithm. ...|$|R

50|$|According to Robert Trivers’s {{theory on}} relatedness, each {{offspring}} {{is related to}} itself by 1, but is only 0.5 related to their parents and siblings. Genetically, offspring are predisposed to behave in their own self-interest while parents are predisposed to behave equally to all their offspring, including both current and future ones. Offspring will selfishly attempt to take more than <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> parental investment while parents will attempt to spread out their parental investment equally amongst their present young and future young.There are many examples of parent-offspring conflict in nature. One manifestation of this is asynchronous hatching in birds. A behavioral ecology hypothesis is known as Lack's brood reduction hypothesis (named after David Lack). Lack's hypothesis posits an evolutionary and ecological explanation as to why birds lay a series of eggs with an asynchronous delay leading to nestlings of mixed age and weights. According to Lack, this brood behavior is an ecological insurance that allows the larger birds to survive in poor years and all birds to survive when food is plentiful. We also see sex-ratio conflict between the queen and her workers in social hymenoptera. Because of haplodiploidy, the workers (offspring) prefer a 3:1 female to male sex allocation while the queen prefers a 1:1 sex ratio. Both the queen and the workers will attempt to bias the sex ratio in their favor. In some species, the workers {{gain control of the}} sex ratio, while in other species, like B. terrestris, the queen has a considerable amount of control over the colony sex ratio. Lastly, there has been recent evidence regarding genomic imprinting that is a result of parent-offspring conflict. Paternal genes in offspring will demand more maternal resources than maternal genes in the same offspring and vice versa. This has been show in imprinted genes like insulin-like growth factor-II.|$|R

First In First Out (FIFO) queuing is simple but does not protect responsive flows from unresponsive one, flows that are sending more than <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share.</b> One <b>of</b> FIFO queuing is Random Early Detection which it can effectively avoid congestion at routers, but it also cannot provide fair bandwidth for the flows. On the other hand, per-flow scheduling mechanisms provide max-min fairness but are more complex, it requires keeping state for all flows going through the router; it’s proved that high bandwidth flows at the time of congestion consume most of the bandwidth of the link, so this algorithm (RED-PD) is most candidates to provide fairness to the flows. Simulations with networks demonstrate that there are chances for RED-PD to enhance its work, by means of incorporating the test of unresponsive flows actively in response to changes in the packet drop rate...|$|R

To overcome this problem, we propose a new packet-drop policy that simultaneously exploits two dimensions [...] when to drop and what to drop.

Our load balancer monitors the loads of the servers, detects indications of overloading, then migrates virtual instances from overloaded servers to target servers.

40|$|The recent {{corporate}} scandals at Cadbury Nigeria Plc and Oceanic Bank Plc in Nigeria not only uncovered devastating incidents of corporate malpractices within Nigerian firms {{but they also}} appear to highlight the ineffectiveness of the existing regulatory structure of companies in the country. This study offers a theoretical analysis to corporate governance practices and regulation of public companies in Nigeria from a legal and regulatory standpoint. It analyses {{the effectiveness of the}} regulatory framework of corporate governance under the Nigerian Companies and Allied Matters Act 1990 ("CAMA 1990 ") and the Code of Corporate Governance 2011 (" 2011 SEC Code") in terms of ensuring good governance and promoting ethical practices amongst corporate actors such as directors, auditors, shareholders and stakeholders. This thesis argues that the CAMA 1990 and the 2011 SEC Code have naturally been rendered inadequate in curtailing corporate malpractices and ensuring good governance in Nigeria because important mechanisms pertaining to directors’ accountability, auditing, shareholders’ protection, compliance and enforcement are weak and defective. By using the UK’s Companies Act 2006 ("CA 2006 ") and US’ Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 ("SOX") as models for reform, the author explores ways to enhance these mechanisms and how to further strengthen the current regulatory framework in Nigeria. The author recognises that the UK and the US, having experienced <b>their</b> own <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> corporate collapses are by no means perfect, but they are widely known to have robust and well-developed regulatory frameworks, which could provide instructive lessons on practical solutions to existing regulatory lapses in Nigeria.

40|$|Cooperative {{services}} are an increasingly popular way to deploy applications. In these services, computers controlled by different entities {{are supposed to}} work together to achieve a common goal, such as file-sharing [6, 12], mesh routing [2], and peer-to-peer backup [1, 7]. The resulting systems can be more fault-tolerant, scalable, and less expensive than traditional client-server approaches.

Several deployed applications [6, 12] and research prototypes [7, 17] include incentives and punishments to encourage cooperation. However, selfish participants still frequently find ways to cheat. For example, in the KaZaA [12] network almost half the users falsify their contributions by using a hacked binary [13]. In BitTorrent [6], researchers have found ways to free-ride [19]. These vulnerabilities are symptoms of a deeper problem: almost no cooperative service rigorously shows that its incentives and punishments are sufficient to induce cooperation. In my research, I aim to build cooperative systems that tolerate the actions of Byzantine users while removing incentives for selfish users to cheat. In this adversarial environment, constructing systems that work well and are robust requires me to step back and forth between practice and theory, something that distinguishes my research from that of many others who design these systems. I believe that pursuing the practice-theory cycle—letting practice guide theory and vice versa—is necessary in building robust and practical systems. This approach requires me to be persistent, resourceful, and creative. Drawing upon these traits and my training so far, I plan to i) develop the theoretical framework necessary to reason about selfish and Byzantine behaviors in cooperative services, ii) design efficient and scalable mechanisms in this framework to address practical issues in building real services, and iii) implement large-scale prototypes that are competitive with if not better than existing less robust works. 1 Curren...|$|R
