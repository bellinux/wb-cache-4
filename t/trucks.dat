5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} involving Wooten, Barbey, Edmund Herring (Wooten's superior as commander of I Corps), Colonel Merian C. Cooper from the Fifth Air Force, and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt from the RAAF, reached agreement, or at least compromise, on many points. Wooten wanted at least 10 days' reserve rations. This meant that some stores {{would have to be}} transported in bulk, and not pre-loaded on <b>trucks</b> as Barbey initially wanted. Loading the stores onto <b>trucks</b> was an inefficient use of shipping space, but permitted quick unloading of the LSTs, as the <b>trucks</b> could simply be driven off. The 9th Division did not have sufficient <b>trucks</b> for this, but 200 <b>trucks</b> earmarked for the US Advanced Base at Lae were borrowed from USASOS. Barbey would not allow loaded vehicles on the tank decks of the LSTs, as this was a fire hazard, so bulk stores were carried there instead.|$|E

5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy <b>trucks.</b> As time passed, truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy <b>trucks,</b> and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter <b>trucks.</b> The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter <b>trucks,</b> preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} of <b>trucks</b> were spotted by Jersey City police {{entering}} {{the city on the}} skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they were told that the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force <b>trucks</b> to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning <b>trucks</b> from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and <b>trucks</b> were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E
5|$|The bridge formula (also {{referred}} to as Formula B) is based on research into single-span bridges, and fails to consider multiple-span bridges. Two-span bridges may not be fully protected by Formula B, depending on the truck length, span length, and other factors. Shorter wheelbase vehicles (usually specialized <b>trucks</b> such as garbage <b>trucks</b> and water <b>trucks)</b> have trouble complying with Formula B.|$|E

5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of <b>trucks</b> operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy <b>trucks</b> were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of <b>trucks</b> destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of <b>trucks)</b> no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E
5|$|The {{trucking}} industry {{serves the}} American economy by transporting {{large quantities of}} raw materials, works in process, and finished goods over land—typically from manufacturing plants to retail distribution centers. <b>Trucks</b> are also used in the construction industry, as dump <b>trucks</b> and portable concrete mixers move the large amounts of rocks, dirt, concrete, and other building materials used in construction. <b>Trucks</b> in America {{are responsible for the}} majority of freight movement over land and are tools in the manufacturing, transportation, and warehousing industries.|$|E
5|$|Under the April 1942 organization, each {{infantry}} battalion had an anti-tank platoon {{with four}} 37mm guns (1/4 ton <b>trucks,</b> {{better known as}} jeeps, were authorized as prime movers) and each regiment an anti-tank company with twelve (towed by 3/4 ton <b>trucks).</b> Each of the four divisional artillery battalions possessed six anti-tank guns, the combat engineering battalion had nine pieces (towed by M2 halftracks); in addition, the division's headquarters company had four (towed by 3/4ton <b>trucks)</b> and the divisional maintenance company two.|$|E

Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard procedure was {{to switch to a}} new position some 10km away due to the ease with which the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{products}} totaling $118,832,000, or 82.7 percent, {{were shipped}} by truck in 2007 (excluding animal feed, cereal grains, and forage products).

5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their <b>trucks</b> with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of <b>trucks</b> (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} <b>trucks</b> under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E
