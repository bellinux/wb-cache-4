5|$|In February 1968, the Beatles {{travelled}} to Rishikesh {{in northern}} India {{to attend an}} advanced <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation (TM) training session at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Their visit {{was one of the}} band's most productive periods and received widespread media attention. The Beatles' interest in the Maharishi was led by George Harrison's commitment, and it changed Western attitudes about Indian spirituality and encouraged the study of <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation.|$|E
5|$|The work ventures into transcendentalism, relying {{strongly}} on intuition, {{a movement}} and practice he had despised. Though he criticized the <b>transcendental</b> movement {{for what he}} referred to as incoherent mysticism, Eureka is more mystical than most <b>transcendental</b> works. Eureka has also been compared to the theories of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science and Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement.|$|E
5|$|A {{positive}} capsule {{review in}} the Los Angeles Times noted that the authors use logic to point out transparencies in the assertions of <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation. John Horgan, in his book Rational Mysticism, questions Persinger's neutrality and says that in his book he treats religious beliefs and spiritual practices as mental illness.|$|E
5|$|Born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, George Ripley {{was pushed}} to attend Harvard College {{by his father}} and {{completed}} his studies in 1823. He went on graduate from the Harvard Divinity School {{and the next year}} married Sophia Dana. Shortly after, he became ordained as the minister of the Purchase Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts, where he began to question traditional Unitarian beliefs. He became one of the founding members of the <b>Transcendental</b> Club and hosted its first official meeting in his home. Shortly after, he resigned from the church to put <b>Transcendental</b> beliefs in practice by founding an experimental commune called Brook Farm. The community later converted to a model {{based on the work of}} Charles Fourier, although the community was never financially stable in either format.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{smoking in}} some of his films, Eastwood is a lifelong non-smoker, has been {{conscious}} of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthful eating and daily <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation.|$|E
5|$|Gregorio {{learned the}} <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation {{technique}} after reading a Wall Street Journal article {{about it in}} 1971. He appeared with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Clint Eastwood and others on an episode of the Merv Griffin show in 1975.|$|E
5|$|A {{practitioner}} of <b>transcendental</b> meditation (TM) {{since the early}} seventies, Josephson became a visiting faculty member in 1975 of the Maharishi European Research University in the Netherlands, part of the TM movement. He also held visiting professorships at Wayne State University in 1983, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 1984, and the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Another German philosopher, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, {{praised the}} {{ideas in the}} Upanishads, as did others. In the United States, the group known as the Transcendentalists were {{influenced}} by the German idealists. Americans, such as Emerson and Thoreau embraced Schelling's interpretation of Kant's <b>Transcendental</b> idealism, {{as well as his}} celebration of the romantic, exotic, mystical aspect of the Upanishads. As a result of the influence of these writers, the Upanishads gained renown in Western countries.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{algebraic}} {{functions are}} defined by an algebraic equation, and <b>transcendental</b> functions (including those discussed above) {{are defined by}} some property that holds for them, such as a differential equation. For example, the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an analytic function by its Taylor series.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Euler {{elaborated}} {{the theory}} of higher <b>transcendental</b> functions by introducing the gamma function and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations. He also {{found a way to}} calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern complex analysis. He also invented the calculus of variations including its best-known result, the Euler–Lagrange equation.|$|E
5|$|Yūgen (幽玄, {{profound}} sublimity): Yūgen is {{a concept}} valued in various forms of art throughout Japanese culture. Originally used to mean elegance or grace representing the perfect beauty in waka, yūgen is invisible beauty that is felt rather than seen in a work of art. The term is used specifically in relation to Noh to mean the profound beauty of the <b>transcendental</b> world, including mournful beauty involved in sadness and loss.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Rosenthal {{learned the}} <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation {{technique}} while in South Africa, {{but found that}} as a medical student and a medical resident he didn't have time to practice. Then 35 years later, after one of his patients had a dramatic improvement {{as a result of}} TM, he began practicing again and then began recommending it to his patients. In 2011, he published , which debuted at number seven on the New York Times' Best Sellers: Hardcover Advice, How-To And Miscellaneous list. Earlier that year, Rosenthal published preliminary research on the potential influence of TM on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.|$|E
5|$|Erik Chisholm wrote {{well over}} 100 works, {{including}} 35 orchestral works, 7 concertante works (including a violin concerto and two piano concertos), 7 works for orchestra and voice or chorus, 54 piano works, 3 organ works, 43 songs, 8 choral part-songs, 7 ballets, and 9 operas including one on Robert Burns. He also made several interesting arrangements by composers such as Handel and Mozart. He arranged a string orchestra {{version of the}} Symphony for Solo Piano, Op. 39 Nos. 4–7 by Charles-Valentin Alkan, a composer still largely unknown at that time, the original {{of which has been}} said to surpass even the <b>Transcendental</b> Études of Franz Liszt in scale and difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, first {{published}} in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later {{become known as the}} philosophy of mind. Kant's first critique is generally recognized as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both continental and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of <b>transcendental</b> consciousness, or {{the life of the mind}} as conceived through universal categories of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Josephson took up <b>transcendental</b> {{meditation}} {{and turned his}} attention to issues outside the boundaries of mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness, and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as quantum mysticism. Those interests have led him to express support for topics such as parapsychology, water memory and cold fusion, and have made him a focus of criticism from fellow scientists.|$|E
5|$|Starr and {{his wife}} left on 1 March, after a ten-day stay; McCartney left after one month due to other commitments; Lennon and Harrison stayed about six weeks, then left {{abruptly}} following financial disagreements and rumours of inappropriate behaviour by the Maharishi. Harrison later apologised for {{the way that he}} and Lennon had treated the Maharishi, and he gave a benefit concert in 1992 for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party. In 2009, McCartney and Starr performed at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation, which raises funds for the teaching of <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation to at-risk students.|$|E
5|$|TM and Cult Mania is a non-fiction {{book that}} {{examines}} assertions {{made by the}} <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation movement (TM). The book is authored by Michael Persinger, Normand Carrey and Lynn Suess and published in 1980 by Christopher Publishing House. Persinger is a neurophysiologist and has worked out of Laurentian University. He trained as a psychologist {{and focused on the}} impacts of religious experience. Carrey is a medical doctor who specialized in psychiatry. He focused his studies into child psychiatry with research at Dalhousie University, and has taught physicians in a psychiatry residency program in the field of family therapy. Suess assisted Persinger in researching effects of geological phenomena on unidentified flying object sightings in Washington; the two conducted similar research in Toronto and Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is celebrated}} as {{a mark of}} {{identity}} as well as source of the seed. Thus, the self-decapitation represents removal of maya (illusion or delusion), physical attachment, false notions, ignorance, and egoism. The scimitar also signifies severance of these obstacles to moksha (emancipation), jnana (wisdom), and self-realization. The goddess also denotes discriminating perception. Chhinnamasta allows the devotee to gain a consciousness that transcends the bonds of physical attachment, the body, and the mind by her self-sacrifice. One interpretation suggests that her three eyes represent the sun, the moon, and fire while another links the third eye to <b>transcendental</b> knowledge. Unlike other Hindu deities who are depicted facing the devotee, Chhinnamasta generally looks at herself, prompting the devotee to look within him- or herself.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia {{attributed}} {{the start of}} the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and as a result, she felt that he slowly lost interest in her. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After Cynthia arrived home at Kenwood, she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. Alexis Mardas later claimed to have slept with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her £100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.|$|E
5|$|George Harrison {{first met}} Joe Massot while the Beatles were filming Help! in early 1965. He agreed {{to write the}} musical score for Massot's film Wonderwall in October 1967, after the Bee Gees had become unavailable. It was Harrison's first formal music project outside the Beatles and coincided with his {{continued}} immersion in Indian classical music. Since 1966, this association with India had given Harrison a distinct musical identity beside the band's primary songwriters, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. While he had minimal interest in the Beatles' main projects during 1967 – the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and their television film Magical Mystery Tour – Harrison led the group {{in terms of their}} shared philosophical direction, as his bandmates followed him in embracing <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation under the guidance of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} in Sandymount, Ireland and educated there and in London. He spent {{childhood}} holidays in County Sligo and studied poetry {{from an early age}} when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display Yeats's debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and realistic. He largely renounced the <b>transcendental</b> beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life. In 1923, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{rock and roll}} was faltering as its major stars dropped from public view. Elvis Presley was drafted, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively, Chuck Berry was in jail, and Jerry Lee Lewis had been disgraced by press reports that he married his 13-year-old cousin. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest {{the last two years}} of the 1950s were barren of talent, {{pointing}} to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles' work were very similar to the young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing By breaking down the division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with <b>transcendental</b> fervor, unashamedly linking the spiritual and the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought the realities of the Saturday-night sinner and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the songs}} on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. The group {{returned}} to EMI Studios (now known as Abbey Road Studios) in May to commence recording sessions that lasted through to October. During these sessions, arguments broke out among the Beatles, and witnesses in the studio saw band members quarrel over creative differences. Another divisive element was the constant presence of John Lennon's new partner, Yoko Ono, whose attendance at the sessions broke with the Beatles' policy regarding wives and girlfriends. After a series of problems, including producer George Martin taking a sudden leave of absence and engineer Geoff Emerick quitting, Ringo Starr left the band briefly in August. The same tensions continued throughout the following year, leading to the eventual break-up of the Beatles in April 1970.|$|E
5|$|Romantic {{thinking}} was {{also evident in}} the writings of Hugh Miller, stonemason and geologist, who followed in the tradition of Naturphilosophie, arguing that nature was a pre-ordained progression towards the human race. Publisher, historian, antiquarian and scientist Robert Chambers (1802–71) became a friend of Scott, writing a biography of him after the author's death. Chambers also became a geologist, researching in Scandinavia and Canada. His most influential work was the anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844), which was the most comprehensive written argument in favour of evolution before the work of Charles Darwin (1809–82). His work was strongly influenced by <b>transcendental</b> anatomy, which, drawing on Goethe and Lorenz Oken (1779–1851), looked for ideal patterns and structure in nature and had been pioneered in Scotland by figures including Robert Knox (1791–1862).|$|E
5|$|This decade also {{witnessed}} {{the emergence of}} a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, <b>Transcendental</b> Meditation, Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in Big Sur, California. It was from Esalen and other similar personal growth centers which had developed links to humanistic psychology that the human potential movement emerged, which would also come to exert a strong influence on the New Age.|$|E
25|$|Almost all irrational {{numbers are}} <b>transcendental</b> and all real <b>transcendental</b> numbers are irrational (there are also complex <b>transcendental</b> numbers): {{the article on}} <b>transcendental</b> numbers lists several examples. e'r and πr are irrational if r≠0 is rational; eπ is irrational.|$|E
25|$|Any non-constant {{algebraic}} {{function of}} a single variable yields a <b>transcendental</b> value when applied to a <b>transcendental</b> argument. For example, from knowing that π is <b>transcendental,</b> it can be immediately deduced that numbers such as 5π, (π − 3)/√, (√ − √)8 and (π5 + 7)1/7 are <b>transcendental</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of <b>transcendental</b> numbers was first established by Liouville (1844, 1851). Hermite proved in 1873 that e is <b>transcendental</b> and Lindemann proved in 1882 that π is <b>transcendental.</b> Finally, Cantor {{showed that the}} set of all real numbers is uncountably infinite but the set of all algebraic numbers is countably infinite, so there is an uncountably infinite number of <b>transcendental</b> numbers.|$|E
25|$|No {{rational}} number is <b>transcendental</b> and all real <b>transcendental</b> numbers are irrational. The ir{{rational number}}s contain all the real <b>transcendental</b> numbers and {{a subset of}} the algebraic numbers, including the quadratic irrationals and other forms of algebraic irrationals.|$|E
25|$|All Liouville {{numbers are}} <b>transcendental,</b> {{as will be}} proven below. Establishing that a given number is a Liouville number {{provides}} {{a useful tool for}} proving a given number is <b>transcendental.</b> However, not every <b>transcendental</b> number is a Liouville number. The terms in the continued fraction expansion of every Liouville number are unbounded; using a counting argument, one can then show that there must be uncountably many <b>transcendental</b> numbers which are not Liouville. Using the explicit continued fraction expansion of e, one can show that e {{is an example of a}} <b>transcendental</b> number that is not Liouville. Mahler proved in 1953 that π is another such example.|$|E
25|$|He also {{discovered}} the solutions of <b>transcendental</b> equations by iteration, {{and found the}} approximation of <b>transcendental</b> numbers by continued fractions.|$|E
25|$|However, an {{algebraic}} {{function of}} several variables may yield an algebraic number {{when applied to}} <b>transcendental</b> numbers if these numbers are not algebraically independent. For example, π and (1 − π) are both <b>transcendental,</b> but π + (1 − π) = 1 is obviously not. It is unknown whether π + e, for example, is <b>transcendental,</b> though {{at least one of}} π + e and πe must be <b>transcendental.</b> More generally, for any two <b>transcendental</b> numbers a and b, at least one of a + b and ab must be <b>transcendental.</b> To see this, consider the polynomial (x − a)(x − b) = x2 − (a + b)x + ab. If (a + b) and ab were both algebraic, then this would be a polynomial with algebraic coefficients. Because algebraic numbers form an algebraically closed field, this would imply that the roots of the polynomial, a and b, must be algebraic. But this is a contradiction, and thus it must be the case {{that at least one of}} the coefficients is <b>transcendental.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because the {{algebraic}} numbers form a field, many irrational numbers can {{be constructed}} by combining <b>transcendental</b> and algebraic numbers. For example, 3π+2, π+√2 and e√3 are irrational (and even <b>transcendental).</b>|$|E
25|$|The set of <b>transcendental</b> {{numbers is}} uncountably infinite. Since the polynomials with {{rational}} coefficients are countable, and since each such polynomial has {{a finite number}} of zeroes, the algebraic numbers must also be countable. However, Cantor's diagonal argument proves that the real numbers (and therefore also the complex numbers) are uncountable. Since the real numbers are the union of algebraic and <b>transcendental</b> numbers, they cannot both be countable. This makes the <b>transcendental</b> numbers uncountable.|$|E
25|$|All Liouville {{numbers are}} <b>transcendental,</b> but not vice versa. Any Liouville number must have {{unbounded}} partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion. Using a counting argument one {{can show that}} there exist <b>transcendental</b> numbers which have bounded partial quotients and hence are not Liouville numbers.|$|E
25|$|Any finite {{model is}} totally <b>transcendental.</b>|$|E
