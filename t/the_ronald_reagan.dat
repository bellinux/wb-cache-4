Keating focused his campaign on expanding resources for crime prevention and education, tailoring his message to the Boston constituency he would pick up as a senator. He was successful, winning about 64 percent of the vote, and was sworn in the following January.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{downtown}} Washington, architectural {{styles are}} even more varied. Historic buildings are designed primarily in the Queen Anne, Châteauesque, Richardsonian Romanesque, Georgian revival, Beaux-Arts, {{and a variety of}} Victorian styles. Rowhouses are especially prominent in areas developed after the Civil War and typically follow Federalist and late Victorian designs. Georgetown's Old Stone House was built in 1765, making it the oldest-standing original building in the city. Founded in 1789, Georgetown University features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture. <b>The</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> Building is the largest building in the District with a total area of approximately 3.1million squarefeet (288,000m2).|$|E

The highway is contiguous with Kinney Harmon Road in Polk County, which connects the Poinciana Parkway with US 17/US 92 in Loughman. Across US 17/92, the road continues as <b>the</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> Parkway (former County Road 54), which provides indirect access from the Poinciana Parkway to Interstate 4.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Congress {{changed the}} name of the Washington National Airport to <b>the</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> Washington National Airport with the law specifying that no money be spent to {{implement}} the name change.

In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only {{at the request of the}} local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Not until 2001 did Congress make changing the station's name a condition of further federal funding.|$|E
