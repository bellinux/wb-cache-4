5|$|In 1983, former Oakland Raider Gene Upshaw {{became the}} {{executive}} director of the NFLPA. During his tenure, he oversaw a player strike, several antitrust lawsuits, and <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement of 1993.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a new CBA was {{negotiated}} between the AFLPA and the AFL. The key principles for <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Bargaining</b> Agreement (2003–2008) reflected a responsible attempt {{to balance the}} interests of the players with the realities facing the competition.|$|E
5|$|As a {{free agent}} {{during the summer of}} 1997, Joe Sakic signed a three-year, $21million offer sheet with the New York Rangers. Under <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> {{agreement}} at the time, the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer, which instigated a salary raise for NHL players.|$|E
40|$|This book is an {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> relationship among <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining,</b> firm competitiveness, and employment protection/creation in <b>the</b> United States. <b>Collective</b> <b>bargaining,</b> at its essence, is the determination of terms and conditions of employment through negotiation between an employer and {{a representative of the}} employer’s employees acting collectively as a group; hence <b>the</b> term <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Although <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> is generally contrasted with individual bargaining, {{for the vast majority of}} employees in the United States, <b>the</b> alternative to <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> is unilateral determination of terms and conditions of employment by the employer, with perhaps a small zone of negotiations over wages or salaries and/or job duties. Few institutions in the United States generate as much continuing controversy as <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Any attempt to change <b>the</b> laws surrounding <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> brings out waves of lobbyists, often attempting to invoke deep value-laden arguments to advocate o...|$|R

5|$|Other {{funds were}} {{redirected}} to creating and expanding charter schools, and expanding college scholarship programs. The law {{also created a}} merit pay system to give better performing teachers higher wages, and gave broader authority to school superintendents to terminate the employment of teachers and restricts <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> rights of teachers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to conducting labor negotiations, the NFLPA represents and protects {{the rights of}} the players; the organization's actions include filing grievances against player discipline that it deems too severe. The union also ensures that the terms of <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement are adhered to by the league and the teams. It negotiates and monitors retirement and insurance benefits and enhances and defends the image of players and their profession.|$|E
5|$|Ballard {{signed with}} Phoenix {{a year later}} to an {{entry-level}} contract worth an annual $1.2 million over three years, including bonuses. With his NHL contract, he decided to forgo his senior year of college hockey. The decision was spurred by his performance at the 2004 World Championships with Team USA, competing with NHL veterans. Ballard indicated that he would only leave the University of Minnesota if he was offered the maximum allowable contract for a rookie, as designated by <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement of the time, which he received.|$|E

5|$|O'Neal {{played in}} two more games before the NBA's case was {{brought before the}} U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York on December 30. The NBA argued that {{under the terms of}} <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Bargaining</b> Agreement (CBA), Stern had {{absolute}} authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. But the judge ruled that because O'Neal's behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA, and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension. Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's suspensions.|$|E
5|$|Stanford {{also agreed}} to the honor <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> {{agreement}} which The JBG Cos. had with UNITE HERE Local 25. About 125 to 135 people, most of them with 20 years of job tenure at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, were affected by the closure. The labor union said it was in discussion with Stanford Corp. to win the company's guarantee that the workers would be rehired and that the company would honor the workers' collective bargaining agreement when the hotel reopened.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996–97 season, Sakic only {{played in}} 65 games {{due to a}} lacerated calf, yet still managed to score 74 points as the Avalanche earned their first Presidents' Trophy and third {{straight}} division title. He had another great playoff season with eight goals and 17 assists, and took the Avalanche {{all the way to}} the conference finals, where they eventually lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. As a free agent during the summer of 1997, Sakic signed a three-year, $21 million offer sheet with the New York Rangers as a restricted free agent. Under <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement at the time, the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer, which instigated a salary raise for many NHL players.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{settlement}} of the Brady et al. v. NFL antitrust suit on July 25, 2011, a majority of players signed union authorization cards approving the NFL Players Association to act as their exclusive <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> representative. <b>The</b> NFL officially recognized the NFLPA’s status as <b>the</b> players’ <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> representative on July 30. The NFL and NFLPA proceeded to negotiate terms for a new <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement, and <b>the</b> agreement became effective after ratification by the players on August 4. <b>The</b> new <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement runs through 2021.|$|R

5|$|Waiters {{signed a}} $16.7 million {{four-year}} contract (two years, plus two team options) {{that was based}} on the rookie wage scales determined by <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement. Drummond also signed a multi-year contract. Kaman signed a one-year $8 million contract with the Dallas Mavericks. Wallace re-signed with the Nets for 4 years and $40 million. The Memphis Grizzlies did not make Mayo a $7.2 million qualifying offer, thus allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent. He subsequently signed with the Mavericks for two years (with a player option in the second year). The New Orleans Hornets matched the Phoenix Suns' 4-year $58 million contract for Gordon.|$|E

40|$|While {{there have}} been {{numerous}} studies examining certain aspects of <b>the</b> effects of <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining,</b> there have yet to be any empirical studies on <b>the</b> effects of <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> on <b>the</b> use of police policy. This study looks to address this issue by examining <b>the</b> impact of <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> on <b>the</b> use of three currently innovative police policies: early warning systems, civilian review boards, and the use of in-car cameras. Using data from the 2003 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey, we look at municipal agencies with over 100 officers. Using bi-variate analyses we compare each of the three dependent variables to <b>the</b> independent variable, <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Our study found significant findings for the use of civilian review boards and the use of in-car camera systems. Our study found that agencies engaged in <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> were less likely to use the given program. This is important because no study has yet to examine <b>the</b> use of <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> and its effect on policy use. Future studies should look closer at these types of issues using more complex analyses...|$|R
25|$|The NLRB and {{the courts}} provide {{different}} solutions against unions that breached their duty of fair representation. Because the Board does not usually have the jurisdiction to enforce <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement or to issue a remedial order against an employer that has violated it, the NLRB often cannot award complete relief to employees. A court, on the other hand, may order an employer to reinstate or pay back pay to an employee if it finds that the employer violated <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement and may, in some instances, order the union to pay attorneys' fees to a successful plaintiff. These distinctions {{do not apply to}} workers covered by the Railway Labor Act since, as noted above, they have no administrative procedures to enforce their rights.|$|E

A new Day Care Contract is also negotiated and leads to substantial improvements in salary and working conditions for Directors and Assistant Directors.|$|E

25|$|Not all strikebreakers {{permanently}} replace workers. But when replacement {{workers are}} permanent, {{the duration of}} the strike lengthens appreciably. The average duration of strikes in which replacement workers are used has lengthened as much as 10-fold in recent years. Permanent replacements also dramatically affect <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> outcome, with unions settling on much less favorable terms.|$|E
