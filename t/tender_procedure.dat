5|$|Transport Scotland {{announced}} in June 2010 that three consortiums that had submitted expressions {{of interest in}} the project were to be invited to participate in a competitive dialogue; these were BAM UK, IMCD (Sir Robert McAlpine, Iridium Concesiones de Infraestructuras and Carillion) and New Borders Railway (Fluor, Miller and Uberior Infrastructure Investments). In mid-November 2010, the withdrawal of Fluor resulted in the third consortium pulling out of the bidding process. The second consortium withdrew in June 2011 following the decision by Carillion not to continue. This led to the cancellation of the <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> by Scottish transport minister Keith Brown. Network Rail was chosen by Transport Scotland to undertake the project and, following months of negotiations, a Transfer of Responsibility was signed at a ceremony held on 6 November 2012 at the Scottish Mining Museum in Newtongrange. Network Rail agreed to build the line by mid-2015 for £294 million, an increase on the estimated £230 million that the line was expected to cost and the £100 million that it was originally costed at in 2000. This figure is also substantially more than the £189 million which Network Rail Chief Executive Iain Coucher agreed to build the line in late 2007 or early 2008.|$|E

2500|$|The ZagrebSisak {{motorway}} {{was defined}} as a priority traffic route by the Government of Croatia in Motorway development plan for the 20052008 period. The route defined at the time fully complied with county development plans, except in a [...] segment south of the Zagreb bypass, which required changes of the spatial planning documents of the City of Zagreb and the [...] Zagreb County. Hrvatske autoceste developed a preliminary study of the route, proposing to connect the A11 to Zagreb at the Zagreb bypass and the Sarajevska Road, requiring a tunnel below Zagreb railway shunting yard. The plan also required moving the A3 motorway Buzin interchange approximately [...] to the west. The plans refer to the moved interchange as Sveta Klara interchange. That scheme planned completion of the motorway to the south of Velika Gorica by 2007, to Lekenik by 2008 and later on to Sisak. At the time the cost of the first section between Velika Gorica and Buševec was estimated at 328 million kuna (44.3 million euro), and the extension to Lekenik was valued at 586 million kuna (79.1 million euro). In February and March 2006, Government of Croatia performed <b>tender</b> <b>procedure</b> for the [...] northernmost section of the A11 spanning the Jakuševec interchange and the Velika Gorica jug exit. At the time, the cost of the section was estimated at 770 million kuna (104 million euro) and the construction works were scheduled to be completed by June 15, 2007. On April 4, commencement of the works between the Velika Gorica jug interchange and Hrašće Turopoljsko was announced. The contract was won by a joint venture comprising Viadukt, Hidroelektra, Konstruktor and Strabag, at a price of 202 million kuna (27.3 million euro) without VAT, and the works were scheduled to be completed by June 15, 2007.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the cost {{structure}} of a sample of Swiss multi-modal urban transport operators in order to assess economies of scale and scope. The results suggest that the industry is characterized by increasing returns to scale and economies of scope. Several European countries have introduced a competitive <b>tendering</b> <b>procedure</b> in the assignment of franchised monopoly in the local transport industry. In the case of multi-modal systems the regulator has to decide to open the competitive <b>tendering</b> <b>procedure</b> for supplying the entire transport services or to unbundle the multi-modal systems and open separate tenders for different modes of transport. In order to make the decision the regulator should have information on the economies of scope. Only few studies have addressed the issue of scope economies in local transport systems. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a model to}} analyse {{the two types of}} <b>tender</b> <b>procedures</b> used by the European Central Bank (ECB) in its open market operations. We assume that the ECB minimizes the expected value of a loss function that depends on the quadratic difference between the interbank rate and a target interest rate that characterizes the stance of monetary policy. We show that when the loss function penalizes more heavily interbank rates below the target, fixed rate tenders have a unique equilibrium characterized by extreme overbidding. We also show that variable rate tenders have multiple equilibria characterized by varying degrees of overbidding, and that in these tenders an equilibrium without overbidding can be obtained by preannouncing the intended liquidity injection. Finally, our empirical analysis supports the assumption of an asymmetric loss function for the ECB.
