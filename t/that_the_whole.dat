Other ancient sources give similarly large numbers. The poet Simonides, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias gave 800,000 as {{the total number of}} the army that assembled in Doriskos.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} century, Caesarius of Arles taught <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> {{glory of the}} Jewish Sabbath had been {{transferred}} to Sunday and that Christians must keep Sunday {{in the same way}} as the Jews were commanded to keep the Sabbath. The Council of Orléans in 538 reprobated this tendency, to apply the law of the Jewish Sabbath to the observance of the Christian Sunday, as Jewish and non-Christian.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1983, it {{was thought}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Sun has the same {{composition}} as the solar atmosphere. In 1983, it was claimed that it was fractionation in the Sun itself that caused the isotopic-composition relationship between the planetary and solar-wind-implanted noble gases.|$|E

5|$|The Sinhalese Nampota dated in {{its present}} form to the 14th or 15th century CE {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the Tamil Kingdom, including parts of the modern Trincomalee District, was recognised as a Tamil region by the name Demala-pattanama (Tamil city). In this work, a number of villages that are now situated in the Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Trincomalee districts are mentioned as places in Demala-pattanama.|$|E

Their {{achievements}} came as a team, without any outstanding stars, which caused The Sentinel to remark <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> team were stars.|$|E
5|$|All {{the veins}} {{of the wing}} are subject to {{secondary}} forking and to union by cross-veins. In some orders of insects the cross-veins are so numerous <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> venational pattern becomes a close network of branching veins and cross-veins. Ordinarily, however, there is a definite number of cross-veins having specific locations. The more constant cross-veins are the humeral cross-vein (h) between costa and subcosta, the radial cross-vein (r) between R and the first fork of Rs, the sectorial cross-vein (s) between the two forks of R8, the median cross-vein (m–m) between M2 and M3, and the mediocubital cross-vein (m-cu) between media and cubitus.|$|E

5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had gone as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E

Regina survives in all endings but depending on the ending, other characters may die.

5|$|Historically Bournemouth {{was part}} of Hampshire, with {{neighbouring}} Poole, just {{to the west of}} the border, in Dorset. At the time of the 1974 local government re-organisation, it was considered desirable <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the Poole/Bournemouth urban area should be part of the same county. Bournemouth therefore became part of the non-metropolitan county of Dorset on 1 April 1974. On 1 April 1997, Bournemouth became a unitary authority, independent from Dorset County Council. For the purposes of the Lieutenancy it remains part of the ceremonial county of Dorset.|$|E

5|$|In 1638 a benefactor, William Holmes, gave £400 to the burgesses of Wisbech to be {{invested}} in land, and the rest applied {{for the maintenance of}} two scholars at Magdalene College, Cambridge. In his will of 1656 Holmes directed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> yearly income of his 46-acre estate in Holbeach, Lincolnshire be paid yearly towards the maintenance of the scholars and the endowment of the school. Other land and property had been donated to the school in the wills of Thomas Parkes in 1628 and John Crane in 1651. Crane's estate included land in Fleet, Lincolnshire and an inn on Market Hill called the Black Bull.|$|E
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris does not mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the {{construction}} of these defences was related to a general uprising of the Welsh tribes, the Ordovices and Silures, that occurred at this time. The revolt was soon quelled, but, to guard against further disruptions, a series of strongholds including Letocetum, Pennocrucium, and Uxacona were established {{along the length of}} Watling Street. All 4th century archaeological remains have come from within the defences and none from outside, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> population were within the defences by the 4th century. The latest coin to be found at Letocetum was minted in the time of the Emperor Gratian and dated to 381CE. Roman administration collapsed {{at the beginning of the}} 5th century and nothing has been found at the site that is datable after this time.|$|E

It was reshot but the audience still laughed. Glen and Les Charles decided to lift the laughter from the office scene, so it is not heard in the final cut. Before portraying Tim—a minor insignificant character—in multiple episodes, Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck, who works at the lab that mutates viruses. Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple, to whom Diane shows her botched artwork.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus {{arrives at}} Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz's hideout, where he discovers Doofenshmirtz {{has gained a}} new nemesis {{in the form of}} Peter the Panda, whom he met in Seattle, Washington. Downtrodden, Perry reminisces about {{previous}} battles with Doofenshmirtz when he was his nemesis, while Doofenshmirtz himself grows tired of Peter due to him being much less sympathetic then Perry. Perry and Doofenshmirtz decide to appear on the talk show Dr. Feelbetter, where they decide to once more become nemeses; however, Doofenshmirtz reveals <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> situation was merely a scheme to capture the world's top agents (who are in the audience) and freeze them with a large ray. This results in a largescale battle where the agents come out victorious.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines {{buried in the}} thick wing roots. Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> nose section could be detached at high altitudes {{to act as an}} escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|E

Buffy learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> town is affected when she looks outside the shop to see a large group (led by series writer and producer David Fury) singing and dancing about how a dry-cleaning service got their stains out ("The Mustard").|$|E
5|$|Yusef is wrongly {{accused of}} {{having an affair with}} Zainab, due to his {{sister-in-law}} overhearing them speaking.

Bhatti has admitted that he is surprised by his status as a heartthrob. Interviewed by Will Payne of the Sunday Mirror, he said that it's a great compliment however, it was a complete surprise.

5|$|After the tournament, Yusuke returns home, but {{has little}} time to rest as he is {{challenged}} to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> scenario was a test put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane in order to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one-by-one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced, when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui {{with the aid of}} the spirit of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight.|$|E
