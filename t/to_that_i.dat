25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E
500|$|In the episode's DVD commentary, MacFarlane {{addressed}} what viewers {{perceived to}} be a rather abrupt ending to the episode. As Peter has lost all hope in getting custody of his kids back, Lois walks through the front door, returning from the hospital, and has brought the kids home with her. MacFarlane stated, [...] "Some of the fans actually noticed, commented {{on the fact that}} this was a very abrupt resolution, but, <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would say, you're not watching [...] wouldn't you rather we throw in more jokes and fill up the time, and then hustle to the finish line at the last minute?".|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E

500|$|Actor John Noble {{called the}} {{beginning}} scene with Olivia and Walter naked [...] "the funniest thing" [...] yet, explaining [...] "The writers keep throwing challenges at me, because I never say no. They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And {{so that was}} a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Uhura and Chekov {{question}} passersby about the location of nuclear vessels was filmed with a hidden camera. However, {{the people with whom}} Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day's shooting and, despite legends to the contrary, knew they were being filmed. In an interview with StarTrek.com, Layla Sarakalo, the extra who said, [...] "I don't know if I know the answer <b>to</b> <b>that...</b> <b>I</b> think it's across the bay, in Alameda," [...] stated that after her car was impounded because she refused to move it for the filming, she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras, hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment. She had been told to act naturally, and so she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film, though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept.|$|E

The size of the object determines the magnitude of the resulting explosion. He is also skilled in the use of a staff, and happens to be very agile. Due to the nature of his power, he displays supernatural durability, being able to take Wolverine's elbow to his face and return to fight moments later. When asked about his thoughts on the character, Kitsch had said, [...] "I knew of him, but I didn't know the following he had. I'm sure I'm still going to be exposed <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> love the character, I love the powers, and I love what they did with him. I didn't know that much, but in my experience, it was a blessing to go in and create my take on him. I'm excited for it, to say the least." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite its success, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{had some}} detractors, {{including}} hip hop tastemakers who were unaccustomed to the album's style. At the 1995 Source Awards, OutKast {{won in the}} [...] "Best Newcomer" [...] category, but were booed upon taking the stage and delivering their acceptance speech; Big Boi managed to deliver his shout outs, while André 3000 was nervous and only said, [...] "The South got somethin' to say." [...] The latter recalled how the album was received by some listeners, [...] "People thought that the South basically only had bass music. At first people were looking at us like 'Um, I don't know.'" [...] Hip hop magnate Russell Simmons reacted negatively to the album at the time, but later expressed regret and said of the album in retrospect, [...] "At the time, I didn't understand their music—it sounds so different from what I was used <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> foolishly... claim that they 'weren't hip-hop.' The same way people didn't understand 'Sucker MCs' a decade earlier, I didn't understand that instead of operating outside of hip-hop, OutKast was actually expanding hip-hop. They were offering {{one of the most}} honest expressions, and expression so honest that it went completely over my head at first." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days before}} the HELP {{confirmation}} hearing, former Surgeon General Richard Carmona went public with claims that the Bush Administration censored his speeches and buried his scientific reports.

The inhabitants of this country are reluctant to pick the flowers, saying that if somebody does pick them in passing, it will not fail to rain that day.

2500|$|Although Guinness {{disliked the}} fame that {{followed}} work {{he did not}} hold in high esteem, Lucas and fellow cast members Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher have spoken highly of his courtesy and professionalism, {{on and off the}} set. Lucas credited him with inspiring cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to achieving completion of the filming. Guinness was quoted as saying that the royalties he obtained from working on the films gave him [...] "no complaints; let me leave it by saying I can live {{for the rest of my}} life in the reasonably modest way I am now used <b>to,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have no debts and I can afford to refuse work that doesn't appeal to me."

2500|$|Early in the 2012 presidential campaign, in June 2011, Romney said, [...] "I don't {{speak for}} the {{scientific}} community, of course, but I believe the world's getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read {{that the world is}} getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> don't know how much our contribution is to that, because I know that there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but I believe we contribute to that. And so I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing." [...] Four months later, in October 2011, he said, [...] "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us." [...] He expressed his opposition to cap and trade plans and to regulation of carbon emissions. In June 2012, Romney's domestic policy advisor Oren Cass told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "He's a supporter of renewable energy, as long as it's anything that would be economically competitive. He doesn't know the extent to which climate change is occurring or that human activity is causing it.... What you won't see are mandates or taxes or regulations that interfere with economic activity." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened <b>to</b> <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E
