25|$|In 1887, the NYYC {{adopted the}} Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club's rating rule, in which Bristol, RI naval {{architect}} Nathanael Herreshoff found loopholes {{that he would}} use to make dramatic improvements in yacht design and to shape the America's Cup's largest and most extreme contenders. Both Herreshoff and Watson proceeded to merge Yankee sloop design and British cutter design to make very deep S-shape fin-keeled hulls. Using steel, <b>tobin</b> <b>bronze,</b> aluminium, and even nickel for novel construction, they significantly lengthened bow and stern overhangs, further extending the sailing waterline as their boats heeled over, thus increasing their speed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> (1962-1994) was an Australian Thoroughbred Hall of Fame racehorse who {{competed with}} great success during the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} won by notable {{champions of the}} past such as Heroic, Phar Lap, Ajax, <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze,</b> Octagonal and Northerly.|$|E
5000|$|He {{also won}} many races under {{handicap}} conditions, {{such as the}} 1967 VATC Caulfield Cup while carrying 9 st 10 lb (61.5 kg) and the AJC Doncaster Handicap under 9 st 5 lb (59.5 kg). In addition, he won the 1967 VATC Toorak Handicap with 9 st 12 lb (62.5 kg), a weight-carrying record for this event that still stands. An 20 October 2009 Sydney Morning Herald article ranked <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze's</b> win in the 1966 Cox Plate {{as one of the}} [...] "Top 5 Cox Plate moments." ...|$|R
50|$|Jane Kirby was a Canadian figure skater who was {{the ladies}} gold {{medalist}} in the 1951 Canadian Figure Skating Championships. She and her partner Donald <b>Tobin</b> were <b>bronze</b> medalists in the pairs competition in the 1951 Canadian Figure Skating Championships and North American Figure Skating Championships. She later turned professional and skated with the Ice Capades.|$|R
5000|$|Columbia had {{a nickel}} steel frame, a <b>tobin</b> <b>bronze</b> hull, and a steel mast (later {{replaced}} {{with one of}} Oregon pine.) ...|$|E
50|$|He was {{moderately}} successful overseas, {{where he}} won a further four times from 16 starts. However, he failed to properly adapt to the dirt tracks used in America. Racing in the United States for the first time, <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> {{finished third in the}} Washington, D.C. International Stakes. Sent to California to race in 1968, on 2 March <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> won in his third start in the United States, capturing the Azucar Purse at Hollywood Park Racetrack.|$|E
50|$|The Trump (1937), Royal Gem (1946), Galilee (1966 - also Melbourne Cup), <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> (1967 - also W S Cox Plate), Leilani (1974).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> died in California in 1994. Following its {{formation}} in 2000, he {{was inducted into}} the Australian Racing Hall of Fame in 2003.|$|E
50|$|Australian-bred stallions {{exported}} to America have proved very successful at stud there. Some of these exported horses include, Bernborough, Shannon, Sailor's Guide, Noholme, <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> and Royal Gem.|$|E
50|$|At stud, <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> was the sire {{of fifteen}} stakes race winners {{including}} Trojan Bronze, the 1975 San Luis Rey Handicap winner, and Noble Bronze, {{who won the}} 1978 California Derby.|$|E
50|$|After {{three seasons}} in Australia, <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> {{was sold to}} American {{interests}} but not before winning his final race start in Australia, the 1967 W.S. Cox Plate, before a huge crowd.|$|E
50|$|The {{champion}} racehorse also easily won such races as the Queen Elizabeth Stakes, the Toorak Handicap and the C.B. Fisher Plate, {{in which}} he defeated champion middle distance horse <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze.</b>|$|E
50|$|The race {{attracted}} champions {{from every}} era that included Carbine, Wakeful, triple {{winner of the}} race Ajax, Tulloch and <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze.</b> In the modern era Rough Habit and Sunline won the race twice.|$|E
50|$|The {{race has}} been won by horses of {{exceptional}} calibre that have won at 2400 metres (~ miles) or longer. These include such thoroughbreds that also competed overseas such as <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> and Better Loosen Up.|$|E
5000|$|Notable {{horses to}} win the event in the 1960s include Pago Pago and Storm Queen who went on {{to win the}} Golden Slipper Stakes as well as {{champion}} <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze.</b> [...] The race was held in early February, but was moved to later in the autumn.|$|E

Many great horses have won the race twice, including Phar Lap, Flight, <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze,</b> Sunline, Northerly, Fields of Omagh, So You Think and Winx. Kingston Town won the race three times.|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{used two}} local woods, Madeira, a local {{mahogany}} like wood, and [...] "yellow pine," [...] probably the slash pine native to south Florida, that were resistant to rot in damp climates. All fastenings beneath the water line were either brass or <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze,</b> now more commonly termed Naval brass, to resist electrolytic action. The vessel was {{named in honor}} of the German biologist and founder of Stazione Zoologica of Naples in Naples, Italy, Anton Dohrn.|$|E
50|$|Tulloch, who {{is often}} {{compared}} to Phar Lap and Carbine, won {{the following year}} and again set a new race record. <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> became a dual winner of the race with victories in 1966 and 1967. The 1969 Cox Plate was won by the New Zealand three-year-old colt Daryl's Joy, {{who went on to}} race successfully in the USA. The popular Goondiwindi grey, Gunsynd, was trainer Tommy Smith's third winner of the Cox Plate in 1972, and the New Zealand Derby winner Fury's Order staggered to victory on a bog track in 1975. Surround became the first three-year-old filly to win the race in 1976, when she defeated the VRC Derby winner Unaware.|$|E
5000|$|For {{his next}} start, Nerud {{decided to try}} the colt on the turf {{for the first time}} in the United Nations Stakes on September 11. The field {{included}} 1967 champion turf horse (and future Horse of the Year) Fort Marcy, Australian champion <b>Tobin</b> <b>Bronze</b> and multiple stakes winner Flit-to. Dr. Fager was assigned 134 pounds, spotting his rivals from 12 to 23 pounds. Despite this, Nerud's only concern was the weather, fearing that soft going would blunt Dr. Fager's natural speed. Elliott Burch, the trainer of Fort Marcy, foresaw additional problems. [...] "It's been my experience that speed horses on the dirt are usually not turf horses," [...] he said. [...] "They can't handle the turns. They tend to run out, and I think 'Fager' is going to have his problems keeping from racing wide." ...|$|E

Dunraven challenged again in 1893, pleading {{for a return to}} the longer 85 ft limit. In a cup-crazed Britain, its four largest cutters ever were being built, including Watson's Valkyrie II for Dunraven's challenge. Meanwhile, the NYYC's wealthiest members ordered two cup candidates from Herreshoff, and two more from Boston yacht designers. Charles Oliver Iselin, who was running the syndicate behind one of the Herreshoff designs called Vigilant, gave the naval architect leave to design the yacht entirely as he willed. Herreshoff helmed Vigilant himself and beat all his rivals in selection trials, and defended the cup successfully from Valkyrie II.|$|E
