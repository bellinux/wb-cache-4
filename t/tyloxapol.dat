The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the mucolytic activity of <b>Tyloxapol</b> compared to saline (0. 9 %) in COPD. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover, clinical trial was carried out. Patients were randomly assigned to either inhale 5 ml <b>Tyloxapol</b> 1 % or saline 0. 9 % solution three times daily for 3 weeks and vice versa for another 3 weeks. 28 patients (18 male, 10 female, 47 to 73 years old, median age 63. 50) were screened, 21 were treated and 19 patients completed the study per protocol. A comparison of the two treatment phases showed that the primary endpoint sputum weight was statistically significant higher when patients inhaled <b>Tyloxapol</b> (mean 4. 03 g, 95 % CI: 2. 34 - 5. 73 g at week 3) compared to saline (mean 2. 63 g, 95 % CI: 1. 73 - 3. 53 g at week 3). The p-value at three weeks of treatment was 0. 041 between treatment arms. Sputum cells decreased during the <b>Tyloxapol</b> treatment after 3 weeks, indicating that <b>Tyloxapol</b> might have some anti-neutrophilic properties.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to test a {{synthetic}} protein-free surfactant preparation, LPM-l, with the same chemical composition as commercially available Exosurf (Glaxo Wellcome), but containing in addition, a sugar, trehalose (TRE). Towards this end, a study was designed to firstly test the hypothesis that the true difference in acute physiological effects between a mixture of oppe, <b>tyloxapol,</b> hexadecanol and trehalose (LPM-l), and Exosurf, (Oppe, <b>tyloxapol</b> and hexadecanol) is zero, in a surfactantdeficient animal model. A second study addressed the physiological effects of oppe, hexadecanol, <b>tyloxapol</b> and trehalose (LPM-l) compared to treatment with trehalose (TRE) or saline, in order to determine (1) the contribution of TRE to the mixture of oppe, hexadecanol and <b>tyloxapol,</b> and (2) to assess the effect of the LPM-l surfactant replacement on the epithelial lining fluid composition by means of analysing bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Thirdly, the effects of TRE and / or calcium were studied on the surface properties of oppe suspensions, by in vitro analysis using the ring detachment method of Du Nouy The in vivo research comprised of two studies, performed in randomised controlled fashion. In the first study, 24 New Zealand White adult rabbits were randomised into 4 groups, while in the second study, 15 animals were randomised into 3 groups. In the first in vivo study, three synthetic surfactants, LPM-l, Exosurf and LPM- 2, and a saline group were tested. LPM-l is a new formulation that consists ofa mixture of Df'PC, TRE, hexadecanol and <b>tyloxapol.</b> LPM- 2 is a formulation with a composition equivalent to that of commercially available Exosurf, prepared on site. In both studies animals were subjected to repeated lavage with large volumes of warm saline (25 ml/kg) in order to establish surfactant deficiency and acute lung injury. Five minutes after the last lavage, vehicle, i. e. surfactants LPM-l, Exosurf, or LPM- 2, or saline, in the first in vivo study, and LPM-l, TRE or saline in the second in vivo study, was instilled, and the course of the animals followed over the next 3 hours. Ventilator settings were standardized before and after lavage. The effects of surfactant treatment on gas exchange (arterial Pa 02, oxygenation index (Ol), arterial-alveolar oxygen (a/A) ratio), percentage calculated shunt, and total dynamic respiratory compliance (CRSdyn), and histopathological changes were compared with changes in saline treated controls. Arterial blood gases in 100 % oxygen and CRSdynwere measured before and after lavage, at 15 minute intervals for the first 30 min, then at 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after vehicle instillation. Oxygenation improved to a similar extent after LPM-l and Exosurf instillation, surpassing that of LPM- 2 or saline. Overall, intratracheal instillation of both Exosurf and LPM-l, rapidly improved the gas exchange and reduced the intrapulmonary shunt, but did not restore the lung to its pre-lavage condition. From the 2 nd in vivo study it was evident that trehalose-only, was inefficient as a lung surfactant, failing to improve oxygenation indices or the calculated percentage shunt, or influencing respiratory compliance. The addition of the sugar, trehalose (TRE), to the on-site 'Exosurf mixture (LPM- 2) brought the activity of the resultant LPM-l to the same level as that of commercial Exosurf, but failed to raise the activity above that of Exosurf. These physiological improvements were sustained for up to 3 hours. Saline-treated animals had no improvement in gas exchange despite management with variable PIP (to maintain a tidal volume of - 1 0 ml / kg) and constant PEEP of 5 cm H 20. In-vitro results, obtained by the Ou Nouy tensiometer, showed higher mean ordinate surface tension values for the OPPC-only and DPPC + TRE mixtures, and the slopes of their respective graphs smaller in magnitude than those of the other formulations, suggesting that these formulations had less surface tension-lowering capability than the other surfactants. At 20 °C (20 mg / ml DPPC-surfactants) the mean ordinate values of OPPC and OPPC + TRE, 70. 13 and 69. 47 dyne / cm, respectively, were not significantly different from each other. The mean ordinate values of LPM-l and the formulation containing OPPC + TRE + <b>tyloxapol</b> + CaCh were lower, but similar, as were the values of LPM- 2 (on-site Exosurf) and LPM- 2 + CaCho Thus, three internally homogeneous subgroups could be identified which differed significantly, namely: DPPC and DPPC + TRE, LPM- 2 and LPM- 2 + CaCh, and DPPC + TRE + <b>tyloxapol</b> + CaCh and LPM-l. Similar conclusions apply to the ordinate values of the surfactants at 37 °C, and to the mean slope values at 20 °C, with the exception that the subgroups, LPM- 2 and LPM- 2 + CaCh, and LPM-l and OPPC + TRE + <b>tyloxapol</b> + CaCh are not so clearly separated. A similar analysis of mean slope values was performed. Here too a significant difference between substances was found, OPPC alone or in combination with TRE, again being significantly different from the other surfactants. The most prominent light microscopy findings of the lungs of animals included general lymphatic dilatation, congestion and lung polymorphonuclear infiltration, with no difference between study groups. Hyaline membranes were present in all surfactant groups, but significantly more so in the saline treated group. In the first in vivo study, the presence of neutrophils in the lung interstitiwn as well as alveoli, was a common finding in all of the study groups towards the end of the study protocol. A significant increase in the BAL-fluid neutrophil count occurred in all animals, concurrent with a significant decrease in the BAL macrophage count. No significant change occurred in the peripheral neutrophil count during the 3 -hour study, suggesting recruitment of neutrophils from storage pools. Treatment with synthetic surfactant (LPM - 1) did not have a significant effect on modifying the inflammatory response, since there was no significant difference in the BAL-derived cell counts between the LPM- 1 and -saline groups. Epithelial damage was a consistent finding in all groups. The damage was more evident by electron microscopy examination and included hydropic changes, most readily observed in the mitochondria. The airspaces of study subjects showed the presence of oedema fluid. This luminal oedema appeared to be more prominent in the control group and LPM- 2 (on site 'Exosurf') group. Organellar debris, probably originating from lysis of epithelial cells, was present, despite treatment with synthetic surfactant. The electron microscopical appearance of the epithelial-lined substance ("hyaline membranes") in the present study showed a marked variability within groups as well as within the same case. The majority of cases showed a mix of membrane types with both granular and fibrillar materials present within the same membrane. In some cases there were layering of the membranes into distinct bands. The instillation of LPM-l resulted in the formation of a slightly different type of epithelial lining fluid after lavage, when compared to the prelavage composition. The most pronounced changes occurred within the fatty acids, whilst the phosphatidylcholine values remained unchanged. Palmitic acid concentrations (C 16 : 0) increased significantly, suggesting enrichment of the epithelial lining fluid after instillation of LPM-l. This increase in C 16 : 0 was concurrent with significant decreases in the percentage C 16 : 1, C 18 : 0, and C 18 : 2. In contrast to previous studies, we describe higher levels for phosphatidyldimethylethanolarnine (PEA). An explanation may be that the lipid identified as PEA, was in fact partly phosphatidylglycerol (PG) -a lipid whose accurate identification was precluded for technical reasons. After surfactant instillation, the PC/SM ratio, a reflection of the lecithin / sphingomyelin (LIS), decreased significantly in the TRE-group between the first and final lavage, but remained statistically unchanged in the animals treated with LPM-l or saline. The change in ratio was mainly accounted for by a decrease in BAL-fluid PC content together with a rise in SM content. A poor correlation existed between the BAL-derived PC/SM ratio and indices reflecting oxygenation status (a/A ratio, Ol), as well as the CRSdynat the time of the final lavage. In conclusion, the primary hypothesis was accepted, LPM-l performed similarly to Exosurf in vivo, improving oxygenation, but not CRSdyn. None was clearly superior to the other. Some questions remain. The reason why LPM-l (LPM- 2 + TRE) did not behave in a superior manner, in vivo, to Exosurf, is partly unclear. This finding was somewhat surprising since the chemical composition of Exosurf and LPM- 2 did not differ, and the addition of TRE to LPM- 2 (on-site Exosurf), did improve the in vivo activity of the resultant LPM-l, above that of LPM- 2. A possible explanation for observed differences in performance include methodological issues, i. e. the preparation of the on-site formulations, especially that of LPM- 2 (on-site Exosurf), may differ from the way in which true commercial Exosurf is prepared. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die doel van die studie was om 'n sintetiese proteïn vrye surfaktant te ontwikkel en die produk te vergelyk met 'n kunsmatige surfaktant reeds in kliniese gebruik. Die bekende uit die literatuur en die onbekende van die produk wat evalueer sou word, lei op tot die samestelling van die nul hipotese van die PhD naamlik dat geen verskil in longfunksie sou gewys word tussen die toetsproduk en reeds gebruikte kommersiële surfaktant nie. Die hipotese was dat 'n suiker (trehalose), in kombinasie met Dipalmitoiel fosfatidielcholine (DPPC), gaswisseling en longfunksies sal verbeter vir 'n long met 'n lae surfaktant konsentrasie. Vir die studie is jong volwasse wit New Zealand konyne gebruik en is hulle met 'n gestandaardiseerde en menslike manier gebruik in eksperimentele werk. Die diere is onder intraveneuse narkose geplaas en verskillende kardiovaskulêre en pulmonologiese aspekte is gemeet. Die long surfaktant is uitgewas deur middel van fisiologiese soutoplossing wat tot liggaam temperatuur verhit is en daarna is die diere prospektief gerandomiseer tot eksperimentele groepe. Met vooraf bepaalde tydsintervalle is die fisiologiese metings herhaal en was die metings toegespits daarop om longmeganiese funksie en gasoordrag vermoë te evalueer. Lig mikroskopiese en elektron mikroskopiese studies is ook op die longe gedoen en verder is brongoalveolêre vloeistof ook ontleed. Die groepe met ondersoek was: I. oppe, heksadekanol, <b>tyloxapol</b> en trehalose (LPM-I). 2. oppe, heksadekanol, <b>tyloxapol</b> (LPM- 2 :. LPM-I sonder trehalose). Hierdie is 'n proteïnvrye surfaktant plaaslik berei (dieselfde samestelling as Exosurf). 3. Exosurf®. (Kommersiële preperaat reeds in gebruik). Hierdie is 'n proteïnvrye sintetiese surfaktant. 4. Trehalose, 'n non-reduserende disakklaried van glukose. Addisioneel is daar ook in vitro studies gedoen waann die oppervlakte spanmngs aktiwiteite van die verskillende surfaktant oplossings vergelyk is. Die statistiese analise is gedoen in samewerking met Prof. J. Maritz wat 'n unieke metode ontwikkel en gepubliseer het om herhalende veranderlikes op 'n statisties verantwoordbare manier te ontleed. In die eerste van die studies, is LPM-I, Exosurf®, fisiologiese soutoplossing en 'n plaaslik bereide "Exosurf" (LPM- 2), met 'n chemiese samestelling identies aan dié van kommersiële Exosurf®, evalueer. In 'n tweede studie is die fisologiese effekte van LPM-I vergelyk met trehalose of fisiologiese soutoplossing om die volgende te ondersoek: 1) Die bydrae van trehalose tot 'n mengsel van oppe, heksadekanol en <b>tyloxapol</b> (LPM- 2). 2) Die gevolg van LPM-l surfaktant toediening op die konyn se brongo-alveolêre vloeistof samestelling. 'n Derde, in vitro studie, het die oppervlaktespannings-effekte van trehalose en of kalsiumbyvoegings tot DPPC-oplossings gemeet deur middel van die ring metode van Du Nouy, In die eerste in vivo studie verbeter oksigenasie en persentasie longaftakking tot dieselfde mate na LPM-l en Exosurf® toediening en word die hipotese van die proefskrif bevestig. In die breë gesien, is die tydsprofiele van LPM-l en Exosurf® ten opsigte van oksigenasie en persentasie longaftakking statisties betekenisvol beter en van 'n sneller aard, as die tydsprofiele van dieselfde indekse na die toediening van fisiologiese soutoplossing of LPM- 2. Die tydsprofiel van dinamiese longvervormbaarheid, na die toediening van LPM-I of Exosurf®, is dieselfde, maar betekenisvol beter as die vervormbaarheid na toediening van LPM- 2 of fisiologiese soutoplossing. Alhoewel die oksigenasie indekse in die geval van LPM-l en Exosurf® betekenisvol verbeter oor die studietydperk, vind volkome herstel tot die basislynwaardes (voor spoeling) nie plaas nie. Bykomend, geen van die surfaktante het na toediening enige noemenswaardige verbetering in longvervormbaarheid tot gevolg gehad nie. Die rede vir die swakker vertoning van LPM- 2 en Exosurf is onbekend en sal in opvolg studie ondersoek word. In die tweede in vivo studie is dit duidelik dat trehalose op sy eie, 'n oneffektiewe surfaktant is aangesien die preperaat na toediening geen verbetering teweegbring ten opsigte van oksigenasie indekse, persentasie longaftakking, of long-dinamiese vervormbaarheid nie. Die toevoeging van trehalose tot LPM- 2, om LPM-l te lewer, neem wel die aktiwiteit van LPM-l tot dieselfde in vivo vlak as dié van kommersiële Exosurf®, maar slaag nie daarim om 'n hoër fisiologiese in vivo aktiwiteit as dié produk te bereik nie. Die diere wat met fisiologiese soutoplossing behandel is toon geen verbetering in enige fisiologiese parameter nie. Die in vitro resultate wat verkry is deur die Du Nouy tensiometer toon hoër gemiddelde ordinaat oppervlaktespannings waardes vir 'n formule wat slegs uit DPPC bestaan, asook vir 'n mengsel van DPPC + trehalose. Die helling van die grafieke van hierdie oplossings is ook kleiner as die van die ander formulas wat daarop dui dat DPPC op sigself, en DPPC + trehalose, weinig vermoë het om oppervlaktespanning te verminder. Daarteenoor verlaag die volgende oplossings die oppervlaktespanning ten opsigte van gedistilleerde water betekenisvol en wel in In konsentrasie afhanklike manier by beide 21 °C en 3 rc: LMP-I-, LPM- 2 -, DPPC + trehalose + <b>tyloxapol</b> + CaCf 2 -, en LPM- 2 + CaCf 2. Die prominentste ligmikroskopiese bevindinge van die longe van die diere sluit in: Algemene limfvat dilatasie, stuwing, en long neutrofiel infiltrasie. Betreffende hierdie histologiese bevindinge is daar geen verskille aangetoon tussen die groepe nie. Hialienmembrane was teenwoordig in al die groepe, maar betekenisvol meer in die groep wat fisiologiese soutoplossing ontvang as vervangingsterapie. In die tweede in vivo studie is daar 'n betekenisvolle styging in die neutrofiel- en daling in makrofaagtelling, van die brongoalveolêre vloeistof spoeling in al drie die groep aangetoon. Terselfdertyd vind geen noemenswaardige daling in die perifêre (sistematiese) neutrofieltelling plaas nie. Hierdie bevindinge dui daarop dat die brongoalveolêre selveranderinge toegeskryf kan word aan verwerwing van neutrofiele vanuit 'n longstoringspoel eerder as rekrutering vanuit die sistemiese sirkulatoriese poel. Surfaktant (LPM-l), behandeling het geen betekenisvolle vermindering in long inflammasie teweeggebring nie. Epiteelskade was 'n algemene ligmikroskopiese bevinding in al die groepe. Die samestelling van die brongoalveolêre vloeistof verander na installering van LPM-I. Die prominentste verandering word waargeneem in die vetsuur samestelling terwyl die DPPC waardes onveranderd bly. Die vetsuur, palmitiensuur (palmitic acid), (CI 6 : 0), verhoog betekenisvol na toediening van LPM-l. Daarteenoor verminder die konsentrasie van C 16 : 1, C 18 : 0 en C 18 : 2. In kontras met vorige studies, beskryf die huidige studie hoër konsentrasies van fosfatidieletanolamien, moontlik as gevolg van tegniese verskille in die metingsmetodes. 'n Betekenisvolle verlaging in die fosfatidielcholine:sfingomiëlien (PC/SM) verhouding word waargeneem tussen die eerste en die finale longspoeling van die trehalose-groep, terwyl dit onveranderd bly in die diere wat LPM- 1 of fisiologiese soutoplossing ontvang...|$|E

Some genes related to hypercholesterolemia are known, although all genes responsible for cholesterolemia regulation {{have not been}} characterised yet. To identify these new genes, animal models with spontaneous defects in cholesterol metabolism could be very useful. Moreover, a number of variations and polymorphisms {{have been found to}} influence blood cholesterol levels in humans. Some may also affect cholesterolemia responsiveness to dietary fat. The Prague hereditary hypercholesterolemic (PHHC) rat is a unique model of hypercholesterolemia induced by dietary cholesterol alone (without administration of cholic acid or thyrotoxic drugs). It exhibits modestly increased cholesterolemia when fed chow and responds to a diet containing cholesterol with a several-fold increase of cholesterolemia to concentrations comparable to those observed in hypercholesterolemic patients. Hypercholesterolemia in this model is characterised by accumulation of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) enriched by cholesterol. In an experiment with <b>tyloxapol</b> (an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase) we found that PHHC rats on a cholesterol diet incorporated twice as much cholesterol into VLDL as Wistar rats, although liver [...] ...|$|E

Two phases can be observed when the surface pressure is low and the mole fraction of DPPC is high: a condensed phase of hexadecanol with some DPPC and an expanded phase. Increasing surface pressure generates a second condensed phase that is DPPC rich. On further compression the expanded phase disappears and the two condensed phases merge, but miscibility rules indicate that the expanded phases do not mix {{even though there is}} no evidence for two phases in the experimental data.

Our study deals with characteristics of nascent VLDL particles and introduces new method for measurements of reverse cholesterol transport in vivo on rats. Characteristics of nascent VLDL particles Production of VLDL particles was studied with two different rat species - Wistar and PHHC. VLDL particles were isolated from a serum 2 hours after i. v. application of Triton WR 1339. No dependence of cholesteromie of the Wistar rats on the diet was observed, while increase of about 45 % of cholesterol of PHHC rats was found. The count of triglycerides (TG) after application of <b>tyloxapol</b> steeply increased {{as a result of}} accumulation of VLDL particles. Small increase of cholesterol in VLDL particles was observed assuming Wistar rats on the cholesterol diet, while the same increase was found to be rapidly higher with PHHC rats on the same diet.

The optimum cyclodextrin concentration for formation of irbesartan/cyclodextrin inclusion complex was found to be 10 % (w/v) and the solubility of ionized irbesartan/γ-cyclodextrin complex (at pH 7. 2) was shown to be three fold greater than that of the unionized complex (at pH 4. 3). The irbesartan flux through semipermeable membranes increased with increasing γ-cyclodextrin concentration at both pH values. However, the ionized complex displayed decrease in the drug permeation coefficient with increasing cyclodextrin concentration. The effect of four pharmaceutical excipients on the cyclodextrin solubilization was investigated. EDTA, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and <b>tyloxapol</b> increased complexation efficiency of γ-cyclodextrin while benzalkonium chloride had negligible effect. The largest solubilization was observed in the eye drop vehicle that contained all four excipients in addition to γ-cyclodextrin.

Ultrafiltration (UF) was carried out using 10 K Nanosep® devices and centrifugation at 5, 000  rpm for 5  min. The separation of free BAC from micellar solutions was also conducted using ultracentrifugation (UC) method for the comparison with UF method. Capillary electrophoresis method was used for the identification of micelles. Results showed that a UF method was applicable for quantitatively evaluating BAC–micelle interaction in micellar solutions. Unlike UF, UC could not completely separate free BAC from the micelles. The free BAC concentrations in the micelle solutions decreased with increasing surfactant concentrations. Among polysorbate 80, cremophor EL, and <b>tyloxapol,</b> BAC had the highest Km in polysorbate 80 solutions. The Km was significantly lower in non-buffered aqueous solutions than that in citric buffers. Moreover, increasing surfactant concentrations led to reducing antimicrobial activity. The UF is a rapid and accurate method that minimally alters the micellar equilibrium for the determination of free BAC and Km in micellar solutions. In conclusion, free BAC concentration, which is a function of surfactant type, surfactant concentration, and ion strength of solution, is likely associated with the antimicrobial activity...|$|E

We used 5 % RHNM dissolved in phosphate-buffered solution as the optimal buffer and concentration of RHNM for the study because it showed a viscoelastic response {{similar to that of}} freshly collected nasal mucus from patients with chronic sinusitis. Methods: Four experiments were performed to determine the influence of each drug on dynamic viscosity and elasticity of 5 % RHNM. Distilled water was used as a control. Results: Acetylcysteine and deoxynuclease I significantly decreased both dynamic viscosity and elastic modulus, while distilled water had no effect on rheological properties of 5 % RHNM in vitro. Alevaire significantly reduced both dynamic viscosity and elastic modulus. Sodium bicarbonate significantly reduced elastic modulus but not dynamic viscosity. Reduction of elastic modulus by Alevaire was significantly greater than that by sodium bicarbonate, while {{there was no difference in}} reduction of dynamic viscosity between them.

Our aim was to investigate the effect of liver denervation upon the secretion of VLDL and the expression of proteins involved in this process. Denervation was achieved by applying a 85 % phenol solution onto the portal tract, while control animals were treated with 9 % NaCl. VLDL secretion was evaluated by the <b>Tyloxapol</b> method. The hepatic concentration of TAG and cholesterol, and the plasma concentration of TAG, cholesterol, VLDL-TAG, VLDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were measured, as well as mRNA expression of proteins involved in the process of VLDL assembly. Hepatic acinar distribution of MTP and apoB was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Denervation increased plasma concentration of cholesterol (125. 3 +/- 10. 1 vs. 67. 1 +/- 4. 9 mg dL(- 1)) and VLDL-cholesterol (61. 6 +/- 5. 6 vs. 29. 4 +/- 3. 3 mg dL(- 1)), but HDL-cholesterol was unchanged (45. 5 +/- 6. 1 vs. 36. 9 +/- 3. 9 mg dL(- 1)). Secretion of VLDL-TAG (47. 5 +/- 23. 8 vs. 148. 5 +/- 27. 4 mg dL h(- 1)) and mRNA expression of CPT I and apoB were reduced (p < 0. 01) in the denervated animals.

The highly conserved interaction between CD 1 d:α-Galactosylceramide (αGC) complexes and the iNKT TCR not only defines this population of αβ T cells {{but can also}} be used for its direct identification. Therefore, CD 1 d oligomers are a widely used tool for iNKT cell related investigations. To this end, the lipid chains of the antigen have to be inserted into the hydrophobic pockets of the CD 1 d binding cleft, often with help of surfactants. In this study, we investigated the influence of different surfactants (Triton X- 100, Tween 20, <b>Tyloxapol)</b> on in vitro loading of CD 1 d molecules derived from four different species (human, mouse, rat and cotton rat) with αGC and derivatives carrying modifications of the acyl-chain (DB 01 - 1, PBS 44) and a 6 -acetamido- 6 -deoxy-addition at the galactosyl head group (PBS 57). We also compared rat CD 1 d dimers with tetramers and staining of an iNKT TCR transductant was used as readout for loading efficacy. The results underlined the importance of CD 1 d loading efficacy for proper analysis of iNKT TCR binding and demonstrated the necessity to adjust loading conditions for each oligomer/glycolipid combination. The efficient usage of surfactants as a tool for CD 1 d loading was revealed to be species-specific and depending on the origin of the CD 1 d producing cells. Additional variation of surfactant-dependent loading efficacy between tested glycolipids was influenced by the acyl-chain length and the modification of the galactosyl head group with PBS 57 showing the least dependence on surfactants and the lowest degree of species-dependent differences...|$|E

Apart from available synthetic drugs used in CVDs, there are many herbal formulations including POL- 10 (containing 10 herbs), which {{have been shown to be}} effective in animal studies but POL- 10 was found to cause tachycardia in rodents as its side effect. This study was designed to modify the composition of POL- 10 for better efficacy and/or safety profile in CVDs. Methods To assess the antidyslipidemic, antihypertensive and endothelial modulatory properties of two herbal formulations, (ZPTO and ZTO) containing Z: Zingiber officinalis, P: Piper nigrum, T: Terminalia belerica and O: Orchis mascula, different animal models including, <b>tyloxapol</b> and high fat diet-induced dyslipidemia and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used. Effect on endothelial function was studied using isolated tissue bath set up coupled with PowerLab data acquisition system. The antioxidant activity was carried out using DPPH radical-scavenging assay. Results Based on preliminary screening of the ingredients of POL- 10 in tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemic rats, ZPTO and ZTO containing four active ingredients namely; Z, P, T and O were identified for further studies and comparison. In tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemic rats, both ZPTO and ZTO caused significant reduction in serum triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC). In high fat diet-fed rats, ZPTO decreased TC, low-density lipoproteins cholesterol (LDL-C) and atherogenic index (AI). ZTO also showed similar effects to those of ZPTO with additional merits being more effective in reducing AI, body weight and more importantly raising high-density lipoproteins. In SHR, both formulations markedly reduced systolic blood pressure, AI and TG levels, ZTO being more potent in reversing endothelial dysfunction while was devoid of cardiac stimulatory effect. In addition, ZTO also reduced LDL-C and improved glucose levels in SHR. In DPPH radical-scavenging activity test, ZTO was also more potent than ZPTO.
