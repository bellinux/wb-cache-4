25|$|Ingesting a {{compound}} by smoking {{is one of}} the most rapid and efficient methods of introducing it into the bloodstream, second only to injection, which allows for the rapid feedback which supports the smokers' ability to titrate their dosage. On average it takes about ten seconds for the substance to reach the brain. As a result of the efficiency of this delivery system, many smokers feel as though they are unable to cease. Of those who attempt cessation and last three months without succumbing to nicotine, most are able to remain smoke-free for the rest of their lives. There exists a possibility of depression in some who attempt cessation, as with other psychoactive substances. Depression is also common in teenage smokers; teens who smoke are four <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop depressive symptoms as their nonsmoking peers.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the sociodemographic and health characteristics and problems of older pedestrians. METHODS: Interviews and assessments were conducted with 1249 enrollees aged 72 or older from the New Haven, Conn, community of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly who {{agreed to participate in}} a seventh follow-up. RESULTS: Approximately 11 % of the New Haven residents reported difficulty crossing the street. Older pedestrians needing help in one or more activities of daily living were more than 10 <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> others, and those with the slowest walking speeds were nearly 3 <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> others, <b>to</b> report difficulty crossing the street. Fewer than 1 % of these pedestrians aged 72 or older had a normal walking speed sufficient to cross the street in the time typically allotted at signalized intersections (1. 22 m/sec).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{findings}} about the work-related differences among professional {{women and men}} information technology (IT) workers in the United States. To better understand these as gender-related differences, we adopt an institutional standpoint and theorize that {{the organization of the}} workplace, post-graduate training and education, and family characteristics largely shape the work-related outcomes {{of men and women in}} the United States IT workforce. Drawing from interviews with 2823 professional IT workers employed in the United States, we report five findings. First, women are nearly two-and-a-half <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> men <b>to</b> leave the professional IT workforce. Second, men and women work similar hours and have similar commute times. Third, no significant differences exist between men’s and women’s types of post-graduate training and education. Fourth, women take more unpaid leave and for longer periods than do men. Finally, women are paid significantly less than men. We conclude the “pipeline ” approach to redress the under-representation of women in information technology fields fails to anticipate the significance of women’s experiences once they enter IT jobs...|$|R
25|$|The {{longitudinal}} study Excess Mortality from Suicide and other External Causes of Death Among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants (2007), reported {{that women who}} sought breast implants are almost 3.0 <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide as are women who have not sought breast implants. Compared to the standard suicide-rate for women of the general populace, the suicide-rate for women with augmented breasts remained alike until 10-years post-implantation, yet it increased to 4.5 times greater at the 11-year mark, and so remained until the 19-year mark, when it increased to 6.0 times greater at 20-years post-implantation. Moreover, additional to the suicide-risk, women with breast implants also faced a trebled death risk from alcoholism and drugs abuse (prescription and recreational). Although seven studies have statistically connected a woman's undergoing a breast augmentation procedure to a greater suicide-rate, the research indicates that augmenation surgery does not increase the suicide death-rate; and that, in the first instance, it is the psychopathologically-inclined woman who is likelier to undergo breast augmentation.|$|E

A field study after a mild fire in Torndirrup National Park published in 1994 found that plants burnt by fire were ten <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have seedlings come up under their crown as unburnt plants (with {{an average of}} 25.2 seedlings per burnt plant), and burnt spikes released {{double the number of}} seeds as unburnt spikes. Despite this, interfire recruitment (seedlings arising between fires) has also been recorded, and might be more common than in other Banksia species. Observations at several of the populations showed many plants produced their first seed anywhere from 13 to 17 years of age, leading to a recommendation of 20 years between fires to allow seed banks to accumulate. [...] If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause a population decline or even local extinction. Too long a time between fires also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.|$|E

Demographic characteristics associated with the prevalence of objective signs of CVI were evaluated in a cross-sectional population study in Italy. MethodsA sample of 5247 people selected by advertising in television and newspapers in 24 Italian cities underwent a clinical examination of the lower limbs, including colour-coded duplex ultrasonography, to determine the presence and severity of CVI. Of these, 4288 subjects provided demographic data that could be analysed by multiple logistic regression model using sex, age, region and family history as covariates. ResultsWomen were four or more <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> men <b>to</b> develop telangiectasia, whilst males had a two-fold increased risk of trunk varices. Age was the main risk factor for vein varicosis in the female population, with women aged over 50 years being almost five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> those aged 29 or less to show trunk varices. Females living in the southern regions had a two-fold increase in risk of developing CVI signs and the risk increased by at least 1. 3 times in multiparous women.

40|$|Abstract Background Household food {{insecurity}} and under-nutrition remain critically important {{in developing countries}} struggling {{to emerge from the}} scourge of poverty, where historically, improvements in economic conditions have benefited only certain privileged groups, causing growing inequality in health and healthcare among the population. Methods Utilizing information from 5, 977 children aged 0 - 59 months included in the 2004 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, this study examined the relationship between household wealth inequality and chronic childhood under-nutrition. A child is defined as being chronically undernourished or whose growth rate is adversely stunted, if his or her z-score of height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the median of international reference. Household wealth status is measured by an established index based on household ownership of durable assets. This study utilized multivariate logistic regressions to estimate the effect of household wealth status on adverse childhood growth rate. Results The results indicate that children in the poorest 20 % of households are more than three <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> suffer from adverse growth rate stunting as children from the wealthiest 20 % of households (OR= 3. 6; 95 % CI: 3. 0, 4. 3). The effect of household wealth status remain significantly large when the analysis was adjusted for a child's multiple birth status, age, gender, antenatal care, delivery assistance, birth order, and duration that the child was breastfed; mother's age at childbirth, nutritional status, education; household access to safe drinking water, arsenic in drinking water, access to a hygienic toilet facility, cooking fuel cleanliness, residence, and geographic location (OR= 2. 4; 95 % CI: 1. 8, 3. 2). Conclusion This study concludes that household wealth inequality is strongly associated with childhood adverse growth rate stunting. Reducing poverty and making services more available and accessible to the poor are essential to improving overall childhood health and nutritional status in Bangladesh. </p...|$|R
