50|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>several</b> <b>architects</b> and {{engineers}} in South and Latin America {{who were working}} in the modernist language, such as Guillermo Gonzalez Zuleta in Colombia, Carlos Raúl Villanueva in Venezuela and Félix Candela in Mexico, who brought architecture and structural engineering into close proximity, especially when undertaking humble commissions. His buildings were mostly roofed with thin shell vaults constructed of brick and ceramic tiles. These forms were cheaper than reinforced concrete, and didn't require ribs and beams. In developing this approach, even in comparison with modernists the world over, he was an innovator.|$|R

40|$|Globalization is an {{inevitable}} phenomenon and put pressure in all aspect of human lives without exemption including architecture.

Among the globalization effect in Indonesia, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>several</b> <b>architects</b> that concern about the local values,such as Macleine Pont, Schoemaker and Mangunwijaya. The issue of localization in the Catholic Church came up after the second Vatican Council with the concepts of Indonesianization. This particular process {{is a process of}} localizing which gave influenced to the architecture. The localization effort which was started by Maclaine Pont and Schoemaker was also found in the works of Mangunwijaya. Mangunwijaya tried his localizing effort in the context of place and culture in his works consciously. But the term of the context sugested by Mangunwijaya is more than just Javanese culture. It can clearly be identified from the process of localizing universal religious symbols and also the architecture expression compared to the surrounding buildings...|$|R
