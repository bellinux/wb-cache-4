[...] Steele was endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee during his run for Senate in 2006. In a March 2009 interview with GQ, Steele suggested that abortion restrictions {{should be left to}} state governments, and stated that he [...] "absolutely" [...] believes there is room for a [...] "pro-choice" [...] candidate in the GOP. This statement prompted criticism from socially conservative Republicans such as Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, as well as the Christian Coalition, and <b>Tony</b> <b>Perkins</b> of the Family Research Council [...] In response to these critics, Steele suggested that he asked God for patience [...] "so I absolutely don't go out and kick this person's ass.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, revelations that an April Navy memo {{relating}} to its DADT training guidelines contemplated allowing same-sex weddings in base chapels and allowing chaplains to officiate if they so chose {{resulted in a}} letter of protest from 63 Republican congressman, citing the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as controlling the use of federal property. <b>Tony</b> <b>Perkins</b> of the Family Research Council said the guidelines [...] "make it even more uncomfortable {{for men and women}} of faith to perform their duties". A Pentagon spokesperson replied that DOMA [...] "does not limit the type of religious ceremonies a chaplain may perform in a chapel on a military installation", and a Navy spokesperson said that [...] "A chaplain can conduct a same-sex ceremony if it is in the tenets of his faith". A few days later the Navy rescinded its earlier instructions [...] "pending additional legal and policy review and interdepartmental coordination".|$|E

Generally speaking, he was [...] "known to be extraordinarily friendly {{in a way that}} made some [...] uncomfortable." [...] According to Mark Beck-Heyman, who served as a Republican page in summer 1995, [...] "Almost the first day I got there I was warned. It was no secret that Foley had a special interest in male pages." [...] He alleged that many people on Capitol Hill, including Republican staffers, [...] "have known for over 11 years about what was going on and chose to do nothing." [...] <b>Tony</b> <b>Perkins,</b> president of the conservative Family Research Council, said on MSNBC that [...] "Iâ€˜ve had people now on staff that used to be pages, and it was widely known to watch out for him, that he liked boys ... so pages were warned to watch out for him." ...|$|E

[...] Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said, [...] "This is a great victory for religious liberty â€“ the bedrock of our founding. In living out our religious convictions, {{there are certain things}} we must not do. This is why we are at a watershed moment. Religious people will no longer be ordered to take action that our religion says we must not take." [...] Family Research Council President <b>Tony</b> <b>Perkins</b> said, [...] "The Supreme Court has delivered {{one of the most significant}} victories for religious freedom in our generation. We are thankful the Supreme Court agreed that the government went too far by mandating that family businesses owners must violate their consciences under threat of crippling fines."

2500|$|On November 30, 2010, [...] the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{released}} the [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" [...] Comprehensive Review Working Group (CRWG) report authored by Jeh C. Johnson, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and Army General Carter F. Ham. It outlined {{a path to}} the implementation of repeal of DADT. The report indicated that there was a low risk of service disruptions due to repealing the ban, provided time was provided for proper implementation and training. It included the results of a survey of 115,000 active-duty and reserve service members. Across all service branches, 30 percent thought that integrating gays into the military would have negative consequences. In the Marine Corps and combat specialties, the percentage with that negative assessment ranged from 40 to 60 percent. The CRWG also said that 69 percent of all those surveyed believed they had already worked with a gay or lesbian and of those, 92 percent reported that the impact of that person's presence was positive or neutral. The same day, in response to the CRWG, 30 professors and scholars, most from military institutions, issued a joint statement saying that the CRWG [...] "echoes more than 20 studies, including studies by military researchers, all of which reach the same conclusion: allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly will not harm the military .... We hope that our collective statement underscores that the debate about the evidence is now officially over...." [...] The Family Research Council's president, <b>Tony</b> <b>Perkins,</b> interpreted the CRWG data differently, writing that it [...] "reveals that 40 percent of Marines and 25 percent of the Army could leave".|$|E
