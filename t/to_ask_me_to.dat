25|$|<b>To</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> verify my life {{by giving}} you my statistics... is like using science to {{validate}} sorcery. It robs {{the world of}} its magic and makes milestones out of us all.|$|E
25|$|I helped him. If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't {{have been}} on the radar screen. I'd have been {{opposing}} Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E
500|$|At Beauregard's request, {{his allies}} in the Confederate Congress petitioned Davis to restore his command in the West. Davis {{remained}} angry at Beauregard's absence {{and told him he}} should have stayed at his post even if he had to be carried around in a litter. He wrote, [...] "If the whole world were <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> restore General Beauregard to the command which I have already given to General Bragg, I would refuse it." [...] Beauregard was ordered to Charleston and took command of coastal defenses in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, replacing Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton. The latter was promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to command the defenses of Vicksburg, Mississippi.|$|E

I did all I could to save their lives; if they were alive this moment I would wish {{nothing better than to}} bring them home, but as <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> forward a {{petition}} in favour of the hoary old rebel that perverted them, I should think it a crime." ...|$|R
500|$|Cher's {{music plays}} {{a large role}} in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", Chris Carter having written the episode after {{spending}} a summer listening to Cher records and developing a fixation on the singer. Carter knew that Cher's half-sister Georganne LaPiere was a major X-Files fan, and Carter learned through LaPiere that Cher herself was intrigued by the show and would be interested in making an X-Files guest appearance. Sitcom star Roseanne Barr also expressed an interest in guesting on The X-Files, and Carter wrote the part of Shaineh Berkowitz specifically for her. Barr, however, was unavailable at the time of shooting—her projected role was filled by Pattie Tierce— while Cher passed on the proffered cameo appearance performing as herself, a decision for which she later expressed regret: [...] "I wanted them <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come on and act—then they just wanted me to come on and sing ... Just to come on and be myself wasn't anything I'd want to do until I saw [...] " [...] — [...] "Had I [...] the quality of [...] I would have done it in a heartbeat." [...] Cher did authorize the use of three of her tracks on the episode's soundtrack including [...] "Walking in Memphis" [...] heard at the episode's conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator Tracey Bell—filmed in longshot or from the back or overheard—as Cher. Although Bell was credited for the role, Cher's fans responded to the episode's premiere with online speculation as to whether the singer had pseudonymously appeared in the episode. [...] Tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself. These casting choices went against a long-standing tradition on The X-Files of only casting actors who were not well-known.|$|E
2500|$|On April 16, 2008, rival mayoral {{candidate}} Leonard Padilla distributed a 2007 {{report of}} similar allegations made against Johnson at St. HOPE Sacramento High School. The allegations were investigated by local police, but no charges were filed. On April 29, 2008, {{a group of}} female civic leaders including former Sacramento Mayor Ann Rudin, Sacramento Municipal Utility District board member Genevieve Shiroma, and former State Senator Deborah Ortiz demanded {{the release of the}} police report on the matter. The teacher to whom the student initially brought the complaint subsequently resigned over the incident, claiming, [...] "St. HOPE sought to intimidate the student through an illegal interrogation and even had the audacity <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> change my story." [...] Sacramento Police Chief Rick Braziel responded, saying, [...] "I think the allegations at the school were handled in the way that you would want them handled. Immediately they followed all the normal protocols that they were supposed to follow. I think it was pretty clear there was nothing there... We did ask the young lady whether anyone had influenced her – her answer was no." [...] The Sacramento County Sheriff John McGinness said on May 30, 2008, that Johnson's actions, though ill-advised, were not illegal.|$|E
2500|$|I {{talked to}} him (Dr. Scott) for some time, and {{consulted}} him about baby, who was looking thin and weak. (15 July)This evening I was standing outside the door with baby in my arms, talking to the ayah, when I felt something whiz past my ears. (23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give her a little milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.

50|$|In {{the later}} stages of his career, Gong comes {{to take an}} {{interest}} in Ancient Greek Philosophy, publishing several books in which he interprets and analyzes famous Greek philosophers such as Socrates and Aristotle. It is also a transformative time for Gong in his life as he converts to Christianity. In his article published on Sept. 28th of 2011, he writes, “if someone were <b>to</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> what they should devote their time and energy, I’d say spend a good amount time studying and writing about the Greek classics. Like classical music and art, {{it is important to understand}} the works of great philosophers.” In the process of this journey, Gong encounters God and expands his studies to include the realm of Christianity.|$|R
