It joins a group of sandwiches from other vendors <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> as counters to the more well-known McDonald's sandwich. This includes the Big Shef sandwich originally from now-defunct chain Burger Chef and occasionally produced as a LTO from current trademark owner Hardees.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to manipulate the Steam storefront and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam {{is unlikely to be}} granted.|$|E
5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E

5|$|LARP {{events have}} {{a wide variety of}} styles that often overlap. Simple distinctions can be made {{regarding}} the genre used, the presence of simulated weapons or abstract rules, and whether players create their own characters or have them assigned by gamemasters. There is also a distinction between scenarios that are only run once and those <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to be repeatable. A number of other common classifications follow.|$|E
5|$|Learning for Life is {{a school}} and work-site based program that is a {{subsidiary}} of the BSA. It utilizes programs designed for schools and community-based organizations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to prepare youth for the complexities of contemporary society and to enhance their self-confidence, motivation, and self-esteem. Exploring is the worksite-based program of Learning for Life with programs based on five areas of emphasis: career opportunities, life skills, citizenship, character education, and leadership experience.|$|E
5|$|Pizza cheese {{encompasses}} several {{varieties and}} types of cheeses and dairy products <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> and manufactured for use specifically on pizza. These include processed and modified cheese such as mozzarella-like processed cheeses and mozzarella variants. The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza. The most popular cheeses used {{in the preparation of}} pizza are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), provolone, cheddar and Parmesan. Emmental, Romano and ricotta are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are mass-produced. Some mass-produced pizza cheeses are frozen after manufacturing and shipped frozen.|$|E

5|$|The AC {{electric}} motor {{used in a}} VFD system is usually three-phase induction motor. Some types of single-phase motors or synchronous motors advantageous in some situations can be used, but three-phase induction motors are generally preferred as the most economical motor choice. Motors <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> for fixed-speed operation are often used. Elevated-voltage stresses imposed on induction motors that are supplied by VFDs require that such motors be designed for definite-purpose inverter-fed duty in accordance with such requirements as Part 31 of NEMA Standard MG-1.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Navy {{has stated}} that the {{carriers}} could withstand three times the damage sustained by the Essex class inflicted by Japanese air attacks during World War II. The hangars on the ships are divided into three fire bays by thick steel doors <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to restrict the spread of fire. This addition has been present on U.S. aircraft carriers since World War II, after the fires caused by Kamikaze attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{objectives}} of the BSA {{are referred to as}} Aims of Scouting: moral character development; citizenship training; and development of physical, mental, and emotional fitness. The BSA pursues these aims through an informal education system called the Scout method, with variations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to be appropriate for the age and maturity of each membership division. Each unit is sponsored by a community organization as part of their youth program and is involved in the neighborhood and community.|$|E

The ship's aircraft operations are controlled by the air boss from Primary Flight Control or Pri-Fly. Four large elevators transport aircraft between the flight deck and the hangars below. These hangars are divided into three bays by thick steel doors <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to restrict the spread of fire.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to attract {{attention}} and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike-likes are {{generally}} much shorter games {{intended to be}} winnable within a single gaming session, in contrast to traditional roguelikes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> for multiple sessions of gameplay. Associated with their short length, many roguelike-likes feature a metagame, whereby achieving certain goals will unlock features {{such as the ability}} to select a new character {{at the start of the}} game or the addition of new items and monsters in the procedural generation of the game's levels. Several roguelike-likes feature daily challenges, in which a preset random seed is used to generate the game's levels in a deterministic fashion so that each player will have the same encounters; players attempt to complete the game through those levels or otherwise get the highest score through online leaderboards. Roguelike-likes may also allow the player to enter the random seed directly as to be able to rechallenge the same set of levels or share a difficult set of levels with other players.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of drains that connect to the River Witham and that are {{protected}} by flood doors. These consist of a single pair of mitre gates <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to close if the level in the river rises above the level in the drain. Several of these are navigable to the more adventurous boater. The river is also joined by the Kyme Eau, which connects to the Sleaford Navigation on which navigation will eventually be restored to Sleaford. At Antons Gowt, a lock drops down into the Witham Navigable Drains, a system of drainage ditches which are used to prevent flooding of the fens to the north of Boston. Since November 2008 there has been an active campaign by the Billinghay Skirth Regeneration Society to restore navigation on the River Skirth, and the project has won the support of Billinghay and other parish councils, the Inland Waterways Association, the Environment Agency, Lincolnshire County Council and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} vacuum trains <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to remove trash {{off of the}} tracks, but are {{ineffective}} and often broken. A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country {{based on the number}} of viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan that will dramatically reduce the amount of trash on the tracks and in the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train delays. The frequency of station track cleaning will be increased. In a two-week period, 94 stations will be cleaned, an increase from 34 stations. Starting on September 12, 2016, the MTA launched an intensive two-week, system-wide cleaning from all of the tracks at all of the system's stations. New portable track vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 2018, and 27 new refuse cars will be part of the operation.|$|E
5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E

5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E
