5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|The hero, {{who comes}} from a land beyond Alefgard, is a {{descendant}} of the legendary Erdrick. When the hero arrives, he {{does not appear to}} be a warrior – he arrives without weapons or armor – and is ignorant of the situation. The populace <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> claim of the ability to defeat the Dragonlord are preposterous; however, King Lorik sees this ability, which give him hope and he aids the hero on his quest.|$|E
5|$|From stanzas 22 to 24, {{more details}} are given by Odin about Valhalla: the holy {{doors of the}} ancient gate Valgrind stand before Valhalla, Valhalla has five hundred and forty doors that eight hundred men can exit from at once (from which the einherjar will flow forth to engage the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarök). Within Valhalla exists Thor's hall Bilskirnir, and within it exist five hundred and forty rooms, {{and of all the}} halls within Valhalla, Odin states that he <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> son's may be greatest. In stanzas 25 through 26, Odin states that the goat Heiðrún and the hart Eikþyrnir stand on top of Valhalla and graze on the {{branches}} of the tree Læraðr. Heiðrún produces vats of mead that liquor cannot be compared to, and from Eikþyrnir's antlers drip liquid into the spring Hvergelmir from which flows forth all waters.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} synopsis {{for both}} films {{was published in}} The Moving Picture World on January 14, 1911. The first film, Everybody Saves Father is focused on Jennie Gear, a young woman whose affections are sought by many men. Jennie's father <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> daughter is {{too young to be}} married and drives off four of her suitors. One of the men, John, concocts a plan to save his life to win the man's approval. The plan is heard by another suitor, George, who decides to hire a rowboat to save the old man himself. This is over heard by George who concocts his own rescue to foil George. The plans go through without failure as each successive suitor's plan works to the actions of the other, and Henry wins the approval of Jennie's father. However, Jennie had already married Bill in the mean time.|$|E
25|$|The {{captain of}} the batting side may declare an innings closed, when the ball is dead, {{at any time during}} a match.

25|$|In the Spring of 1864, the Confederate {{government}} did send agents to Canada to plan prison escape attempts and {{attacks in the}} North. One of the agents, Captain Thomas Hines, did believe he could raise a force of about 5,000 Confederate sympathizers in Chicago to free the prisoners from Camp Douglas. On the other hand, no evidence of elementary planning of the details for the assault has been found for the period before Hines began to plan the operation in mid–August 1864. He soon found that he had only 25 untrained volunteers for the difficult mission. He apparently gave up on the scheme as the Democratic convention in Chicago, {{which was supposed to}} provide volunteers and cover for execution of the plan, ended at the end of August. Sweet kept the tale alive, however, and told superiors he was about to crush a dangerous uprising. As Sweet made no effort to prevent the 196th Pennsylvania Infantry from leaving the camp 11 days earlier, Levy <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> report to superiors was self-serving.|$|E

25|$|At the {{railroad}} tracks, Chanie {{turns in the}} direction away from the school and toward where he <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> home will be. When it is dark, he decides to sleep next to a beaver pond, lighting a small fire with the matches {{given to him by}} the girl. However, the fire gives him little to no protection against the extremely cold temperatures that night. He ends up dreaming about the sexual abuse he experienced at the hands of one of his teachers. Back on the tracks, Chanie continues to slowly make his way on his journey, weakened from exhaustion and exposure. He falls a number of times before finally succumbing to the cold. After his death, a mother lynx lifts Chanie’s spirit and carries him into the forest, away from the tracks. In the morning an engineer comes across Chanie's frozen body by the tracks and notifies the authorities. The story ends with Chanie, warm and happy, dancing in the forest with all of the animals featured throughout the novel.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later, the Krusty Krab's {{business}} quickly dwindles {{due to the}} highway. Believing {{that no one will}} come to the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs decides to finally give Plankton the Krabby Patty formula. Mere seconds before he does, however, the jellyfish from Jellyfish Fields invade Bikini Bottom and start attacking civilians. Seeing {{this as an opportunity to}} demolish the highway, SpongeBob makes an appeal to the people, who agree to destroy it. Everybody in Bikini Bottom turns against Plankton and destroys the pavement and the columns of the highway. [...] Plankton, who <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> highway is unremovable, tries to save it but gets run over. [...] Jellyfish Fields is restored instantly to its natural state.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Alanna Nash {{also gave}} the album {{positive}} feedback, viewing the album to have [...] "enough boiling rhythms and brooding melodies {{to reflect the}} anger and disillusionment {{of the middle class}} in the '90s", calling the track [...] "She <b>Thinks</b> <b>His</b> Name Was John" [...] to be the best example of that idea. The song was eventually spawned as a single and was considered controversial for its storyline, which described a woman who contracts AIDS from a one-night stand. Due to its subject matter, the song garnered less of a response from radio and peaked at No. 15. Read My Mind became another major seller for McEntire and her label, selling three million copies by 1995 and certifying at 3× Multi-Platinum from the RIAA.|$|E

Mulder grabs [...] "Scully" [...] and kisses her, [...] "in case they never meet again". [...] "Scully" [...] punches him, and he jumps overboard. Mulder wakes up in 1998 in a hospital, {{surrounded}} by Scully, the Lone Gunmen and Skinner. Mulder attempts to tell them that he traveled to 1939, and of his encounter with Nazis, and tells Scully that she was there with him, but they all think he is delirious. After Skinner and the Gunmen leave, Mulder calls Scully back and tells her that he loves her. Scully <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> confession is an effect of the drugs he has been given, rolls her eyes and leaves. As he lies down, Mulder winces as his cheek touches the pillow; the spot where [...] "Scully" [...] punched him in 1939 is still sore and visibly bruised. Mulder feels his eye-socket and breaks into a knowing smile, as the screen fades to black.|$|E
500|$|In the Japanese {{version of}} Fullmetal Alchemists anime adaptations, Edward has been voiced by Romi Park. In the English version, the role has been played by Vic Mignogna. Mignogna {{has stated that}} {{performing}} Edward may be his biggest voice acting achievement since fans do not compare him with Park, noting that their voices are not similar {{and that he did}} not plan to sound like her. Additionally, in the upcoming live-action of the series, Edward will be portrayed by Ryosuke Yamada. Yamada <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> short starture might be work as an advantage due to one of Edward's most common characteristics is his low height. Studying Arakawa's manga, Yamada tried imitating Edward's other signature actions such the way he runs. A fan of the series, the actor expressed happiness with the role he was given. Nevertheless, in Anime Expo 2017 if anything from him looked [...] "weird" [...] which resulted in praise from the audience. During questions, Yamada said {{that one of the most}} difficult scenes about his acting is interacting with Alphonse as a result of the latter being CGI. As a result, in the shooting of some scenes the staff had a person in Alphonse's place [...] so that Yamada had a better way to act.|$|E
500|$|In New York, Michael and Dwight locate Ryan after {{discovering}} which club Ryan frequents; Ryan is {{thrilled to see}} them but appears {{to be under the}} influence of drugs though Michael and Dwight do not notice. Later, Michael, Dwight, Ryan and Ryan's colleague, Troy Underbridge (Noel Petok) (who Dwight is certain is a Hobbit due to his short stature) wait outside another club, but fail to get in because they do not have dates. Dwight comes to the rescue when he manages to pair each of them with members of a women's basketball team, who are also waiting in line. Inside the club, Ryan's dancing becomes erratic and aggressive, and he accidentally hits a girl, prompting her friends to attack Ryan. Dwight and Michael escort him out of the club, and after Troy advises them not to take Ryan to a hospital, he runs off. Michael and Dwight bring Ryan back to his apartment, where he tells them that he <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> [...] "friend Troy" [...] has a drug problem, and asks what he should do about it. Michael, oblivious to the fact that Ryan is obviously referring to his own drug addiction, gives him hypothetical advice involving a wiretap and snitching on a drug dealer. [...] He then tells the camera that he has been watching The Wire but does not understand {{what is going on in}} the show.|$|E

500|$|Jack {{is delighted}} when he <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> mother, Colleen, {{is unable to}} visit him for the {{holidays}} due to her flight from Florida being grounded by Hurricane Zapato. Unexpectedly, Colleen arrives because {{she was able to}} travel by bus to Atlanta and get a flight from there. Also arriving at 30 Rockefeller Plaza is Liz's family, including her brother Mitch who has [...] "Trauma Induced Nivea Aphasia" [...] which means that his memory is stuck on December 7, 1985, and he believes that he is still 17 years old, when he is actually 40. Jack's mother immediately dislikes the Lemons due to their constant optimism and happiness. Colleen sets out to show Jack that they're just as screwed up as their relationship is. Jack, Colleen and the Lemons spend the day together and eventually end up going to dinner with each other. At the dinner, Colleen comments that it appears that Liz is the [...] "favorite" [...] child leading Mitch to reveal that his parents, Dick and Margaret, took him to see The Goonies in 1985 when they should have been watching Liz at her football game. Liz then gets into in argument with her parents, culminating in her accidentally revealing to Mitch that he is in fact 40 years old. The Lemons then spiral into a drunken fight, unknowingly falling for Colleen's plan.|$|E
500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E
500|$|Darryl <b>thinks</b> <b>his</b> {{popularity}} {{with the staff}} will make him a shoo-in, so he thinks {{he does not have}} to do an interview like everyone else. He is caught off-guard when he actually must do an interview and they ask for his resume. Darryl writes up an overly extensive four-page resume, which Jo quickly derides, though Jim encourages Darryl by saying that the interview and resume are mere formalities for him. When Andy interviews for the manager position, Gabe hijacks the meeting in an attempt to sabotage him by asking random trivia questions, which Andy successfully parries, but Gabe ends up screaming at him and acting like a lunatic. Gabe is also dismissive of Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) during her interview, saying she is not a [...] "real candidate". Kelly exacts revenge by telling Jo about Gabe's relationship with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and his harassing behavior after their breakup. In response, Jo sends Gabe back to Sabre's Florida headquarters, and installs Kelly in Gabe's position on the search committee. Kelly then says she has accepted Dwight's bribery and looks forward to the benefits of his return to the manager's chair, as Toby haltingly says they could give Dwight another trial run and Jim looks on in horror. After Phyllis tells Jim that Kelly and Dwight have pre-fired her, Jim tells Dwight he is not and will not be the manager, and the office begins arguing about who will be selected. When the discussion gets out of control, with Ryan (B. J. Novak) preferring a homeless man, Andy declaring he wants the job, and Darryl's daughter Jada asking out loud if Jim is the guy making him manager, Jim cuts it short and brings the committee back to the conference room to make up their minds.|$|E
