50|$|A {{class rating}} is an {{allowance}} {{to fly a}} certain group of aircraft that require training common to all aircraft within the group. A <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> is specified if a particular aircraft requires additional specialized training {{beyond the scope of}} initial license and aircraft class training. What aircraft require a <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> is decided by the local aviation authority. Almost all single engine piston (SEP) or multi engine piston (MEP) single pilot aircraft can be flown without a <b>type</b> <b>rating,</b> but are covered by a class rating instead. An exception to this under European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations is the piston version of the Piper Malibu.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 2006, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States {{requires}} co-pilots (second-in-command, or SIC) {{to have a}} 'SIC Type Rating' {{for aircraft}} requiring a crew of two, and otherwise requires a <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> to act as pilot-in-command (PIC) to fly internationally, or over international airspace. This is {{in order to remain}} compliant with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This is outlined in Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 ยง61.55 (14 CFR 61.55). Such a <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> is not required for operations completely within the United States. Obtaining a SIC Type Ratings is significantly less rigorous than obtaining a 'full' or Pilot in command (PIC) <b>type</b> <b>rating.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> is a {{regulating}} agency's {{certification of}} an airplane pilot to fly a certain aircraft type that requires additional training {{beyond the scope of}} the initial license and aircraft class training. What aircraft require a <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> is decided by the local aviation authority. In many countries pilots of single-engined aircraft under a certain maximum weight (5,700 kg or 12,500 lb, typically) do not require a <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> for each model, all or most such aircraft being covered by one class rating instead. There are exceptions to this, e.g. under Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) regulations the piston version of the Piper Malibu does require its own <b>type</b> <b>rating.</b> In New Zealand and South Africa there is no class rating, each aircraft model requiring its own rating. Countries which have adopted the class rating system for small aircraft typically require additional training and license endorsement for complexity features such as conventional undercarriage (tailwheels), variable-pitch propellers, retractable undercarriage, etc.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{aircraft}} weighs over 12,500 pounds, pilots of civilian US-registered Albatross aircraft {{must have a}} type rating. There is a yearly Albatross fly-in at Boulder City, Nevada where Albatross pilots can become <b>type</b> <b>rated.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to complete the <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> and line training without having employment. Some agencies and FTOs will charge you to put you through your <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> and place you with an airline to operate as a First Officer until completion of your line training. You would receive no salary during hours-building, so arguably you are paying the airline to work for them.|$|R
5000|$|The FAA may impose {{limitations}} on a pilot certificate if, during training or the practical test, the pilot does not demonstrate all {{skills necessary to}} exercise all privileges of a privilege level, category, class or <b>type</b> <b>rating.</b> For example, a holder of a DC-3 <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> who does not demonstrate instrument flying skills during the practical test would be assigned a limitation reading, [...] "DC-3 (VFR Only)".|$|R
