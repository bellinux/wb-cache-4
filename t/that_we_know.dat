5|$|Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century Eastern Roman monk {{and former}} {{merchant}} {{who wrote the}} Christian Topography (describing the Indian Ocean trade leading {{all the way to}} China), visited the Aksumite port city of Adulis and included eyewitness accounts of it in his book. He copied a Greek inscription detailing the reign of an early 3rd-century polytheistic ruler of Aksum who sent a naval fleet across the Red Sea to conquer the Sabaeans in what is now Yemen, along with other parts of western Arabia. Ancient Sabaean texts from Yemen confirm that this was the Aksumite ruler Gadara, who made alliances with Sabaean kings, leading to eventual Axumite control over western Yemen that would last until the Himyarite ruler Shammar Yahri'sh (r. c. 265 – c. 287) expelled the Aksumites from southwestern Arabia. It is only from Sabaean and Himyarite inscriptions <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> the names of several Aksumite kings and princes after Gadara, including the monarchs `DBH and DTWNS. Inscriptions of king Ezana mention stone-carved thrones near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum (the platforms of which still exist), and Cosmas described a white-marble throne and stele in Adulis that were both covered in Greek inscriptions.|$|E

50|$|Schopenhauer {{disagreed}} with Kant's critics {{and stated that}} it is absurd to assume that phenomena have no basis. Schopenhauer proposed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot <b>know</b> the thing in itself as {{though it is a}} cause of phenomena.

25|$|The {{origins of}} Hadaka Matsuri date back 500 years when worshippers competed to receive paper talismans called Go-o thrown by the priest. These paper talismans were tokens of the {{completion}} of New Year ascetic training by the priests. As those people receiving these paper talismans had good things happen to them, {{the number of people}} requesting them increased year by year. However, as paper is easily destroyed, the talismans were changed to the wooden ofuda <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> today.|$|E

When he comes he rests on Mount Kenya and four other sacred mountains. Thunder is interpreted to be the movement of God, and lightning is God's weapon by means of which he clears the way when moving from one sacred place to another.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the following claims, rationalists often adopt similar stances on other aspects of philosophy. Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable a priori. Naturally, when you claim some truths are innately known to us, one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.|$|E
25|$|The first ajaw, or king, of B'aakal <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> of was K'uk Balam (Quetzal Jaguar), who governed {{for four}} years {{starting}} in the year 431. After him, a king came to power, nicknamed Casper by archaeologists. The next two kings were probably Caspers sons. Little was known about the first of these, B'utz Aj Sak Chiik, until 1994, when a tablet was found describing a ritual for the king. The first tablet mentioned his successor Ahkal Mo' Naab I as a teenage prince, and therefore {{it is believed that}} there was a family relation between them. For unknown reasons, Akhal Mo' Naab I had great prestige, so the kings who succeeded him were proud to be his descendants.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} Pyramid is {{interpreted}} by Alford as a network of secret chambers in which religious relics were concealed– hence {{the title of his}} book Pyramid of Secrets. This is the weakest part of his case, as the textual support for the idea is thin {{and there is no way}} of knowing what might have been contained in the chambers <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> of today. Once again, Alford’s theory can be proven or negated by future exploration, since it is central to his case that further secret chambers exist. In this regard, his thoughts are guided by the scholar J.P. Lepre, who claimed that anomalous patterns in the Pyramid’s masonry joints might be signs to the existence of hidden passages and chambers.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{deemed it}} obvious {{that we have}} some {{objective}} knowledge of the world, such as, say, Newtonian physics. But this knowledge relies on synthetic, a priori laws of nature, like causality and substance. The problem, then, is how this is possible. Kant's solution was to reason that the subject must supply laws that make experience of objects possible, and that these laws are the synthetic, a priori laws of nature <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> apply to all objects before we experience them. So, to deduce all these laws, Kant examined experience in general, dissecting in it what is supplied by the mind from what is supplied by the given intuitions. What has just been explicated is commonly called a transcendental deduction.|$|E
25|$|Javanese {{people are}} {{descendant}} from Austronesian peoples. Temple relief in 9th-century Borobudur shows Javanese houses that were archetype of Austronesian houses: pile foundations, pitched roofs and an extended roof ridge. While these reliefs suggest houses on piles were in common use from the 9th to 12th centuries, between the 13th and 14th century the preferred Javanese style (east and central Java) {{was to build}} on the ground with a raised floor, the form of Javanese house <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> today. This new form resembles the vernacular architecture of eastern Indonesia such as Balinese and Sumbanese houses. Excavations at Trowulan (East Java), the probable site of Majapahit's capital in the 14th century, have uncovered remains of dwellings with permanent materials such as brick floors, foundations for walls and tile roofs.|$|E
25|$|The Odonata (dragonflies) {{are also}} a good {{candidate}} as the oldest living member of the Pterygota. Mayflies are morphologically and physiologically more basal, but the derived characteristics of dragonflies could have evolved independently in their own direction for a long time. It seems that orders with aquatic nymphs or larvae become evolutionarily conservative once they had adapted to water. If mayflies {{made it to the}} water first, this could partly explain why they are more primitive than dragonflies, even if dragonflies have an older origin. Similarly, stoneflies retain the most basal traits of the Neoptera, but they were not necessarily the first order to branch off. This also makes it less likely that an aquatic ancestor would have the evolutionary potential to give rise to all the different forms and species of insects <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> today.|$|E

25|$|The famous {{structures}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> today probably {{represent a}} rebuilding effort {{in response to}} the attacks by the city of Calakmul and its client states in 599 and 611. One of the main figures responsible for rebuilding Palenque and for a renaissance in the city's art and architecture {{is also one of the}} best-known Maya Ajaw, K'inich Janaab' Pakal (Pacal the Great), who ruled from 615 to 683. He is best known through his funerary monument, dubbed the Temple of Inscriptions after the lengthy text preserved in the temple's superstructure. At the time Alberto Ruz Lhuillier excavated Pakal's tomb it was the richest and best preserved of any scientifically excavated burial then known from the ancient Americas. It held this position until the discovery of the rich Moche burials at Sipan, Peru and the recent discoveries at Copan and Calakmul.|$|E
25|$|Mainly {{known for}} his writings, Vitruvius was himself an architect. In Roman times {{architecture}} was a broader subject than at present including the modern fields of architecture, construction management, construction engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, materials engineering, mechanical engineering, military engineering and urban planning; architectural engineers consider him the first of their discipline, a specialization previously known as technical architecture. Frontinus mentions him {{in connection with the}} standard sizes of pipes. He is often credited as father of architectural acoustics for describing the technique of echeas placement in theaters. The only building, however, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> Vitruvius to have worked on is one he tells us about, a basilica completed in 19 BC. It was built at Fanum Fortunae, now the modern town of Fano. The Basilica di Fano (to give the building its Italian name) has disappeared so completely that its very site is a matter of conjecture, although various {{attempts have been made to}} visualise it. The early Christian practice of converting Roman basilicae (public buildings) into cathedrals implies the basilica may be incorporated into the cathedral located in Fano.|$|E
