5|$|On 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was {{recalled}} {{to court}} to attend {{the final stages of}} Mary's apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen. If, on the other hand, Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. When it became clear that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a child. Elizabeth's succession seemed assured.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{precautions}} against further resistance, Darius sent {{soldiers to}} seize Intaphernes, {{along with his}} son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, {{but when he was}} brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> another husband and another son, but she would always have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Serah is {{the only}} one who remembers Lightning being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She {{eventually}} becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E

She gets on Erica's computer and sees a picture of Kendall on a boat and so she goes to find her.

Greenlee accuses Kendall of doing it on purpose so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> Ryan.|$|E
25|$|In 1814, after Napoleon's defeat, nobility from {{throughout}} Europe attended celebrations in London, but Caroline was excluded. George's {{relationship with his}} daughter was also deteriorating, as Charlotte sought greater freedom from her father's strictures. On 12 July, he informed Charlotte that she would henceforth be confined at Cranbourne Lodge, Windsor, that her household would be replaced, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> no visitors except her grandmother, Queen Charlotte, once a week. Horrified, Charlotte ran away to her mother's house in Bayswater. After an anxious night, Charlotte was eventually persuaded {{to return to her}} father by Brougham, since legally she could be placed in her father's care and there was a danger of public disorder against George, which might prejudice Charlotte's position if she continued to disobey him.|$|E
25|$|Midna has {{received}} mostly positive reception {{from both the}} video game press and the public {{for her role in}} Twilight Princess. Game Informer editor Andrew Reiner stated that she, along with Link's wolf transformation, had incredible effects on Twilight Princess gameplay. Fellow Game Informer editor Billy Berghammer stated that he loved Midna, describing her as a cool character due to how she messed with Link throughout the game. 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that the supporting characters of Twilight Princess make up for Link's laconic nature, Midna more so than others. He described her as being acerbic and thoughtful, as well as an intricate character who moves the plot forward for her own means. While America's Intelligence Wire editor Dave Arey described her as intriguing, he felt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been more so if Nintendo had developed her further. GamesRadar listed her as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that before Midna, the only characters they could relate to were Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon. RPGamer editor Matthew Rickert stated that he found nothing intriguing or likable about her, complaining about how much more plot time she receives in spite of this, arguing that she offers little help to Link and that it felt like she had replaced Zelda in Twilight Princess.|$|E

They explored the guess that the family of the child could be unaware of her death. Another explanation for why no matches were achieved was <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> belonged to an [...] "undocumented" [...] family. Police were focused on investigating in the local community, yet they believed it possible that the girl was not from the area and continued to search through various cases of missing children.|$|E

Bardwell discovered a ring that she had mentioned she liked, at which point Roy entered the room with their son and said, [...] "BJ wants to know if you will marry his daddy".

500|$|Napravnik's {{success has}} come in a sport where only 10% of all jockeys are women, {{even though they have}} been {{licensed}} as jockeys in pari-mutuel races since 1969. She initially was uncomfortable finding herself viewed as a role model for girls, preferring to simply be noticed as a top jockey. She became aware <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a positive impact on others and that helped her be more comfortable with her prominence. [...] She still prefers to emphasize her riding prowess, and stated in 2014, [...] "If you show your work ethic and professionalism and obvious skill and ability, that is what is going to win somebody over." ...|$|E

[...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, and I go, 'Can you just do one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{recognizes that}} there are fictional aspects to all her books, {{although}} there is less fictionalization in Traveling Shoes than in her previous autobiographies. [...] Her approach parallels the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the abolitionist period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection. [...] Hagen places Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but insists that Angelou has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form. [...] Journalist George Plimpton asked her in a 1998 interview if she changed the truth to improve her story; she stated, [...] "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite {{of three or four}} people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about". [...] Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she fictionalizes them to make an impact and to enhance her readers' interest. [...] Angelou's long-time editor, Robert Loomis stated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> rewritten any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader.|$|E

For her stepfather, they noted his and Ashley's tumultuous relationship and how they did not get along with each other. Castor's mother believed her granddaughter Ashley to be guilty.
