Bunchgrasses in the park include basin wildrye, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, among others. Native grasses that form sod in parts of the monument include Sandberg's bluegrass and other bluegrass species. Reed canary grass, if mowed, also forms sod along stream banks.|$|E

5000|$|Some 21st-century phylogenetic {{analyses}} indicate some {{quite different}} lineages. Mainly, the earlier authors {{seem to have}} overlumped the snapdragon-like forms (including <b>toadflaxes)</b> which actually {{do not seem to}} be closely related, while overemphasizing the morphological diversity of the true snapdragon relatives. As early as 1982, Speta had realized that the typical <b>toadflaxes</b> (including Nuttallanthus) were a lineage well apart from the snapdragons and similar genera, and established the Antirrhininae for the latter. In 2000, combining internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and morphological data from 16 genera, Ghebrehiwet et al confirmed Rothmaler's proposal of a close relationship between the fairly dissimilar-looking Maurandya and Rhodochiton and the distinctness of their lineage from the bulk of the subfamily. However, they found the [...] "Linarieae" [...] hard to resolve, but could already tell that Kickxia should be moved to the Anarrhinae, and Asarina and Cymbalaria to the Maurandyinae. In addition, Mohavea was recognized as a snapdragon relative with extremely modified flowers, refuting a monotypic Mohaveinae.

40|$|Background: Due to its complex, {{dynamic and}} {{well-known}} paleogeography, the Mediterranean region provides an ideal framework {{to study the}} colonization history of plant lineages. The genus Linaria has its diversity centre in the Mediterranean region, both in Europe and Africa. The last land connection between both continental plates occurred during the Messinian Salinity Crisis, in the late Miocene (5. 96 to 5. 33 Ma). Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed the colonization history of Linaria sect. Versicolores (bifid <b>toadflaxes),</b> which includes c. 22 species distributed across the Mediterranean, including Europe and Africa. Two cpDNA regions (rpl 32 -trnL UAG and trnK-matK) were sequenced from 66 samples of Linaria. We conducted phylogenetic, dating, biogeographic and phylogeographic analyses to reconstruct colonization patterns in space and time. Four major clades were found: two of them exclusively contain Iberian samples, while the other two include northern African samples together with some European samples. The bifid <b>toadflaxes</b> have been split in African and European clades since the late Miocene, and most lineage and speciation differentiation occurred during the Pliocene and Quaternary. We have strongly inferred four events of post-Messinian colonization following long-distance dispersal from northern Africa to the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily and Greece. Conclusions/Significance: The current distribution of Linaria sect. Versicolores lineages is explained by both ancien...|$|R

50|$|The most {{striking}} {{difference between the}} 2004 and 2013 results is the precisely inverted placement of Galvezia and Gambelia (one as core of a distinct clade, the other close to Antirrhinum {{as part of the}} Sairocarpus complex). Given the highly similar datasets and analyses, a clerical error confusing the two generic names might be suspected, but considering that the 2013 study included two species of each genus which congruently resolved as sister taxa, hybrid introgression, or a disparity between nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (ndhF) evolution or some other divergence seems a more likely cause. The erratic behavior of the two genera was noted by Vargas et al but not discussed in Fernández-Mazuecos et al.; adding to the confusion, Ghebrehiwet et al found a strongly supported Galvezia fruticosa-Gambelia speciosa clade excluding Pseudorontium and Schweinfurthia and equidistant from the true snapdragons and <b>toadflaxes,</b> entirely in line with Rothmaler's Gambeliinae. Furthermore, several species were historically moved between the two genera without authors noting anything suggesting against a very close relationship between them.|$|R
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Nectar spurs (tubular outgrowths of a floral organ which contain or give the {{appearance}} of containing nectar) are hypothesized to be a ‘key innovation’ which can lead to rapid speciation within a lineage, because they are involved in pollinator specificity. Despite the ecological importance of nectar spurs, relatively little is known about their development. We used a comparative approach to investigate variation in nectar spur length in a clade of eight Iberian <b>toadflaxes.</b> Methods Spur growth was measured at the macroscopic level over time in all eight species, and growth rate and growth duration compared. Evolution of growth rate was reconstructed across the phylogeny. Within the clade we then focused on Linaria becerrae and Linaria clementei, a pair of sister species which have extremely long and short spurs, respectively. Characterisation at a micromorphological level was performed across a range of key developmental stages to determine whether the difference in spur length is due to differential cell expansion or cell division. Key results We detected {{a significant difference in the}} evolved growth rates, while developmental timing of both the initiation and the end of spur growth remained similar. Cell number is 3 times higher in the long spurred Linaria becerrae compared to Linaria clementei, whereas cell length is only 1. 3 times greater. In addition, overall anisotropy of mature cells is not significantly different between the two species. Conclusions We found that changes in cell number and therefore in cell division largely explain evolution of spur length. This contrasts with previous studies in Aquilegia which have found that variation in nectar spur length is due to directed cell expansion (anisotropy) over variable timeframes. Our study adds to knowledge about nectar spur development in a comparative context and indicates that different systems may have evolved nectar spurs using disparate mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Drought is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} for South Dakota beef producers. The variation in weed control that ranchers need to manage for is the intensity and duration of the rainfall shortages. The common problem however, {{is what happens when}} grass and forbs become stressed and the changes to the vegetation that occurs. Stresses or disturbances that cause the grasses to slow growth and open up bare areas can include several situations; over grazing, flooding, wild fires, severe hail, growing season freeze, soil disturbances (prairie dogs or pocket gophers), and drought. Weeds are very opportunistic and competitive and will readily invade bare areas of ground that are created by these conditions. Once established weeds will aggressively compete for light, nutrients, moisture and space. This will allow for quick weed establishment and when more favorable conditions occur, weeds will spread to new areas and weed densities will increase. Weeds can be divided into three growth categories; 1. Annuals, 2. Biennials, and 3. Perennials. Within these groups they can further be categorized as cool season or warm season plants or as a broadleaf, grass or sedge plants. The plants we tend to be more concerned with during or following drought are the broadleaf weeds. The broadleaf weeds that cause the biggest problems are those introduced or invasive plants that have gotten a foothold here. In South Dakota the invasive weeds of major emphasis for grasslands include Canada thistle, leafy spurge, hoary cress, the knapweeds, biennial thistles (musk, plumeless, bull and scotch), the <b>toadflaxes,</b> field bindweed, absinth wormwood and common mullein. All of these and others are on South Dakota’s state wide and locally noxious lists. They are considered regulated pests in the state. Another group of plants that can take advantage of drought and become a problem in range settings is some native forbs like the vervains, common sunflower, horseweed or marestail, golden rod family, perennial ragweed and cudweed sagewort. In normal conditions these plants are not considered invasive. They can have good forage value at certain growth stages. This can reduce grazing pressure on desirable grass species recovering form drought...|$|R
