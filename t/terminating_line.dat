6000|$|This rival balloon was {{constructed}} by a Frenchman named De Moret, who, having succeeded in attracting a concourse of fifty or sixty thousand {{people to see}} his ascent, failed in the primary part of his undertaking,--that of filling his balloon. The people, after waiting patiently for three hours, and supposing [...] "the whole affair an imposture, rushed in and tore it to pieces." [...] In consequence of this failure, and the riots with which it was followed, the Governor forbade Signor Lunardi to make his ascent from Chelsea Hospital grounds. He writes again to his friend, [...] "The national prejudice of the English against France {{is supposed to have}} its full effect on a subject, from which the literati of England expect to derive but little honour. An unsuccessful attempt has been made by a Frenchman, and my name being that of a foreigner, a very excusable ignorance in the people may place me among the adventurers of that nation, who are said to have sometimes distinguished themselves here by ingenious impositions." [...] In vain did he try to obtain another place to launch his aerial ship; he was laughed at and ridiculed as an impostor, and the colleague of De Moret. At length, after much exertion, he obtained leave to ascend from the ground of the Honourable Artillery Company. By twelve o'clock on the day fixed for the ascension, an immense mass of people had assembled, including the Prince of Wales. The filling of the balloon caused some delay, but, {{in order to keep the}} patience of the populace within control, it was only partially filled. At five minutes past two the balloon ascended amid the loud acclamations of the assembled multitudes, and Signor Lunardi had proved himself no impostor. He writes to his friend, [...] "The stillness, extent, and magnificence of the scene rendered it highly awful. My horizon seemed a perfect circle, the <b>terminating</b> <b>line</b> several hundred miles in circumference; this I conjectured from the view of London, the extreme points of which formed an angle only a few degrees. It was so reduced on the great scale before me that I can find no simile to convey an idea of it. I could distinguish Saint Paul's and other churches from the houses; I saw the streets as lines, all animated with beings whom I knew to be men and women, but which otherwise I should have had a difficulty in describing. It was an enormous bee-hive, but the industry of it was suspended. All the moving mass seemed to have no object but myself, and the transition from the suspicion, perhaps contempt, of the preceding hour, to the affectionate transport, admiration, and glory of the present moment, was not without its effect on my mind. It seemed as if I had left below all the cares and passions that molest mankind. I had not the slightest sense of motion in the machine; I knew not whether it went swiftly or slowly, whether it ascended or descended, whether it was agitated or tranquil, but by the appearance or disappearance of objects on the earth. The height had not the effect which a much less degree of it has near the earth, that of producing giddiness. The gradual diminution of objects, and the masses of light and shade, are intelligible in oblique and common prospects, but here everything wore a new appearance and had a new effect. The face of the country had a mild and permanent verdure, to which Italy is a stranger. The variety of cultivation and the accuracy with which property is divided give the idea, ever present to the stranger in England, of good civil laws and an equitable administration. The rivulets meandering; the immense districts beneath me spotted with cities, towns, villages, and houses, pouring out their inhabitants to hail my appearance. You will allow me some merit in not having been exceedingly intoxicated with my situation." [...] He descended at North Mimms about half-past three-o'clock, but wishing to obtain a second triumph, he threw out the remainder of his ballast and provisions, landed a cat which he had taken up with him, and which had suffered severely from the cold, and again ascended to the regions above. This time his ascent was more rapid, the thermometer quickly fell to 29 degrees, and icicles were soon formed all round his machine. He descended at twenty minutes past four near Ware in Hertfordshire, and the balloon being properly secured, the gas was let out and [...] "nearly poisoned the whole neighbourhood by the disagreeable stench emitted." [...] The success and triumph of this first attempt in aerial navigation in English air exceeded Signor Lunardi's utmost expectations. Everywhere he was received with marks of approbation, and treated as a hero. [...] "My fame," [...] he writes, [...] "has not been sparingly diffused by the newspapers (which in England are the barometers of public opinion; often erroneous, as other instruments are, in their particular information, but yielding the best that can be obtained). You will imagine the importance of these vehicles of knowledge when you learn that in London alone there are printed no less than 160,000 papers weekly, which, by a stamp on each paper, and a duty on advertisements, brings into the treasury of the nation upwards of 80,000 pounds a year. They are to the English constitution what the Censors were to those of ancient Rome. Ministers of State are checked and kept in awe by them, and they freely, and often judiciously, expose the pretensions of those who would harass Government merely to be taken into its service." ...|$|E

The 135m-long bay platform {{was completed in}} 2016 and is intended to relieve congestion at Manchester Victoria, where terminating trains would occupy the through platforms; numerous services now will continue on to Rochdale as opposed to terminating at Victoria.

5000|$|In 1929, local {{real estate}} agents {{promoted}} land sales along the railway line at Epping {{in preparation for the}} construction of the line. They called the area [...] "Epping Junction", on account of the station being a junction between the Epping-St Leonards Line and the Main Northern Line. A new island platform was also built in preparation for the terminus of the new line. The track was {{to be in the middle}} of the two Main Northern Line platforms, and until the 1970s still existed as a <b>terminating</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Warringah Shire {{initiated}} {{a process of}} electrifying the area, and {{the completion of the}} electricity supply and street-lighting of the area was officially marked on 29 March 1923 by Shire President Arthur George Parr. A tramline was established through the south-eastern area of the shire, running along Pittwater Road from Manly Lagoon eventually stretching {{all the way to the}} tramshed at Narrabeen in December 1913, with a later additional <b>terminating</b> <b>line</b> through Harbord to Freshwater Beach. This, coupled with the opening of the Spit and Roseville bridges in 1924 led to increased interest and travel to the area, which increased even further with the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. Early subdivisions were usually given over for weekenders and holiday homes, and at the same time the surf clubs and rock pools on the beaches began to be developed. After World War II, urbanisation began to occur, with family homes beginning to be built in the area, especially near the beaches. Retail, light industry and improved public amenity soon followed. It was also around this time that the tram lines were progressively closed across Sydney, to give way to more lanes for motor vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2016, city {{planning}} staff proposed to eliminate {{two of the}} three stops along the planned Scarborough Subway Extension <b>terminating</b> <b>Line</b> 2 Bloor-Danforth at Scarborough Town Centre in order to free up funding for a proposed Crosstown East LRT line. The eliminated intermediate stops were at Lawrence Avenue and Sheppard Avenue. However, subsequently the cost estimate for the one-stop subway extension increased to $3.2 billion leaving the Crosstown East LRT unfunded. Given the rising cost for the subway extension and the loss of funding for the LRT line, a group of city councillors led by Josh Matlow reopened the subway versus LRT debate. Matlow proposed scrapping the one-stop subway extension in order to provide funding for 24 LRT stops on two LRT lines within Scarborough. TTC CEO Andy Byford said the cost of the LRT line following the SRT route may have risen to as high as $3 billion because of [...] "delays and redesign" [...] since 2013, but Brad Ross also of the TTC warned of [...] "caveats around numbers and assumptions" [...] associated with that estimate. After Council's vote, Byford admitted that the cost estimates for [...] "delays" [...] was unnecessary, which assumed the LRT's completion would be in 2026, the same date as the subway option. However, according to Michael Warren, a former TTC Chief General Manage, the LRT could have been completed in 2020 at a cost of $1.8 billion, an estimate not presented to City Council when it voted. There was also the issue whether there would be space for both expanded GO service and an LRT north of Kennedy station; however, Metrolinx subsequently denied there would be such a problem. On July 13, Toronto City Council voted down Matlow's proposal by a margin of roughly 2 to 1.|$|E
40|$|The Population Protocol {{model is}} a {{distributed}} model that concerns systems of very weak computational entities that cannot control the way they interact. The model of Network Constructors is a variant of Population Protocols capable of (algorithmically) constructing abstract networks. Both models are characterized by a fundamental inability to terminate. In this work, we investigate the minimal strengthenings of the latter that could overcome this inability. Our main conclusion is that initial connectivity of the communication topology combined with {{the ability of the}} protocol to transform the communication topology plus a few other local and realistic assumptions are sufficient to guarantee not only termination but also the maximum computational power that one can hope for in this family of models. The technique is to transform any initial connected topology to a less symmetric and detectable topology without ever breaking its connectivity during the transformation. The target topology of all of our transformers is the spanning line and we call <b>Terminating</b> <b>Line</b> Transformation the corresponding problem. We first study the case {{in which there is a}} pre-elected unique leader and give a time-optimal protocol for <b>Terminating</b> <b>Line</b> Transformation. We then prove that dropping the leader without additional assumptions leads to a strong impossibility result. In an attempt to overcome this, we equip the nodes with the ability to tell, during their pairwise interactions, whether they have at least one neighbor in common. Interestingly, it turns out that this local and realistic mechanism is sufficient to make the problem solvable. In particular, we give a very efficient protocol that solves <b>Terminating</b> <b>Line</b> Transformation when all nodes are initially identical. The latter implies that the model computes with termination any symmetric predicate computable by a Turing Machine of space Θ(n^ 2) ...|$|E
