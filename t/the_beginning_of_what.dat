5|$|The US Navy {{ended the}} Civil War with about fifty monitor-type coastal ironclads; by the 1870s {{most of these}} were laid up in reserve, leaving the USA {{virtually}} without an ironclad fleet. Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers. The 1890s saw <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> became the Great White Fleet, {{and it was the}} modern pre-Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish–American War of 1898. This started a new era of naval warfare.|$|E
5|$|With the {{feasibility}} of the route thus demonstrated, New Guinea Force decided to establish a line of communications to Wau via Bulldog. A platoon of the 1st Independent Company left Port Moresby in the schooner Royal Endeavour and traversed the route, joining {{the men of the}} New Guinea Volunteer Rifles holding the Wau area. This was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> became Kanga Force on 23 April 1942. On 22 May, the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron USAAF flew in commandos of the 2/5th Independent Company to join Kanga Force. The 2/7th Independent Company followed in October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Belgicas voyage marked <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{became known}} as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, and was rapidly {{followed}} by expeditions from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and France. However, on his return to Norway in 1899, Amundsen turned his attention northwards. Confident in his abilities to lead an expedition, he planned a traversal of the Northwest Passage, the then-uncharted sea route from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the labyrinth of north Canadian islands. Having earned his master's ticket, Amundsen acquired a small sloop, Gjøa, which he adapted for Arctic travel. He secured the patronage of King Oscar of Sweden and Norway, the support of Nansen, and sufficient financial backing to set out in June 1903 with a crew of six. The voyage lasted until 1906 and was wholly successful; the Northwest Passage, which defeated mariners for centuries, was finally conquered. At the age of 34 Amundsen became a national hero, in the first rank of polar explorers.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there had}} been many earlier laws enacted against Catholics in Ireland, the year 1695 marked <b>the</b> real <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> were called <b>the</b> Penal Laws.

We've bounced three college presidents and made three new ones in the record time of two hours. And that's just <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> going to happen." [...] The presidents of the University of Mississippi ("Ole Miss"), Mississippi A & M (later Mississippi State University), and the Mississippi State College for Women were all fired and {{replaced}}, respectively, by a realtor, a press agent, and a recent B.A. degree-recipient. The Dean of the Medical School at Ole Miss was replaced by [...] "a man who once had a course in dentistry." ...|$|R

25|$|Soon after Sabatier's work, a German chemist, Wilhelm Normann, {{found that}} {{catalytic}} hydrogenation {{could be used}} to convert unsaturated fatty acids or glycerides in the liquid phase into saturated ones.

25|$|Santa Barbara's {{aviation}} history {{began in}} 1914 when Lincoln J. Beachey flew an airplane across Goleta Valley. Two {{years later the}} Loughead brothers, who later changed their name to Lockheed, established a seaplane factory on State Street (Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company) and constructed a wooden ramp on West Beach to launch their planes. In 1928, Gordon Sackett and Royce Stetson landed a Hisso-powered airplane in a cow pasture near the corner of Hollister and Fairview Avenues {{and set up a}} flight school on the spot. That first airstrip marked <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was to become the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.|$|E
25|$|The Lombards {{remained}} {{a threat to}} papal power, however, until they were crushed by Charlemagne in 774. Charlemagne added the Kingdom of the Lombards to his vast realm. In recognition of Charlemagne's power, and to cement the church's alliance with him, Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III in 800. After Charlemagne's death in 814, his son Louis the Pious succeeded him. Louis divided the empire among his sons, who fought each other for territory. Such battles continued until Otto the Great, the king of Germany, was crowned emperor in 962. This marked <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> later was called the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratification}} of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States. This ushered in <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is known as the}} Gangster Era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when Prohibition was repealed. The 1920s saw gangsters, including Al Capone, Dion O'Banion, Bugs Moran and Tony Accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of Chicago during the Prohibition era. Chicago was the location of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929, when Al Capone sent men to gun down members of his rival gang, North Side, led by Bugs Moran.|$|E

25|$|The Byzantine Empire {{was one of}} {{the first}} empires to have flourishing medical establishments. Prior to the Byzantine Empire the Roman Empire had {{hospitals}} specifically for soldiers and slaves. However, none of these establishments were for the public. The hospitals in Byzantium were originally started by the church to act as a place for the poor to have access to basic amenities. Hospitals were usually separated between men and women. Although the remains of these hospitals have not been discovered by archaeologists, recordings of hospitals from the Byzantine Empire describe large buildings that had the core feature of an open hearth. The establishments of the Byzantine Empire resembled <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we now know as modern hospitals.|$|E
25|$|On the 21st Army Group's left, one {{corps of}} the Canadian 1st Army reached the North Sea near the Dutch-German border on 16 April, while another {{drove through the}} central Netherlands, {{trapping}} the German forces remaining in that country. However, concerned that the bypassed Germans would flood {{much of the nation}} and cause complete famine among a Dutch population already near starvation, General Eisenhower approved an agreement with the local enemy commanders to allow the Allies to air-drop food into the country in return for a local ceasefire on the battlefield. The ensuing airdrops, which began on 29 April, marked <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was to become a colossal effort to put war-torn Europe back together again.|$|E
25|$|Gikai's return marked <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is known}} as the sandai sōron, a schism that would split Dōgen's {{community}} into multiple competing factions. Because Gikai had an interest in architecture and had recorded temple constructions during his time in China, Ejō allowed him {{to take control of the}} ongoing building projects at Eihei-ji. In 1267, Ejō had become ill and decided to retire as abbot. He moved out of Eihei-ji to a nearby location, but continued to be considered the tōdōi, a rank for retired abbots. Two monks, Bussō and Dōson, are even said to have attained enlightenment under him during his stay outside the temple. At any rate, his health had improved within a short time of leaving Eihei-ji.|$|E
2500|$|Whether in Augustan Rome or modern Europe, {{democracy}} all {{too easily}} {{gave way to}} totalitarianism, technology was as readily used for battle as for comfort, and immense wealth lay alongside abysmal poverty.

50|$|During {{the days}} of the Brooke Administration, some semblances of the {{functions}} of the Council were performed by the Public Works Department. Sir Charles Vyner Brooke was installed as the Third Rajah on 22 July 1918. In 1921 the Kuching Sanitary and Municipal Advisory Board was formed. Following a new legislation, the Board became the Municipal Authority for Kuching on 1 January 1934 marking <b>the</b> early <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would in due course become the local authority for Kuching, known as the Kuching Municipal Board.|$|R
50|$|Sidney Slon {{had moved}} to New York, and was writing for CBS and NBC radio shows in the late 1930s.

25|$|In 1808 a British {{expeditionary force}} under John Moore arrived in Sweden, but {{after months of}} idleness {{departed}} for <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{became known as the}} Peninsular War. Had the king accepted the landing of 10,000 British troops in Skåne, where the expeditionary force had been authorized to disembark, it would have enabled the Swedes to release at least 10,000 trained soldiers for the Finnish War. As it happened, the bulk of the Swedish army, including the best units, were kept out of the Finnish War by the king, who reserved them for his plans for conquering either Sjælland or Norway. Swedish landings were invariably made with poorly equipped and trained forces, often with troops who had very low morale. Landings were further complicated by the Swedish Navy's failure to tightly block the coastal sea route past Hangö.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of a Provisional IRA ceasefire and <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> became known as the Peace Process during the 1990s, the {{official}} view of the Rising grew more positive and in 1996 an 80th anniversary commemoration at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin was attended by the Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, John Bruton. In 2005, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, announced the government's intention to resume the military parade past the GPO from Easter 2006, and to form a committee to plan centenary celebrations in 2016. The 90th anniversary was celebrated with a military parade in Dublin on Easter Sunday, 2006, attended by the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach and the Lord Mayor of Dublin. There is now an annual ceremony at Easter attended by relatives of those who fought, by the President, the Taoiseach, ministers, senators and TDs, and by usually large and respectful crowds.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, the Syrian army {{intervened in}} the Lebanese civil war {{to ensure that}} the status quo was maintained, and the Maronite Christians {{remained}} in power. This was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{turned out to be a}} thirty-year Syrian military occupation. Many crimes in Lebanon, including the accused assassinations of Rafik Hariri, Kamal Jumblat and Bachir Gemayel were attributed to the Syrian forces and intelligence services although were not proven to this day. In 1981 Israel declared its annexation of the Golan Heights. The following year, Israel invaded Lebanon and attacked the Syrian army, forcing it to withdraw from several areas. When Lebanon and Israel announced the end of hostilities in 1983, Syrian forces remained in Lebanon. Through extensive use of proxy militias, Syria attempted to stop Israel from taking over southern Lebanon. Assad sent troops into Lebanon for a second time in 1987 to enforce a ceasefire in Beirut.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} hydrogenation {{is that of}} platinum catalyzed {{addition of}} hydrogen to oxygen in the Döbereiner's lamp, a device commercialized as early as 1823. The French chemist Paul Sabatier is considered {{the father of the}} hydrogenation process. In 1897, building on the earlier work of James Boyce, an American chemist working in the manufacture of soap products, he discovered that traces of nickel catalyzed the addition of hydrogen to molecules of gaseous hydrocarbons in what is now known as the Sabatier process. For this work, Sabatier shared the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Wilhelm Normann was awarded a patent in Germany in 1902 and in Britain in 1903 for the hydrogenation of liquid oils, which was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now a worldwide industry. The commercially important Haber–Bosch process, first described in 1905, involves hydrogenation of nitrogen. In the Fischer–Tropsch process, reported in 1922 carbon monoxide, which is easily derived from coal, is hydrogenated to liquid fuels.|$|E
25|$|In 1868, the Second State Normal School {{began in}} rented space by Professor George M. Gage in the Methodist Episcopal Church in {{downtown}} Mankato. The {{idea of a}} Normal School was conceived in 1858 at the State Legislature, but was sought by local residents long before this. The State began to build a main schoolhouse building that {{was the start of}} original footprint in Richardsonian Romanesque styling similar to that of Pillsbury Hall that was later built on the University of Minnesota campus. It was finished in 1869. This building allowed school officials to transition from borrowed space in the Mankato downtown and begin to host collegiate faculty in earnest. This first campus was located amongst the growing edge of the city in the Minnesota River valley. It was during this time that slow growth of additional out buildings were added to campus. This was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now called the Wilson Campus.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 Beuys befriended his Düsseldorf {{colleague}} Nam June Paik, {{a member}} of the Fluxus movement. This was <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was to be a brief formal involvement with Fluxus, a loose international group of artists who championed a radical erosion of the boundaries of art, bringing aspects of creative practice outside of the institution and into the everyday. Although Beuys participated in a number of Fluxus events, {{it soon became clear that}} he viewed the implications of art's economic and institutional framework differently. Indeed, whereas Fluxus was directly inspired by the radical Dada activities emerging during the First World War, Beuys in 1964 broadcast (from Second German Television Studio) a rather different message: ‘Das Schweigen von Marcel Duchamp wird überbewertet’ (‘The Silence of Marcel Duchamp is Overrated’). Beuys's relationship with the legacy of Duchamp and the Readymade is a central (if often unacknowledged) aspect of the controversy surrounding his practice.|$|E

25|$|In viticulture, {{ripeness}} is {{the completion}} of the ripening process of wine grapes on the vine which signals <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> harvest. <b>What</b> exactly constitutes ripeness will vary depending on <b>what</b> style <b>of</b> wine is being produced (sparkling, still, fortified, rosé, dessert wine, etc.) and what the winemaker and viticulturist personally believe constitutes ripeness. Once the grapes are harvested, the physical and chemical components of the grape which will influence a wine's quality are essentially set so determining the optimal moment of ripeness may be considered the most crucial decision in winemaking.|$|R
