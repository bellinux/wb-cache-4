50|$|A Hollander beater design {{consists}} of a circular or ovoid water raceway with a beater wheel at a single point along the raceway. The beater wheel is a centrifugal compressor or radial impeller cylinder parallel to a grooved plate, similar {{to the construction of}} a water wheel or <b>timing</b> <b>pulley.</b> Under power, the blades rotate to beat the fiber into a usable pulp slurry. The beater wheel and plate do not touch, as this would result in cutting. The distance between the two is adjusted to increase or decrease the pressure on the fibers when passing through the beater.|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} engine valve control {{system has been}} presented, in which both valve lift and phase are {{controlled}} directly by electric motors. A mechanism of the phase control system is made of planetary gears. The outer gear is the <b>timing</b> <b>pulley</b> which has timing belt driven by the crank of an engine. Two planetary gears are inside of the pulley. The gears engage in inner gear of the pulley. The center of the disc which has centers of the planetary gear {{is connected to the}} camshaft. Then, the crank rotation is transmitted to the cam shaft, and rotation of sun gear is added to the rotation of cam shaft. This means that when rotation angle of the sun gear is controlled, phase of the cam can be controlled. The lift control system is made of linear slider and ball screw. The cam shape of this system is three-dimensional. The height of the cam varies along the axis of the shaft. Hence, when the ball screw rotates, the cam shaft slides in the axial direction, so that the lift of the cam varies. Experimental tests have been carried out for the system. lt is ascertained that both cam lift and phase can be controlled continuously...|$|E
40|$|Transmissions by {{synchronous}} belts {{combine the}} advantages of transmissions by single belts (plates, trapezoidal or striated) due to their low weight, their low maintenance, great beaches of linear speeds and big transmission ratios with {{the advantages of}} chains: no slip, synchronized transmission speed, low tension pose, etc. with {{the teeth of the}} belt entering the corresponding <b>timing</b> <b>pulleys,</b> there is a direct transmission of power without slippage as between two gears. These synchronous transmissions are of quasi universal application, in all cases where the user wishes to have a positive fit and sliding. The {{purpose of this article is}} to gather information on the behavior of belts which differ mainly in their forms transverse tooth along the width...|$|R
50|$|Volkswagen use a {{variator}} {{system with}} two variators, {{one for each}} camshaft. Like the Alfa Romeo system, these are electrically-controlled hydraulic units, mounted in the camshaft's <b>timing</b> belt <b>pulley.</b> These systems are fitted to the Volkswagen VR5 and VR6 engines, and also to the W8 and W12 engines. The multiple-bank W engines have four variators in total, one for each camshaft.|$|R
40|$|Robotic manipulanda are {{extensively}} used in {{investigation of}} the motor control of human arm movements. They permit the application of translational forces to the arm based on its state {{and can be used}} to probe issues ranging from mechanisms of neural control to biomechanics. However, most current designs are optimized for studying either motor learning or stiffness. Even fewer include end-point torque control which is important for the simulation of objects and the study of tool use. Here we describe a modular, general purpose, two-dimensional planar manipulandum (vBOT) primarily optimized for dynamic learning paradigms. It employs a carbon fibre arm arranged as a parallelogram which is driven by motors via <b>timing</b> <b>pulleys.</b> The design minimizes the intrinsic dynamics of the manipulandum without active compensation. A novel variant of the design (WristBOT) can apply torques at the handle using an add-on cable drive mechanism. In a second variant (StiffBOT) a more rigid arm can be substituted and zero backlash belts can be used, making the StiffBOT more suitable for the study of stiffness. The three variants can be used with custom built display rigs, mounting, and air tables. We investigated the performance of the vBOT and its variants in terms of effective end-point mass, viscosity and stiffness. Finally we present an object manipulation task using the WristBOT. This demonstrates that subjects can perceive the orientation of the principal axis of an object based on haptic feedback arising from its rotational dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The loss {{of energy}} in gear with timing belt is a reason of belt destruction. The {{analysis}} of coupling between <b>timing</b> belt and <b>pulley</b> lets us point out the most important cause for lost {{of energy in}} gears with timing belt. Due to circumferenial force and pre-tension friction forces and centrifugal forces as well as transverse and lonigitudinal forces in cords evoked by vibrations there are many complex stresses occurring in the gear...|$|R
50|$|A {{crankshaft}} is {{subjected to}} enormous stresses, potentially equivalent of several tonnes of force. The crankshaft {{is connected to the}} fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to torque), the engine block, using bearings on the main journals, and to the pistons via their respective con-rods. An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and piston area. The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (<b>timing</b> chains, belts, <b>pulleys,</b> camshafts, lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.|$|R
5000|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this system is that it {{incorporates}} [...] "floating" [...] inlet cam drive pulleys that are not directly keyed to the shafts. This means that special setting tools are required to establish the cam <b>timing</b> before the <b>pulley</b> fixings are tightened. This requirement {{is the result of}} the complexity of the cam drive train. In addition to the length and thickness tolerance of the belts, the accuracy of the cam timing is also affected by the positional and diameter tolerance of each pulley and the thickness of each major engine casting. The result is that the required degree of timing accuracy could not otherwise be maintained.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to monitor the wheel-rail friction coefficient in railway vehicles to improve their traction and braking performance {{as well as to}} reduce the number of incidents caused by low friction. Model based fault detection and identification (FDI) methods, especially state observers have been commonly used in previous research to monitor the wheel-rail friction. However, the previous methods cannot provide an accurate value of the friction coefficient and few of them have been validated using experiments. A Kalman filter based estimator is proposed in this research project. The developed estimator uses signals from the traction motor and provides a new and more efficient approach to monitoring the condition of the wheel-rail contact condition. A 1 / 5 scaled test rig has been built to evaluate the developed method. This rig comprises 2 axle-hung induction motors driving both the wheelsets of the bogie through 2 pairs of spur gears. 2 DC generators are used to provide traction load to the rollers through <b>timing</b> <b>pulleys.</b> The motors are independently controlled by 2 inverters. Motor parameters such as voltage, current and speed are measured by the inverters. The speed of the wheel and roller and the output of the DC generator are measured by incremental encoders and Hall-effect current clamps. A LabVIEW code has been designed to process all the collected data and send control commands to the inverters. The communication between the PC and the inverters are realized using the Profibus (Process Field Bus) and the OPC (Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for Process Control) protocol. 3 different estimators were first developed using computer simulations. Kalman filter and its two nonlinear developments: extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) have been used in these 3 methods. The results show that the UKF based estimator can provide the best performance in this case. The requirement for measuring the roller speed and the traction load are also studied using the UKF. The results show that it is essential to measure the roller speed but the absence of the traction load measurement does not have significant impact on the estimation accuracy. A re-adhesion control algorithm, which reduces excessive creepage between the wheel and rail, is developed based on the UKF estimator. Accurate monitoring of the friction coefficient helps the traction motor work at its optimum point. As the largest creep force is generated, the braking and accelerating time and distance can be reduced to their minimum values. This controller can also avoid excessive creepage and hence potentially reduce the wear of the wheel and rail. The UKF based estimator development has been evaluated by experiments conducted on the roller rig. Three different friction conditions were tested: base condition without contamination, water contamination and oil contamination. The traction load was varied to cover a large range of creepage. The importance of measuring the roller speed and the traction load was also studied. The UKF based estimator was shown to provide reliable estimation in most of the tested conditions. The experiments also confirm that it is not necessary to measure the traction load and give good agreement with the simulation results. With both the simulation and experiment work, the UKF based estimator has shown its capability of monitoring the wheel-rail friction coefficient...|$|R
5000|$|The {{main purpose}} of the dry-sump system is to contain all the stored oil in a {{separate}} tank, or reservoir. This reservoir is usually tall and round or narrow and specially designed with internal baffles, and an oil outlet (supply) {{at the very bottom}} for uninhibited oil supply. The dry-sump oil pump is a minimum of 2 stages, with as many as 5 or 6. One stage is for pressure and is supplied the oil {{from the bottom of the}} reservoir, and along with an adjustable pressure regulator, supplies the oil under pressure through the filter and into the engine. The remaining stages [...] "scavenge" [...] the oil out of the dry-sump pan and return the oil (and gasses) to the top of the tank or reservoir. If an oil cooler is used usually it is mounted inline between the scavenge outlets and the tank. The dry-sump pump is usually driven by a Gilmer or HTD <b>timing</b> belt and <b>pulleys,</b> off the front of the crankshaft, at approximately one half crank speed. The dry-sump pump is designed with multiple stages to ensure that all the oil is scavenged from the pan and also to allow removal of excess air from the crankcase.|$|R
