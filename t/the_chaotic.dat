40|$|First, {{this paper}} announces a seven-term novel 3 -D {{conservative}} chaotic system with four quadratic nonlinearities. <b>The</b> conservative <b>chaotic</b> systems {{are characterized by}} the important property that they are volume conserving. The phase portraits of <b>the</b> novel conservative <b>chaotic</b> system are displayed and the mathematical properties are discussed. An important property of <b>the</b> proposed novel <b>chaotic</b> system {{is that it has}} no equilibrium point.

In this work, a detailed qualitative analysis of <b>the</b> novel <b>chaotic</b> systems (A) and (B) has been presented, and the Lyapunov exponents and Kaplan-Yorke dimension of these chaotic systems have been obtained.
