The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the <b>transient</b> <b>flow</b> of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by {{the heat of the}} impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material.

First, the equations including the steep slope effect are presented in one dimension and compared to the classical shallow-water equations.

The models give comparable results when compared on fast <b>transient</b> <b>flows</b> on steep slopes, while they differ when modelling uniform steady flows. They also lead to comparable results in the particular case of a flow overtopping a dike. Finally, the impact of the classical shallow water assumptions on the sediment transport evaluation is analysed.

Meres (1906-1963), analyzed {{results from the}} steady-state and the <b>transient</b> <b>flow</b> experiments of Ralph Dewey Wyckoff and Holbrook Gorham Botset. The experimental {{results showed that the}} flow of a mixture experienced an effective permeability that was reduced compared to the single-phase permeability. The reduced permeability correlated non-linearly with volume fraction of the other phase, and the reduction factor (or function) is denoted relative permeability. The formulation is based on Muskat's theory that the porous medium has a local structure of macroscopic size that is defined by the saturations, or volume fractions, of the fluid mixture. Muskat included the new permeability-reducing parameter in the refined single-phase flow equations, and thus established a new differential equation that governs the flow of multi-phase fluids in porous media. The experimental findings of Wyckoff and Botset and the analytical / theoretical findings of Muskat and Meres were published as two coordinated papers in 1936.|$|E

40|$|Cotton turf and hotwire {{measurements}} {{were used to}} experimentally assess the highly swirling flow characteristics in a spray dryer fitted with a rotary disc atomizer. The numerical simulation captured key features of the flow field. Analysis revealed that rapid rotation of an atomizing disc tends to centrifugally split the central inlet jet. The flow field exhibited significant long time-scale transient behaviour. However, this centrifugally split jet resulted in a balanced upward recirculation region in the chamber as expected by the jet-feedback mechanism. Detailed analysis using a 'transient air-steady particle' approach revealed that this approach is applicable for such highly swirling <b>transient</b> <b>flows</b> as well. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting the deposition results, particularly in regions of low particle velocities. This is anticipated be an important consideration in future attempts to simulate the predominantly <b>transient</b> <b>flows</b> in spray dryers. (C) 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

For example, frequent experiences of flow at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development (Csikszentmihályi, 1991, 2004).

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the figure of merit (zT), a material’s thermal conductivity should be minimized while its electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient is maximized. In most cases, methods to increase or decrease one property result in {{the same effect on}} other properties due to their interdependence. [...] A novel processing technique exploits the scattering of different phonon frequencies to selectively reduce lattice thermal conductivity without the typical negative effects on electrical conductivity from the simultaneous increased scattering of electrons. In a bismuth antimony tellurium ternary system, liquid-phase sintering is used to produce low-energy semicoherent grain boundaries, which do not have a significant scattering effect on electrons. The breakthrough is then applying a pressure to the liquid in the sintering process, which creates a <b>transient</b> <b>flow</b> of the Te rich liquid and facilitates the formation of dislocations that greatly reduce the lattice conductivity. The ability to selectively decrease the lattice conductivity results in reported zT values of 1.86 ± [...]15 which are a significant improvement over current commercial thermoelectric generators which have typical figures of merit closer to [...]3-.6. These improvements highlight the fact that in addition to development of novel materials for thermoelectric applications, using different processing techniques to design microstructure is a viable and worthwhile effort. In fact, it often makes sense to work to optimize both composition and microstructure.|$|E
