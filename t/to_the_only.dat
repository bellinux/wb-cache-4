5|$|The greater Phoenix {{region is}} home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{thriving}} feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird {{is a popular}} birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.|$|E

5|$|An American {{punk rock}} band from Long Island, New York named {{themselves}} after the film's alternative title, Horror Planet. Their eponymous theme song contained lyrical references to horrific {{aspects of the}} plot. The song was not released as a record but was circulated on cassette demonstration tapes prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> official release by the band. In 1985, Horror Planet released a professionally produced recording on an EP record with hand-painted fabric sleeves. The songs from the Horror Planet record were subsequently re-released in their entirety on the anthology CD compilation, Something in the Water: the Secret History of Long Island Punk, by Winged Disk Records.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920 season, the spitball was banned by Major League Baseball. As a current spitball pitcher, Coveleski was grandfathered in, and was allowed to continue using the pitch until his retirement. He won his first seven starting appearances of the season, but on May 28, his wife died suddenly, and he was given some time off to mourn, returning to pitching two weeks later. Nearly three months later, he was the starting pitcher against the New York Yankees on August 16. In the game, Coveleski hit a sacrifice fly to help the Indians win, 4–3, but it was best remembered as the game where Yankees pitcher Carl Mays hit Ray Chapman, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> death in MLB history from a pitch. He finished the 1920 regular season with 24 wins, 14 losses, a 2.49 ERA, and 133 strikeouts; he led the AL in strikeouts and finished second in ERA to Bob Shawkey.|$|E

5|$|Byron's {{attack on}} Skippon's musketeers in the centre also went poorly. Pushing three regiments of foot forward, the force {{suffered}} similarly high casualties {{in an attempt}} to take Round Hill; after the attack stalled, the cavalry had to be called in to force it forward. Despite heavy losses due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> avenue of advance being a narrow lane lined with Parliamentarian musketeers, this move succeeded in allowing Byron to take Round Hill, forcing the Parliamentarian infantry back to a hedge on the far side. The attack eventually lost momentum, and although Round Hill was taken, Byron was unable to advance any further. On the right flank, William Vavasour attempted to overwhelm the Parliamentary flank with a substantial brigade of foot, which included a small amount of cavalry support. His initial attack was repulsed thanks to the Parliamentarian artillery opening fire, but a subsequent head-on attack forced Skippon's beleaguered force in the centre to send several regiments over to assist, with the fight turning into a bloody melee. Vavasour's force was eventually forced to retire, with the Parliamentarians failing to give ground.|$|E
5|$|Nani scored Portugal's {{first goal}} in the last match of the group stage, a 3–3 draw against Hungary on 22 June, to help the team qualify for the {{knockout}} round. He then contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> goal of the match in a 1–0 extra-time victory in the round of 16 against Croatia on 25 June. During their quarter-final match on 30 June against Poland, Nani set up Renato Sanches' goal in regulation time and later scored Portugal's fourth penalty in an eventual 5–3 shoot-out victory, following a 1–1 draw after extra-time. In the semi-finals against Wales on 6 July, he scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory. In the final against host-nation France on 10 July, Nani was awarded the captain's armband after Cristiano Ronaldo was forced off in the opening 25 minutes of the match following a challenge from Dimitri Payet. During extra-time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1–0 victory.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists {{have long}} {{classified}} Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, but because its remains were {{for many years}} poorly known, a more precise classification had remained elusive until the discovery of A. altai. A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified into the family Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae, alongside Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus. A 2004 study supported this result but suggested it was equally probable that Alioramus belonged outside the family Tyrannosauridae entirely, with its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea. Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> specimen's fragmentary nature. The discovery of A. altai in 2009 confirmed {{the placement of the}} genus within the Tyrannosaurinae.|$|E

5|$|The eastern voalavo (Voalavo antsahabensis) is a rodent in {{the family}} Nesomyidae which occurs in the Anjozorobe forest of eastern Madagascar. Although surveys before 2002 failed to record the species, it is common in some places. However, it is {{threatened}} by habitat loss because of slash-and-burn agriculture. The species was formally described in 2005 and is most closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> other species of Voalavo, the northern voalavo from northern Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Three {{specimens}} {{have been}} assigned to Sinosauropteryx prima: the holotype GMV2123 (and its counter slab , NIGP127586), NIGP127587, and D2141. Another specimen, IVPPV14202, {{was assigned to the}} genus but not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> species by Zhang and colleagues. The assignment of an additional larger specimen to S. prima, GMV2124, was later found to be in error. All of the fossils were found in the Jianshangou or Dawangzhangzi Beds of the Yixian Formation in the Beipiao and Lingyuan regions of Liaoning, China. These fossil beds have been dated to 124.6–122million years ago, during the late Barremian to early Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|Juan Martín del Potro and Roger Federer {{have played}} 24 times with Federer leading 18–6. They have met seven times in Grand Slam tournaments with Federer leading 5–2. Their two most famous Grand Slam tournament {{meetings}} came in 2009. The first {{was in the}} French Open semifinals, when Federer survived a five-set clash {{when he was on}} his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> French title of his career. The second was in the final of the US Open, where del Potro stunned five-time defending champion Federer in five sets, ending his 20-match winning streak at Grand Slams. Another high-profile match was in the semifinals of the 2012 London Olympics, where Federer prevailed 19–17 in the final set to secure the Olympic silver medal. They also met in the finals of the Swiss Indoors in 2012, 2013 and 2017, with del Potro prevailing on first two occasions, and Federer on last one of them in tight three-set matches. In the 2017 U.S. Open quarterfinals, in a rematch of the 2009 US Open final, Del Potro again stunned Federer in four sets to end his unbeaten streak in grand slams that year. With this win, Del Potro also denied the first Federer-Nadal match at US Open, as in 2009 where he crushed Nadal in straight sets in the semifinals. Federer, however avenged this loss at the Shanghai Masters semifinals, where he beat del Potro in three sets after coming from a set down.|$|E
