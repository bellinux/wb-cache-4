5000|$|Henriot was {{a natural}} target for the Résistance and on 28 June 1944, in the Ministry {{building}} where he lived, he was assassinated {{by a group of}} COMAC members of <b>the</b> Maquis, an <b>organisation</b> <b>designated</b> by <b>the</b> French government at Vichy as [...] "terrorists". Disguised as members of the Milice, they had persuaded him to open his door. In retaliation, the Milice assassinated Georges Mandel, a strong opponent of collaboration. Henriot was afforded a state funeral in Paris, presided over by Cardinal Suhard in Notre Dame Cathedral. His coffin was placed, surrounded by French flags and flowers, in front of the Hôtel de Ville, where thousands filed past to mourn him - less than two months before the Liberation of Paris.|$|R

40|$|Podoconiosis or 'endemic non-filarial elephantiasis' is a {{tropical}} disease caused by exposure of bare feet to irritant alkaline clay soils. This causes an asymmetrical {{swelling of the}} feet and lower limbs due to lymphoedema. Podoconiosis has a curable pre-elephantiasic phase. However, once elephantiasis is established, podoconiosis persists and may cause lifelong disability. The disease is associated with living in low-income countries in the tropics in regions with high altitude and high seasonal rainfall. It is found in areas of tropical Africa, Central and South America and north-west India. In endemic areas, podoconiosis is a considerable public health problem. Social stigmatisation of patients is widespread and economic losses are enormous since it mainly affects the most productive people, sustaining the disease-poverty-disease cycle. Podoconiosis is unique in being an entirely preventable, non-communicable tropical disease {{with the potential for}} eradication. Low-cost preventive measures are a simple but effective solution. However, so far it has received little attention from health care policy makers and, until recently, research into the disease has been scarce and the pathogenesis and genetic basis are partly unclear. A better understanding of these aspects may lead to new prevention and treatment opportunities. In the past few years, several projects fighting podoconiosis have been started by non-governmental organisations. In February 2011, <b>the</b> World Health <b>Organisation</b> <b>designated</b> podoconiosis as one of the 20 neglected tropical diseases, marking an important step in the fight against the diseas...|$|R

40|$|Within {{aerospace}} and defence sectors, organisations {{are adding}} value to their core corporate offerings through services. These services tend to emphasise {{the potential to}} maintain future revenue streams and improved profitability and hence require the establishment of cost effective strategies that can manage uncertainties within value led services e. g. maintenance activities. In large organisations, decision-making is often supported by information processing and decision aiding systems; {{it is not always}} apparent whose decision affects the outcome the most. Often, accountability moves away from <b>the</b> <b>designated</b> <b>organisation</b> personnel in unforeseen ways, and depending on the decisions of individual decision makers, the structure of <b>the</b> <b>organisation,</b> or unregulated operating procedures may change. This can have far more effect on the overall system reliability – leading to inadequate troubleshooting, repeated down-time, reduced availability and increased burden on Through-life Engineering Services. This paper focuses on outlining current industrial attitudes regarding the No Fault Found (NFF) phenomena and identifies the drivers that influence the NFF decision-making process. It articulates the contents of tacit knowledge and addresses a knowledge gap by developing NFF management policies. The paper further classifies the NFF phenomenon into five key processes that must be controlled by using the developed policies. In addition to the theoretical developments, a Petri net model is also outlined and discussed based on the captured information regarding NFF decision-making in organisations. Since NFF decision-making is influenced by several factors, Petri nets are sought as a powerful tool to realise a meta-model capability to understand the complexity of situations. Its potential managerial implications can help describe decision problems under conditions of uncertainty. Finally, the conclusions indicate that engineering processes, which allow decision-making at various maintenance echelons, can often obfuscate problems that then require a systems approach to illustrate the impact of the issue...|$|R
40|$|Introduction It is a {{standard}} feature of all <b>organisations</b> that <b>designated</b> agents, usually when acting in specific roles, are empowered by <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> to create specified kinds of states of a#airs [...] - as when, for instance, a priest declares a couple as married and thereby makes it so {{in the eye of}} the church, or when a head of department assigns one of his subordinates to a particular project, or when an owner transfers ownership, as opposed to mere physical possession, of an item to another entity. This feature of organisations is referred to variously as `(legal) power', `(legal) competence`, or `(legal) capacity'. Jones and Sergot [JS 96] use the term institutionalised power to emphasise that this is not a feature of legal systems alone but commonplace in all <b>organisations.</b> <b>The</b> neutral term `institution' is used by them, and other authors, for any kind of formal or informal <b>organisation.</b> <b>The</b> states of a#airs created when a designated agent exercises an institutionalised powe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to solve a paradox: {{maintaining}} {{a high level of}} employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> is assumed to be a critical factor for successful downsizing, but downsizing tends to reduce employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation.</b> In seeking to resolve this paradox, the thesis aims to provide insights into how employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> under downsizing can be managed. The thesis first explores the mechanism through which downsizing exerts its influence on employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation,</b> i. e. it examines whether downsizing affects employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> directly and/or indirectly through employees' daily work experiences, and seeks to determine which impact is stronger. Then, it examines whether employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> is really important in terms of organisational citizenship behaviour. Finally, the thesis identifies the determinants of employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> and investigates how and why these determinants have such effects. The results of the research show that the indirect impact of downsizing on employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> is much stronger than its direct impact. That is, employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> is slightly reduced by downsizing, but it can be maintained or enhanced if the change of employees' daily work experiences caused by downsizing is favourable to them. Moreover, employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> appears to be very important in terms of organisational citizenship behaviour. Finally, employees' daily work experiences affect employees' affective commitment to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> through their impacts on the three mediating variables (organisation-based self-esteem, perceived organisational support, and self efficacy). The results also show that organisation-based self-esteem is the key mediating variable...|$|R
