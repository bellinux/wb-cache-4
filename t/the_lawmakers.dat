5|$|A December 1988 audit by the FHLBB found Lincoln in {{violation}} of many regulations and in danger of default. The following month they ordered Keating to stop transferring cash from Lincoln to American Continental, which imperiled the latter's survival strategy and caused its stock price to nosedive. Keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves failed and he lost $11 million in one month alone. Keating got Senators DeConcini and Cranston to pressure the regulators to let a sale go through, but this time <b>the</b> <b>lawmakers</b> were ignored.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few years}} of the end of World War II, the United States {{deactivated}} all of its remaining battleships and placed them in the United States Navy reserve fleets. Most of these ships were eventually scrapped, but the four Iowa-class battleships were not, and on several occasions {{one or more of these}} four battleships were reactivated for naval gunfire support. The U.S. Navy has held onto the four Iowa-class battleships long after the upkeep and maintenance of operating and maintaining a battleship and the arrival of aircraft and precision guided munitions led other nations to scrap their big-gun fleets. Congress was largely responsible for keeping the four Iowa-class battleships in the United States Navy reserve fleets and on the Naval Vessel Register as long as they did. <b>The</b> <b>lawmakers</b> argued that the battleships' large-caliber guns had a useful destructive power that is lacking in the smaller, cheaper, and faster guns mounted by U.S. cruisers and destroyers.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the trend}} is to {{interpret}} legal texts directly, regarding each legal regulation as a freestanding text, many times legal norms have to be correlated and interpreted ones {{by means of the}} others. Thus the legislative technique plays a very important part in drawing up an efficient legislative act whose enforcement should not generate any difficulties caused by the misinterpretation and misunderstanding of the norms. It is obvious why <b>the</b> <b>lawmaker</b> has given such attention to accession, bearing important changes which have taken shape into a regulation much higher than the previous one. If <b>the</b> <b>lawmaker’s</b> attention to details is generally appreciated, i. e. it is useful to cover legislative lacunae by new regulations, sometimes excessive regulation is regarded critically by legal councillors, generating a poisonous inflexibility in enforcing the law. Also, <b>the</b> <b>lawmaker’s</b> attempt to define some terms within the code is regarded critically, too, by legal councillors, considering that it is not pertinent to define some terms within a civil code. We consider that by the regulating way <b>the</b> <b>lawmaker</b> succeeded in surpassing its old pattern, the French civil code adjusting better to the situations arising from practice. Also, <b>the</b> Romanian <b>lawmaker</b> evolved from <b>the</b> point of view of systematization of norms, compared to <b>the</b> French <b>lawmaker</b> which keeps on treating immovable accession, including the movable one, as conglomerates of norms. The new accession regulation is a progress {{from the point of view}} of enforcing the norms of legislative techniques. It can certainly represent a pattern for the regulation of the accession in the law of other EU Member States, and not only them...|$|R

25|$|Following {{the birth}} of the modern State of Israel in 1948, the Law of Return was enacted to give any Jew the right to immigrate to Israel and become a citizen. However, due to an {{inability}} on <b>the</b> <b>lawmakers</b> to agree, the Law did not define who was a Jew, relying instead on the issue to resolve itself over time. As a result, the Law relied in form on the traditional halakhic definition. But, the absence of a definition of who is a Jew, for the purpose of the Law, has resulted in the divergent views of the various streams of Judaism competing for recognition.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court of Pakistan on 24 July, {{revised the}} {{date for the}} presidential {{election}} on {{the appeal of the}} ruling party, PML (N), asking the election commission to hold it on 30 July instead of 6 August. The court made the order as many of <b>the</b> <b>lawmakers</b> who will elect a replacement for President Asif Ali Zardari will be paying pilgrimages or offering special prayers on 6 August for the holy month of Ramadan, which ends a few days later, thus making it potentially difficult for some lawmakers to oblige with their religious duties along with the election.

25|$|When Parliament {{passed the}} Act of Uniformity 1549, people {{in many areas}} of Cornwall did not speak or {{understand}} English. The intention of the Act was to replace worship in Latin with worship in English, which was known by <b>the</b> <b>lawmakers</b> not to be universally spoken throughout England. Instead of merely banning Latin, the Act was framed so as to enforce English. The Prayer Book Rebellion, which may also have been influenced by the retaliation of the English after the failed Cornish Rebellion of 1497, broke out, and was ruthlessly suppressed: over 4,000 people who protested against the imposition of an English prayer book were massacred by Edward VI's army. Their leaders were executed and the people suffered numerous reprisals.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, the Interim Juba Administration began a {{selection}} {{process for the}} members of the new regional parliament.

25|$|The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution had {{ushered in}} a period known as Prohibition, during which the manufacture, distribution, and sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages was illegal. Passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 was the crowning achievement of the temperance movement, but it soon proved highly unpopular. Crime rates soared under Prohibition as gangsters, such as Chicago's Al Capone, became rich from a profitable, often violent black market for alcohol. The federal government was incapable of stemming the tide: enforcement of the Volstead Act {{proved to be a}} nearly impossible task and corruption was rife among law enforcement agencies. In 1932, wealthy industrialist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. stated in a letter: As more and more Americans opposed the Eighteenth Amendment, a political movement grew for its repeal. However, repeal was complicated by grassroots politics. Although the U.S. Constitution provides two methods for ratifying constitutional amendments, only one method had been used up until that time; and that was for ratification by the state legislatures of three-fourths of the states. However, the wisdom of the day was that <b>the</b> <b>lawmakers</b> of many states were either beholden to or simply fearful of the temperance lobby. For that reason, when Congress formally proposed the repeal of Prohibition on February 20, 1933 (with the requisite two-thirds having voted in favor in each house; 63 to 21 in the United States Senate and 289 to 121 in the United States House of Representatives), it chose the second ratification method established by Article V, that being via state conventions. The Twenty-first Amendment is the only constitutional amendment ratified by state conventions rather than by the state legislatures.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the French Directory sank in {{popularity}} after military defeats and mismanagement.

The next day, the coup almost collapsed when Bonaparte had to be rescued from the Council of Five Hundred. However, Lucien Bonaparte convinced the Council's own guard battalion that only a minority of members opposed his brother. These soldiers soon evicted <b>the</b> <b>lawmakers</b> from their own hall. During these events, Sérurier's troops arrived at Saint-Cloud and the general was heard addressing them, [...] "The wretches! They wished to kill General Bonaparte. Do not stir soldiers; wait until you get orders". In the aftermath of the coup, Sérurier was put on a commission to determine how to use auxiliary battalions on 15 November 1799.
