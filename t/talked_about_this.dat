25|$|It {{is strange}} {{to look back}} and see how this frail-looking young man burst on the scene in 1953. We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to {{challenge}} for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> burly Englishman who had ridden 160km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.|$|E

500|$|However, Canham later {{denied that}} Elliott was [...] "eased out" [...] of his job. [...] In an {{interview}} with Joe Falls, Canham said: [...] "Bump and I are close personal friends. [...] Bump is not naïve – he knows that when you work at a place for 10 years and you’re not winning consistently, it doesn’t become fun for anybody – the coach, the alumni, the players or anybody else. [...] We <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{and we talked about}} it openly. [...] If Bump had said to me, ‘Look, give me a couple of more years,’ I would have given it to him. [...] I mean that. [...] I didn’t fire Bump Elliott. [...] My first year as director Bump had an 8 and 2 record. [...] Anyone could live with that." ...|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the episode, Luna {{had also}} hinted at the {{continued}} conflict between Phil Coulson {{and the new}} Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Jeffrey Mace, saying, [...] "Coulson has been doing what he wants, doing his own thing, taking the quinjet out for a spin wherever he needs to go. He’s shooting from the hip {{with a lot of}} these moves he’s making, and I’m sure that’s going to rub the director the wrong way. [...] in who is reportedly a serial killer, so how the director is going to respond to that, we can only wait and see." [...] Bell <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> acknowledging that Coulson [...] "wants to have his cake and eat it too", having decided to step down from the role of director himself but still wanting to do what he wants. He said that they were mostly trying to [...] "tee-up" [...] that conflict and give the audience time to get to know Mace before more thoroughly exploring that aspect in later episodes.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E

According to reports, she participated {{in order to show}} solidarity with HIV-AIDS sufferers. According to Shetty, the issue was particularly close to her heart as she had portrayed an HIV-positive sufferer in her 2004 film Phir Milenge. Speaking about the film and HIV in general, Shetty said: [...] "Why not a film on HIV positive patients? It is a social stigma in our society. We made this film to highlight this problem... This film will bring about a social awareness about AIDS in our country. It is high time we <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> in our society".|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{opened up}} {{about his past}} {{relationships}} saying that there were years when he had over 100 sexual partners and stated “If I saw a pretty girl, I wanted to have her.” When asked about marriage and growing old and alone Kiedis responded by saying “Maybe it is because I never learned {{to live in a}} relationship and as silly one sounds, I do not understand women yet. They remain a mystery. I <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> yesterday with a friend: do we focus on finding a person who fits with us, or will we remain single? I am open to both.

2500|$|Milgram's {{interest}} in the Holocaust had its basis in what his biographer, Professor Thomas Blass, referred to as Milgram's [...] "lifelong identification with the Jewish people". [...] Author Kirsten Fermaglich wrote that Milgram as an adult had [...] "a personal conflict as a Jewish man who perceived himself both as an outsider, {{a victim of the}} Nazi destruction, and as an insider, as scientist". [...] Alexandra stated that Milgram's Jewish identity led to his focus on the Holocaust and his obedience-to-authority research. He shared this as well with Herbert Winer, one of his obedience study subjects, who noted after speaking to Milgram about the experiment that [...] "Milgram was very Jewish. I was Jewish. We <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> There was obviously a motive behind neutral research." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{suspect profile}} report {{created by the}} National Criminal Investigation Service in Norway (Kripos) {{concluded}} that there was only one perpetrator since both victims were killed in a way that could not be copied by another person. In the interrogations with the police, Jan Helge Andersen had described in detail how the girls were killed, a method he had learned by watching a special type of documentary called [...] "Reality TV", but he was only sentenced for killing one of the victims while Kristiansen was sentenced for killing both. According to Kristiansen's lawyer, Arvid Sjødin, Andersen also told the police that he had never <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> method with Kristiansen. (The interrogation transcripts are not publicly available) The suspect profile report was neither presented for the court, nor for the lawyers. It was not known for the public until 2010 when Kristiansen's lawyer Sigurd J. Klomsæt got hold of it by appearing personally at Kripos after several failed written requests. FBI expert Gregg McCrary agreed with the conclusion of the report.|$|E
