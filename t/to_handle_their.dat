5|$|The Arabian {{developed}} in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>their</b> horses with competence and respect.|$|E
5|$|Commandant Teste was {{designed}} to accommodate the naval version of the Farman F.60 Goliath torpedo bomber, but they were obsolete when she was commissioned in 1932. Biplane Levasseur PL.14 torpedo bomber floatplanes were only briefly used as they proved to be too fragile for landing at sea. They were replaced by improved Levasseur PL.15 biplanes from July–August 1934. The Latécoère 298 monoplane replaced the PL.15 in March–May 1939. The scouting squadron was initially equipped with fixed-wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-810 floatplanes until the folding wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-811 arrived in October 1933. They were replaced in turn by the improved Gourdou-Leseurre GL-813 in early 1936. The larger Loire 130 flying boat replaced the GL-813 from April 1938, although the catapults had to be modified <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>their</b> greater weight. No fighter seaplanes were ever embarked on Commandant Teste, although the Loire 210 floatplane {{was designed}} for the role. However, {{it proved to be}} greatly out-classed by contemporary land-based fighters and only 20 were built in 1939.|$|E

25|$|On the air side of HVAC coils a {{significant}} difference exists between those used for heating, and those for cooling. Due to psychrometrics, air that is cooled often has moisture condensing out of it, except with extremely dry air flows. Heating some air increases that airflow's capacity to hold water. So heating coils need not consider moisture condensation on their air-side, but cooling coils must be adequately designed and selected <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>their</b> particular latent (moisture) {{as well as the}} sensible (cooling) loads. The water that is removed is called condensate.|$|E
25|$|Human-generated {{pollution}} {{of the lake}} and, by extension, New York City's watershed, also increased.

In 2000 {{the city and the}} county reached a deal to build a plant to handle sewage from the many homes around the lake whose original septic systems were failing, and divert it to the Hudson River.

25|$|The concerts were {{digitally}} {{recorded by}} 28 HD cameras, both human operated and robotic, collecting about 500 gigabytes of audio/video per hour—roughly a terabyte (TB) per show. <b>To</b> <b>handle</b> <b>their</b> data storage needs, U2 used several products from EMC Corporation, {{the first time}} the company had a musical client. To archive uncompressed footage and access it on-demand during the shows' production, the tour staff used an EMC VNXe3200 portable flash storage unit worth about US$25,000; it was configured with 22.9 TB of storage but was expandable up to 450 TB. After each show, tour staff used an EMC Data Domain 2500 system to back up footage; with storage up to 6.6 petabytes and an hourly throughput of 13.4 TB, the Data Domain system could complete a nightly backup before the crew disassembled the stage. On previous tours, U2 relied on USB flash drives for storage. Video imagery was loaded on the set's video screens with two d3 Technologies d3 4×4 media servers. Due to the need to load video on the fly, all storage was locally networked, as a cloud storage configuration would have increased latency. EMC's solution satisfied certain requirements dictated by the band, such as: mobility through a flight case form factor; expandable storage; and the capability to handle the large data loads from many cameras.|$|E

500|$|Singular: tomium. The {{cutting edges}} of the [...] and [...] mandibles. In most birds, these range from rounded to {{slightly}} sharp, but some species have evolved structural modifications that allow them <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>their</b> typical food sources better. Granivorous (seed-eating) birds, for example, have ridges in their tomia, which help the bird to slice through a seed's outer hull. Birds in roughly 30 families have tomia lined with tight bunches of very short bristles along their entire length. Most of these species are either [...] (preferring hard-shelled prey) or snail eaters, and the brush-like projections may help to increase the coefficient of friction between the mandibles, thereby improving the bird's ability to hold hard prey items. Serrations on hummingbird bills, found in 23% of all hummingbird genera, may perform a similar function, allowing the birds to effectively hold insect prey. They may also allow shorter-billed hummingbirds to function as nectar thieves, as they can more effectively hold and cut through long or waxy flower corollas. In some cases, the colour of a bird's tomia can help to distinguish between similar species. The snow goose, for example, has a reddish-pink bill with black tomia, while the whole beak of the similar Ross's goose is pinkish-red, without darker tomia.|$|E

In contrast, Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal was less enthusiastic about the episode, expressing, [...] "truth be told, after three episodes very little has happened so far this season." [...] TV Fanatic Sean McKenna asserted that despite not having any direction, [...] "Save the Last One" [...] managed to retain the [...] "tension and action that makes this show a thrill ride every week." [...] He added: [...] "I'm sure for some the slow pace in real time is something of a bother, but for me it adds to the intensity of the characters' situation and the show itself." [...] McKenna ultimately gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Similarly, Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy stated that the episode was the strongest installment of the season as well as amongst the series' best installments.|$|E
