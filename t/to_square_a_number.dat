50|$|Suppose we need <b>to</b> <b>square</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> x near 50. This number may be {{expressed}} as x = 50 &minus; n, {{and hence the}} answer x2 is (50−n)2, which is 502 − 100n + n2. We know that 502 is 2500. So we subtract 100n from 2500, and then add n2. Example, say we want to square 48, which is 50 &minus; 2. We subtract 200 from 2500 and add 4, and get x2 = 2304. For numbers larger than 50 (x = 50 + n), add n a hundred times instead of subtracting it.|$|E

25|$|In 1225, Fibonacci was {{challenged}} {{to find a}} construction for triples of square numbers that are equally spaced from each other, forming an arithmetic progression, and for the spacing between these numbers, which he called a congruum. One way of describing Fibonacci's solution is that the numbers <b>to</b> be <b>squared</b> are the difference of legs, hypotenuse, and sum of legs of a Pythagorean triangle, and that the congruum is four times {{the area of the}} same triangle. In his later work on the congruum problem, published in The Book of Squares, Fibonacci observed that it is impossible for a congruum <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>square</b> <b>number</b> itself, but did not present a satisfactory proof of this fact.|$|R
50|$|Rahova is {{serviced}} by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of public transport (RATB) lines, especially tramways (or light rail) {{and to a}} lesser extent buses. Line 32 is the main line, with tramways running every minute from Rahovei Market <b>to</b> Unirii <b>Square.</b> Currently <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of tramway lines are upgraded and/or converted to Light Rail. There is no subway (Metrou) in the area, nor are there plans to build or extend the network to the area. Because of a chaotic layout of roads and streets, and the presence of a belt of factories to the north of the neighbourhood (The Old Industrial Area of Trafic Greu, officially Progresului Road), there are basically only three roads heading downtown (Calea Rahovei, 13 Septembrie and Drumul Sării - with no secondary streets whatsoever), all with only two lanes per way of traffic and heavy public transport. This causes severe traffic jams that can last for up to five hours daily. The only solution found was to demolish two factories and make way for a new road, but the proposal was deemed too expensive and scrapped.|$|R
5000|$|Moseley's law is an {{empirical}} law concerning the characteristic x-rays that are emitted by atoms. The law was discovered {{and published by}} the English physicist Henry Moseley in 1913. It is historically important in quantitatively justifying the conception of the nuclear model of the atom, with all, or nearly all, positive charges of the atom located in the nucleus, and associated on an integer basis with atomic number. Until Moseley's work, [...] "atomic number" [...] was merely an element's place in the periodic table, and was not known {{to be associated with}} any measureable physical quantity. Moseley was able to show that the frequencies of certain characteristic X-rays emitted from chemical elements are proportional <b>to</b> the <b>square</b> of <b>a</b> <b>number</b> which was close to the element's atomic number; a finding which supported Van den Broek and Bohr's model of the atom in which the atomic number {{is the same as the}} number of positive charges in the nucleus of the atom. In brief, the law states that the square root of the frequency of the emitted x-ray is proportional to the atomic number.|$|R
40|$|Ultra-fast {{science is}} an {{important}} new research frontier that is driving the development of novel sources for generation of extremely short x-ray and electron pulses. Recent advances in femtosecond lasers have stimulated development of femtosecond x-ray sources that allow the study of matter at the time scale shorter than period of oscillations of atoms in molecules, {approx} 100 fs. The next breakthrough would {{be a source of}} electron pulses comparable with atomic periods {omega}{sup - 1 } {approx} 100 attosecond (10 {sup - 16 } s), where {omega} is a transition frequency between atomic levels. This will open qualitatively new class of phenomena based on the interaction of atomic electrons in the medium with a collective electric field of electron pulses and not with their individual electrons. For example, one can expect coherent ionization losses that are proportional <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>square</b> <b>number</b> of electrons in the microbunch, phase synchronized excitation of medium followed by its relaxation with a radiation of a single-cycled optical pulse, excitation of entanglement states in the medium of atoms with few valence electrons, and possibly other new phenomena, yet to be identified. Simple estimation of coherent ionization losses shows that a 100 MeV, 100 attosecond electron pulse containing 10 {sup 5 } electrons will lose its total energy after propagating only {approx} 200 {micro}m through liquid hydrogen. This is approximately 104 times shorter stopping range than it is for a long (on atomic scale) electron bunch...|$|R
