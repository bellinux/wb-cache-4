After publicity generated by <b>the</b> <b>lawsuits,</b> <b>the</b> book became a bestseller.|$|R
5|$|Because {{no money}} is {{exchanged}} and laws are rarely broken, {{there is little}} legal recourse to take upon discovery of someone faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for defamatory language in 2005. <b>The</b> <b>lawsuit</b> followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge and his own accounts. <b>The</b> <b>lawsuit</b> was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's medical history.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 an Australian {{non-profit}} organisation called Australia for Dolphins (featured {{in the documentary}} The Killing Cove) launched a world-first lawsuit against the brokers of the drive hunts, the Taiji Whale Museum. <b>The</b> <b>lawsuit,</b> known as the Action for Angel case, alleges that the museum illegally refused entry to dolphin welfare observers, and aims to open the museum up to public scrutiny. <b>The</b> <b>lawsuit,</b> which is ongoing, {{is expected to reach}} an outcome in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Controversy emerged over Entrance 2's {{location}} in February 2011, when a lawsuit was {{filed by the}} Yorkshire Towers over the location of Entrance 2. The entrances, planned to service 3,600 people an hour, were alleged in <b>the</b> <b>lawsuit</b> to be destroying {{the quality of life}} for building tenants, if the entrances were to be built in the location. <b>The</b> <b>lawsuit</b> was later dismissed because the suit had been filed two years after the FTA's FONSI was published, which was past the statute of limitations. A new lawsuit was filed on March 15, 2013, after the MTA started construction on the entrances. In June 2013, that lawsuit was also dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Also {{contained}} in Hemming's {{work is a}} description of <b>the</b> <b>lawsuit</b> between the diocese of Worcester and Evesham Abbey, which took place between 1078 and 1085. Although only Hemming relates {{the course of the}} proceedings, the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Evesham Chronicle, also gives background information on the dispute. The litigation involved lands that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire, but that the diocese maintained were actually part of one of the bishopric's manors. Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of Æthelwig, when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of lands previously held from the diocese. After Æthelwig's death, most of these lands passed to Odo of Bayeux, but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth, which became the basis of the dispute. <b>The</b> <b>lawsuit</b> was complicated because part of the land had been granted by an earlier bishop, Beorhtheah, to a kinsman, Azur. After the Conquest, Azur's lands were given to Urse d'Abetot, the Sheriff of Worcester. Following Æthelwig's death, Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with Æthelwig's successor Walter. The settlement, which was concluded in 1086, granted the lands to the abbey, but the diocese was the overlord of the lands, for which the abbey owed military service.|$|E

5|$|Although {{membership}} in the Klan was limited to men, Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel white supremacist organization for women. Evans established a women's group and sued him. Evans won <b>the</b> <b>lawsuit,</b> leading to a public war of words with Simmons, whose lawyer was soon murdered by Evans' press agent, an event in which Evans denied complicity. In 1924, Evans paid Simmons $145,000 for a promise to abandon the latter's claim to Klan leadership.|$|E
5|$|Another {{lawsuit was}} filed by a South Carolina {{resident}} {{who said he}} was accosted by Baron Cohen (as Borat) in the bathroom at a restaurant in downtown Columbia, with the actor allegedly making comments regarding the individual's genitals, without signing any legal waiver. <b>The</b> <b>lawsuit</b> also sought to have the footage excluded from any DVD releases and removed from Internet video sites.|$|E
5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending <b>the</b> <b>lawsuit,</b> and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the seventh}} season aired, Duchovny {{filed a lawsuit}} against 20th Century Fox. He was upset because, he claimed, Fox had undersold the rights to its own affiliates, thereby costing him huge sums of money. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>lawsuit</b> was settled, and Duchovny was awarded a {{settlement}} of about $20 million. <b>The</b> <b>lawsuit</b> put strain on Duchovny's professional relationships. Neither Carter nor Duchovny was contracted to work on the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of that season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, but it was decided that Mulder would be abducted {{at the end of the}} seventh seasons and would return in 12 episodes the following year. The producers then announced that a new character, John Doggett, would fill Mulder's role.|$|E
