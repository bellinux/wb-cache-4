5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans {{migrated}} to the West; 3.454million left between 1950 {{and the construction of}} the Berlin Wall in 1961. After the border was fortified and the Berlin Wall constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than a small minority {{of the total number of}} emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> or by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E

40|$|Just {{as there}} has been tension between EU {{migration}} policies and national level policies, there is growing evidence that local authorities are taking a more proactive position to define local policies for <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals. In some countries, these complement stronger positive national policies, in other countries, where there is an absence of national migration policies, local authorities are playing {{an important role in}} supporting the integration of <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals within society and the local economy. They do this through social cohesion activities, language education and wider education and life-long learning services. The position of <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals in the labour force is often weak, especially women and those with low levels of education. There is a need for more focused strategies to make the recognition of existing qualifications easier and quicker. Austerity policies have had an impact on <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals because they have resulted in cuts to services, e. g. social cohesion, which were specially targeted at <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals.

25|$|Originally {{planned to}} hold 300,000 refugees, the {{population}} eventually reached 160,000 in March 1980. Later, as KID became the main holding center for refugees awaiting third country visas, illegal {{entry to the}} camp became highly sought after by refugees desperate to escape from Cambodia, and smuggling, theft and violence spiraled out of control. In July and August 1980 UNHCR began transferring large numbers of refugees out of KID to Phanat Nikhom, Sa Kaeo II, Mairut, and Kap Choeng. By December 1982 the population had dropped to 40,134 as refugees were forcibly repatriated, sent to <b>third</b> <b>countries,</b> or {{sent back to the}} border camps.|$|E

25|$|Attempts by the UK Government {{to obtain}} a similar {{exemption}} were also stymied. The UK Government sought an exemption {{in the context of}} the JSF project. The Clinton administration promised the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence that an ITAR waiver would be given, allowing greater technology transfer associated with the project. Yet, despite the backing of the Bush administration, the waiver was repeatedly blocked by the late U.S. Congressman Henry Hyde because of his security concerns about potential technology transfer to <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> With his departure, ITAR-related impacts regarding the F-35 / JSF program remain in flux. These difficulties caused the UK to threaten that it would abandon the JSF project and consider alternative aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The port of Las Palmas {{is first}} in freight {{traffic in the}} islands, while the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the first fishing port with {{approximately}} 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the Spanish government publication Statistical Yearbook of State Ports. Similarly, {{it is the second}} port in Spain as regards ship traffic, only surpassed by the Port of Algeciras Bay. The port's facilities include a border inspection post (BIP) approved by the European Union, which is responsible for inspecting all types of imports from <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> or exports to countries outside the European Economic Area. The port of Los Cristianos (Tenerife) has the greatest number of passengers recorded in the Canary Islands, followed by the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The Port of Las Palmas is the third port in the islands in passengers and first in number of vehicles transported.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{also took}} {{a series of steps}} to evade the embargo and clandestinely trade with the Arab world. Front {{companies}} in <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> were set up, which imported goods, then re-exported them to Arab countries with false labels and certificates of origin. In other cases, foreign companies would purchase Israeli technology and materials, use them to assemble completed products, and export them to Arab countries while concealing this fact from their customers. Arrangements with American companies were worked out where the American companies would buy goods from Israeli affiliates and export them as American-made goods. Israeli ships were re-flagged as ships of other nations and provided with faked bills of landing so they could directly export goods to the Arab and Muslim world. Greece and Cyprus were particularly popular hubs for smuggling Israeli goods into the Arab world due to their location, multilateral economic connections, large merchant fleets, and Cyprus' corporate and bank secrecy laws.|$|E

25|$|However, after India {{tested a}} nuclear device in 1974, the U.S. slowed down and {{eventually}} halted nuclear cooperation with Brazil. Also, {{in the aftermath of}} the 1973 energy crisis, USAEC made its provision of fuel to <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> subject to availability. This in turn pushed Brazil to accelerate talks with West Germany and France, eventually signing an agreement with the former on 27 June 1975, that established the transfer of operational know-how regarding reactors. The deal represented the largest technology transfer agreement ever signed between an industrialized country and an industrializing one. Bonn committed to export four to eight reactors over a span of 15 years. Likewise, West German firms agreed to construct a complete nuclear fuel cycle in Brazil: uranium prospecting and mining; uranium enrichment (using the jet-nozzle process); manufacturing fuel rods; and reprocessing spent fuel rods. For West Germanyâ€™s nuclear industry, this was the most significant contract ever to be established, at an anticipated value of 10 billion marks (roughly US$4 billion). Also, this was the largest single export order in German history.|$|E
25|$|Boycotts {{were almost}} {{exclusively}} applied against specific individuals and firms in <b>third</b> <b>countries,</b> and very rarely against the countries themselves, excluding a few short-lived boycotts of {{countries in the}} early 1950s. A plan {{was made by the}} Arab League in 1952 to boycott the Federal Republic of Germany after it signed the Reparations Agreement with Israel, which would provide Israel with restitution for the slave labor of Jews during the Holocaust and compensate for losses in Jewish livelihood and property that was stolen due to Nazi persecution and genocide. The Arab League strongly opposed the agreement, but its threats to boycott West Germany were never carried out due to economic considerationsâ€”the Arab League would be impacted far more negatively by losing trade with West Germany than vice versa. Similarly, at its second meeting on the boycott in 1953, the Arab League proposed a wide range of restrictions on trade with Cyprus, which had become a hub of illicit Arab-Israeli trade. The restrictions were greatly relaxed due to international criticism of the boycott of an entire state not involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict, but they were not completely eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Besides air transport, Tenerife has two {{principal}} maritime ports: the Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Puerto de Santa Cruz), which serves the various capitals of the Canary Islands, {{especially those in}} the west; and the Port of Los Cristianos (Puerto de Los Cristianos), which serves the various island capitals of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The first port also has passenger services, which connect with the mainland port of CÃ¡diz (and vice versa). There are plans to build a new port in the south of the island, in Granadilla de Abona, and in another in the west, at FonsalÃ­a. The Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the first fishing port in the Canary Islands with approximately 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the Statistical Yearbook of the State Ports 2006 (the latest of which is changing). Following this report is the largest port number of passengers recorded. Similarly, the second port of Spain moving ship and loaded into cars, only surpassed by the Port of Algeciras Bay.
