5|$|According to Ovid, Myrrha was the {{daughter}} of King Cinyras and Queen Cenchreis of Cyprus. It is stated that Cupid was not <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for Myrrha's incestuous love for her father, Cinyras. Ovid further comments that hating one's father is a crime, but Myrrha's love was a greater crime. Ovid therefore blamed it on the Furies.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Michael excitedly {{starts a}} Willy Wonka-inspired promotional gimmick {{providing}} discounts to customers who receive golden tickets, then tries <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> the idea on Dwight when the promotion appears {{to cost the}} company {{a large amount of}} money. In a B story, Kevin receives conflicting romantic advice from Andy, Jim and Pam.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for this.

50|$|Various {{theories}} of victimology exist, each {{with the aim}} of explaining why certain people become victims of crimes, and why others do not. Some people view some theories in a negative light, believing that to conjecture as to the causes of victimisation is tantamount <b>to</b> <b>blaming</b> the victim for crime, at least partly.|$|R

5|$|Just as the furore {{appeared}} to have died down, in April 1952 Sydney's Daily Mirror published {{a letter from a}} reader, Jacob Raith. Responding to a letter in support of Barnes, Raith sided with the Board and suggested that his character was <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for the omission. Acting on legal advice, Barnes sued Raith for libel and engaged Sydney's leading barrister, Jack Shand KC, as counsel.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E
5|$|By early 2011, Hughes's {{velocity}} on {{his fastball}} was down several mph; John Harper of the New York Daily News speculated that Hughes's overuse of the cutter was <b>to</b> <b>blame,</b> not a dead arm. Hughes {{continued to use}} the cutter into {{the start of the}} 2012 season; he posted a 7.88 ERA in April, throwing the cutter about 12% of the time in this span. In early May, Hughes dropped the cutter from his repertoire, using it only 1.2% of the time {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Darby denied {{involvement}} with the murder, claiming that New Court partisans such as Francis P. Blair and Amos Kendall were seeking to defame him. He also countered that Eliza Sharp's letter to the New Court Argus was written by New Court supporters, including Kendall, the newspaper's editor. The claims and counterclaims {{between the two sides}} reached such an extreme that an 1826 letter in the New Court Argus suggested that New Court supporters had instigated Sharp's murder in order <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> Old Court partisans and affix a stigma to them.|$|E

50|$|An early {{example of}} this would {{possibly}} be the Krynnish elves of the Dragonlance series.

5|$|Deep Purple was {{practically}} {{ignored by the}} music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced {{up and down on}} the Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close to the success of its two predecessors.

5|$|Despite Germany's {{comparatively}} {{low expectations}} when for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team {{advanced to the}} finals; Kahn conceded only three goals {{in the course of}} the competition, two of which were in the Final.

Once the game was over with Brazil as the new champion, he stood alone and disappointed in his goal; nevertheless he refused <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> his injury for his mistake.|$|E
5|$|Drysdale also {{oversaw the}} first civil {{litigation}} trial, {{in which the}} owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo were equally <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster.|$|E
50|$|In {{the novel}} The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick, every major {{character}} uses bibliomancy, mainly by casting yarrow stalks {{in conjunction with}} the I Ching.
