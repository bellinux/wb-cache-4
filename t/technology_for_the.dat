The songs were written by The Buggles between 1977 and 1979, with contributions on several tracks from Bruce Woolley.

5|$|Internally, Salvin knocked through {{existing}} {{rooms to}} create the Outer Hall, a new gallery on the first floor, a billiard room, a new library and a drawing room. Much of the wooden 17th-century panelling in the parlour and the hall had to be stripped out {{as part of the}} renovations. As part of his work, Salvin appears to have used a number of rolled wrought-iron beams to span the resulting structural gaps in the building, an advanced use of that <b>technology</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time. The house was refurnished with newly bought 16th and 17th-century artwork, two brass Italian cannons and a stuffed polar bear.|$|E
5|$|The Halo series {{features}} voice work {{by television}} and film actors including Ron Perlman, Orlando Jones, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert Davi, and Terence Stamp. Voice acting became more important as Halo: Combat Evolveds sequels were developed; Halo 2 had 2,000 lines of combat dialogue, while Halo 3 has {{in excess of}} 14,000 lines. The actual <b>technology</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> trilogy changed very little; while some actors voiced their lines in remote locations, others traveled to Bungie to record their lines. In interviews, Halos voice actors stated {{that they had no}} idea that the games would become such a critical and commercial success. Steve Downes, the voice of the game's protagonist, stated that generally when a voice actor has finished their lines, their involvement with the game ends. As the characters in Combat Evolved were relatively undefined, the voice actors were given leeway to develop their own style and personality.|$|E

5|$|The game centres around Donkey Kong and {{his nephew}} Diddy Kong, who must recover their stolen hoard of bananas from King K. Rool and the Kremlings. Development {{of the game}} first began shortly after Rare's Tim and Chris Stamper ran {{experiments}} with a Silicon Graphics workstation, rendering realistic 3D sprites. Nintendo became interested in Rare's work and soon acquired 49% of the company which culminated {{in the production of}} a new title using Alias and SGI <b>technology</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> SNES console. The Stamper brothers expressed an interest to create a standalone Donkey Kong game, and assembled a team of 12 to work on the game over an 18-month development cycle.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, {{the company}} {{publicly}} introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio, including sensitive condenser microphones and rubber-line recorders (named after {{the use of}} a rubber damping band for recording with better frequency response onto a wax master disc). That May, the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J. Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures; he founded Vitagraph, in which Warner Bros. acquired a half interest, just one month later. In April 1926, Warners signed a contract with AT for exclusive use of its film sound <b>technology</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> redubbed Vitaphone operation, leading to the production of Don Juan and its accompanying shorts over the following months. During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents, the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company's sound-on-film competitors. Meanwhile, Bell Labs—the new name for the AT research operation—was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over loudspeakers at theater-filling volume. The new moving-coil speaker system was installed in New York's Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission, for what Western Electric called the No. 555 Receiver, was filed on August 4, just two days before the premiere of Don Juan.|$|E
