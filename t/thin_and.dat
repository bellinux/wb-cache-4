40|$|<b>Thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning forests {{established}} on revegetated mine pits in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests of south-west Australia is being {{considered as a}} management option to accelerate succession in sites with excessive tree densities. To {{assess the impact of}} <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning on reptiles and small mammals, we installed trapping grids in eight <b>thinned</b> <b>and</b> burned sites, each paired with untreated controls. Of the eight pairs, four were in rehabilitated sites (planted with nonlocal species) and four were in restored sites (seeded with local species). <b>Thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning had no significant impact on the small mammal community, although Cercatetus concinnus was more abundant in rehabilitated sites. In contrast, <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning significantly increased reptile abundance and species richness, with two species (Morethia obscura and Menetia greyii) only recorded in <b>thinned</b> <b>and</b> burned sites. We concluded that <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning was a successful management option in revegetated mine pits in jarrah forests, particularly because reptile communities created by <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning were more similar to those in unmined forest. Although published studies for comparison are few, we expect <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning to have generally positive effects on reptile communities in forest ecosystems where fire is an important disturbance agent. Our study emphasizes the importance of monitoring revegetated areas over time periods sufficient to detect deviations from desired successional trajectories, so that management options, such as <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> burning, can be implemented if required...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a stochastic forest growth {{model in}} which the manager is able to first thin the forest to promote better growth before harvesting. Both Wicksell single <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> harvesting cycle and Faustmann on-going rotation problems are considered. The Wicksell problem is analyzed by first restricting the class of decision times to (thinning, harvesting) pairs that bound the growth away from infinity and imbedding the problem in an infinite-dimensional linear program on a space of triplets of measures. These measures capture the <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> harvesting decisions along with {{the behavior of the}} growth process prior to harvest. An auxiliary linear program then leads to a nonlinear optimization problem for which an optimal value and solution are determined. The values of all the problems are be related through a set of inequalities. The solution of the nonlinear problem determines (random) <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> harvesting times for the single <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> harvesting cycle which demonstrate the equality of the values of these various problems. Finally for the Wicksell problem, the unrestricted class of <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> harvest times is shown to give the same value as the restricted class. The Faustmann on-going <b>thinning</b> <b>and</b> harvesting rotation problem is reduced to a Wicksell problem which then allows for the characterization of the value as the solution to a different nonlinear optimization problem. The effects of the opportunity to thin the forest are illustrated on a mean-reverting stochastic model.
