Commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks was prohibited in 1998, but this has been of limited effectiveness due to high bycatch mortality on multi-species gear. In addition, some 2,000 dusky sharks were caught by recreational fishers in 2003 despite the ban. In 2005, North Carolina implemented a time/area closure to reduce the impact of recreational fishing. To aid conservation efforts, molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed that can identify whether marketed shark parts (e.g. fins) are from prohibited species like the dusky shark, versus similar allowed species such as the sandbar shark.|$|E

500|$|Abundances of {{barndoor}} skate dropped precipitously in the 1960s and early 1970s, {{coinciding with the}} period of intense fishing by foreign factory trawlers.

30|$|The basic {{steps of}} <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> method {{presented}} in this section are summarized as the following algorithm.|$|R
30|$|In {{equinoctial}} months (April, October), <b>the</b> noon time <b>NmF</b> 2 {{values are}} in the range of 3 – 28 × 105 electron/cm 3, increasing with F 10.7 in the quiet and moderate geomagnetic activity condition, and NmF 2 at midnight is less than 13 × 105 electron/cm 3. The difference of <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 between noon and midnight is getting higher with increasing solar activity. The patterns of <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 variation for each geomagnetic activity conditions are very similar in winter month (January) and equinoctial months (April, October), except that <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 difference between noon and midnight is higher in winter than in other seasons, probably due to recombination during longer time after sunset. On the other hand, <b>the</b> pattern of <b>NmF</b> 2 in summer (July) is quite different from other seasons. Most NmF 2 values in July are less than 10 × 105 el/cm 3 even in high solar activity and <b>the</b> response of <b>NmF</b> 2 is very similar at noon and at midnight, resulting in only small NmF 2 difference between noon and midnight even in high solar activity. <b>The</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 responses with F 10.7 in January, and in July are consistent with those reported by Bremer (1998). Correlation coefficients at noontime for low geomagnetic activity condition are more than 0.86 for all months except summer months, when the data are scattered severely for Kp < 2.

500|$|In 1997, the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{listed the}} night shark as a [...] "Species of Concern", {{meaning that it}} merits {{conservation}} concern but there is insufficient evidence for listing on the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In 1999, <b>the</b> <b>NMFS</b> Fishery Management Plan (FMP) of the Atlantic tunas, swordfish, and sharks was revised to prohibit the retention of 19 species, including the night shark. The prohibition of this species was upheld by Amendment 1 of the FMP, added in 2003. Night sharks suffer high bycatch mortality on longlines, and prohibited or not some are kept by fishers because of their value {{and the difficulty of}} identifying disembodied parts to species. Nevertheless, a 20032008 NMFS population assessment concluded that night shark population in United States waters has stabilized (perhaps even increasing) and no longer merits categorization as a [...] "Species of Concern", though recommended that the prohibition on retention be maintained as a precautionary measure. This species should also benefit from the imposition of time/area closures in the Florida Straits and on the Charleston Bump. Off Brazil and elsewhere, fishing continues largely unmanaged. IUCN members have urged that Brazil improve catch monitoring and enforcement of existing regulations, declare some critical habitat off-limits, and implement the Brazilian National Plan of Action for Sharks (NPOA-Sharks) under the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks).|$|E

30|$|Non-negative tensor {{factorization}} (NTF), {{known as}} one of <b>the</b> multichannel <b>NMF</b> techniques, extends <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> idea to tensors. An n-way tensor is a generalization of the mathematical concepts of scalar, vector, and matrix (e.g., a two-way tensor is a matrix). Specifically, a three-way tensor, which can be regarded as a collection of multichannel spectrograms, is being investigated for use in NTF [10 – 12]. Extension to the third dimension provides another matrix that describes the energy distribution of each basis component on every channel, which can also be regarded as spatial information.

40|$|Abstract. The nonnegative matrix {{factorization}} (NMF) is a bound-constrained low-rank approximation {{technique for}} nonnegative multi-variate data. NMF {{has been studied}} extensively over the last years, but an important aspect which only has received little attention so far is a proper initialization of <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> factors {{in order to achieve}} a faster error reduction. Since <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> objective function is usually non-differentiable, discontinuous, and may possess many local minima, heuristic search al-gorithms are a promising choice as initialization enhancers for NMF. In this paper we investigate the application of five population based algorithms (genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, fish school search, differential evolution, and fireworks algorithm) as new initializa-tion variants for NMF. Experimental evaluation shows that some of them are well suited as initialization enhancers and can reduce <b>the</b> number of <b>NMF</b> iterations needed to achieve a given accuracy. Moreover, we com-pare the general applicability of these five optimization algorithms for continuous optimization problems, such as <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> objective function. ...|$|R
30|$|In Figs. 5 and 6, {{the changes}} of <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 values are {{dominated}} by the diurnal variation for all seasons, and maximum NmF 2 values increase with the solar activity except in July. In July, the representative month of summer, dependency of NmF 2 values on the solar activity is drastically reduced. Note that <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 patterns of low solar activity cases in July are significantly different from higher solar activity cases and their error bars are unusually large because sudden enhancements of NmF 2 during daytime occurred frequently in summer for the quiet period from 2006 to 2007, which {{will be discussed in}} Section 4. In most cases, <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 is minimized around 5 LT just before sunrise, and it rapidly increases after sunrise, obviously due to ionization by solar EUV flux. Dependency of geomagnetic activity on <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 values is not clear, although <b>the</b> maximum <b>NmF</b> 2 increases with geomagnetic activity in some cases. <b>The</b> maximum <b>NmF</b> 2 appears around 12 LT for all geomagnetic and solar activities in January and October, whereas the maximum is delayed by as much as 2 – 3 hours for the cases of low and moderate solar activity in April. In July, NmF 2 variations are too small to determine the maximum time reliably. In January, NmF 2 show particularly small error bars for all cases, compared to other seasons. Note that the error bars are sometimes omitted in the figure where reliable fitting cannot be made due to lack of data, especially for some cases of the high geomagnetic condition. The IRI- 2007 model well traces <b>the</b> Anyang <b>NmF</b> 2 values for most cases with noticeable departure for the cases of low solar activity in July.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method to {{incorporate}} priors on {{the solution of}} nonnegative matrix factorization (<b>NMF).</b> <b>The</b> <b>NMF</b> solution is guided to follow the {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) estimates of the weight combinations under a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior. The proposed algorithm can be used for denoising or single-channel source separation (SCSS) applications. NMF is used in SCSS in two main stages, the training stage and the separation stage. In <b>the</b> training stage, <b>NMF</b> is used to decompose the training data spectrogram for each source into a multiplication of a trained basis and gains matrices. In the separation stage, the mixed signal spectrogram is decomposed as a weighted linear combination of the trained basis matrices for the source signals. In this work, to improve the separation performance of <b>NMF,</b> <b>the</b> trained gains matrices are used to guide the solution of <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> weights during <b>the</b> separation stage. The trained gains matrix is used to train a prior GMM that captures the statistics of the valid weight combinations that the columns of the basis matrix can receive for a given source signal. In the separation stage, the prior GMMs are used to guide <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> solution of <b>the</b> gains/weights matrices using MMSE estimation. <b>The</b> <b>NMF</b> decomposition weights matrix is treated as a distorted image by a distortion operator, which is learned directly from the observed signals. The MMSE estimate of the weights matrix under the trained GMM prior and log-normal distribution for the distortion is then found to improve <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> decomposition results. <b>The</b> MMSE estimate is embedded within the optimization objective to form a novel regularized <b>NMF</b> cost function. <b>The</b> corresponding update rules for the new objectives are derived in this paper. The proposed MMSE estimates based regularization avoids the problem of computing the hyper-parameters and the regularization parameters. MMSE also provides a better estimate for the valid gains matrix.
