500|$|Rock 'n' Roll Circus {{received}} mixed to favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. [...] A staff reviewer from CD Journal praised the album's rock influences, and commended the album's production. Greg from Selective Hearing was positive towards the album. He commented, [...] "This {{was an excellent}} album and I couldn’t think of a single thing that could be wrong. It proves that Ayu is still {{at the top of}} her game." [...] However, he felt that [...] "Last Links", [...] "Lady Dynamite", [...] "Sexy Little Things", [...] "The Meaning Of Love", and [...] "Red Line -for TA-" [...] were the album's, [...] "standard cookie cutter fillers". Asian Junkie editor Random J reviewed the album on his personal blog, and awarded it seven stars. He stated, [...] "Rock 'n Roll Circus feels more accessible and easier to connect with than the likes of Guilty." [...] He later commented, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the few albums where Ayumi Hamasaki sounds comfortable and locked into its sound... The album title is a tad misleading, but we can forgive Ayumi Hamasaki for it, given that given the music is good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Attorney General Reilly {{certified}} {{the language}} and format of petitions as valid on September 7, 2005. Advocates of same-sex marriage objected that the proposed amendment was clearly designed to reverse the SJC decision, {{a violation of the}} state constitution's rule that amendments could not be used for that purpose. Deval Patrick, Reilly's principal opponent for the Democratic nomination for governor, said [...] "There was a strong argument that this should have gone a different way." [...] Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of those instances where the institution of gay marriage may be less divisive to society than the referendum campaign will be. The emotions that this kind of issue brings out can be very detrimental to society. It {{has been around for a}} year and any honest person can conclude that it has not been detrimental to society." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Paul Fedor, who had previously worked with the band for their 2002 video [...] "Capricorn (A Brand New Name)". 30 Seconds to Mars performed and presented the premiere of the video on August 29, 2005, on Fuse's Daily Download. In Canada, the video premiered on MuchMusic during MuchOnDemand on October 6, 2005, and was added to medium rotation {{a couple of days}} later. Jared Leto told MTV News that [...] "It's the first bestiality footage that you're ever going to see, but it's tastefully done. We're breaking new ground with this one." [...] The music video for the song was filmed during July and August 2005 in an abandoned hotel in Hollywood where the crew encountered prostitutes and drug addicts squatting prior to filming. The crew ended up doing 70 effects shots in 7 days. Throughout the video, effects are greatly used for visual enhancement over bandmembers and around the women depicted. Each frame of the video hides some messages. Fedor explained that was difficult to shoot the video, and commented [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of my best videos. Every shot in this one is perfect... Look for hidden messages in this one." [...] The video found success on Fuse, mtvU, MTV2 and MuchMusic.|$|E

As a result, intelligence analysts are drowning in information. The book explains how to navigate this rising flood and make best use of these new, rich sources of information.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. The show runner of The Simpsons at the time, Bill Oakley, <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the most [...] "beautifully" [...] directed episodes of the show. He called the [...] "hand-colouring" [...] very [...] "vivid" [...] and [...] "bright". The episode is the first Christmas episode the producers had done since the first episode of the series, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". Oakley said that nobody in the writing staff wanted to [...] "try on Christmas" [...] because it was [...] "so famous" [...] as being the first episode.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Flinders Petrie, a {{contributor}} of interesting experiments on kindred subjects to Nature, informs {{me that he}} habitually works out sums by aid of an imaginary sliding rule, which he sets in the desired way and reads off mentally. He does not usually visualise the whole rule, but only {{that part of it}} with which he is at the moment concerned (see Plate II. Fig. 34, where, however, the artist has not put in the divisions very correctly). I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the most striking cases of accurate visualising power it is possible to imagine.|$|E

[...] So it {{happened}} that Lord Lovel and Lady Anna went across the meadow together, down to the river, and sauntered along the margin till {{they came to the}} stepping-stones. He passed over, and she followed him, almost without a word. Her heart was so full, that she did not think now of the water running at her feet. It had hardly seemed to her to make any difficulty as to the passage. She must follow him whither he would lead her, but her mind misgave her,--that they would not return sweet loving friends as they went out. [...] "We won't climb," [...] said he, [...] "because it might try your ankle too much. But we will go in here by the meadow. I always <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the prettiest views there is," [...] he said, throwing himself upon the grass.|$|E
60|$|There don't {{seem to be}} any war news of {{importance}} very late. We have been fearfully disappointed with Sigel not making his junction from {{the lower part of the}} valley, and perhaps harassing Lee's left or left rear, which the junction or equivalent to it was an indispensable part of Grant's plan, we <b>think.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> great reason why things have lagged so with the Army. Some here are furious with Sigel. You will see he has been superseded. His losses [in] his repulse are not so important, though annoying enough, but it was of the greatest consequence that he should have hastened through the gaps ten or twelve days ago at all hazards and come in from the west, keeping near enough to our right to have assistance if he needed it. Jeff, I suppose you know that there has been quite a large army lying idle, mostly of artillery reg'ts, manning the numerous forts around here. They have been the fattest and heartiest reg'ts anywhere to be seen, and full in numbers, some of them numbering 2000 men. Well, they have all, every one, been shoved down to the front. Lately we have had the militia reg'ts pouring in here, mostly from Ohio. They look first rate. I saw two or three come in yesterday, splendid American young men, from farms mostly. We are to have them for a hundred days and probably they will not refuse to stay another hundred. Jeff, tell mother I shall write Wednesday certain (or if I hear anything I will write to-morrow). I still think we shall get Richmond.|$|E

5000|$|David Stratton, {{film critic}} for The Movie Show praised Bad Boy Bubby.

5000|$|Throughout his career, Petty {{extensively}} documented his concerts, {{beginning in}} the late seventies. [...] "I'm glad we did it.

5000|$|Marx wrote [...] "Now and Forever" [...] {{about his}} wife, actress Cynthia Rhodes. He has been quoted as saying: [...] "I {{was working on}} the fourth album and {{realized}} I had not written a song addressing our relationship since we had gotten married and had three kids. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of those songs which was unique in that the verses are so specific to our relationship." ...|$|E
5000|$|Carolyn See, a book critic from The Washington Post, {{said in her}} review: [...] "'Half the Sky' is a call to arms, a {{call for}} help, a call for contributions, but also a call for volunteers.

The author <b>thinks</b> that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the causes of the little value that companies grant to them.

He {{develops}} an attachment to Hannah, and I think a lot hinges on his ability to save her. In a series where House has virtually phoned in his diagnoses, here he is with his sleeves rolled up amputating a woman's leg. And still he can't save her.
