40|$|The {{ecophysiology}} of cold tolerance in many <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>animals</b> {{is based}} on water and its activity at low temperatures, affecting cell, tissue and whole organism functions. The normal body water content of invertebrates varies from 40 to 90 % of their live weight, which is influenced by water in their immediate environment, especially in species with a water vapour permeable cuticle. Water gain from, or loss to, the surrounding atmosphere may affect animal survival, but under sub-zero conditions body water status becomes more critical for overwinter survival in many species. Water content influences the supercooling capacity of many insects and other arthropods. Trehalose is known to maintain membrane integrity during desiccation stress in several taxa. Dehydration affects potential ice nucleators by reducing or masking their activity and a desiccation protection strategy has been detected in some species. When water crystallises to ice in an animal it greatly influences the physiology of nearby cells, even if the cells remain unfrozen. A proportion of body water remains unfrozen in many cold hardened invertebrates when they are frozen, which allows basal metabolism to continue at a low level and aids recovery to normal function when thawing occurs. About 22 % of total body water remains unfrozen from calculations using differential scanning calorimetry (compared with ca 19 % in food materials). The ratio of unfrozen to frozen water components in insects is 1 : 4 (1 : 6 for foods). Such unfrozen water may aid recovery of freezing tolerant species after a freezing exposure. Rapid changes in cold hardiness of some arthropods may be brought about by subtle shifts in body water management. It is recognised that cold tolerance strategies of many invertebrates are related to desiccation resistance, and possibly to mechanisms inherent in insect diapause, but the role of water is fundamental to them all. Detailed experimental {{studies are needed to}} provide information which will allow a more complete and coherent understanding of the behaviour of water in biological systems and aid the cryopreservation {{of a wide range of}} biological material...|$|E
40|$|Floodplain {{habitats}} in the alluvium of the Morava and Dyje rivers, Czech Republic, {{were strongly}} affected {{by changes in}} water regime conditioned by regulation measures in the past centuries. These negative changes resulted in the cessation of regular floods, decline of groundwater level and subsequently in dramatic changes of characteristic vegetation as well as animal assemblages. Therefore activities aimed at more thorough analysis and restoration and revitalization projects were undertaken in nineties. Specific extreme conditions in the regularly flooded biotopes are determining {{for the existence of}} the specific soil invertebrate assemblages including millipedes (Diplopoda), centipedes (Chilopoda) and terrestrial isopods (Oniscidea). Long termed pitfall trapping processed in forest and meadow habitats in the years 1993 - 2001 enable us to evaluate the impact of restoration of regular floods and improving water regime on these <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> While the <b>animal</b> assemblages in floodplain forest (Ranšpurk National Nature Reserve) showed to be more conservative towards restoration processes, those in flooded meadow (Křivé jezero National Nature Reserve) dramatically stressed by previous negative conditions well responded to improving water regime. Renewed inundations at this locality contributed to the return of parameters of natural wetland habitat.

40|$|<b>Terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> subsidize fish diets in lotic ecosystems. Seasonality {{strongly}} influences <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrate</b> {{abundance in}} temperate regions and alters their delivery to streams. Seasonal {{changes in the}} tropics are characterized by distinct wet and dry periods, with marked variation in invertebrate abundance. However, {{little is known about}} how these seasonal changes affect invertebrate subsidies and their ecological consequences for tropical streams. We measured the effect of rainfall and canopy density on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrate</b> falling input, as well as seasonal variation in falling input, benthic and drifting invertebrate, and Rivulus hartii (Hart’s Rivulus) diet composition during both the wet and dry seasons at three stream sites in Trinidad. Rates of input of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> showed seasonal trends in biomass and abundance. Rainfall magnitude and canopy density were directly correlated with falling input. The delivery of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> increased from an average of 52 mg m- 2 day- 1 to 72 mg m- 2 day- 1 from wet to dry season. Conversely, average benthic invertebrate abundance and biomass decreased from 382 mg m- 2 in the dry season to 130 mg m- 2 in the wet season, presumably due to displacement and mortality resulting from severe flow conditions. A 75 % increase in drifting invertebrate biomass was driven by a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrate</b> biomass that more than doubled during the wet season. Prey selectivity in Rivulus diets mirrored this seasonal variation in prey invertebrate availability, as percent composition of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrate</b> volume in Rivulus guts also doubled during the wet season. We conclude that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> are a substantial energetic subsidy for tropical river ecosystems, and the spatial and temporal variation in delivering these resources from wet to dry season have profound effects on consumer-resource dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> are important prey resources for trout, often providing about 50 % of their annual energy and having strong effects on growth and abundance. However, the importance of this prey resource in rangeland streams has received little attention, and there has been no experimental test of whether riparian grazing by livestock reduces this manual removal of woody riparian vegetation, affect trout populations by reducing <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrate</b> prey in central Wyoming streams. We tested three, short duration (2 - 11 d), grazing treatments: 1) moderate intensity grazing (10 - 15 cm stubble height), 2) high intensity grazing (5 - 7. 5 cm stubble height), 3) high intensity grazing plus removal of two-thirds of streamside woody vegetation, and 4) a control with no livestock grazing. Overall, short durations of moderate and high intensity grazing had little effect on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> entering streams, but grazing plus removal of streamside woody vegetation caused significant reductions in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrate</b> inputs to streams. In contrast, all experimental treatments reduced the biomass of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> in late-summer trout diet. However, these effects did not translate to reductions in trout populations. These results indicate that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> falling into streams may be relatively resistant to short, but intensive, bouts of grazing, and that grazing systems that incorporate short grazing bouts and maintain streamside woody vegetation, may also support the terrestrial prey resources necessary to sustain robust trout populations...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{terrestrial}} reliance of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and {{compared it to}} the potential prey available (macrozoobenthos and drifting invertebrates) in three temperate rivers (Galicia, NW Spain), with special emphasis on variations in terrestrial energy intake through the ontogeny of brown trout. Additionally, we paid particular attention to individual variation of terrestrial resource use within and between age classes. Prey items were grouped in four categories: i) aquatic invertebrates; ii) imagoes of aquatic invertebrates; iii) terrestrial invertebrates; and iv) fish prey. Next, energy composition was measured according to dry weight-energy equations for each individual in line with above-mentioned prey categories. Our findings illustrate that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> appeared to be scarce in the environment, whereas aquatic food resources were rather abundant and accessible. The use of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> tended to increase with age, but {{with a high degree}} of inter-individual variation in resource use. In fact, the individual reliance of brown trout on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> may vary considerably (between 0 % and 76. 9 %). Besides, the frequency of terrestrial foragers, i. e., individuals with <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> in their stomachs, increased with age, except in one population which had the maximum value in the age- 2 class. The acquisition of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> thus appears to be a process strongly dependent upon the actual food availability in the environment, but {{with a high degree of}} individual variance in resource use within the same age class. Finally, we discuss that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> may largely contribute to cover the energy intake of the species, highlighting the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and thereby the importance of riparian canopy cover as a key factor for food supply of stream-dwelling salmonids species. </p...|$|R

In this study, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, we evaluated the importance of introduced C 4 grasses {{as a source of}} carbon in aquatic food webs of headwater streams of the coastal Atlantic Forest located on the north coast of the State of S&# 227;o Paulo, in the southeastern region of Brazil. <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> were collected in two streams: one where the main land cover was pristine montane Atlantic Forest (forest stream) and another where the main land cover was introduced C 4 forage grasses for livestock (pasture stream). The average &# 948; 13 C of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> collected in the forest stream (&# 8722; 26. 3 &# 177; 2. 1 &# 8240;) was significantly (p< 0. 01) smaller than the average &# 948; 13 C of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> collected in the pasture stream (&# 8722; 15. 7 &# 177; 4. 7 &# 8240;), denoting a larger contribution of C 4 grasses to <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> of the pasture stream. The average &# 948; 15 N of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> of the forest stream (4. 1 &# 177; 2. 4 &# 8240;) was significantly (p< 0. 01) lower than the average &# 948; 15 N of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> of the pasture stream (9. 5 &# 177; 2. 7 &# 8240;). The relative contribution of C 3 and C 4 plants to <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> was estimated using SIAR. In the forest stream, the C 3 contribution was on average 0. 75 (0. 72 minimum to 0. 79 maximum), and the C 4 contribution was on average 0. 25 (0. 21 minimum to 0. 28 maximum). In the pasture stream, the C 3 contribution decreased to 0. 20 (0. 14 minimum to 0. 26 maximum), and the C 4 contribution increased to 0. 80 (0. 74 minimum to 0. 86 maximum). These results have several implications for the ecosystem functioning as well as for recent changes in environmental policies of Brazil. The lower nutritional value of C 4 grasses may not only decrease invertebrate performance, but also alter the stoichiometry of several components of the aquatic food webs with potential consequence for the whole ecosystem functioning. On the public policy side, recent changes in the Brazilian Forest Act, a series of laws that regulate land cover at the property level, reduced the width of the forested riparian area with potentially dangerous consequences for aquatic ecosystems...|$|R

The studies presented in this licentiate thesis focus on light and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> two factors influenced by riparian zone structure, which potentially affect stream ecosystems and thus also brown trout (Salmo trutta). Paper I is a laboratory experiment where I study size dependent foraging behavior on surface-drifting <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrates</b> and benthic invertebrates by brown trout. The results show a size-dependent difference in foraging ability with large trout being better able to use terrestrial surface prey than small trout. I argue that such ontogenetic foraging differences are due to both morphological constraints (eg. gape limitation) and size dependent behavioral differences related to predation risk. Paper II consists of a 5 month-long 2 x 2 factorial design field experiment where my objective {{was to examine the}} effects of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrate</b> input and solar radiation (PAR) on different trophic levels in a boreal headwater stream. More specifically, I followed the effects of increased light and decreased <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrate</b> subsidies on periphyton, benthic macroinvertebrates and two size classes of the top fish predator, brown trout. The results showed that the reduction of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>invertebrate</b> input had size- and seasonal-dependent effects on trout, where large trout had lower growth rates than small trout, mainly in summer. Diet analyses of trout supported growth differences in that large trout in unmanipulated enclosures consumed relatively more terrestrial prey than large trout living in enclosures with reduced terrestrial inputs. A higher reliance on terrestrial prey subsidies by large trout compared to small may be explained by ontogenetic differences in foraging and habitat choice. Despite a 2. 5 -fold increase in PAR, light did not have an effect on chlorophyll a biomass, nor was there an effect on the density or composition of benthic macroinvertebrates. The lack of effects on primary production may be explained by very low nutrient levels in the stream...|$|R
