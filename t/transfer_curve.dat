40|$|Controlling {{threshold}} voltage (V(TH)) and field-effect mobility (mu(FET)) in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) is of primary importance to attain reliable devices {{that can be}} harnessed in more complicated circuits and eventually commercialized. In particular hysteresis in OTFT <b>transfer</b> <b>curves</b> {{is an issue that}} has to be better understood and analyzed. In this regard, even if the interface between organic dielectric and organic semiconductor seems to play an important role, our study shows that a further and relevant factor is played by the transport of charges across the bulk of the dielectric layer. Here, an analytical approach is applied to identify and understand the different components that give rise to the hysteresis in the <b>transfer</b> <b>curves</b> of pentacene-based OTFTs using poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) cross-linked with ammonium dichromate (PVAad) as the (polymeric) gate dielectric. <b>Transfer</b> <b>curves</b> simulations which include charge transport in the PVA show a hysteretic behavior in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the hysteresis measured in OTFTs can be reduced by the insertion of an underlying dielectric layer of SiO(2) that blocks the above-mentioned effect. The residual contribution to the hysteresis is then analyzed by investigating the chemistry nature of both PVA and PVAad, which show different electron trapping efficiency at the interface with the pentacene layer. Therefore, a consistent explanation of how the polymeric dielectric is able to impact the <b>transfer</b> <b>curves</b> requires considering all mentioned factors...|$|R

These have been chosen to be similar to many real-world monitors and viewing conditions, in order to allow rendering to be fairly close to the specified values even without color management. User agents vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors. More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity; this is particularly important for Web-to-print applications.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reason the}} two signals, the RF and AF currents, can pass {{simultaneously}} through the amplifier without interfering {{is due to}} the superposition principle because the amplifier is linear. Since the two signals have different frequencies, they can be separated at the output with frequency selective filters. Therefore the proper functioning of the circuit depends on the amplifier operating in the linear region of its <b>transfer</b> <b>curve.</b> If the amplifier is significantly nonlinear, intermodulation distortion will occur and the audio signal will modulate the RF signal, resulting in audio feedback which can cause a shrieking in the earphone. The presence of the audio return circuit from the amplifier output to input made the reflex circuit vulnerable to such parasitic oscillation problems.|$|E

40|$|The {{charge carrier}} {{distribution}} in dual-gate field-effect transistors is investigated {{as a function}} of semiconductor thickness. A good agreement with 2 -dimensional numerically calculated <b>transfer</b> <b>curves</b> is obtained. For semiconductor thicknesses larger than the accumulation width, two spatially separated channels are formed. The cross-over from accumulation into depletion of the two channels in combination with a carrier density dependent mobility causes a shoulder in the transfer characteristics. A semiconducting monolayer has only a single channel. The charge carrier density, and consequently the mobility, are virtually constant and change monotonically with applied gate biases, leading to <b>transfer</b> <b>curves</b> without a shoulder.

Only the transmission and photocurrent data are needed with this method. The method allows to obtain the total optical coupling loss, internal quantum efficiency, and optical absorption coefficients when input optical power is low. We also developed a method to analyze optical absorption coefficient with the saturation effect. By using those methods, we investigated the dependence of the <b>transfer</b> <b>curves</b> on the input optical power in a multiple-quantum-well EAM. The optical loss saturation effect and the increase of device temperature are the dominant mechanisms for the dependence of <b>transfer</b> <b>curves</b> on the input optical power in the low bias region and the high bias region, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} our proposed technique AutoDomainMine that performs {{data mining}} guided by fundamental {{knowledge of the}} domain. The data being mined consists of input conditions from quenching experiments and the resulting heat transfer curves, i. e., plots of heat transfer coefficients versus part temperature. Since heat transfer coefficients characterize quenching, the estimation assists decision-making. This avoids running laboratory experiments which consume considerable time and resources. AutoDomainMine integrates two data mining techniques, clustering and classification, into a learning strategy. It clusters curves resulting from existing experiments and uses decision tree classifiers to learn the clustering criteria, i. e., input conditions characterizing the clusters. The learned criteria are used to design a representative pair of input conditions and heat <b>transfer</b> <b>curve</b> per cluster. The decision trees and representatives {{serve as the basis}} for estimation. When input conditions of an unperformed experiment are submitted, the decision tree path is traced to estimate its cluster and hence the corresponding heat <b>transfer</b> <b>curve.</b> Also when a desired heat <b>transfer</b> <b>curve</b> is submitted, it is compared with the representative curves. The input conditions of the closest matching curve are the estimated conditions to achieve the desired curve.
