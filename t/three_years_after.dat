5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (<b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
