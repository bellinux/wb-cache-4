40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparison}} between <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> in two nearly all sky redshift surveys: the ORS and the IRAS 1. 2 Jy.

We compare the spatial distribution of <b>the</b> two <b>void</b> populations and demonstrate the correlation between them. <b>The</b> <b>voids</b> also agree with regard to <b>the</b> overall <b>void</b> statistics [...] a filling factor of ~ 0. 45 of the volume, an average void diameter ~ 45 /h Mpc and an average galaxy underdensity in <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> of approximately - 0. 9. Our measurements of the underdensities of <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> in <b>the</b> two surveys enable us to estimate the relative bias in <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> between optical and IRAS samples.

40|$|Void {{coalescence}} {{and interaction}} in dynamic fracture of ductile metals {{have been investigated}} using three-dimensional strain-controlled multi-million atom molecular dynamics simulations of copper. The correlated growth of two <b>voids</b> during <b>the</b> coalescence process leading to fracture is investigated, {{both in terms of}} its onset and the ensuing dynamical interactions. Void interactions are quantified through the rate of reduction of the distance between <b>the</b> <b>voids,</b> through <b>the</b> correlated directional growth of <b>the</b> <b>voids,</b> and through correlated shape evolution of <b>the</b> <b>voids.</b> <b>The</b> critical inter-void ligament distance marking the onset of coalescence is shown to be approximately one void radius based on the quantification measurements used, independent of the initial separation distance between <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> and <b>the</b> strain-rate of the expansion of the system. The interaction of <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> is not reflected in the volumetric asymptotic growth rate of <b>the</b> <b>voids,</b> as demonstrated here. Finally, the practice of using a single void and periodic boundary conditions to study coalescence is examined critically and shown to produce results markedly different than the coalescence of a pair of isolated voids.

30|$|According to Paschen’s law of {{critical}} breakdown field in micrometre <b>voids,</b> <b>the</b> thin <b>voids</b> of a virgin (non-treated) material have high Ec. Therefore, the charge density of films with small voids {{is expected to}} be relatively small [6] compared to films with larger voids, assuming that both are charged under the same field. Large voids start to gain charge density at lower fields, and a higher piezoelectric coefficient d 33 is achieved {{by the end of the}} charging procedure [3, 6, 7, 8]. One method for actively increasing the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> is <b>the</b> Gas Diffusion Expansion (GDE) procedure. During GDE, the pressure surrounding the sample is increased resulting in gas diffusion in <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> of <b>the</b> material after a long period of time (20 – 60  min). The pressure is then released quickly. The gas does not have the time to diffuse out of <b>the</b> <b>voids,</b> causing their expansion in the thickness direction, thereby reducing the length/height ratio (aspect ratio) [9, 10]. Tuncer [9] simulated <b>the</b> <b>voided</b> part of <b>the</b> material by a rhomboidal-like mesh structure and found that the aspect ratio of <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> is a critical parameter for the overall stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>voided</b> structure and as a result for the stiffness of the material in third direction (c 33). However, neither the stiffness of the material nor the piezoelectric coefficient changes monotonically with the level of GDE [11]. Non-expanded and low expanded materials show a rapid increase of stiffness under compressive forces, as <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> collapse easily under small stresses due to their compliant structure (high aspect ratio). In this case, what is compressed is the bulk material rather than the air cavities, leading to high c 33 and low d 33. Expanding the film by GDE, and for moderate aspect ratios (still compliant voided structure), allows for higher strains to be applied, before <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> collapse, decreasing that way the c 33 and increasing the d 33. On the other hand, greater expansions lead to increment of c 33 as <b>the</b> <b>voided</b> structure becomes stiffer (low aspect ratio). Studies showed that the breakpoint that maximises the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and lowers the stiffness c 33 is close to a density ratio of about 0.46 [12, 13, 14].|$|R
40|$|Nacre, {{the inner}} {{iridescent}} layer of mollusc shells, {{is a typical}} example of a material that is formed by such biomineralization processes. Nacre is composed of the CaCO 3 -polymorph aragonite and a small amount (about 5 wt. %) of organic matter. The authors studied {{the structure of the}} aragonite platelets of Haliotis laevigata nacre, using conventional transmission electron microscopy, Z-contrast, electron tomography, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). The authors observed faceted voids several nanometers wide within the aragonite platelets. The electron tomography investigations showed that <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> are distributed more or less randomly in the studied specimen and allowed an estimation of the order of magnitude of the width and the volumetric content of <b>the</b> <b>voids.</b> <b>The</b> <b>voids</b> are located within the aragonite platelets, so that they are not an artifact of preparation. Furthermore, a first proposal for a three-dimensional model of <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> was made. EDX and EELS measurements revealed that <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> include a larger amount of carbon in comparison to the bulk material. The questions why these voids are formed and how have still to be answered. A speculative function of <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> could be <b>the</b> decreased propagation of cracks in the shell providing an increased fracture toughness...|$|R

The effects of <b>the</b> technological <b>voids</b> or <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> inside <b>the</b> soil were investigated. <b>The</b> technological <b>voids</b> {{are referred to as}} the macro-pores related to different interfaces involving the buffer material, whereas <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> inside <b>the</b> soil are referred to as common macro-pores within the compacted bentonite/sand mixture.

40|$|Voids {{are nearly}} empty {{regions in the}} Universe that can extend to {{millions}} of lightyears in size. They are a characteristic part of a complex bubble-like foam called the Large Scale Structure. It consists of dense nodes that are interconnected by a network of filaments and sheets, hence {{the origin of the}} alternative name, the Cosmic Web. We have developed an accurate method to find such <b>voids.</b> <b>The</b> method can even provide a classification of the overdense structures that surround <b>the</b> <b>voids.</b> This allows us to describe in one consistent way the building blocks of <b>the</b> Cosmic Web: <b>voids,</b> filaments and walls. Using our methods we are able to make accurate cosmographical maps of the Large Scale Structures in the nearby Universe. We show that <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> {{are an integral part of}} these mapped structures. For example their shape is deformed by strong tidal forces extorted by massive clusters that surround <b>the</b> <b>voids.</b> Such clusters are usually clustered into larger agglomerates called superclusters. Also <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> cluster, forming even more extended objects called supervoids. Such superclusters and supervoids align themselves to form larger entities called Great Walls, they appear to be common elements in the nearby Universe. On smaller scales we can also locate the lonely galaxies that reside in the midst of large and almost empty voids. Free from all the complexities in denser regions, the properties of such isolated galaxies tells us a lot about the general formation scenario of galaxies. For example one of our studied voidgalaxies is embedded within a voidwall and has an oddly configured gas-disk. The disk is not regularly oriented with its stars, but is aligned perpendicular to it, suggesting that cold gas has been accreted from out of <b>the</b> <b>voids.</b> <b>The</b> <b>voids</b> thus provides us with an unique and distinct perspective on the the Universe.
