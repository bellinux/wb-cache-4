5|$|With {{regards to}} {{digestive}} tract lesions, mild bleeding and mild resultant anemia is treated with iron supplementation, and no specific treatment is administered. There is limited data on hormone treatment and <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> to reduce bleeding and anemia. Severe anemia or episodes of severe bleeding {{are treated with}} endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) or laser treatment of any lesions identified; this may {{reduce the need for}} supportive treatment. The expected benefits are not such that repeated attempts at treating lesions are advocated. Sudden, very severe bleeding is unusual—if encountered, alternative causes (such as a peptic ulcer) need to be considered—but embolization may be used in such instances.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E

25|$|Also in 2010, the WOMAN (World Maternal Antifibrinolytic) trial began, a randomised, double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study of}} <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> in 20 060 women with post-partum haemorrhage. Enrollment {{was completed in}} 2016, and in April 2017, the results were published and showed that <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> reduced death in the 10,036 treated women versus the 9985 on placebo with no adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> tablets {{that may}} also reduce loss {{by up to}} 50%. This may be {{combined}} with hormonal medication previously mentioned.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> and {{aminocaproic acid}} inhibit fibrinolysis, {{and lead to}} a de facto reduced {{bleeding}} rate. Before its withdrawal, aprotinin was used in some forms of major surgery to decrease bleeding risk and need for blood products.|$|E
25|$|The {{antifibrinolytic}} agents epsilon amino {{caproic acid}} and <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> are useful adjuncts {{in the management}} of vWD complicated by clinical hemorrhage. The use topical thrombin JMI and topical Tisseel VH are effective adjuncts for correction of hemorrhage from wounds.|$|E
25|$|In {{acquired}} angioedema, HAE types I and II, and nonhistaminergic angioedema, antifibrinolytics such as <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> or ε-aminocaproic acid may be effective. Cinnarizine {{may also}} be useful because it blocks the activation of C4 {{and can be used}} in patients with liver disease, while androgens cannot.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tranexamic</b> <b>acid,</b> a {{medication}} to promote blood clotting, {{may also be}} used to reduce bleeding and blood transfusions in low-risk women, however evidence as of 2015 was not strong. A 2017 trial found that it decreased the risk of death from bleeding from 1.9% to 1.5% in women with postpartum bleeding. The benefit was greater when the medication was given within three hours.|$|E
25|$|During her {{lifetime}} {{she was unable}} to persuade obstetricians at Kobe to trial the antifibrinolytic agent, which had become a drug on the WHO list of essential medicines in 2009. She lived to see the 2010 beginning of the study of <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> in 20 000 women with post-partum haemorrhage, but died before its completion in 2016 and the publication of tranexamic acids fatality preventing results in 2017, that she had predicted.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the baby}} has been {{delivered}} placental management becomes an issue. In normal deliveries the contraction of uterus provides a powerful mechanism to control blood loss, however, in an abdominal pregnancy the placenta is located over tissue that cannot contract and attempts of its removal {{may lead to}} life-threatening blood loss. Thus blood transfusion is frequent {{in the management of}} patients with this kind of pregnancy, with others even using <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> and recombinant factor VIIa, which both minimize blood loss.|$|E
25|$|For low-grade, {{unilateral}} stage-IA cancers, {{only the}} involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This {{can be done}} especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed. If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed. <b>Tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> can be administered prior to surgery to {{reduce the need for}} blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.|$|E
25|$|Thrombosis, presumably from overactive {{inhibition}} of the fibrinolytic system, may occur {{at a higher}} rate, but until 2006 there was limited evidence for this association. Similarly, while biochemical measures of renal function were known to occasionally deteriorate, {{there was no evidence}} that this greatly influenced outcomes. A study performed in cardiac surgery patients reported in 2006 showed that there was indeed a risk of acute renal failure, myocardial infarction and heart failure, as well as stroke and encephalopathy. The study authors recommend older antifibrinolytics (such as <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid)</b> in which these risks were not documented. The same group updated their data in 2007 and demonstrated similar findings.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{involves}} decreasing known {{risk factors}} including if possible procedures {{associated with the}} condition and giving the medication oxytocin to stimulate the uterus to contract shortly after the baby is born. Misoprostol may be used instead of oxytocin in resource poor settings. Treatments may include: intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, and the medication ergotamine to cause further uterine contraction. Efforts to compress the uterus using the hands may be effective if other treatments do not work. The aorta may also be compressed by pressing on the abdomen. The World Health Organization has recommended non-pneumatic anti-shock garment to help until other measures such as surgery can be carried out. In 2017 study found that <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> decreased a woman's risk of death.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{evidence}} from people with {{other health problems}} crystalloid and colloids {{are believed to be}} equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may reduce mortality in those with severe disease as well as the risk of re-bleeding and the need for surgery among this group. Oral and intravenous formulations may be equivalent; however, the evidence to support this is suboptimal. In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance. There is tentative evidence of benefit for <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> which inhibits clot breakdown. Somatostatin and octreotide, while recommended for varicial bleeding, have not been found to be of general use for non variceal bleeds. After treatment of a high risk bleeding ulcer endoscopically giving a PPI once or a day rather than as an infusion appears to work just as well and is less expensive (the method may be either by mouth or intravenously).|$|E
2500|$|... was a Japanese {{medical doctor}} {{working as a}} medical {{scientist}} who discovered <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> in the 1950s in her quest to find a drug that would treat bleeding after childbirth (post-partum haemorrhage). After publishing results in 1962 she became a chair at Kobe Gakuin University, where she worked from 1966 until her retirement in 1990. Okamoto's career was hampered by a very male dominated environment.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> {{decreases}} {{the mortality rate}} in people who are bleeding due to trauma. It [...] only appears to be beneficial, however, if administered within the first three hours after trauma. For severe bleeding, for example from bleeding disorders, recombinant factor VIIaa protein that assists blood clottingmay be appropriate. While it decreases blood use, {{it does not appear}} to decrease the mortality rate. In those without previous factor VII deficiency, its use is not recommended outside of trial situations.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II and the Second Sino-Japanese War {{respectively}} in 1945, {{she moved}} to Keio University in Shinanomachi in Tokyo. As resources were scarce, {{she and her husband}} Shosuke Okamoto changed to research on blood: [...] "If there was not enough we could simply use our own". They hoped to find a treatment for post-partum haemorrhage, a potent drug to stop bleeding after childbirth. They began by studying epsilon-amino-caproic acid (EACA). They then studied a related chemical, 1-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane-4-carboxylic acid (AMCHA), also known as <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid.</b> The Okamotos found it was 27 times as powerful and thus a promising hemostatic agent and published their findings in the Keio Journal of Medicine in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{evidence}} from people with {{other health problems}} crystalloid and colloids {{are believed to be}} equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding. In people with a confirmed peptic ulcer, there is conflicting evidence if proton pump inhibitors reduce death rates, but PPIs do reduce the risk of re-bleeding and the need for surgery among this group. In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance. [...] <b>Tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> might be effective to reduce mortality, but the evidence for this is weak. But the evidence is promising. Somatostatin and octreotide while recommended for varicial bleeding have not been found to be of general use for non varicial bleeds.|$|E
2500|$|On October 25, 2007, the FDA {{issued a}} {{statement}} regarding the [...] "Blood conservation using antifibrinolytics" [...] (BART) randomized trial in a cardiac surgery population. The preliminary findings suggest that, compared to other antifibrinolytic drugs (epsilon-aminocaproic acid and <b>tranexamic</b> <b>acid)</b> aprotinin may {{increase the risk of}} death. [...] On October 29, 2006 the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that aprotinin may have serious kidney and cardiovascular toxicity. The producer, Bayer, reported to the FDA that additional observation studies showed that it may increase the chance for death, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure and strokes. FDA warned clinicians to consider limiting use to those situations where the clinical benefit of reduced blood loss is essential to medical management and outweighs the potential risks. On November 5, 2007, Bayer announced that it was withdrawing [...] Aprotinin because of a Canadian study that showed it increased the risk of death when used to prevent bleeding during heart surgery.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{synthetic}} analog of the amino acid lysine. It {{serves as an}} antifibrinolytic by reversibly binding four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen or plasmin. This prevents plasmin from binding to and degrading fibrin and preserves the framework of fibrin's matrix structure. <b>Tranexamic</b> <b>acid</b> has roughly eight times the antifibrinolytic activity of an older analogue, ε-aminocaproic acid.|$|E
