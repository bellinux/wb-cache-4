5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
5|$|Granulated sugars {{are used}} at the table, to {{sprinkle}} on foods and to sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add sweetness and <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied fruits, jams, and marmalades.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{prepared}} with toppings such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazes, dusted with granulated sugar or cinnamon-sugar, or served plain without any topping. The {{shape of the}} doughnut can lend to the retention of a greater amount of glaze or other toppings compared to other doughnut styles. The old-fashioned doughnut may have a similar <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> that of a buttermilk doughnut, may be crisp in texture, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface.|$|E

5000|$|With Bit Boy!!, Bplus {{wanted the}} game to [...] "spark true retro {{feelings}} in all gamers, regardless of age", which led to it being set across multiple video game generations. The first three Bit Generations feature increasingly detailed 2D graphics (including {{the use of the}} authentic NES color palette in Bit Boy 2), the latter generations evolve from using simple polygonal shapes and blurry <b>textures</b> <b>to</b> complex models and sharp photo realistic <b>textures</b> <b>to</b> illustrate the evolution of the three-dimensional visuals.|$|R
25|$|Distilled absinthe {{employs a}} method of {{production}} {{similar to that of}} high quality gin. Botanicals are initially macerated in distilled base alcohol before being redistilled to exclude bitter principles, and impart the desired complexity and <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> the spirit.|$|E
25|$|The {{softness}} of old mirrors is sometimes replicated by contemporary artisans {{for use in}} interior design. These reproduction antiqued mirrors are works of art and can bring color and <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> an otherwise hard, cold reflective surface.

25|$|White chocolate, {{although}} {{similar in}} <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> that {{of milk and}} dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids. Because of this, many countries do not consider white chocolate as chocolate at all. Because it does not contain any cocoa solids, white chocolate does not contain any theobromine, {{so it can be}} consumed by animals.|$|E

25|$|Inflammatory {{breast cancer}} is a {{particular}} type of breast cancer which can pose a substantial diagnostic challenge. Symptoms may resemble a breast inflammation and may include itching, pain, swelling, nipple inversion, warmth and redness throughout the breast, as well as an orange-peel <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> the skin referred to as peau d'orange. As inflammatory breast cancer does not present as a lump there can sometimes be a delay in diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|His chanson {{settings}} were famous, {{and influential}} in assisting {{the transformation of}} the chanson from the previous light, dance-like, four-part <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> the late-century style of careful text setting, emotionalism, greater vocal range, and larger number of voices. Cross-influence with the contemporary Italian form of the madrigal was obvious, but chansons such as those by Certon retained a lightness and a rhythmic element characteristic of the French language itself.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{increased}} internationalization of cuisines and food supply, foie gras is increasingly found in hot preparations {{not only in}} the United States, but in France and elsewhere. Duck foie gras ("foie gras de canard") has slightly lower fat content and is generally more suitable in <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> cooking at high temperature than is goose foie gras ("foie gras d'oie"), but chefs have been able to cook goose foie gras employing similar techniques developed for duck, albeit with more care.|$|E
25|$|In Mandatory Palestine, {{demand for}} kosher canned meats {{increased}} as Spam became more popular during World War II. Canned meat was briefly mentioned during wartime from 1939–43, but the true boom in kosher canned meat came in 1945. This is when kosher canned meat became the key item in Europe's Jewish war victim relief packages. Then in 1946, the Chicago Kosher Sausage Manufacturing Company registered a patent for a kosher canned meat product called Breef. Made of beef, Breef {{has a similar}} <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> Spam but tastes like corned beef.|$|E
25|$|This bond has {{alternating}} {{stretching and}} heading courses, with the headers centred over {{the midpoint of}} the stretchers, and perpends in each alternate course aligned. Queen closers appear as the second brick, and the penultimate brick in heading courses. A muted colour scheme for occasional headers is sometimes used in English bond to lend a subtle <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> the brickwork. Examples of such schemes include blue-grey headers among otherwise red bricks—seen in the south of England—and light brown headers in a dark brown wall, more often found in parts of the north of England.|$|E

25|$|Most {{varieties}} of Malvasia {{are closely related}} to Malvasia bianca. One notable exception is the variety known as Malvasia di Candia which is a distinctly different sub-variety of Malvasia. Malvasia bianca is grown widely throughout the world in places like Italy, the San Joaquin Valley of California, the Greek Islands of Paros and Syros, the Canary Islands, Rioja and Navarra. Throughout central Italy, Malvasia is often blended with Trebbiano to add flavor and <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> the wine. In Rioja, it performs a similar function when blended with Viura.|$|E
25|$|The antilopine {{kangaroo}} (Macropus antilopinus) is, essentially, the far-northern {{equivalent of}} the eastern and western grey kangaroos. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the antilopine wallaroo, but in behaviour and habitat it is more similar to red and grey kangaroos. Like them, it is a creature of the grassy plains and woodlands, and gregarious. Its name comes from its fur, which is similar in colour and <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> that of antelopes. Characteristically, the noses of males swell behind the nostrils. This enlarges nasal passages and allows them to release more heat in hot and humid climates.|$|E
25|$|The menus of many American {{restaurants}} {{during the}} 19th century included a Hamburg beefsteak that was often sold for breakfast. A variant of Hamburg steak is the Salisbury steak, {{which is usually}} served with a gravy similar in <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> brown sauce. Invented by Dr. James Salisbury (1823–1905), the term Salisbury steak {{has been used in}} the United States since 1897. Nowadays, in the city of Hamburg as well as in parts of northern Germany, this type dish is called Frikadelle, Frikandelle, or Bulette, which is similar to the meatball. The term hamburger steak was replaced by hamburger by 1930, which has in turn been somewhat displaced by the simpler term, burger. The latter term is now commonly used as a suffix to create new words for different variants of the hamburger, including cheeseburger, porkburger, baconburger and mooseburger. There are other foods with names derived from German cities that are shortened in different ways in American English. An example is the frankfurter, often abbreviated as frank.|$|E
50|$|Parameterization {{was mainly}} used for mapping <b>textures</b> <b>to</b> surfaces. Recently, {{it has become}} a {{powerful}} tool for many applications in mesh processing.

25|$|The stains or mineral powder (such as Hematite) are earth {{colors in}} various hues of brown, black, green, and blue. These colors are also accented by the {{original}} colors of the clay (red, white, or gray) to provide a further rich texture. After the stain {{is applied to the}} ceramic piece, Al-Zahawi would use a cloth with turpentine to remove some of the stain and reveal the texture of clay and patterns of the rib tool. The stain is then protected by a transparent wax that has limited shine but nevertheless allows the colors and shades of the stain and the rich <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> become more pronounced. Al-Zahawi has also experimented with engraving designs on the surface of certain sculptures to bring out a particular area or special form. With staining versus glazing, these engravings are extenuated and truly give the art a unique and exotic feel.|$|E
25|$|Texture mapping is {{a method}} for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a computer-generated graphic or 3D model. Its {{application}} to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr Edwin Catmull in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) {{to the surface of}} a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon. Procedural textures (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and bitmap textures (created in an image editing application or imported from a digital camera) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as UV mapping (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for polygon surfaces, while non-uniform rational B-spline (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used as texture coordinates. Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating normal maps and bump maps that correspond to a <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> simulate height and specular maps to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as environment mapping to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.|$|E
500|$|Nückel {{engraved}} his {{plates with}} a multiple tool (also called a lining tool), {{a sort of}} chisel that cuts multiple parallel lines at once, which gives a mechanical hatching <b>texture</b> <b>to</b> the print.
