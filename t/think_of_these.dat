25|$|Nimzowitsch's chess theories, {{when first}} propounded, flew {{in the face}} of widely held orthodoxies enunciated by the {{dominant}} theorist of the era, Siegbert Tarrasch, and his disciples. Tarrasch's rigid generalizations drew on the earlier work of Wilhelm Steinitz, and were upheld by Tarrasch's sharp tongue when dismissing the opinions of doubters. While the greatest players of the time, among them Alekhine, Emanuel Lasker and Capablanca, clearly did not allow their play to be hobbled by blind adherence to general concepts that the center had to be controlled by pawns, that development had to happen in support of this control, that rooks always belong on open files, that wing openings were unsound—core ideas of Tarrasch's chess philosophy as popularly understood—beginners were taught to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> generalizations as unalterable principles.|$|E

2500|$|Cass’s {{third major}} {{contribution}} to economic theory was {{his work on}} general equilibrium with incomplete markets, work which grew out of his exploration {{of the question of}} existence of sunspot equilibria in models with incomplete asset markets. [...] Cass’s follow-on work on existence and determinacy of general equilibrium in models with incomplete asset markets spawned another large literature which {{has come to be known}} simply as GEI. [...] As an historical note, Cass never really liked this terminology, preferring instead to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> models as ones of General Financial Equilibrium (GFE) to emphasize the presence of financial assets and the frictions these introduced.|$|E

2500|$|The Cuban Ministry of the Interior claimed [...] {{that the}} three September 4, 1997 bomb attacks [...] against three hotels in Havana, which killed one person, were planned and {{controlled}} by CANF. CANF has denied the allegations. However, a former {{board member of the}} group has stated that several of its leaders planned attacks in Cuba during the 1990s. In 1997, the CANF published a statement supporting un-conditionally all terrorist attacks against Cuba; the CANF chairman at the time stated that [...] "We do not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> as terrorist actions". For his part, Posada has claimed to be responsible for planning six bombings at Havana hotels and restaurants during 1997.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002 Navetta and Lombardo joined Stevenson for {{a reunion}} {{performance}} by the Descendents' original power trio lineup at Stevenson's Stockage festival in Fort Collins, Colorado. According to Lombardo, they also recorded some songs for a potential future release: [...] "We recorded some of my songs in 2006 at The Blasting Room. In 2002 we recorded {{a whole bunch of}} songs, mostly Frank's songs. He was a great songwriter. He had such a unique EQ out of his amp. When we recorded later in 2008, we did some more of my songs, but Frank wasn't there for that. We tried to recreate that unique Frank sound. I'd like to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> as songs that if the Descendents had stayed together, this is what we would have sounded like. Those are in Bill's hands. Milo has said from the get-go that he would record it, but he hasn't yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Davis {{moved to}} Hollywood to screen test for Universal Studios. Davis {{and her mother}} {{traveled}} by train to Hollywood and arrived on December 13, 1930. She later recounted her surprise that nobody from the studio was there to meet her at the train. [...] In fact, a studio employee had waited for her, but left because he saw nobody who [...] "looked like an actress". She failed her first screen test, but was used in several screen tests for other actors. In a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, she related the experience with the observation, [...] "I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. They laid me on a couch, and I tested fifteen men...They all had to lie {{on top of me}} and give me a passionate kiss. Oh, I thought I would die. Just thought I would die." [...] A second test was arranged for Davis, for the 1931 film A House Divided. Hastily dressed in an ill-fitting costume with a low neckline, she was rebuffed by the director William Wyler, who loudly commented to the assembled crew, [...] "What do you <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> dames who show their chests and think they can get jobs?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In the [...] "Bad Nauheim Debate" [...] (1920) between Einstein and (among others) Philipp Lenard, {{the latter}} stated the {{following}} objections: He criticized {{the lack of}} [...] "illustrativeness" [...] of Einstein's version of relativity, a condition that he suggested could only be met by an aether theory. Einstein responded that for physicists the content of [...] "illustrativeness" [...] or [...] "common sense" [...] had changed in time, so it {{could no longer be}} used as a criterion for the validity of a physical theory. Lenard also argued that with his relativistic theory of gravity Einstein had tacitly reintroduced the aether [...] under the name [...] "space". While this charge was rejected (among others) by Hermann Weyl, in an inaugural address given at the University of Leiden in 1920, shortly after the Bad Nauheim debates, Einstein himself acknowledged that according to his general theory of relativity, so-called [...] "empty space" [...] possesses physical properties that influence matter and vice versa. Lenard also argued that Einstein's general theory of relativity admits the existence of superluminal velocities, in contradiction to the principles of special relativity; for example, in a rotating coordinate system in which the Earth is at rest, the distant points of the whole universe are rotating around Earth with superluminal velocities. However, as been pointed out by Weyl, it's not possible to handle a rotating extended system as a rigid body (neither in special nor in general relativity)—so the signal velocity of an object never exceeds the speed of light. Another criticism that was raised by both Lenard and Gustav Mie concerned the existence of [...] "fictitious" [...] gravitational fields in accelerating frames, which according to Einstein's Equivalence Principle are no less physically real than those produced by material sources. Lenard and Mie argued that physical forces can only be produced by real material sources, while the gravitational field that Einstein supposed to exist in an accelerating frame of reference has no concrete physical meaning. Einstein responded that, based on Mach's principle, one can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> gravitational fields as induced by the distant masses. In this respect the criticism of Lenard and Mie has been vindicated, since according to the modern consensus, in agreement with Einstein's own mature views, Mach's principle as originally conceived by Einstein is not actually supported by general relativity, as already mentioned above.|$|E
