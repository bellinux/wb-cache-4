Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice." ...|$|R
40|$|Self-harm {{is common}} among adolescents. Recent {{research}} {{has attempted to}} understand the prevalence and the reasoning behind self-harm. The present study aimed to investigate 1) whether the reasons given for self-harm differed according to how long ago the self-harming behaviour occurred, and 2) whether motives (Cry of pain vs. cry for help) given at baseline were able to predict repetition of self-harm over <b>a</b> 6 <b>month</b> period. 988 school pupils aged 15 - 16 years completed a self-report questionnaire (modified version of the Child and Adolescent Self-Harm in Europe study) at two time points 6 months apart. The motive “to get relief from a terrible state of mind” was the most endorsed reason for self-harm (boys and girls). The least commonly endorsed reasons were the cry for help or ‘manipulative’ reasons. To investigate whether there were any differences in the reasons assigned to the behaviour {{as a result of}} when self-harm last occurred (less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> between <b>a</b> <b>month</b> and <b>a</b> year, more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year) multinomial regression analysis was conducted. This analysis highlighted that the adolescents who had most recently self-harmed (less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month)</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} endorse the reason “I wanted to punish myself” <b>than</b> the over <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> but less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year, and the adolescents who had last self-harmed more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year ago. In addition, logistic regression was conducted to establish whether the reasons for self-harming endorsed at T 1 were able to predict self-harm 6 months later (T 2). This analysis revealed that pupils who endorsed “I wanted to find out whether someone really loved me” at T 1 were significantly less likely to self-harm at T 2, whilst pupils who endorsed “wanting to get relief from a terrible state of mind” at T 1 were significantly more likely to self-harm at T 2. The results are discussed in relation to their implications for educational mental health provision...|$|R

This was more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago,</b> and there had come not a single word from him. All that vague distrust which Brooks had sometimes felt in the man was rekindled and increased, and with it came a flood of bitter thoughts. Another opportunity then was to be lost. For seven years longer these thousands of pallid, heart-weary men and women were to suffer, with no one to champion their cause. He saw again that sea of eager faces in the market-place, lit with a sudden gleam of hope as they listened to the bold words of the man who was promising them life and hope and better things. Surely if this was a betrayal it was an evil deed, not passively to be borne.|$|E

The continued excellence of the play of the Australian backs therefore surprised the spectators.

5000|$|The August 29, 2014 Super Viernes {{professional}} wrestling show {{hosted the}} finals of Mexican wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libres (CMLL) annual Universal Championship tournament. In previous weeks Último Guerrero and La Sombra had both won their qualifying round {{to head to}} the finals of the tournament. Guerrero had previously won the 2009 Universal Championship tournament and La Sombra had won the 2011 tournament, which meant {{that for the first time}} ever there would be a two time winner of the Universal Championship. Both Guerrero and La Sombra had been involved in separate storylines up until this point, Último Guerrero continued his several-years long feud with Atlantis while La Sombra had been part of an emerging group known as Los Ingobernables that had headlined a large number of CMLL shows in 2014. The tournament finals was the only tournament match to be contested under [...] "best two-out-of-three falls rules and saw Último Guerrero win the first and third fall to become the first ever two time Universal Championship tournament winner. In the second to last match of the night long time rivals Negro Casas and Rush found themselves on opposite sides of a Six-man tag team match as they clashed to carry on the feud that had seen Negro Casas shaved bald less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> and Casas and partner Shocker defeat Rush and La Máscara to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. Another issue in the semi-main event was the ongoing storyline between former partners Rey Escorpión and Dragón Rojo Jr. that began when Dragón Rojo Jr. decided to leave the Rey Escorpión led Los Revolucionarios del Terror ("The Revolutionaries of Terror") a few months prior. The betrayal led to an ongoing rivalry between the two, a rivalry that had already seen Dragón Rojo Jr. successfully defend the CMLL World Middleweight Championship against his Rey Escorpión on the August 8 Super Viernes show. Casas and Rey Escorpión were joined by Niebla Roja as they took on Rush, Dragón Rojo Jr. and Atlantis, defeating the trio by disqualification when Rush caused his team to lose after a low blow on Casas. The fourth match of the night was used to showcase a quickly developing feud between Rey Cometa and Cavernario, a storyline that would lead to a featured match on the CMLL 81st Anniversary Show only a few weeks later. Rey Cometa, Máscara Dorada and Valiente took on the group known as La Peste Negra ("The Black Plague"; Cavernario, El Felino and Mr. Niebla). In the third and deciding fall La Peste Negras disregard for the rules got the team disqualified for excessive violence on Rey Cometa.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus is}} on the Mekong River Commission’s (MRC) {{governance}} of the resources of the Mekong River and its tributaries. The great economic growth over the last years in the South East Asia has increased the demand for energy correspondingly. The way to fulfill these increased energy demands is to a large extent expected to be meet through the generation of hydroelectric energy. In the last two decades hydropower dams have been constructed on the Mekong tributaries with huge consequences for the surroundings, and not more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> was the Nam Theun II dam in Lao PDR completed both altering the flow of the river up- and downstream, with consequences for over 120. 000 peoples living along its banks. The MRC was finally established by Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam in 1995, with the goal to secure a sustainable development and an equal utilization of resources between the four member states. However, an investigation {{of the structure of the}} MRC and the formulations of the mutual agreement, has given a clear indication that the MRC in practical terms does not have any authoritative to approve or disapprove proposed projects. Most recently the MRC has been asked to assist in the formulation of a Strategic Impact Assessments on 11 hydropower proposals on the Mekong Mainstream. However evidence indicates that projects are so far ahead, that the conclusions here will be of no importance to the decision makers. The question is whether the MRC member states are prepared to delegate sovereignty to the mutual governance for a sustainable development in the future? - or whether they will keep utilizing the resources until total depletion? – the tragedy of the commons...|$|E
40|$|Less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> I was in North Korea {{seeing the}} sights and {{engaging}} in some general research into the philosophical mood of its people. After exploring the desolate, zombie-like town of Kaesong, I happened upon a small shop selling {{such things as the}} North’s own brand of Coca-Cola, stamps with Kim Jung Il’s face on them, a myriad of different types of Chinese medicine and, of all things, a manhwa – the Korean name for manga – containing some of the most impressive art I had ever seen; indeed, to my utter surprise, the images in the North Korean manhwa filled me with a deep yearning for something quite inexplicable. Naturally, as a professor of philosophy, I felt obliged to investigate this phenomenon further. And as I did so, I started to realize that certain manga and anime – arguably, the two most sacred objects of otaku culture – have been stirring in me these kinds of feelings ever since I could remember. As a result of this, I immediately came to see that it did not matter whether the culture producing the anime and manga was largely atheistic, like North Korea, Shinto-Buddhist, like Japan, or Christian, like the USA: otaku culture produced anywhere and by any type of believer or nonbeliever seemed to be capable of awakening in me what Plato calls eros and Rudolph Otto calls the numinous. As I moved beyond my own personal reflections to see what scholars of otaku culture have already written on this subject, I found some precedent for my own ideas in the work of Teri Silvio, who has examined the relationship between religious icons and character toys in Taiwan, i Hiroshi Yamanaka, who has discussed “pop cultural spirituality” in the work of Hayao Miyazaki, ii and Susan Napier, who, influenced by Roger Aden’s book Popular Stories and Promised Land: Fan Cultures and Symbolic Pilgrimages, has written about western otaku making “pilgrimages to Akihabara” and has wisely labelled certain anime and manga chatrooms “sacred spaces. ” iii Nevertheless, while I agreed with the insights of all these scholars, I felt they did not go far enough in linking their observations to larger philosophical issues. Thus, in this paper I would like to explore the idea of spiritual longing in otaku culture, firstly, by elucidating Plato’s eros and Otto’s numinous, and then, secondly, by examining a few examples from anime and manga which have instilled in me, or others I know, a deep desire for something that {{can only be described as}} mysterious, irreducible and spiritual...|$|E
