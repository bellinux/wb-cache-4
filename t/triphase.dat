40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to apply <b>triphase</b> catalytic technique to catalyze allylation of sodium phenoxide with allyl bromide for synthesizing ally phenyl ether by conducting nucleophilic substitutions in the organic solution in solid-liquid-liquid system. The product allyl phenyl ether is used in the production of insecticides, herbicides, delation agent of coronary artery, dropping agent of blood pressure, tranquilizer and thermoplastic resins. Macroporous and microporous polymer supports were prepared for the immobilization of different active functional groups. The <b>triphase</b> reaction was carried out in a stirred batch reactor under mild operating conditions. A kinetic model was also proposed to describe allylation in the solid-liquid-liquid <b>triphase</b> system and the experimental data were well described by the pseudo-first-order kinetics. For the experimental data shown, when the agitaton speed exceeds 350 rpm, the external mass transfer resistance can be ignored. The overall reaction rates decrease with increasing the mean particle size. This demonstrates that the allylation of sodium phenoxide is controlled by the combination of intraparticle diffusion and intrinsic reaction under <b>triphase</b> conditions. Moreover, the characteristics and structure of the catalyst support also affect the catalytic efficiency. With the same degree of crosslinking, macroporous catalysts have higher activities than microporous catalysts do. The reactivity of the recovered catalyst only loses less than 5 % of that of fresh catalyst after 5 times of recovery. This result indicates that the stability of the catalyst prepared in the present study is good {{to be used in the}} allylation of sodium phenoxide. Other factors influencing the performance of the supported catalyst were also studied. The ion-exchange reaction is one of the fundamental processes of S-L-L <b>triphase</b> reactions. In this work, we also proceed the ion-exchange reaction by <b>triphase</b> catalysts for sodium phenoxide solution. The kinetics for the ion-exchange reaction between <b>triphase</b> catalysts and imbibed organic solvent/water solution have been studied to understand <b>triphase</b> reaction mechanism in more detail. The kinetics model proposed can be applied to describe the experimental data of the ion-exchange process successfully. Under the intraparticle diffusion-controlled kinetics, three variables including concentration of the solution, reaction temperature and types of organic solvents have been identified important to affect the ion-exchange rate. 本研究主要探討以三相觸媒催化酚鈉鹽之丙烯化反應去合成丙烯基苯基醚。產物丙烯基苯基醚是一種用途非常廣泛的中間原料，由此化合物可合成殺蟲劑、除草劑等農藥化學品；冠狀動脈擴張劑、血壓下降劑、中樞神經鎮靜劑等醫藥化學品，以及高經濟價值的熱固性高分子樹脂等。而後，製備巨孔與微孔高分子擔體，進行不同活性官能基之觸媒固定化實驗，三相反應以一溫和操作條件在批式攪拌反應器中進行。提出一反應機構來描述固-液-液三相系統之醚化反應，且利用產率之虛擬一階方程式可以完整、清楚地解釋實驗結果。實驗結果：當攪拌速率超過 350 rpm 時，其外部質傳阻力可忽略不計。總反應速率隨平均粒徑的增加而降低，這顯示在三相反應系統下，酚鈉鹽之醚化反應同時受粒內擴散與本質反應之影響。然而，觸媒的特性與結構也影響著觸媒反應活性，相同交聯度下，巨孔隙觸媒活性較微孔隙觸媒活性佳。由觸媒回收反應性來看，結果顯示反應性依回收的次數依次緩慢降低，但差距並不是很大，約在 5 %左右，為頗佳之觸媒穩定性。而其他影響固定化觸媒性能之因素也有詳細的探討。 由於，離子交換反應是重要的三相反應過程之一，故使用三相觸媒對酚鈉鹽進行離子交換反應，探討三相觸媒在水-油溶液中進行離子交換反應之動力學，來充分瞭解三相反應之機制。經由實驗數據可導出一動力式來描述此離子交換之過程。在粒內控制下，下列三種變因即溶液起始濃度、反應溫度與有機溶劑效應等，對離子交換速率均有重要之影響。中文摘 [...] - I 英文摘要 [...] III 誌謝 [...] Ⅴ 目錄 [...] VI 圖目錄 [...] -VIII 表目錄 [...] XIV 符號說明 [...] XVI 第一章 緒論 1 1 - 1. 三相相間轉移催化反應簡介 [...] 1 1 - 2. 離子交換反應 [...] - 12 1 - 3. 醚化反應 [...] - 20 1 - 4. 研究目的與方法 [...] - 26 第二章 實驗藥品與設備 29 2 - 1. 實驗藥品 [...] - 29 2 - 2. 實驗裝置與儀器 [...] - 31 2 - 3. 校正曲線 [...] - 37 第三章 以高分子擔體製備三相觸媒及其特性分析 41 3 - 1. 前言 [...] - 41 3 - 2. 實驗步驟 [...] - 42 3 - 3. 實驗結果與討論 [...] - 53 3 - 4. 結論 [...] - 57 第四章 三相觸媒之離子交換反應動力學 59 4 - 1. 前言 [...] - 59 4 - 2. 實驗步驟 [...] - 60 4 - 3. 反應動力學模式 [...] - 62 4 - 4. 實驗結果與討論 [...] - 69 4 - 5. 結論 [...] - 94 第五章 三相觸媒催化酚鈉鹽之醚化反應動力學 97 5 - 1. 前言 [...] - 97 5 - 2. 實驗步驟 [...] - 99 5 - 3. 反應動力學模式 [...] - 100 5 - 4. 實驗結果與討論 [...] - 107 5 - 5. 結論 [...] - 161 第六章 總結 [...] - 165 參考資料 [...] - 171 自述 [...] - 17...|$|E

This <b>triphase</b> consists of the PBA gel swelled in the organic phase and the water phase containing Cu(II) Br- 2 and hexamethylated tris(2 -aminoethyl) amine (Me- 6 -TREN). Addition of at least 10 % hexanes or other nonpolar and non-disproportionating solvents to the ethanol-water reaction mixture transforms SET-LRP of BA from a triphasic to a biphasic system. A synergistic effect was observed in the biphasic system, which {{was caused by the}} addition of hexanes that corresponds to a volumetric ratio of 4 / 3 / 3 for ethanol/hexanes/water, when the volume fraction of hexanes (phi(Hex)) is constant at 0. 3, and 4 / 4 / 2 while the volume fraction of water (phi(H 2 O)) is constant at 0. 2.

In solid-liquid-liquid system, the product yield was obtained above 86 % within 3 hr of reaction using small amount of solid catalyst with the properties of 1. 38 % divinylbenzene crosslinked, particle size of 40 - 80 mesh,tributylamine activated, and macropore-mouth type, and the overall reaction rate decreased with increasing the mean particle size. This demonstrates that the esterification of sodium benzoate is controlled by the combination of intraparticle diffusion and intrinsic reaction under <b>triphase</b> conditions. Moreover, the characteristics and structure of the catalyst support also affect the catalytic efficiency. With the same degree of crosslinking, macroporous catalyst with tributylamine activated has higher activities than microporous catalyst does. The effects of operating parameters, including agitation speed, reaction temperature, amounts of catalyst, types of solvents, molar ratio of reactants, type of phase-transfer catalysts, volume ratio of aqueous, and so on, were all performed to find the optimal reaction conditions. With increasing of agitation speed, reaction temperature and amounts of catalyst, the reaction rate increased. The catalytic efficiency of functional group used as trioctylphosphine was best than trialkylamines. The ion-exchange reaction is one of the fundamental process of solid-liquid-liquid <b>triphase</b> reactions. We also proceed the ion-exchange reaction by <b>triphase</b> catalysts for sodium benzoate solution to know the formation and variation of the active intermediate (PhCOOQ) during the reaction.

40|$|The {{importance}} of phase transfer catalysis (PTC) {{in the production}} of high value chemicals has grown immensely over the past few years. PTC may be a suitable method to synthesize a product whenever each reactant is miscible in a different phase. By addition of a PT catalyst, which functions as a ferrying agent between the phases, significant rate enhancements can be achieved;The PT catalyst (e. g. a quaternary ammonium salt) is usually used in soluble form. Alternatively, it can be bound to a solid support. The latter technique is called <b>triphase</b> catalysis (TPC). It has operational advantages over conventional PTC due to its potential use in continuous processes. However, the solid support (usually a porous polymer) induces diffusional limitations and consequently reduces overall reaction rates;The objective of the present research is to develop a method to determine external mass transfer coefficients since many TPC systems may be film diffusion limited under typical reaction conditions. A rotating disk contactor (RDC) has been specifically designed for this purpose. From the data obtained from this unit, it is possible to calculate mass transfer coefficients of several reaction systems and to suggest a general equation that correlates the Sherwood number to the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers;In view of conflicting reports on the efficacy of supported PTC, a comparative assessment of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts has been made for different mechanistic categories of PTC systems. It is possible to identify conditions under which the supported catalyst performs distinctly better than its soluble counterpart. The solubility of the homogeneous catalyst in the organic phase is found {{to be the most important}} factor in determining catalytic activity. Under certain conditions, polarity changes of the organic bulk phase induces autocatalytic behavior, an observation not hitherto made. In conclusion, it can be stated that certain categories of heterogenized catalysts perform better than their soluble counterparts for some reactions, notwithstanding their natural predilection to hinder reaction by diffusional limitation. This fact, coupled with the operational advantages of <b>triphase</b> catalysis, opens up the distinct possibility of its acceptance by industry...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel gold bellflower (GBF) {{platform}} with multiple-branched petals, prepared by a liquid-liquid-gas <b>triphase</b> interface system, for photoacoustic imaging (PAI) -guided photothermal therapy (PTT). Upon near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, the GBFs, with strong NIR absorption, showed very strong PA response and an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency (≈, ～ 74 %) among the reported photothermal conversion agents. The excellent performance in PAI and PTT is mainly {{attributed to the}} unique features of the GBFs: (i) multiple-branched petals with an enhanced local electromagnetic field, (ii) long narrow gaps between adjacent petals that induce a strong plasmonic coupling effect, and (iii) a bell-shaped nanostructure that can effectively amplify the acoustic signals during the acoustic propagation. Besides the notable PTT and an excellent PAI effect, the NIR-absorbing GBFs may also find applications in NIR light-triggered drug delivery, catalysis, surface enhanced Raman scattering, stealth, antireflection, IR sensors, telecommunications, and the like. ? 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|The {{sulfonated}} reduced graphene oxide (S-rGO) as {{supports and}} size-controlled Pt nanoparticles (NPs) for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) catalysts was investigated. The S-rGO was fabricated by a lyophilization-assisted method from a liquid mixture of GO and (NH 4) 2 SO 4 with a subsequent thermal treatment in inert gas. Sulfonic acid groups were grafted on GO {{and a reduction}} of GO was achieved simultaneously. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) results showed a uniform deposition of Pt NPs on S-rGO (Pt/S-rGO) with a {{narrow particle size distribution}} ranging from 2 to 5 nm in diameter. A higher catalytic activity of this novel Pt/S-rGO catalyst was revealed in comparison with that of Pt/GO, Pt/rGO and conventional Pt/C catalysts by cyclic voltammetry and oxygen reduction reaction measurements due to an enhanced <b>triphase</b> boundary. Significantly, the Pt/S-rGO catalyst also presented an excellent electrochemical stability. This new catalyst thus holds a great potential application in PEMFCs in terms of enhanced activity and durability...|$|E
40|$|This letter reports {{synchronization}} {{phenomena and}} mathematical modeling on a frustrated system of living beings, or Japanese tree frogs (Hyla japonica). While an isolated male Japanese tree frog calls nearly periodically, {{he can hear}} sounds including calls of other males. Therefore, the spontaneous calling behavior of interacting males {{can be understood as}} a system of coupled oscillators. We construct a simple but biologically reasonable model based on the experimental results of two frogs, extend the model to a system of three frogs, and theoretically predict the occurrence of rich synchronization phenomena, such as <b>triphase</b> synchronization and 1 : 2 antiphase synchronization. In addition, we experimentally verify the theoretical prediction by ethological experiments on the calling behavior of three frogs and time series analysis on recorded sound data. Note that the calling behavior of three male Japanese tree frogs is frustrated because almost perfect antiphase synchronization is robustly observed in a system of two male frogs. Thus, nonlinear dynamics of the three-frogs system should be far from trivial...|$|E

40|$|Most {{techniques}} for power system analysis model the grid by exact electrical circuits. For instance, in power flow study, state estimation, and voltage stability assessment, {{the use of}} admittance parameters (i. e., the nodal admittance matrix) and hybrid parameters is common. Moreover, network reduction techniques (e. g., Kron reduction) are often applied to decrease the size of large grid models (i. e., with {{hundreds or thousands of}} state variables), thereby alleviating the computational burden. However, researchers normally disregard the fact that the applicability of these methods is not generally guaranteed. In reality, the nodal admittance must satisfy certain properties in order for hybrid parameters to exist and Kron reduction to be feasible. Recently, this problem was solved for the particular cases of monophase and balanced <b>triphase</b> grids. This paper investigates the general case of unbalanced polyphase grids. Firstly, conditions determining the rank of the so-called compound nodal admittance matrix and its diagonal subblocks are deduced from the characteristics of the electrical components and the network graph. Secondly, the implications of these findings concerning the feasibility of Kron reduction and the existence of hybrid parameters are discussed. In this regard, this paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for various applications in power system analysis...|$|E

To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic value of quantification of liver tumor microvascularization using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) measured continuously from the arterial phase {{to the late}} phase (3 minutes). Material and Methods. We present a retrospective analysis of 20 patients with malignant (n = 13) or benign (n = 7) liver tumors. The tumors had histopathologically been proven or clearly identified using contrast-enhanced reference imaging with either 1. 5 [*]T MRI (liver specific contrast medium) or <b>triphase</b> CT and follow-up. CEUS was performed using a multifrequency transducer (1 – 5 [*]MHz) and a bolus injection of 2. 4 [*]mL sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles. A retrospective perfusion analysis was performed to determine TTP (time-to-peak), RBV (regional blood volume), RBF (regional blood flow), and Peak. Results. Statistics revealed a significant difference (P < 0. 05) between benign and malignant tumors in the RBV, RBF, and Peak but not in TTP (P = 0. 07). Receiver operating curves (ROC) were generated for RBV, RBF, Peak, and TTP with estimated ROC areas of 0. 97, 0. 96, 0. 98, and 0. 76, respectively. Conclusion.

40|$|The present work aims {{to study}} {{mechanical}} nonlinearities {{detected in the}} accelerometric records during a thermodiffusion experiment performed at the International Space Station, ISS. In that experiment the test cell was subjected to harmonic vibrations of different frequencies and amplitudes. Accelerometric data associated to the runs were downloaded from NASA PIMS website. Second order spectral analysis shows that the shaker modifies the normality of the data and introduces nonlinearities {{in the distribution of}} energy. High Order Spectral Analysis, HOSA, based on the bispectrum, bicoherence, trispectrum and tricoherence functions enabled us to study the kind of these nonlinearities. Additionally, a new method using the biphase and <b>triphase</b> histograms helps us to assess if quadratic and/or cubic phase coupling mechanisms are responsible for the anomalous nonlinear energy transfer detected. Finally, the RMS acceleration values are investigated to check if the vibratory limit requirements of the ISS are exceeded. This methodology is important not only in generic research of aerospace engineering but also in space sciences in order to help space researchers to characterize more globally their experiments. It is mentioned finally that HOSA techniques are not new, but never have been used in the analysis of accelerometric data coming from the IS...|$|E
40|$|We present {{numerical}} {{results from}} phase-field simulations of the buoyancy-driven detachment of an isolated, wall-bound pendant emulsion droplet acted upon by surface tension and wall-normal buoyancy forces alone. Our theoretical approach follows a diffuse-interface model for partially miscible binary mixtures {{which has been}} extended to include the influence of static contact angles other than 90 degree, based on a Hermite interpolation formulation of the Cahn boundary condition as first proposed by Jacqmin [J. Fluid Mech. 402, 57 (2000) ]. In a previous work, this model has been successfully employed for simulating <b>triphase</b> contact line problems in stable emulsions with nearly immiscible components, and, in particular, applied to the determination of critical Bond numbers for buoyancy-driven detachment {{as a function of}} static contact angle. Herein, the shapes of interfaces at pinchoff are investigated as a function of static contact angle and distance to the critical condition. Furthermore, we show numerical results on the nonequilibrium surface tension that help to explain the discrepancy between our numerically determined static contact angle dependence of the critical Bond number and its sharp-interface counterpart based on a static stability analysis of equilibrium shapes after numerical integration of the Young-Laplace equation. Finally, we show the influence of static contact angle and distance to the critical condition on the temporal evolution of the minimum neck radius in the necking regime of drop detachment...|$|E
40|$|Oily {{wastewater}} {{is always}} a threat to biological and human safety, {{and it is a}} worldwide challenge {{to solve the problem of}} disposing of it. The development of interface science brings hope of solving this serious problem, however. Inspired by the capacity for capturing water of natural fabrics and by the underwater superoleophobic self-cleaning property of fish scales, a strategy is proposed to design and fabricate micro/nanoscale hierarchical-structured fabric membranes with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity, by coating scaly titanium oxide nanostructures onto fabric microstructures, which can separate oil/water mixtures efficiently. The microstructures of the fabrics are beneficial for achieving high water-holding capacity of the membranes. More importantly, the special scaly titanium oxide nanostructures are critical for achieving the desired superwetting property toward water of the membranes, which means that air bubbles cannot exist on them in water and there is ultralow underwater-oil adhesion. The cooperative effects of the microscale and nanoscale structures result in the formation of a stable oil/water/solid <b>triphase</b> interface with a robust underwater superoleophobic self-cleaning property. Furthermore, the fabrics are common, commercially cheap, and environmentally friendly materials with flexible but robust mechanical properties, which make the fabric membranes a good candidate for oil/water separation even under strong water flow. This work would also be helpful for developing new underwater superoleophobic self-cleaning materials and related devices...|$|E

In order to achieve it, the companies of generation and they of distribution apply regulations and fines to the big companies and factories that they don't fulfill certain ranges in the utilization of the electricity. One of the parameters to respect is the power factor (pf), the phase difference that is produced between the voltage vector and the current vector. In {{the case of the}} factories, that in their majority relies on motors (inductive element), a backwardness of the current is produced with concerning the voltage, producing loss in the lines of transmission, for it should be corrected this problem. With the utilization of semiconductors of capacity, it are succeeded in getting increase the efficiency in the utilization of the resources already available, so much in the part of control like in the own element managed by these. Like for example: the utilization of changer frequency for the starts of motors, the utilization of rele of state solid.

It with her get excited the rotor of a motor <b>triphase,</b> in order to have control on the value of the fp. In this process of rectification for tall current should look after another of the parameters that are regulated, like him is the generation of harmonics in the line, the which degenerate the quality of the form of wave sinusoidal that gives the company. In order to avoid this problem it are proceeded to carry out a design of two <b>triphase</b> rectifiers, formed by six thyristors (converter of 6 pulses), that is connected in parallel to achieve current output, forming the called converter of 12 pulses, that reduces the quantity of harmonics. In order to could interconnect the two converter of 6 pulses, it are needed to make by means of a transformer of it couple and to can make the converter of twelve pulses, the transformer that feeds at two of 6, it is of characteristic very special, with a winding primary in connection wye and, two windings secundaries, one connected in wye and the other in star, to achieve the good operation of the group. Also the part of control of shooting of the thyristors should be adequate to this system of 12 pulses. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería en Electrónica.
