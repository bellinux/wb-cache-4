40|$|The {{classification}} of blind relevance feedback (BRF) terms {{described in this}} paper aims at increasing precision or recall by determining which terms decrease, increase or do not change the corresponding information retrieval (IR) performance metric. Classification and IR experiments are performed on the German and English GIRT data, using the BM 25 retrieval model. Several basic memory-based classifiers are trained on dierent feature sets, grouping together features from different query expansion (QE) approaches. Combined classifiers employ {{the results of the}} basic classifiers and correctness predictions as features. The best combined classifiers for German (English) yield 22. 9 % (26. 4 %) and 5. 8 % (1. 9 %) improvement for <b>term</b> <b>classification</b> wrt. precision and recall compared to the best basic classifiers. IR experiments based on this <b>term</b> <b>classification</b> have also been performed. Filtering out different types of BRF terms shows that selecting feedback terms predicted to increase precision improves the average precision significantly compared to experiments without BRF. MAP is improved by + 19. 8 % compared to the best standard BRF experiment (+ 11 % for German).

In this study, we re-examine this assumption and show {{that it does not}} hold in reality – many expansion terms identified in traditional approaches are indeed unrelated to the query and harmful to the retrieval. We also show that good expansion terms cannot be distinguished from bad ones merely on their distributions in the feedback documents and in the whole collection. We then propose to integrate a <b>term</b> <b>classification</b> process to predict the usefulness of expansion terms. Multiple additional features can be integrated in this process. Our experiments on three TREC collections show that retrieval effectiveness can be much improved when <b>term</b> <b>classification</b> is used.

Recognizing and classifying biomedical terms in these texts {{is an important step}} for developing efficient techniques for knowledge discovery and information extraction from the literature. This paper presents a new technique for biomedical <b>term</b> <b>classification</b> in biomedical texts. The method is based on combing successful feature selection techniques (MI, X 2) with machine learning (SVM) for biomedical <b>term</b> <b>classification.</b> We utilize the advances in feature selection techniques in IR and use them to select the key features for term identification and classification. We evaluated the method using Genia 3. 0 corpus with about 3, 000 to more than 34, 000 biomedical term instances. The technique is effective, achieving impressive accuracy, precision, and recall; and with F-score approaching ~ 90 %, the method is superior or very competitive with the recently published results.

This domain-adaptive method yields good results even when trained on relatively small training corpora. It can be applied to different real-world applications, which need domain-relevant ontology, for example, information extraction, information retrieval or text classification. 1...|$|E
