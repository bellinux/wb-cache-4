5|$|Chamberlain decided <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the House of Commons, and {{was adopted}} as Unionist {{candidate}} for Birmingham Ladywood. After the war ended, {{a general election}} was called almost immediately. He was elected with almost 70% of the vote {{and a majority of}} 6,833. He was 49 years old, which remains to date the oldest age at which any future Prime Minister has first been elected to the Commons.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{chose not}} <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the House of Commons in the 1930 federal election, citing health reasons. The Conservatives gained a {{majority}} in the election, and party leader R. B. Bennett became Prime Minister. Diefenbaker continued a high-profile legal practice, and in 1933, ran for mayor of Prince Albert. He was defeated by 48 votes in an election in which over 2,000 ballots were cast.|$|E

50|$|In the formula, plyr <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> player, PTS <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> points, FGA <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> {{field goal}} attempts, REB <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> rebounds, AST <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> assists, STL <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> steals, BLK <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> blocks, PF <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> {{personal}} fouls, and <b>TO</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> turnovers. The award {{was given to}} the player with the highest point total.|$|R
5|$|In response, {{a series}} of {{potential}} heirs {{seem to have been}} selected, among them Tiberius and his brother Drusus. In 24BC at the age of seventeen Tiberius entered politics under Augustus' direction, receiving the position of quaestor, and was granted the right <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> election as praetor and consul five years in advance of the age required by law. Similar provisions were made for Drusus.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{symbol for}} Venus {{is the same}} as that used in biology for the female sex: a circle with a small cross beneath. The Venus symbol also {{represents}} femininity, and in Western alchemy stood for the metal copper. Polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity, and the symbol for Venus has sometimes been understood <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the mirror of the goddess.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} encourages Siva's {{friends to}} ask him <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the student-union presidency, but {{he wants them to}} nominate Naresh (one of the group) instead. Ganesh's attempts to pacify Siva fail, and Bhavani learns about him. He considers Siva a potential replacement for J. D., whose weakness annoys him.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{personal}} {{effects of the}} characters that were familiar to the public {{were added to the}} sets. The prologue and climactic scene in the Granita restaurant was shot on location in the restaurant itself. Frears subdued Berrington's performance to avoid portraying Cherie as too much of a Lady Macbeth figure; in the scene where Cherie encourages Blair <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the leadership, Frears had Berrington stand with her back towards the camera. Editing and post-production went on until September. Some historical events—such as the Sheffield Rally and footage of the 1997 general election—were too costly to refilm so archive footage was used instead. Adam Curtis assisted in the editing of the archive footage.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith's nephew Henry Frank Peterson came to {{work with}} her at the library, and began to {{organize}} the books into a faceted classification scheme that she specified, one which used one- and two-digit numbers <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> general subjects, and three-digit numbers to indicate individual books in that subject. Before this, Coolbrith had resisted library trustee attempts to classify the books; she had wished to continue the reading-room atmosphere that she had established.|$|E
5|$|Even liberal {{senators}} were agitated by {{the proposed}} changes, fearing their own lands would be confiscated. Senators arranged for other tribunes {{to oppose the}} reforms. Tiberius then appealed to the people, and argued that a tribune who opposes {{the will of the}} people in favour of the rich is not a true tribune. The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> a second term.|$|E

5|$|Fascism {{has been}} {{prescribed}} dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform {{presented in the}} Fascist manifesto in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary {{groups such as the}} fasci femminilli and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from Prime Minister Benito Mussolini's more conservative coalition partners.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the referendum, Walker was {{encouraged}} <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the Senate by a petition of over 6500 signatures. A staunch free trader, Walker campaigned as part of the Free Trade Party's endorsed ticket. He had resigned as president of the Bank of New South Wales in 1897, but remained a director. At the first federal election in March 1901, Walker was elected as a New South Wales Senator {{at the head of the}} poll.|$|E
5|$|In 367BC, plebeians {{were allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the consulship, and this implicitly opened both the {{censorship}} {{as well as}} the dictatorship to plebeians. Around this time, the practice of electing military tribunes with consular authority was dropped. In 366BC, in an effort by the patricians to reassert their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. These two offices, the praetorship and the curule aedileship (so-called because its holder, like consuls and praetors, had the right to sit in a curule seat), were at first open only to patricians, but within a generation they were open to plebeians as well.|$|E

5|$|In 449 BC, the Senate promulgated the Twelve Tables as the {{centerpiece}} of the Roman Constitution. In 443 BC, the office of Censor was created, and in 367 BC, Plebeians were allowed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the Consulship. The opening of the Consulship to the Plebeian class implicitly opened both the Censorship as well as the Dictatorship to Plebeians. In 366 BC, in an effort by the Patricians to reassert their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. While these two offices, the Praetorship and the Curule Aedileship, were at first open only to Patricians, within a generation, they were open to Plebeians as well.|$|E
5|$|In early 2005, Miliband {{resigned}} his advisory role to HM Treasury <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> election. Kevin Hughes, {{then the}} Labour MP for Doncaster North, announced in February {{of that year}} {{that he would be}} standing down at the next election due to being diagnosed with motor neurone disease. Miliband applied for selection to be the candidate in the safe Labour seat and won, beating off a close challenge from Michael Dugher, then a SPAD to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} 1950s, Constantine {{supported}} the campaign, led by James, to appoint West Indies cricket's first black captain; {{the success of}} black people like Constantine in attaining government positions while not permitted to captain the cricket team was {{a key factor in}} an ultimately successful campaign. While in government, Constantine assisted {{in the development of the}} West Indies Federation, as a step towards the independence of the islands, and his fame and familiarity with Britain played some part in the negotiations which led to Trinidad's independence in 1962. After he decided not <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> re-election in 1961, Williams appointed him as Trinidad and Tobago's first High Commissioner in London.|$|E

5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|Now outside Parliament, Odlum {{maintained}} {{his presence in}} the public eye through meetings and the work of his newspaper, The Crusader. His revenge over the Labour Party finally occurred during the 1987 general election, when the PLP split the vote and denied his old allies victory. In 1995 he accepted the position of Ambassador to the United Nations from Compton, his old enemy, holding it for only a year. When Compton resigned in 1996, Odlum chose <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> election against his successor and lost the contest.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May, Livingstone {{called a}} caucus of his supporters; announcing his intent to {{challenge}} McIntosh's leadership, he invited those assembled <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> other GLC posts. The meeting ended at 4:45pm having {{agreed on a}} full slate of candidates. At 5 o'clock, McIntosh held a GLC Labour meeting; the attendees called an immediate leadership election, in which Livingstone defeated him by 30 votes to 20. The entire left caucus slate was then elected. The next day, a leftist coup deposed Sir Ashley Bramall on the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA), replacing him with Bryn Davies; the left group now controlled both the GLC and the ILEA.|$|E
