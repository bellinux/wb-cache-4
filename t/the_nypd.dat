5|$|The New York City Fire Department {{deployed}} 200 units (half of the department) to the World Trade Center. Their {{efforts were}} supplemented by numerous off-duty firefighters and emergency medical technicians. The New York City Police Department sent Emergency Service Units and other police personnel, and deployed its aviation unit. Once on the scene, the FDNY, <b>the</b> <b>NYPD,</b> and the PAPD did not coordinate efforts and performed redundant searches for civilians. As conditions deteriorated, <b>the</b> <b>NYPD</b> aviation unit relayed information to police commanders, who issued orders for its personnel {{to evacuate the}} towers; most NYPD officers were able to safely evacuate before the buildings collapsed. With separate command posts set up and incompatible radio communications between the agencies, warnings were not passed along to FDNY commanders.|$|E

5000|$|In 1991, Masur became music {{director}} of the New York Philharmonic (NYP). In that capacity, he directed the Philharmonic in a performance of Brahms's Deutsches Requiem {{in the aftermath of the}} terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. [...] During his tenure, there were reports of tension between Masur and <b>the</b> <b>NYP's</b> Executive Director at the time, Deborah Borda, which eventually contributed to his contract not being renewed beyond 2002. [...] In a television interview with Charlie Rose, Masur stated that regarding his leaving <b>the</b> <b>NYP,</b> [...] "it was not my wish". [...] Masur stood down as <b>the</b> <b>NYP's</b> {{music director}} in 2002 and was named its Music Director Emeritus, a new title created for him. The critical consensus was that Masur improved the playing of the orchestra over his tenure.|$|R

Instead, Roberts offers Lucas {{a chance at}} a shorter jail {{sentence}} if he aids his investigation of dirty cops in <b>the</b> <b>NYPD</b> and Lucas duly provides Roberts with the names. In the end, three quarters of the New York DEA are arrested and convicted, and a distraught Trupo commits suicide. Roberts, having just passed the bar exam, defends Lucas as his first client. Lucas is sentenced to 70 years in prison, of which he serves 15 years and is released in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Serious issues {{concerning}} {{safety and security}} in the building arose after Donald Trump was declared as President-elect of the United States on November 8, 2016. Trump Tower {{had served as a}} rallying point for the protests against Donald Trump {{in the days after the}} election's results were announced, thus requiring extra deployments of security officials. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-fly zone over Trump Tower until January 20, 2017, and <b>the</b> <b>NYPD</b> stated that it was projected to spend $35 million to provide security to the tower, of which $7 million would be repaid by Congress. <b>The</b> <b>NYPD</b> later revised its estimate to $24 million. Street closures were imposed along the east side of Fifth Avenue and on the north side of 56th Street, with NYPD officers stopping and questioning pedestrians on these sidewalks as to their destinations. The block of 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was closed completely to vehicular traffic, but part of the street west of Madison Avenue was later reopened to allow local deliveries. Customers to the Gucci and Tiffany's stores in Trump Tower's lobby were allowed to proceed, while other pedestrians were redirected to the opposite side of the street. During presidential visits, dump trucks from the New York City Department of Sanitation were parked outside the tower to prevent car bombs. The press nicknamed the now-heavily secured building White House North, comparing it to the White House's West Wing.|$|E

2500|$|Officially {{known as}} the [...] "Ryan NYP" [...] (for New York to Paris), the single engine {{monoplane}} was designed by Donald A. Hall of Ryan Airlines and was named the [...] "Spirit of St. Louis" [...] in honor of Lindbergh's supporters from the St. Louis Raquette Club in his then hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. To save design time, <b>the</b> <b>NYP</b> was loosely based on the company's 1926 Ryan M-2 mailplane with the main difference being the 4,000 mile range of <b>the</b> <b>NYP</b> and, as a non-standard design, the government assigned it the registration number N-X-211 (for [...] "experimental"). Hall documented his design in [...] "Engineering Data on the Spirit of St. Louis" [...] which he prepared for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and is included as an appendix to Lindbergh's 1953 Pulitzer Prize winning book, The Spirit of St. Louis.|$|R
5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because <b>the</b> <b>NYPD</b> was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001, attacks, the MTA {{exercised}} {{extreme caution}} regarding anyone taking photographs or recording video inside {{the system and}} proposed banning all photography and recording in a meeting around June 2004. However, due to strong response from {{both the public and}} from civil rights groups, the rule of conduct was dropped. In November 2004, the MTA again put this rule up for approval, but was again denied, though many police officers and transit workers still confront or harass people taking photographs or videos. However, on April 3, 2009, <b>the</b> <b>NYPD</b> issued a directive to officers stating that it is legal to take pictures within the subway system so long as it is not accompanied with suspicious activity.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{security}} after the 2016 election, {{there have been}} some detentions and arrests that have been related to the increased security at the tower. On December 6, a woman managed to bypass security and go to the 24th floor—two floors below Donald Trump's office—before being stopped by Secret Service officers. A week later on December 13, a Baruch College student who was arrested at Trump Tower was found to have multiple weapons, including knives, a garrote, and firecrackers. The next day, another man reportedly got angry after he wanted to meet Donald Trump at the tower, and after throwing a wine glass onto the floor of the tower's lobby, was subsequently detained by <b>the</b> <b>NYPD.</b>|$|E

After gaining a Juris Doctor and a Master's degree in Public Administration from Syracuse University, Doggett went on to work for the New York Police Department from 1987–1995, {{eventually}} becoming a detective in the Fugitive Division's Warrant section. While he was working for <b>the</b> <b>NYPD,</b> his son, Luke Doggett (played in flashbacks by Jake Fritz), was abducted and murdered. Doggett teamed up with Special Agent Monica Reyes, who was working out of the New York FBI field office at the time, to search for his son's killer. After his son's death, Doggett's marriage to Barbara Doggett (played by Patrick's real-life wife Barbara) ended in divorce.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Alvin Kass {{served as}} Rabbi from 1976-2014.

At one point during his service as Police Department chaplain he and his family received months of 24-hour security after death threats, and at another he defused a hostage situation by providing the hostage taker with sandwiches from the Carnegie Deli. Kass, who teaches ethics at the Police Academy, was instrumental in getting Jewish police officers time off to observe the Sabbath. He also convinced <b>the</b> <b>NYPD</b> Shomrim Society (the fraternal organization of Jewish members of the New York City Police Department) to admit David Durk. Durk, along with the more famous Frank Serpico, had been the source of the allegations of police corruption that {{led to the formation of}} the Knapp Commission. In 2014, Rabbi Kass retired from the position of Rabbi at East Midwood Jewish Center and currently serves as Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E
5|$|For another episode for {{the series}} filmed in New York City he was asked by <b>the</b> <b>NYPD</b> not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel {{performances}} had become {{a concern for the}} police. This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a noose around his neck which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show.

50|$|In 1978 Mehta {{left the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic to become music {{director}} for the New York Philharmonic (<b>NYP).</b> Among <b>the</b> reasons he wanted to direct <b>the</b> <b>NYP</b> was that it allowed him to experiment with new ideas, such as taking the orchestra to Harlem. There, they played at the Abyssinian Baptist Church each year. Accompanying the orchestra with Mehta for various concerts were Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, and Kathleen Battle. He stayed with NYP until 1991.|$|R

5|$|Liz {{attempts}} to make amends by talking to Tracy during a rehearsal, during which she makes negative remarks about Jenna {{and the other members}} of her staff. Liz is notified by Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that her chat with Tracy was aired over the studio's monitors, which meant that everyone heard and saw her making the comments.
