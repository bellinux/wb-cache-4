2500|$|The {{dramatic}} {{decrease in}} evasion {{during this period}} coincided with a reinvigorated Transit Police, a 25% expansion of City police, and a general drop in crime in U.S. cities. In the city, crime rate decline begun in 1991 under Mayor David Dinkins and continued <b>through</b> <b>next</b> two decades under Mayors Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg. Some observers credited the “broken windows” approach of law enforcement [...] where minor crimes like evasion are routinely prosecuted, and statistical crimefighting tools, whereas others have indicated different reasons for crime reduction. Regardless of causality, evasion checks resulted in many arrests for outstanding warrants or weapons charges, likely contributing somewhat to public safety improvements. Arrests weren’t {{the only way to}} combat evasions, and by the early 1990s NYCTA was examining methods to improve fare control passenger throughputs, reduce fare collection costs, and maintain control over evasions and general grime. The AFC system was being designed, and evasion-preventing capability was a key consideration.|$|E

I brought out all the good points I [...] could think of. I said: 'Mr. President, Captain Curtis is the [...] most disinterested man in the Indian service.

'Does Mr. [...] Blank, of New York, endorse Captain Curtis?' he asked. I didn't [...] see what this led to, but I answered that I did not know. 'He's [...] a friend of yours, isn't he?' he asked. 'Whom do you mean?' I [...] said, and my cheeks burned. Then he smiled. 'You needn't [...] worry,' he said, banging the table with his fist. 'I'll keep [...] Captain Curtis where he is if every politician in the State [...] petitions for his removal.'
