5|$|Although the United States Navy was {{prevented}} from developing fortifications on the Aleutian Islands due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the Washington Naval Treaty, the Navy believed {{that at some}} point the United States' treaty obligations would no longer apply, and began to scout the Aleutians for possible naval bases. In 1923, two scouting ships investigated the possibility of establishing anchorages off the Islands, and attempted to claim the United States Army's bases on the Aleutians for the purposes of national security.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a school}} {{desegregation}} suit in 1972, the court required St. Louis to accept a busing plan in 1980. Judge William L. Hungate declared that a mandatory plan would go into effect unless other arrangements were made to adhere <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the suit. In 1983, an unprecedented voluntary busing plan was put into place, integrating the schools without a mandated plan being required.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, she {{was part}} of the Battleship Division Nine, which was {{attached}} to the British Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. During the war, she was primarily tasked with patrolling in the North Sea and escorting convoys to Norway. She served in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets throughout the 1920s, and in 1931–1932, she was converted into a training ship according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the London Naval Treaty of 1930.|$|E
50|$|At {{a federal}} level, the ACT and the NT both elect {{two members of}} the House of Representatives and two Senators. <b>The</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{territory}} senators are tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Representatives, not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate. This means that if there is an election for the Senate only (as last happened in 1970), this would involve only half the state senators, and <b>the</b> territory senators' <b>terms</b> would continue. Conversely, if there is an election for the House of Representatives only (as last happened in 1972), this would also involve the territory senators but not the state senators.|$|R

5|$|Heavy cruiser {{development}} steadied between World War I and World War II thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the Washington Naval Treaty and successor {{treaties and}} conferences, where the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy agreed to limit heavy cruisers to 10,000tons displacement with 8-inch main armament.

5|$|On 11 November 1918, Germany {{entered into}} the Armistice with the Western Allies.

On the day the armistice took effect, Hannover was sent briefly to Swinemünde, before returning to Kiel on 14–15 November along with Schlesien. Hannover was decommissioned a month later on 17 December in accordance with the terms of the Armistice.|$|E

5|$|The ship's postwar {{career was}} short. She {{conducted}} training cruises for US Naval Academy cadets in 1920 and 1921, {{the first to}} the Pacific and the second to Europe.

On 21–22 November 1918, Helgoland steamed to Harwich to retrieve the crews of U-boats that had been surrendered there. She was then removed from active service on 16December 1918. Helgoland and her sisters were stricken from the German navy on 5November 1919. Helgoland was formally {{handed over to the}} United Kingdom on 5August 1920. She was scrapped at Morecambe; work began on 3March 1921. Helgolands coat of arms is currently preserved in the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the new alliance, {{during the}} late summer, the Christian fleet {{assembled}} at Messina, {{under the command of}} Don John of Austria, who arrived on 23 August. By that time, however, Famagusta had fallen, and any effort to save Cyprus was meaningless. Before setting sail for the east, Don John {{had to deal with the}} mutual distrust and hostility among the various contingents, especially between the Venetians and the Genoese. The Spanish admiral tackled the problem by breaking the various contingents up and mingle ships from various states. Doria assumed command of the right wing, Don Juan kept the centre, the Venetian Agostino Barbarigo received the left, and the Spaniard Alvaro de Bazan the reserve. Unaware of Famagusta's fate, the allied fleet left Messina on 16 September, and ten days later arrived at Corfu, where it learned of the Ottoman victory. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Müezzinzade Ali Pasha, had anchored at Lepanto (Nafpaktos), near the entrance of the Corinthian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the repatriation effort, Montana was transferred to the west coast of the United States. She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Seattle on 16 August, where she remained until 2 February 1921, when she was decommissioned. During this period of inactivity, she was renamed Missoula on 7 June 1920 so her original name could be used for one of the planned South Dakota-class battleships, and she reclassified with the hull number CA-13. Though decommissioned in 1921, the ship remained in the Navy's inventory until 15 July 1930, when she was formally stricken from the naval register, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the London Naval Treaty, which placed aggregate tonnage limits on the cruiser fleets of the signatory countries. She was sold to John Irwin Jr. on 29 September and was eventually broken up in 1935.|$|E

50|$|Akua {{was seen}} as a close ally of President Marcus Stephen, whose {{government}} ceased <b>to</b> command <b>the</b> support of a majority in the Parliament of Nauru in March 2008. Akua's resignation was thus set in the context of strengthening the Executive by hindering the conduct of Parliamentary business, which, as widely acknowledged, would likely have led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stephen Administration being ended by Parliament. In this sense, Akua's record as Parliamentary Speaker is seen as controversial and allegations of a coup d'état made by Akua's successor as Speaker, David Adeang, may be seen against this light.|$|R

5|$|Following the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{a significant portion}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the Armistice. Rheinland and her three sisters were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained in German ports. However, a copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter came to the conclusion that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.|$|E
5|$|In early 1922, the world's major navies, {{including}} Italy, {{signed the}} Washington Naval Treaty. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the treaty, Italy could keep Napoli {{and her three}} sisters, along with the newer dreadnought battleships. Due to the small size and age of the ships, particularly {{in comparison to the}} modern dreadnoughts, the Italians could have kept the ships in service indefinitely. They could not, however, be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system, which provided for replacements after a ship was 20 years old. Napoli was retained for a few years, but was stricken from the naval register on 3 August 1926 and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Kuntz was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} with the Marlins before spring training in 2002.

Kuntz, who was paid for the 2002 season in any case due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> his contract, kept a job working on the grounds crew at the team's spring training site. He had performed ground crew duties at the site for several years in the offseasons. Late in the 2002 season, the Atlanta Braves hired Kuntz as a roving instructor. After the season, he was hired by the Pittsburgh Pirates as a first-base coach. In October 2005, the Pirates offered minor league positions to Kuntz and fellow coaches Gerald Perry and Alvaro Espinoza. He spent the next two seasons coaching between the Class AAA Indianapolis Indians and the major league club.|$|E

During 1903, the ship was converted into a coal barge by the removal of her turret, her side armor, and its wooden backing, and by the division of her hull into three holds. She was redesignated as Barzha No. 31, Barzha No. 50 and, in 1914, Barzha No. 323.
