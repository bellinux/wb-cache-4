Protein-supplemented steers demonstrated increased (P<. 01) intake of dormant, bluestem-range forage {{when compared with}} unsupplemented steers. Although increasing concentration of supplemental crude protein from 15 to 20 % substantially increased (P<. 01) forage and <b>total</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> intake. only slight increases in forage and <b>total</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> intake occurred when the concentration exceeded 20 %. Protein supplementation increased (P<. 01) fiber and dry matter digestibilities. Additionally. fiber digestibility tended (P=. 087) to increase with increasing crude protein concentration of the supplement. Results suggest that when feeding a wheat middlings-based supplement. the crude protein concentration should be 20 % or higher to optimize use of poor-quality forage...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the physicochemical {{properties of the}} oil obtained from Tenebrio molitor Larvae and explore its potential as edible oil. Methodology: Oils obtained from five batches of Tenebrio molitor Larvae were investigated. Among the samples, three were produced directly in the lab (3 different productions) and 2 were purchased from a local supplier. In addition to the total lipid content (solvent extraction), both FA (GC) and TAG (HPLC) profiles were determined. Thermal properties by DSC were also estimated. Results and conclusion: The fresh Larvae from the lab contained 52 % of <b>total</b> proteins (% <b>dry</b> <b>matter).</b> Their <b>total</b> fat content was around 36 % (% <b>dry</b> <b>matter).</b> The commercial samples contained more proteins, but less fat: around 58 % of total proteins and 30 % of <b>total</b> fat (% <b>dry</b> <b>matter).</b> All the extracted oils contained high amount of unsaturated fatty acids. However, the chemical composition and the thermal properties of the samples varied according to their origin. The level and quality of lipid content offer potential as a substitute of oilseeds...|$|R
40|$|Studying the {{correlations}} between productivity elements of red clover (green <b>matter,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and seed yield) {{is a very important}} aspect of breeding programs because it helps obtaining highly productive cultivars. Positive correlations, statistically assured, were observed between green and <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> yields in both years of vegetation, for both groups of ploidy. Negative correlations were noticed between seed yield and first cut green matter yield in the 2 nd year, for diploids and between seed yield and <b>total</b> green and <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> in the 1 st year, for tetraploids...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile Astacus astacus (initial b. w. : 0. 98 +/- 0. 06 g) were cultured (30 crayfish/m(2)) in 2001 tanks for 69 days. The {{experimental}} design {{was composed of}} three treatments as follows: control diet (C) (crude protein: 28. 4 % of the <b>total</b> <b>dried</b> <b>matter,</b> "DM"; ether extract: 6. 22 % DM), water cress (W) (crude protein: 20. 7 % DM; ether extract: 1. 9 % DIVI) and control diet + water cress (C + W) with thee replicates per treatment. Relative growth rate improved significantly (P < 0. 05) in crayfish fed C + W (+ 110 %) compared to W (+ 43 %) and the control diet (+ 36 %). Gross protein and lipid retentions of the treatment C + W {{were significantly higher than}} the control diet and water cress fed alone. At the end of the experiment, a higher survival rate of A. astacus was observed (P < 0. 05) in the treatment C + W (67 %) and C (71 %) compared to the W (58 %). These results suggest that the plant water cress (Nasturtium officinale) can be used as supplemental food in noble crayfish feeding...|$|R
