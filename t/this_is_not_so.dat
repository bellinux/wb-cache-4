5|$|Penrose tilings, {{which use}} two {{different}} quadrilaterals, {{are the best}} known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of aperiodic tilings, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The recursive process of substitution tiling is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. One class that can be generated {{in this way is}} the rep-tiles; these tilings have surprising self-replicating properties. Pinwheel tilings are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations. It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so.</b> Aperiodic tilings, while lacking in translational symmetry, do have symmetries of other types, by infinite repetition of any bounded patch of the tiling and in certain finite groups of rotations or reflections of those patches. A substitution rule, such as can be used to generate some Penrose patterns using assemblies of tiles called rhombs, illustrates scaling symmetry. A Fibonacci word can be used to build an aperiodic tiling, and to study quasicrystals, which are structures with aperiodic order.|$|E

25|$|While {{the total}} mesocolic {{excision}} (TME) operation {{has become the}} surgical gold standard {{for the management of}} rectal cancer, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> for colon cancer. Recently, the surgical principles underpinning TME in rectal cancer have been extrapolated to colonic surgery. Total or Complete mesocolic excision (CME), use planar surgery and extensive mesenterectomy (high tie) to minimise breach of the mesentery and maximise lymph nodes yield. Application of this T/CME reduces local five-year recurrence rates in colon cancer from 6.5% to 3.6%, while cancer-related five-year survival rates in patients resected for cure increased from 82.1% to 89.1%.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} layers of {{modeling}} {{are used to}} determine the long-term, or Time Independent, estimates of the magnitude, location, and frequency of potentially damaging earthquakes in California. The Time Dependent model is based on the theory of elastic rebound, that after an earthquake releases tectonic stress there will be some time before sufficient stress accumulates to cause another earthquake. In theory, this should produce some regularity in the earthquakes on a given fault, and knowing the date of the last rupture is a clue to how soon the next one can be expected. In practice <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> clear, in part because slip rates vary, and also because fault segments influence each other, so a rupture on one segment triggers rupturing on adjacent segments. One of the achievements of UCERF3 is to better handle such multifault ruptures.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the crucial}} points of the {{authenticity}} controversy {{is the relationship between}} The Tale of Igor's Campaign and Zadonschina, an unquestionably authentic poem, which was created in the 15th century to glorify Dmitri Donskoi's victory over Mamai in the Battle of Kulikovo and is preserved in six medieval copies. There are almost identical passages in both texts where only the personal names are different. The traditional point of view considers Zadonschina to be a late imitation, with Slovo as its pattern. The forgery version claims the reverse: that Igor's Tale was written using Zadonschina as a source. Recently, Roman Jakobson's and Andrey Zaliznyak's analyses show that the passages of Zadonschina with counterparts in Slovo differ {{from the rest of the}} text by a number of linguistic parameters, whereas <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> for Igor's Tale. This fact is taken as evidence of Slovo being the original with respect to Zadonschina. Zaliznyak also points out that the passages in Zadonschina which parallel those in the Igor's Tale but differ from it can only be explained if Slovo was the source for Zadonshchina (the differences can be the result of the distortion of the original Slovo text by the author and different editors of Zadonshchina versions), but not vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Although oak barrels {{have long}} been used by winemakers, many wineries now use oak wood chips for aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors. It is a common {{misconception}} that oak imparts butter flavors to wine. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so.</b> The butter flavors come from lactic acid, naturally present in the wine, converted during malolactic fermentation to diacetyl. This process reverses itself, although the addition of sulfur dioxide prevents this, and the diacetyl remains. Oak chips can be added during fermentation or during aging. In the latter case, they are generally placed into fabric sacks and placed into the aging wine. The diversity of chips available gives winemakers numerous options. Oak chips {{have the benefit of}} imparting intense oak flavoring {{in a matter of weeks}} while traditional oak barrels would need a year or more to convey similar intensity. Critics claim that the oak flavoring from chips tend to be one-dimensional and skewed towards the vanilla extract with the wines still lacking some of the physical benefits that barrel oak imparts. The use of oak powder is also less common than chips, although they are a very practical alternative if oak character is to be introduced during fermentation. Oak planks or staves are sometimes used, either during fermentation or aging. Wines made from these barrel alternatives typically do not age as well as wines that are matured in barrels. Improvements in micro-oxygenation have allowed winemakers to better mimic the gentle aeration of oak barrels in stainless steel tanks with oak chips.|$|E
500|$|Different {{fundamental}} {{variables are}} chosen for mechanical translation and rotational systems leading to two variants {{for each of}} the analogies. [...] For instance, linear distance is the displacement variable in a translational system, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> appropriate for rotating systems where angle is used instead. [...] Acoustical analogies have also been included in the descriptions as a third variant. [...] While acoustical energy is ultimately mechanical in nature, it is treated in the literature as an instance of a different energy domain, the fluid domain, and has different fundamental variables. [...] Analogies between all three domains − electrical, mechanical and acoustical − are required to fully represent electromechanical audio systems.|$|E

500|$|Kant {{goes on to}} write, [...] "'being' is evidently not a real predicate" [...] and {{cannot be}} part of the concept of something. He proposes that {{existence}} is not a predicate, or quality. This is because existence does not add to the essence of a being, but merely indicates its occurrence in reality. He states that by taking the subject of God with all its predicates and then asserting that God exists, [...] "I add no new predicate to the conception of God". He argues that the ontological argument works only if existence is a predicate; if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so,</b> he claims the ontological argument is invalidated, as it is then conceivable a completely perfect being doesn't exist.|$|E
500|$|The {{properties}} of geodesics {{differ from those}} of straight lines. For example, on a plane, parallel lines never meet, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> for geodesics {{on the surface of the}} Earth: for example, lines of longitude are parallel at the equator, but intersect at the poles. Analogously, the world lines of test particles in free fall are spacetime geodesics, the straightest possible lines in spacetime. [...] But still there are crucial differences between them and the truly straight lines that can be traced out in the gravity-free spacetime of special relativity. [...] In special relativity, parallel geodesics remain parallel. In a gravitational field with tidal effects, this will not, in general, be the case. If, for example, two bodies are initially at rest relative to each other, but are then dropped in the Earth's gravitational field, they will move towards each other as they fall towards the Earth's center.|$|E

500|$|It {{was also}} thought that some medals {{made during the}} First World War were {{composed}} of metal captured from different Chinese guns during the Boxer Rebellion. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so,</b> however. [...] The VCs examined by Creagh and Ashton [...] both in Australia (58) and at the QE II Army Memorial Museum in New Zealand (14) [...] spanned the entire time during which VCs have been issued and no compositional inconsistencies were found. It was also believed that another source of metal was used between 1942 and 1945 to create five Second World War VCs when the Sevastopol metal [...] "went missing". Creagh accessed the Army records at MoD Donnington in 1991 and {{did not find any}} gaps in the custodial record. The composition found in the WW2 VCs, amongst them those for Edwards (Australia) and Upham (New Zealand), is similar to that for the early WW1 medals. This is likely to be due to the reuse of material from earlier pourings, casting sprues, defective medals, etc.|$|E

500|$|Gray worked {{extensively}} on {{a phenomenon that}} is now called the [...] "Asa Gray disjunction", namely, the surprising morphological similarities between many eastern Asian and eastern North American plants. In fact, Gray felt the flora of eastern North America is more similar to the flora of Japan {{than it is to}} the flora of western North America, but more recent studies have shown <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so.</b> While Gray was not the first botanist to notice this (it was first noticed in the early 18thcentury), beginning in the early 1840s he brought scientific focus to the issue. He was the first scientist in the world to possess the requisite knowledge set to do so as he had intimate knowledge of the northeast and southeast United States as well as eastern Asiadue to several contacts he had there. The phenomenon involves about 65genera and is not limited to plants, but also includes fungi, arachnids, millipedes, insects, and freshwater fishes. It was believed that each pair of species might be international sister species, but it is now known that this is not generally the case; the species involved are less closely related to one another. Today, botanists suggest three possible causes for the observed morphological similarity, which probably developed at different times and via different pathways; the species pairs are: (1)the products of similar environmental conditions in separate locations, (2)relics of species that were formerly widely distributed but diversified later, (3)not as morphologically similar as was previously believed. Gray's work in this area gave significant support to Darwin's theory of evolution {{and is one of the}} hallmarks of Gray's career. In 1880 David P. Penhallow was accepted by Gray as a research assistant. Penhallow aided in Gray's work regarding the distribution of northern hemisphere plants, and in 1882 Gray recommended Penhallow as a lecturer to Sir John Dawson of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.|$|E
