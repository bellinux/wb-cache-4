5|$|Around {{the same}} time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly {{pushed for the}} {{creation}} of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. Mullaly noted that New York City had less parkland per capita than many major European cities, and that the 1853 construction of Central Park had raised property values around the park immediately after construction. His association sent out pamphlets to high-profile New Yorkers, advocating for a new park. However, controversies arose over the proposals for new parks in <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> and so the city did not authorize a commission for the planned new parks. Since the city refused to make a park commission, the New York Park Association appealed to the New York State Legislature instead. On April 19, 1883, the state passed a law authorizing a seven-person commission headed by association member Luther Marsh, which would be responsible for scouting out sites for future parks in the 23rd and 24th wards of New York City (now the portion of <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> that is west of <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River). Mullaly was named the secretary, In June 1883, the commission visited the park site, and by January 1884, Marsh had drafted a bill to the New York State Legislature regarding a proposed park system in <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> comprising six parks connected by three parkways.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted {{was hired}} to survey <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> and map out streets based on the local geography. Olmsted noted {{the natural beauty of}} the Van Cortlandt estate, {{comparing}} it to Central Park which he designed, and recommended the city purchase the property. The land was part of a proposed greenbelt across <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a grid system similar to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within the bounds of the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan.|$|E
5|$|On June 21, 1904, the Regents of the University of the State of New York {{consented to}} allow the board of {{trustees}} to authorize the opening of a law school and a medical school. St. John's College officially became Fordham University on March 7, 1907. The name Fordham refers to the village of Fordham, in which the original Rose Hill campus is located. The village, in turn, drew its name from its location near a shallow crossing of <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River ("ford by the hamlet"). When Fordham and several other Westchester County towns were consolidated into <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, the village became the borough's Fordham neighborhood. Still in existence today, it is just to the west of the Rose Hill campus.|$|E
5|$|One {{neighborhood}} of New York County is contiguous with the U.S. mainland.

Before World War I, {{the section of the}} original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from <b>The</b> <b>Bronx</b> was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.|$|E

5|$|The Sprain Brook {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the early 1920s as a parkway between <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River Parkway and the Hawthorne Circle. The parkway sold a majority of its right-of-way in the 1920s, but the proposed parkway met strong opposition {{from the village of}} Bronxville and Yonkers. The Sprain Brook proposal sat on the table until 1949, when the State Council of Parks, run by Robert Moses, sought to ease congestion on <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River Parkway. Moses proposed that a new state park would be constructed in Westchester, with the Sprain Brook Parkway serving as a traffic alternative to <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River, and nearly {{a decade and a half}} after the parkway was deeded land. This time, Bronxville opposed the project rather than Yonkers, but an agreement was worked out in 1951.
