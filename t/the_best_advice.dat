25|$|On April 12, 2011, Couric's first book, titled <b>The</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Advice</b> I Ever Got: Lessons from Extraordinary Lives, was {{published}} by Random House. The book {{is a collection of}} essays compiled over the past year by Couric; contributors include New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Queen Rania of Jordan, and former Today Show colleague Matt Lauer. Couric said that a 2010 convocation keynote address she gave inspired her to write the book. To this end, all profits of the book will be donated to Scholarship America.|$|E
25|$|Having {{received}} {{repeated and}} cryptic cablegrams from her husband, who {{had returned to}} Norway {{a year and a}} half earlier, Flagstad was forced to consider leaving the United States in 1941. Though dismissing the political implications of the departure of someone of her fame from the United States to German-occupied Norway, it was nonetheless a difficult decision for her. She had many friends, colleagues, and of course many fans all over the US. Even more importantly, her 20-year-old daughter Else had married an American named Arthur Dusenberry and was living with her new husband on a dude ranch in Bozeman, Montana. It was Edwin McArthur who gave the bride away at the wedding in Bozeman a year earlier. Nonetheless, against <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>advice</b> of her friends and colleagues, including former president Herbert Hoover, who pleaded with her to stay out of Europe, she returned to Norway via Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona, Marseille, and Berlin in April, 1941. Though during the war she performed only in Sweden and Switzerland, countries not occupied by German forces, this fact did not temper the storm of public opinion that hurt her personally and professionally for the next several years. Her husband was arrested after the war for profiteering during the occupation that involved his lumber business. This arrest, together with her decision to remain in occupied Norway, made her unpopular, particularly in the United States. The Norwegian ambassador and columnist Walter Winchell spoke out against her. In 1948, she performed several benefit concerts for the United Jewish Appeal. In defense of Flagstad's husband, Henry Johansen, it should be noted that after his death it was revealed that during the occupation he was arrested by the Gestapo and held for eight days. Also, one of Johansen's sons by his first marriage, Henry Jr, had been a member of the Norwegian underground throughout the war.|$|E

Kartheiser described Pete as doing [...] "what he thinks he needs to do to get the account. I don't know if that's always such a good thing, but it's common in business.

In 1932, his brother John, who had graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a degree in electrical engineering, persuaded him to go to college as well. John suggested that [...] "if you aren’t sure what part of science you want, take physics, because that's basic to all of them." [...] Creutz later recalled that this was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>advice</b> he ever got. He entered the University of Wisconsin and studied mathematics and physics. Money was scarce during the Great Depression, especially after his father died in 1935. To pay his bills, Creutz worked as a dishwasher and short order cook, and took a job taking care of the physics laboratory equipment. In 1936, his senior year, he taught physics laboratory classes.|$|E
500|$|Eleanor {{dismissed}} Bamie's criticisms {{by referring}} to her as an [...] "aged woman." [...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>advice</b> I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E

500|$|With these issues, Kavanagh {{argues that}} there {{are likely to be}} consequences. Firstly, if judges replace the text of a statute with the meaning given to it by a single {{minister}} in Parliament, there is a risk that they will attribute a meaning to it which was not supported by the MPs; interpretations, based on the views of ministers, are more likely to reflect the executive's intention than that of Parliament. Kavanagh also suggests that it could impact on the actions of ministers; rather than attempting to specify law through the difficult route of placing it in legislation, they can simply make a statement within Parliament about the legislation's intent. Lord Mackay's worry that this would increase the cost of litigation was also considered; under Pepper, every lawyer must go through every word said in both Houses of Parliament and in the various committees to ensure that they are giving <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>advice</b> to their client. Academics have also expressed worry about the reliability of Hansard as a source; [...] "the debate on the Bill is a battle of wits often carried out under extreme pressure and excitement where much more than the passage of this Bill may be at stake. The Ministers supporting it cannot be expected to act as if they were under oath in a court of law".|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} specify {{those aspects of}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>advices</b> of performance appraisal researchers which {{were related to the}} effectiveness of the performance appraisal process. A 150 -item questionnaire was sent to 1, 200 people who had participated in management development programs (531 responded). With effectiveness operationalized as influencing the motivation of individuals to work, only the practices invloved in setting goals were important, and then in only a modest fashion. However, with the definition of effectiveness broadened to include the influence of the Performance Appraisal Process (PAP) on intention to turnover and job satisfaction, almost all aspects of the PAP measured were found to be important. <b>The</b> aspects of <b>best</b> <b>advices</b> which organizations should include in the design and implementation of effective performance appraisal systems are: goal-setting, including the setting of difficult, specific goals, participatively established and supported by feedback; the selection and/or training of supervisors who can appraise performance in a supportive manner, and who can avoid bias in rating their subordinates, and who can also produce clear directions for future performance...|$|R
