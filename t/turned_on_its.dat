5|$|In March 2007, Moelis {{announced}} that he was leaving the company, and shortly thereafter founded a new business, Moelis & Company. As he had when joining UBS, Moelis took a large team of senior UBS investment bankers. Moelis's departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the bank's balance sheet to pursue large transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts. The bank's apparent conservatism would be <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees. After Moelis, other notable departures included investment banking co-head Jeff McDermott in early 2007 and, as the financial crisis set in, other high-profile bankers such as Oliver Sarkozy in early 2008 and Ben Lorello in 2009.|$|E

25|$|The corpse is {{washed and}} placed on tiger or deer skin or a bed of kusha grass. The hair and feet of the corpse may be tied. The corpse is {{believed}} to be a vessel of power while the rite is performed and tying the hair ensures that the energy does not escape. Another interpretation states that the bondage reflects the practitioner's desire to control the spirit of the corpse. Then, the sadhaka will sit on the corpse for meditation. In Shakta narratives, betel nut is put into the corpse's mouth and it is <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> back and smeared with sandalwood paste. Shakta sandhakas draw a yantra {{on the back of the}} corpse and sit on it. The 64 yoginis and the guardians of the directions are worshipped with vegetarian offerings. The corpse-seat is again worshipped and the practitioner mounts the corpse like one sits on a horse. Another tradition says that the practitioner is expected to sit in Virasana ("the heroic pose"). The Tantrasara narrates that the practitioner should get off the corpse to draw a triangle or protective circle around him and the corpse or again to scatter mustard or sesame seeds in all directions.|$|E
500|$|Sonnets of {{all types}} often make use of a volta, or [...] "turn," [...] {{a point in the}} poem at which an idea is <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> head, a {{question}} is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated. This volta can often {{take the form of a}} [...] "but" [...] statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.|$|E

500|$|Although never {{intended}} for the low-level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast its intended successor as {{the nature of the}} air war environment changed. The B-52's huge fuel load allowed it to operate at lower altitudes for longer times, and the large airframe allowed the addition of improved radar jamming and deception suites to deal with radars. During the Vietnam War, the concept that all future wars would be nuclear was <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> head, and the [...] "big belly" [...] modifications increased the B-52's total bomb load to , turning it into a powerful tactical aircraft which could be used against ground troops along with strategic targets from high altitudes. The much smaller bomb bay of the B-70 would have made it much less useful in this role.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 75 ethnic, {{social, and}} {{religious}} Chicago organizations {{were asked to}} provide candidates whose faces would be photographed for integration into the fountain. The subjects were chosen from local schools, churches and community groups, and filming began in 2001 at the downtown campus of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). The SAIC students filmed their subjects with a $100,000 high-definition HDW-F900 video camera, the same model used in the production of the three Star Wars prequels. About 20 SAIC students took part in what became an informal master's course in public art for the project. Faculty from Columbia College Chicago was also involved in the production of the video. The high-definition equipment was used because of the scale of the project. [...] Because the image proportions were like a movie screen with a width far exceeding its height, the camera was <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> side during filming.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, {{proposed}} that the episode is a parody of organized religion, most specifically those who follow a religion, but only pay it lip service. The two argue that the principal joke in the episode is [...] "to {{look at the way}} religious faith has been so watered down and paid nothing but lip service, its rituals and doctrines reinterpreted so that only what's comfortable is adhered to." [...] This parody, however, is <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> head: the followers paying lip service in [...] "Die Hand Die Verletzt" [...] are not stereotypical Christians, but rather, devil worshippers. Shearman and Pearson compare Mrs. Paddock—which the episode insinuates to be the devil incarnate—coming to Milford Haven, New Hampshire to judge his followers to St. Paul [...] "coming back and taking a pop at all fair weather Christians who only affirm their faith at their own convenience." ...|$|E

500|$|There are no {{official}} statistics of people's religious beliefs {{nor is it}} asked in the census. According to the government, 99.8% of the Turkish population is Muslim (although some sources give a slightly lower estimate of 96.4 percent) with the most popular sect being the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam. There are also some Sufi Muslims. Roughly 2 percent are non-denominational Muslims. The highest Islamic religious authority is the Presidency of Religious Affairs (...) it interprets the Hanafi school of law, and is responsible for regulating {{the operation of the}} country's 80,000 registered mosques and employing local and provincial imams.

500|$|Khaled Hosseini {{considers}} pain, love, {{and familial}} {{love to be}} the primary themes of And the Mountains Echoed. The separation of the two siblings, Abdullah and Pari, is [...] "the heart of the book". Both subsequently become [...] "victims of the passage of time": Abdullah, who is older and remembers Pari, agonizes over her loss for most of his life, while Pari is younger and able to forget her brother after losing him. However, {{towards the end of the}} book, Pari is informed that she was adopted and that she has a brother, Abdullah; she locates him in the United States only to discover that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and has forgotten her. Hosseini stated, [...] "The question is raised a number of times about whether memory is a blessing — something that safeguards in all the things that are dear to you — or is memory a curse — something that makes you relive the most painful parts of your life, the toil, the struggle, the sorrows." [...] Thus, the combination of these events make And the Mountains Echoed [...] "kind of like a fairytale <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> head".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed {{in front of}} a live {{audience}} at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on August 10, 2012. SuperUber worked on integration between animations and technology, the structure design and projection mapping that took over the General Assembly Hall after it was invited by Kenzo Digital. 10 20K HLM Barco projectors were placed and mapping was done using Pandora's widget designer and 5 Pandora's Dual Box servers. The final video had an 8856 x 1664 resolution and was split into 10 slices of 1080 x 1664 pixels, since each projector was <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> side and the images were projected vertically in order to cover the whole structure. Two slices were fed into each system and SuperUber did the warping and edge blending inside Pandora. The screen which was used was over 12,000 square feet; Lucas Werthein, a representative for SuperUber commented that it was the largest indoor temporary screen that was a tilted compound curve adding that from an engineering standpoint, it is [...] "extremely complex". It was custom-designed to mold {{to the inside of the}} General Assembly Hall. It spanned 68m X 15m and surrounded the audience with a 240 degree immersive projection. Ten synchronized and mapped projections covered the screen with 200,000 lumens, creating one continuous giant image. The screen which weighed 1000 pounds was sewn by forty five people. The whole structure, which was hanging off the UN ceiling weighed 6000 pounds. Werthein revealed, [...] "In order to create the proper tension for the screen to hold its shape we had to weld permanent rigging points into the dome of the general assembly." [...] Peter Kirn of Create Digital Motion wrote that the projection mapping was performed onto a fairly simple surface: [...] "What makes the mapping so effective is the way in which it can fill the space, making those pictures immersive on a grand architectural scale. It makes the image a real volume in which the performance can take place." [...] Russ Rive, SuperUber’s director said, [...] "It’s an ambitious project that has completely transformed an iconic location – seen as immutable and unchanging, with its goldplated panel and grand volume. By adding a virtual layer to it, we could digitally rebuild it, playing with the architectural elements, and therefore changing the notion of something static. The technology made the integration between animation and architecture. We used projectors to 'paint with light' the UN General Assembly’s Hall – a unique opportunity to transform such an emblematic place." ...|$|E
