30|$|Comparing {{scale scores}} of {{constructs}} across groups produces meaningful results {{only if the}} scales measure the same construct {{in all of the}} groups (Van de Vijver and Leung 2000). In order to ascertain such equivalence, MI is to be established by examining the interrelations between items and the scale representing the underlying trait (Chen 2008, p. 1006). It is common to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> MI by using multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA). According to the bottom-up approach of Brown (2006), at first configural invariance, the basic level of measurement invariance, is to be examined. If in each of the groups the same items are associated with the same latent factors, configural invariance is established. As a second step, it is to be tested whether the factor loadings are invariant, to ensure that the unit of measurement is identical across the groups. Invariance of factor loadings allows to compare relationships between the construct assessed and others across groups. The third step is to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>scalar</b> invariance. If the intercepts are invariant, the items have the same origins in all groups. Only if a scale consists of the same units of measurement and the same origin, it is allowed to compare factor means across groups (Chen 2008).|$|R
40|$|Equivalence <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> <b>scalar</b> {{data has}} been well {{addressed}} in the literature, however, the same cannot be said for functional data. The resultant complexity from maintaining the functional structure of the data, rather than using a scalar transformation to reduce dimensionality, renders the existing literature on equivalence <b>testing</b> inadequate <b>for</b> the desired inference. We propose a framework <b>for</b> equivalence <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> functional data within both the frequentist and Bayesian paradigms. This framework combines extensions of scalar methodologies with new methodology for functional data. Our frequentist hypothesis test extends the Two One-Sided <b>Testing</b> (TOST) procedure <b>for</b> equivalence <b>testing</b> to the functional regime. We conduct this TOST procedure {{through the use of}} the nonparametric bootstrap. Our Bayesian methodology employs a functional analysis of variance model, and uses a flexible class of Gaussian Processes for both modeling our data and as prior distributions. Through our analysis, we introduce a model for heteroscedastic variances within a Gaussian Process by modeling variance curves via Log-Gaussian Process priors. We stress the importance of choosing prior distributions that are commensurate with the prior state of knowledge and evidence regarding practical equivalence. We illustrate these testing methods through data from an ongoing method comparison study between two devices <b>for</b> pulmonary function <b>testing.</b> In so doing, we provide not only concrete motivation <b>for</b> equivalence <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> functional data, but also a blueprint for researchers who hope to conduct similar inference.

The graphic rating scale and the Likert scale were each be measured using two different response category sets, a scale ranging from 1 to 5 and a scale ranging from - 2 to + 2. Participants {{were asked to respond}} to a scale measuring Employee Engagement and were randomly assigned to one of the four scaling conditions. ^ Following the guidelines proposed by Vanderberg 2 ̆ 6 Lance (2000), a multi-step approach to testing measurement invariance using a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models with the maximum likelihood estimation was employed to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> configural invariance, metric invariance, and scalar invariance. Additionally, the scales were tested to see if subjects display a tendency to utilize the scales differently due to the numeric anchoring conditions. ^ In the first step of the invariance testing, the four scaling techniques were found to have good model fit using a confirmatory factor analysis. Next the factor structures were constrained to be equal across the groups. Good fit was found with the factor structures constrained to be equal which is evidence for configural invariance. To <b>test</b> <b>for</b> metric invariance the model was additionally constrained to have equal factor loadings. When tested the model showed good fit indicating metric invariance. Next, to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>scalar</b> invariance the model was additionally constrained to have equal intercepts of the indicators.

Finally, each of the scaling techniques were then tested with a one-way analysis of variance to determine if there were means score differences for any of the four scale types. No significant differences were found. ^ Results of this study would indicate that Likert scales and graphic numeric rating scales have measurement invariance, however further research should be done to address the limitations of this study. ...|$|R
