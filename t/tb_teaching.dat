40|$|Objective: To analyze {{practical}} tuberculosis (<b>TB)</b> <b>teaching</b> in Nursing Schools (NS) in Brazil in 2004. Methodology: We surveyed all NS in Brazil in 2004, {{and sent}} questionnaires by mail to faculty <b>TB</b> <b>teaching.</b> Data were compiled in a database {{with a view}} to descriptive analysis. In a universe of 347 NS, 111 answered the questionnaire, which constituted the study population. Results: 75, 2 % of the NS are concentrated in the Southeast and South. The hour load (HL) for practical <b>TB</b> <b>teaching</b> ranges between 10 and 20 hours (42, 2 %). Teaching is mainly provided (89, 1 %) at primary care level. Practical activities focus on nursing appointments and home visits. Faculty members obtain updated knowledge on the subject through scientific events and Internet. Conclusion: The student training in TB care isnâ€™t enough to discuss aspects of treatment, epidemiological surveillance and management...|$|E
40|$|This {{practicum}} {{sought to}} provide {{elementary school teachers}} with {{the skills and knowledge}} needed <b>tb</b> <b>teach</b> students residing in foster care. The three specific goals of the practicum were: (1) to have all 30 of the teacher participants use teaching strategies appropriate to the education of foster care children; (2) to have at least 25 of the 30 teachers use at least 3 intervention strategies before referring A foster child for behavior problems; and (3) to decrease the number of foster care children referred for special education assessment. Inservice teacher training sessions were developed and conducted to achieve these goals. Teacher appraisal worksheets, behavior referrals, and suspension charts were used during the implementation phase to document the teachers' growth. A post-intervention assessment was completed by teachers to document their understanding of the needs of foster children. Analysis of the assessment data, classroom observations, and school records indicated that all three goals of the practicum were met. (Two appendixes contain strategies for healthy preschool and school-age child development and suggestions on how teachers can help children cope with stress. Contains 41 references.)

50|$|Returning to South Africa, Sahajananda {{took up a}} {{teaching}} post at the FOSA (Friends of Sick Association) <b>TB</b> Settlement, <b>teaching</b> {{in the school and}} serving the sick in the wards. It was during this time that Sivananda wrote to him with a request to start a branch of Divine Life Society in South Africa. Being nervous and shy by temperament, and unaccustomed to any kind of organisational work, Sahajananda felt quite incompetent to undertake the task, and did not respond to his letter. Sivananda wrote a second letter dated 18 October 1949, requesting him to open a branch. Sahajananda was now in a fix, and thought that since he was a disciple, he should obey and forwarded the affiliation fee to register the branch. Sivananda was evidently impatient to get the branch opened, for before the affiliation fee could reach him, Sivananda sent a third letter, dated 11 November 1949, requesting a branch to be opened. Thus began the saga of Divine Life Society of South Africa.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tuberculosis (TB) is an {{established}} occupational disease affecting {{health care workers}} (HCWs). Determining the risk of TB among HCWs is important to enable authorites to take preventative measures in health care facilities and protect HCWs. This {{study was designed to}} assess the incidence of <b>TB</b> in a <b>teaching</b> hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. This study is retrospective study of health records of HCWs in our hospital from 1991 to 2000. Results The mean workforce of the hospital was 3359 + 33. 2 between 1991 and 2000. There were 31 cases (15 male) meeting the diagnostic criteria for TB, comprising eight doctors, one nurse and 22 other health professionals. Mean incidence of TB was 96 per 100, 000 for all HCWs (relative risk: 2. 71), 79 per 100, 000 for doctors (relative risk: 2. 2), 14 per 100, 000 for nurses and 121 per 100, 000 (relative risk: 3. 4) for other professionals. The mean incidence of TB in Turkey between 1991 and 2000 was 35. 4 per 100, 000. Incidence of TB was similar in the Departments of Chest Diseases and Clinical Medicine but there were no TB cases in the Basic Science and Managerial Departments. Conclusion HCWs in Turkey who work in clinics have an increased risk for TB. Post-graduate education and prevention programs reduce the risk of TB. Control programs to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB should be established in hospitals to reduce risk for HCWs. </p...|$|R
