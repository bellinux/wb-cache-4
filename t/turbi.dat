25|$|The East Africa Force on the {{southern}} front included the 1st South African Division (Major-General George Brink), the 11th (African) Division (Major-General H. E. de R. Wetherall) and the 12th (African) Division (Major-General A. R. Godwin-Austen) (The African divisions were composed of East African, South African, Nigerian and Ghanaian troops under British, Rhodesian and South African officers.) In January 1941, Cunningham decided to launch his first attacks across the Kenyan border directly into southern Ethiopia. Although he realised that the approaching wet season would preclude a direct advance this way to Addis Ababa, he hoped that this action would cause the Ethiopians {{in the south of}} the country to rise up in rebellion against the Italians (the plot proved abortive). Cunningham sent the 1st South African Division (composed of the 2nd and 5th South African and 21st East African brigades) and an independent East African brigade into the Galla-Sidamo Province. From 16 to 18 January 1941, they captured El Yibo and on 19 February, an advance force of the South African Division captured Jumbo. From 24 to 25 January, Cunningham's troops fought on the <b>Turbi</b> Road.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of the 1st South African Infantry Brigade against the Italians at the El Wak border post on 16 December 1940, Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham was intent on opening access into the Galla-Sidamo area across the Chalbi Desert by {{advancing}} eastwards from the eastern side of Lake Rudolf and to support a possible rebellion by the Shifta tribe against the Italians. This was the first offensive to be assigned to 1 SA Division. The division then consisted of the 2nd and 5th SA Brigades (located at Marsabit), the 25th East African Brigade (at Lokitaung) as well as six companies of the 2nd Abyssinian Irregulars. Almost on a daily basis, division infantry and armoured cars crossed the Dida Galgalla in search of enemy patrols. The Italians maintained a well established outpost at <b>Turbi</b> Hills, from which they had clear observation of any vehicle or troop movements in the Dida Galgalla. From December 1940 to February 1941 patrols {{had never been able to}} engage Italian patrols or elements [...] as they withdrew deeper into Abyssinia on sighting the South African patrols entering the Dida Galgalla, only to return the next day.|$|E
60|$|When Eusebius {{had brought}} down his Ecclesiatical History to {{the reign of}} Dioclesian, he thus {{describes}} {{the state of the}} Church: Qualem quantamque gloriam simul ac libertatem doctrina veræ erga supremum Deum pietatis à Christo primùm hominibus annunciata, apud omnes Græcos pariter & barbaros ante persecutionem nostrâ memoriâ excitatam, consecuta sit, nos certè pro merito explicare non possumus. Argumento esse possit Imperatorum benignitas erga nostros: quibus regendas etiam provincias committebant, omni sacrificandi metu eos liberantes ob singularem, qua in religionem nostram affecti erant, benevolentiam. And a little after: Jam vero quis innumerabilem hominum quotidiè ad fidem Christi confugientium turbam, quis numerum ecclesiarum in singulis urbibus, quis illustres populorum concursus in ædibus sacris, cumulatè possit describere? Quo factum est, ut priscis ædificiis jam non contenti, in singulis urbibus spatiosas ab ipsis fundamentis exstruerent ecclesias. Atque hæc progressii temporis increscentia, & quotidiè in majus & melius proficiscentia, nec livor ullus atterere, nec malignitas dæmonis fascinare, nec hominum insidiæ prohibere unquam potuerunt, quamdiu omnipotentis Dei dextra populum suum, utpote tali dignum præsidio, texit atque custodiit. Sed cum ex nimia libertate in negligentiam ac desidiam prolapsi essemus; cum alter alteri invidere atque obtrectare cæpisset; cum inter nos quasi bella intestina gereremus, verbis, tanquam armis quibusdam hastisque, nos mutuò vulnerantes; cum Antistites adversus Antistites, populi in populos collisi, jurgia ac tumultus agitarent; denique cum fraus & simulatio ad summum malitiæ culmen adolevisset: tum divina ultio, levi brachio ut solet, integro adhuc ecclesiæ statu, & fidelium <b>turbis</b> liberè convenientibus, sensim ac moderatè in nos cæpit animadvertere; orsà primùm persecutione ab iis qui militabant. Cum verò sensu omni destituti de placando Dei numine ne cogitaremus quidem; quin potius instar impiorum quorundam res humanas nullâ providentiâ gubernari rati, alia quotidiè crimina aliis adjiceremus: cum Pastores nostri spretâ religionis regulâ, mutuis inter se contentionibus decertarent, nihil aliud quam jurgia, minas, æmulationem, odia, ac mutuas inimicitias amplificare studentes; principatum quasi tyrannidem quandam contentissimè sibi vindicantes: tunc demùm juxta dictum Hieremiæ, obscuravit Dominus in ira sua filiam Sion, & dejecit de cælo gloriam Israel,--per Ecclesiarum scilicet subversionem, &c. This was the state of the Church just before the subversion of the Churches in the beginning of Dioclesian's persecution: and to this state of the Church agrees the first of the seven Epistles to the Angel of the seven Churches, [1] that to the Church in Ephesus. I have something against thee, saith Christ to the Angel of that Church, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. The Nicolaitans are the Continentes above described, who placed religion in abstinence from marriage, abandoning their wives if they had any. They are here called Nicolaitans, from Nicolas one of the seven deacons of the primitive Church of Jerusalem; who having a beautiful wife, and being taxed with uxoriousness, abandoned her, and permitted her to marry whom she pleased, saying that we must disuse the flesh; and thenceforward lived a single life in continency, as his children also. The Continentes afterwards embraced the doctrine of Æons and Ghosts male and female, and were avoided by the Churches till the fourth century; and the Church of Ephesus is here commended for hating their deeds.|$|R

50|$|The {{fighting}} {{was a result}} of competition over scarce water and pasture land in the arid region along the Somali border, as well as a recent political division along ethnic lines.

Cattle rustling is relatively common practice in this region, and some reports suggest that the massacre may have begun as a cattle raid.

We demonstrated that both diffusion theory and similarity relations provide very accurate results when the photon sources are isotropic and buried more deeply than one transport mean free path in turbid media.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} initialising dynamic wind turbine models in power-system simulations. The method uses grid-status information to initialise the grid-connected wind turbine model. The goal is to start a power-system simulation in a stationary state, without unnecessary transient behaviour {{at the beginning of}} the simulation. Correct initialisation is necessary to reach quickly the steady state of the grid-connected wind turbine, before a real transient on the grid occurs. Consequently, the dynamic performance of the system can be independently and accurately evaluated. The method presented considers wind turbines with directly grid-connected induction generators, with constant or variable blade angle (passive stall control, blade angle control or active stall control). These aspects apply to both constant and variable speed wi nd <b>turbi</b> nes. The investigation is performed in the commercial dedicated power-system simulation-tool DIgSILENT. Attention is especially drawn to the initialisation of the non-electrical parts of the wind turbine. The suitability of this initialisation strategy is illustrated by an example.

40|$|Carotenoids are {{protective}} pigments {{present in}} many aquatic organisms that reduce the photooxidative stress induced by short-wavelenght solar radiation, yet increase their susceptibility to predators. Arctodiaptomus spinosus, a calanoid copepod typically {{found in many}} fishless shallow soda lakes, shows large between-lake differences in pigmentation. Here, we attribute these differences to the environmental state of these ecosystems, namely, ‘dark water ’ lakes with submersed vegetation and turbid ‘white ’ lakes lacking macrophytes. Copepod carotenoid concentration in the turbid ‘white ’ lakes was significantly (about 20 -fold) {{higher than in the}} ‘dark water ’ ones, although the latter systems were characterized by higher transparency. In addition, males had on a dry weight basis around three times higher carotenoid concentrations than females. Mycosporine-like amino acids (direct UV screening substances) were found in all cases, but in low concentration. The environmental conditions in these ecosystems were largely shaped by the presence/absence of submersed macrophytes Thus, in the turbid lakes, the strong wind-driven mixis allows for copepods to be brought to the surface and being exposed to solar radiation, whereas in ‘dark water ’ ones, macrophytes reduce water turbulence and additionally provide shelter.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTheoretical analyses of flow with rotating passages of <b>turbi</b> 0 machinery have become {{necessary for the}} proper design of turbo-pump elements in liquid fuel boosters and power conversion units. One such theory is presented, and a numerical solution derived. this theory develops a method for the analysis of steady, inviscid, adiabatic flow through arbitrary rotors. A detailed analysis in a meridional plane is given, assuming axial symmetry. A simplified approach to the blade to blade solution is also presented. The merits of these theories are compared with other proposed methods. The inverse, or design, approach is considered, and found to be unnecessary. A numerical solution for incompressible flow is derived and applied to the flow solution in the impeller of a mixed flow compressor with backwards-bent blades of arbitrary shape. Meridional streamlines and relative vorticity distributioins are progressively calculated on a CDC 1604 computer, using FORTRAN program language. Data are measured from a detailed presentation of the blade shape in a meridional plane. Blade to blade relative velocity distributions are calculated from the meridional plane analysis. It is concluded that the results completely define the flow and are sufficiently accurate for engineering applications. Validation is based upon the reliability of the theory, and upon comparisons with results of other methods. Extensions of the scope of this approach are recommended, which include the compressible solution and the solution of flows in unbladed passages. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
