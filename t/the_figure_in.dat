5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve {{to make him a}} mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1763 {{descriptions}} of the giant appeared in contemporary magazines. The earliest known survey {{was published in the}} Royal Magazine in September 1763. Derivative versions subsequently appeared in the October 1763 St James Chronicle, the July 1764 Gentleman's Magazine, and the 1764 edition of The Annual Register. The Gentleman's Magazine account in particular was prominent, and contained the oldest known drawing of <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b> <b>In</b> 1774, the antiquarian John Hutchins reviewed various previous accounts in his book The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset. In it, he wrote that the carving had only been done the previous century.|$|E

5|$|He used {{friends as}} models, {{most notably the}} painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who {{modelled}} for <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of}} the mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.|$|E
5|$|Burns and {{his wife}} had been friends with Schuyler before {{production}} of the film. According to Glut, Schuyler had recently purchased a new sports jacket and did not want it to get soiled or damaged during production. During the fight scene, in order to avoid stepping on and damaging it, Schuyler would remove the jacket and carry it over his shoulder. When the time came for the film's climax, where the Sun Demon fell to his death off a cliff, neither Burns nor Glut wanted to do the stunt, and neither wanted to damage the mask by putting it on a dummy. So Burns modified a G.I. Joe action figure so that it resembled the Sun Demon, and Glut then shot <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> slow motion tumbling down a hole that resembled a valley. The original film's soundtrack was later added to the remake during post-production, with Glut's friend Bart Andrews supplying the Sun Demon's voice.|$|E
5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E

5|$|The {{first century}} in the {{championship}} was scored by Dennis Amiss of England when he made 137 against India in the 1975 World Cup. The same day New Zealand's Glenn Turner scored 171 not out against East Africa. It remained the highest individual total {{over the next two}} editions until Indian cricketer Kapil Dev scored 175 not out against Zimbabwe in 1983. Following that, the record was broken successively by Viv Richards (181) in 1987, Gary Kirsten (188 not out) in 1996, Chris Gayle (215) and Martin Guptill (237 not out) both in 2015. India cricketer Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the highest number of centuries with six, followed by Australia's Ricky Ponting and Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara with five each. Mark Waugh, Sourav Ganguly, Mahela Jayawardene, AB de Villiers and Tillakaratne Dilshan are joint-third with four centuries. Three players have scored three centuries in a single tournament– Waugh, Ganguly, and Matthew Hayden– in 1996, 2003, 2007 respectively, while Sangakkara made four consecutive centuries in the 2015 World Cup. Ireland's Kevin O'Brien recorded the fastest century when he reached <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> 50 balls, against England in the 2011 World Cup. In 1992, Andy Flower of Zimbabwe– making his ODI debut in a World Cup– scored a century. In the 2015 tournament, 38 centuries were scored, making it the highest number in a single tournament, while the 1979 competition had the least with two.|$|E

25|$|A few {{indicators}} {{suggest that}} there may have existed, in the same location, another structure, likely a temple to the goddess Nabia (as yet undiscovered). <b>The</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the toga could represent the god Asclepius.

25|$|In black-figure vase painting, the pre-drawn {{outlines}} {{were a part}} of <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b> <b>In</b> red-figure vases, {{the outline}} would, after firing, form part of the black background. This led to vases with very thin figures early on. A further problem was that the black background did not permit the depiction of space in any depth, so that spatial perspective was almost never attempted. Nonetheless, the advantages outnumbered the disadvantages. The depiction of muscles and other anatomical details clearly illustrates the development of the style.|$|E

25|$|Early 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw {{objects as}} {{perceived}} within an environment {{according to all}} of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of perception—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It {{is based on the}} here and now, and in the way things are seen. Images can be divided into figure or ground.

25|$|After the {{internationalization}} of the Armenian Question, and the Treaty of Berlin {{that followed}} in 1878, {{the idea of}} a self-governing Armenian nation became a possibility.

The Armenian population statistics for those regions would have influenced the losses of Armenian population but can not account for the other million or more Armenians that are missing in the records of 1881–82 under the reign of Hamid.|$|E
