5|$|In 1953, Mainer and {{his wife}} settled in Flint, Michigan, where he found work at a General Motors factory. Although renouncing both the music {{industry}} and his trademark instrument, <b>the</b> <b>banjo,</b> he and Julia did continue to sing at gospel revival meetings. In the early 1960s, Molly O'Day convinced {{him that he could}} use <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> in gospel recordings, which spurred a series of religiously themed banjo albums beginning in 1961. He also began to record and tour with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He played <b>the</b> <b>banjo,</b> as did Julia, {{though neither}} pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} <b>the</b> <b>banjo).</b> They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of {{what they would do}} in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E
5|$|Mainer grew up {{listening}} to traditional mountain music and was largely influenced by his brother-in-law Roscoe Banks. He first learned to play <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> at square dances, where he would pick up instruments left by performers and practice on them. After moving to Concord, North Carolina and working in a series of jobs at cotton mills, he became a part of his brother J.E.'s band, known as J. E. Mainer's Mountaineers. His entry into the band in 1934 marked the beginning of a nearly six-decade career in music. J.E. played the fiddle while Wade performed on <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> for the string band, and they played at fiddlers' conventions and other gatherings.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Beacon <b>Banjo</b> Company {{expanded}} <b>the</b> <b>banjo’s</b> abilities {{by making}} these specialized tuners able to install {{on all four}} long strings, instead of—as with the cam tuning machines—only on the 2nd and 3rd strings, [...]|$|R
5000|$|In {{partnership}} with <b>the</b> Vega <b>Banjo</b> Company of Boston, Peabody {{developed a new}} type of plectrum <b>banjo</b> called <b>the</b> Vegavox, featuring a resonator that rose the full height of <b>the</b> <b>banjo's</b> body. (Traditional resonators are about half as high.) This increased <b>the</b> <b>banjo's</b> interior resonation space, giving it a distinctively mellow tone. The Vegavox also featured a [...] "top-tension" [...] design that allowed the head's tension to be adjusted without removing the resonator. The Vegavox was produced primarily in four-stringed plectrum (22-fret) and tenor (19-fret) versions; however, some five-string models were made as special orders.|$|R
5|$|Lennon {{played a}} mouth organ during a bus journey {{to visit his}} cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a {{harmonica}} he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, {{and it became a}} signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play <b>the</b> <b>banjo,</b> later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.|$|E
5|$|The song {{has been}} covered by several artists and {{community}} groups. Pete Seeger Released a studio version on his 1956 album American Industrial Ballads and a live {{version of the}} song on his 1964 album Songs of Struggle and Protest, 1930–50. Both versions by Seeger feature him singing and playing <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> without any additional accompaniment. In the live version, the crowd's clapping and singing along can be heard. Folk bands in the Pittsburgh area, such as the NewLanders, have both recorded and performed Seeger's version of the song.|$|E
5|$|Martinique and Guadeloupe {{are also}} home to their own {{distinct}} folk traditions, most influentially including Guadeloupan gwo ka and Martinican tambour and tibwa. Gwo ka {{is a type of}} percussion music which consists of seven basic rhythms and variations on them. It has been modernized into gwo ka moderne, though traditional rural performances (lewoz) are still common. Tambour and ti bwa ensembles are the origin of several important Martinican popular styles, including chouval bwa and biguine, and also exerted an influence on zouk. Lucian folk music features ensembles of fiddle, cuatro, banjo, guitar and chak-chak (a rattle), with <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> and cuatro being of iconic importance, and recreational, often lyric song forms called jwé. The French Creole folk music of Dominica is based on the quadrille, accompanied by ensembles called jing ping. Folk storytelling (kont) and songs (bélé) are also {{a major part of the}} country's musical identity.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} Saint Lucia {{is home to}} many vibrant oral and folk traditions {{and is based on}} {{elements}} derived from the music of Africa, especially rhythmically, and Western Europe, dances like the quadrille, polka and waltz. <b>The</b> <b>banjo</b> and cuatro are iconic Lucian folk instruments, especially a four-stringed banjo called the bwa poye. Celebratory songs called jwé show lyricism, and rhythmic complexity. The most important of the Afro-Lucian Creole folk dances is the kwadril. Music {{is an integral part of}} Lucian folk holidays and celebrations, as well as the good-natured rivalry between the La Rose and La Marguerite societies. There is little Western classical music on Saint Lucia, and the country's popular music industry is only nascent. There are few recording opportunities, though live music and radio remain a vital part of Lucian culture. Popular music from abroad, especially Trinidadian styles like calypso and soca, is widespread.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>banjo</b> is {{frequently}} associated with country, folk, Irish traditional, and bluegrass music. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> occupied a central place in African American traditional music, before becoming {{popular in the}} minstrel shows of the 19th century. <b>The</b> <b>banjo,</b> with the fiddle, is a mainstay of American old-time music. It is also very frequently used in Traditional ("Trad") Jazz.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} hybrid {{instruments}} exist, crossing <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> with other stringed instruments. Most of these use {{the body of}} a banjo, often with a resonator, and the neck of the other instrument. Examples include <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> mandolin (first patented in 1882) and <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> ukulele or banjolele, most famously played by the English comedian George Formby. These were especially popular {{in the early decades of}} the twentieth century, and were probably a result of a desire either to allow players of other instruments to jump on <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> bandwagon at the height of its popularity, or to get the natural amplification benefits of <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> resonator in an age before electric amplification.|$|E
40|$|Among <b>banjos,</b> <b>the</b> {{resonator}} <b>banjo</b> is loud, and the resonator back likely maximizes the loudness {{contributed by}} its sound hole. Using three different methods of sound production, evaluated using three different criteria of loudness, {{it is found}} that the common alternatives, e. g., open back or flat plate back, are equally loud. <b>The</b> total <b>banjo</b> sound volume in essentially indistinguishable among these cases...|$|R

25|$|The Diddley bow (a {{homemade}} one-stringed instrument {{found in}} parts of the American South in the early twentieth century) and <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> are African-derived instruments that may have helped in the transfer of African performance techniques into the early blues instrumental vocabulary. <b>The</b> <b>banjo</b> seems to be directly imported from West African music. It is similar to the musical instrument that griots and other Africans such as the Igbo played (called halam or akonting by African peoples such as the Wolof, Fula and Mandinka). However, in the 1920s, when country blues began to be recorded, the use of <b>the</b> <b>banjo</b> in blues music was quite marginal and limited to individuals such as Papa Charlie Jackson and later Gus Cannon.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> {{plectrum}} <b>banjo</b> is {{a standard}} <b>banjo</b> without <b>the</b> short drone string. It usually has 22 frets on the neck and a scale length of 26 to 28inches, and was originally tuned C3 G3 B3 D4. It can also be tuned like the top four strings of a guitar, which is known as [...] "Chicago tuning." [...] As the name suggests, it is usually played with a guitar-style pick (that is, a single one held between thumb and forefinger), unlike <b>the</b> five-string <b>banjo,</b> which is either played with a thumbpick and two fingerpicks, or with bare fingers. <b>The</b> plectrum <b>banjo</b> evolved out of <b>the</b> five-string <b>banjo,</b> to cater to styles of music involving strummed chords. The plectrum is also featured in many early jazz recordings and arrangements.|$|R
