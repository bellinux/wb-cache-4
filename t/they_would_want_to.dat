25|$|For {{the third}} group of astronauts, {{training}} began with a 240-hour course of the basics of spaceflight. Fifty-eight hours of this was devoted to geology, something that Collins did not readily understand and in which he never became very interested. At the end, Alan Shepard, who {{was head of the}} astronaut office, asked the fourteen to rank their fellow astronauts in the order <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> fly with them in space. Collins picked David Scott in the number one position.|$|E
25|$|Although World War II had {{interrupted}} {{production of}} the Ercoupe, general aviation manufacturers were enthusiastic about the prospects of a postwar aviation boom. Thousands {{of men and women}} were trained as pilots by the government, and the hope was that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> include flying in their civilian life. Production of the model 415-C resumed in 1945, and in 1946 alone 4,311 aircraft were produced and sold at a cost of US$2,665. This was the same price as in 1941. At its peak, ERCO was turning out 34 Ercoupes per day, operating three shifts per day. The aircraft was aggressively marketed through unconventional outlets such as the men's department of the Macy's department store chain.|$|E

When Matt had a second daughter, the two agreed to put the series on hiatus, knowing <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come back to it but could not guarantee a time frame. Mike also noted that they had spent nearly ten years delivering a weekly cartoon, and believed that, creatively, they needed a break.

25|$|Bell and Weinberg {{documented}} {{efforts by}} homosexuals {{to change their}} sexual orientation, finding that depending on factors such as sex and race, between 29 and 38 per cent of its subjects had considered abandoning homosexual behavior. Between 40 and 75 per cent {{of those who had}} considered abandoning homosexuality actually attempted it, some making repeated attempts. The attempts included measures such as withdrawing from gay sociosexual involvement, increasing heterosexual sociosexual involvement, stopping homosexual feelings, and seeking professional help. Between 11 and 23 percent of the subjects had consulted a professional to seek help in giving up homosexuality. When asked whether, had it been possible to take a magic pill at birth that would have guaranteed that they would have become heterosexual, between 72 and 89 per cent indicated that they would not have wanted to take the pill. When asked whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take such a pill now, between 86 and 95 per cent said no. Those who regretted their sexual orientation did so primarily because it exposed them to societal rejection (about 50 per cent gave this as a reason).|$|E
25|$|With no {{significant}} opposition from Italy, Hitler proceeded with Anschluß, the annexation of Austria in 1938. Germany later claimed the Sudetenland, a province of Czechoslovakia inhabited mostly by Germans. Mussolini {{felt he had}} little choice but to help Germany to avoid isolation. With the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, the Fascist regime began to be concerned about the majority ethnic German population in Southern Tyrol and whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> join a Greater Germany. The Fascists were also concerned about whether Italy should follow National Socialist antisemitic policies in order to gain favor from those National Socialists who had mixed feelings about Italy as an ally. In 1938, Mussolini pressured fellow Fascist members to support the enacting of antisemitic policies, but this was not well taken as a number of Fascists were Jewish and antisemitism was not an active political concept in Italy. Nevertheless, Mussolini forced through antisemitic legislation even while his own son-in-law and prominent Fascist Count Galeazzo Ciano personally condemned such laws. In turn for enacting the extremely unpopular antisemitic laws, Mussolini and the Fascist government demanded a concession from Hitler and the National Socialists. In 1939, the Fascists demanded from Hitler that his government willingly accept the Italian government's plan to have all Germans in South Tyrol either leave Italy or be forced to accept Italianization. Hitler agreed and thus the threat to Italy from the South Tyrol Germans was neutralized.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} the film, Hillenburg {{wanted to end}} the series [...] "so [...] wouldn't jump the shark." [...] "We're working on episodes 40 through 60 right now, and I always looked at that as a typical run for an animated show. [...] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now {{was a good time}} to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it's good not to go to the point where people don't want to see your show anymore," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: [...] "The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn't afford not to," [...] storyboard director Sam Henderson observed. Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: [...] "I think [...] respect that my contribution is important. I think <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> maintain the original concept and quality." [...] Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role. Although he no longer has a direct involvement in the production of SpongeBob SquarePants, he still retains a position as an executive producer and maintains an advisory role, reviewing each episode. While he was on the show, Hillenburg voiced Potty the Parrot and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording. During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty, while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director.|$|E
