5|$|Although he {{successfully}} prosecuted his {{operations in}} the war against Paraguay, Inhaúma's leadership was encumbered by his hesitating and procrastinating behavior. While in command in the war zone, he became mentally exhausted and contracted an unknown disease. Seriously ill, Inhaúma returned to the national capital in early 1869 and died shortly thereafter. Although historical works have not given much coverage to Inhaúma, some historians regard him among <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>of</b> the Brazilian navy officers.|$|E

5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. <b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>of</b> these is global warming and the {{consequent}} rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E

The Panthers were again undefeated and, like the {{previous}} year, six of the eight games were shutouts. Thirty-two of their 35 players were from Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The team scored 255 points, conceding 25. Warner considered the team an improvement because its defense was more dominant than the previous year's. The Panthers were the consensus national champions, and Warner became {{recognized as one of}} football's greatest coaches.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bohemia (then part of Austrian Empire) as a German-speaking Jew of humble circumstances, Mahler {{displayed}} {{his musical}} gifts {{at an early}} age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 {{as director of the}} Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>of</b> opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky. Late in his life he was briefly director of New York's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic.|$|E

5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden as <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>of</b> all the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by {{his father and his}} son. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others. In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E
5|$|Development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 {{began at}} the end of 1991, with both Japanese and American staff, from Sonic Team and Sega Technical Institute respectively, {{contributing}} to development. As with the original game, the soundtrack was composed by Dreams Come True songwriter Masato Nakamura. Upon release, the game was a critical and commercial success, selling over six million copies, making it the second-best-selling Genesis game behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog. It has since been released on several compilations and downloads for various platforms, which were also generally positively received.

Eventually he killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils. Fëanor then named him Morgoth (S. The Black Enemy). Fëanor and his seven sons then swore to take the Silmarils back, and led a large army of the Noldor to Beleriand.|$|E

5|$|In the 8th century BC, {{after the}} end of the {{so-called}} Greek Dark Ages, Greece emerged with a network of myths and legends, <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>of</b> all being that of the Trojan Epic Cycle. In general, the Greeks of classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth. The legends of Homer's Epics were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. At this time, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of Mycenae in 1876. Thus, Schliemann set out to prove the historical accuracy of the Iliad by identifying the places described by Homer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after his death and mainly {{following}} the downfall of the Brazilian monarchy, Caxias' reputation was initially overshadowed by that of Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval, but with time surpassed even Erval's renown.

On 13 March 1962 he was officially designated the army's protectorits soldierly ideal and the most important figure in its tradition.
