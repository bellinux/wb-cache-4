25|$|Living {{conditions}} {{here were}} in general very difficult, due {{mostly to the}} remoteness of the area {{and the lack of}} proper means of transportation. Transportation consisted usually of a small sailboat that traveled back and forth once a month, and whose journey took many hours, Reaching the mainland from Cayo Coco, for example, took around 10 hours, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> had to be run at sea.|$|E
25|$|On 30 January, Napolitano {{appointed}} Franco Marini {{to try to}} form {{a caretaker}} government {{with the goal of}} changing the current electoral system, rather than call a quick election.

50|$|From another perspective, {{the farmer}} and the miller both reduce a risk and acquire a risk when they sign the futures contract: the farmer reduces <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> price of wheat will fall below the price {{specified}} in the contract and acquires <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> price of wheat will rise above the price {{specified in the}} contract (thereby losing additional income {{that he could have}} earned). The miller, on the other hand, acquires <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract (thereby paying more in the future than he otherwise would have) and reduces <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract. In this sense, one party is <b>the</b> insurer (<b>risk</b> taker) for one type of <b>risk,</b> and <b>the</b> counter-party is <b>the</b> insurer (<b>risk</b> taker) for another type of risk.|$|R

25|$|A later study {{questioned}} {{the attitudes of}} adolescents. When asked about abstinence, many girls reported they felt conflicted. They were trying to balance maintaining a good reputation with trying to maintain a romantic relationship and wanting to behave in adult-like ways. Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys. Some boys said that for them, <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> may come from having sex were {{not as bad as}} the social risks that could come from remaining abstinent.|$|E
25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take {{the opposite side of}} every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E
500|$|Lody's {{information}} was entirely inaccurate {{and had been}} gleaned, as he was to admit at his trial, purely from rumours: [...] "I heard it in the boarding-house and I heard it in the barber's shop." [...] His second letter, in German, was addressed to [...] "Herr Stammer" [...] at German naval intelligence in Courbierestrasse, Berlin, and contained details of British naval losses and vessels stationed at Leith and Grangemouth. He had obtained details of the naval vessels simply by climbing Calton Hill in Edinburgh and observing the panorama from the summit, and by taking a promenade along the seafront at Grangemouth, used by thousands of citizens as a popular excursion. He was worried about <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> he was taking and stated in his letter {{that he would not}} go near any place where he could be challenged, or where barricades and restrictions prevented access. His lack of training or preparation meant that these letters, like all of his communications, were written with no attempt at concealment whatsoever– no code or invisible ink– and were composed entirely en clair in ordinary written English or German.|$|E

30|$|The {{collaboration}} agreement contract shows partners’ congruence for actions (if required) {{for dealing with}} pre-identified collaboration risks, which may be categorized as belonging to the four types of capital. These risks are: (1) financial capital <b>risks,</b> including <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> no major customers will use the results, the market environment or the end-user views may change and make the results obsolete, and a competing solution will emerge and make the results less valuable; (2) human capital <b>risks,</b> including <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> a key person with {{a specific type of}} expertise leaves the project; (3) social capital <b>risks,</b> including <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> a partner is underperforming, a key partner is leaving the project, or the partners cannot agree due to conflicting interests; and (4) innovative capital <b>risks,</b> including <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> key technologies or components are not available at the expected time and that key milestones or critical deliverables are delayed.|$|R

2500|$|The {{magnitude}} of the reaction was underestimated and pressures from the public opinion on the Mulroney government forced it to take preventive measures. First were the Inuit populations of the region who were concerned about <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> an unregulated commercial passage would threaten their livelihood and compromise their ethnic integrity. [...] Then, nationalists groups further increased pressure on the government through editorials {{in the press and}} public protests. One group even announced plans during the Polar Sea voyage to place Canadian flags across the path of the icebreaker. This actual plan was not carried out but Canadian students and Inuit activists managed to drop leaflets in a cylinder wrapped with a Canadian Flag onto the deck of the ship near Melville Island. Their message requested that the crew return the icebreaker to international waters. Finally, the Soviet diplomacy spoke in support of the public outcry by stating that it believed in Canada’s right to sovereignty on its Northwest passage just like the USSR believed the Northeast passage belonged to them.|$|E
2500|$|... "The [...] {{directors}} of Northern Rock were the principal {{authors of the}} difficulties {{that the company has}} faced since August 2007. It is right that members of the Board of Northern Rock have been replaced, though haphazardly, since the company became dependent on liquidity support from the Bank of England. The high-risk, reckless business strategy of Northern Rock, with its reliance on short- and medium-term wholesale funding and an absence of sufficient insurance and a failure to arrange standby facility or cover that risk, meant that it was unable to cope with the liquidity pressures placed upon it by the freezing of international capital markets in August 2007. Given that the formulation of that strategy was a fundamental role of the Board of Northern Rock, overseen by some directors who had been there since its demutualisation, the failure of that strategy must also be attributed to the Board. The non-executive members of the Board, and in particular the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Risk Committee and the senior non-executive director, failed in the case of Northern Rock to ensure that it remained liquid as well as solvent, to provide against <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> it was taking and to act as an effective restraining force on the strategy of the executive members." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{collaboration}} is not however, {{to be confused}} with assimilation or [...] "selling out". [...] The romance plots in the novel have been perceived as assimilationist as if the Anglo men are conquering the Mexican women. [...] However, as Cotera notes, [...] "such criticisms are founded, of course, on the exigencies of race and nation, forcing what is essentially a critique of patriarchal ideology into service as a critique of imperialism, a service that the novel only imperfectly satisfies". [...] Instead of viewing the collaboration as a [...] "sell out" [...] or a problem, it {{can be viewed as a}} nepantla, a term the highly acclaimed and respected Chicana scholar Gloria Anzaldúa uses based on a Nahuatl word that refers to [...] "a space between or a middle ground". [...] This concept favors the recognition of the humanity in others and ourselves in order to create bridges and overcome borders. [...] This works on multiple levels, [...] "collapsing ‘the binaries of colored/white, female/male, mind/body," [...] all of which are relevant to Caballero and the historical context of the novel. [...] Eimer and Gonzalez took a leap of faith in one another in both their friendship and their work, as [...] "Caballero's collaborations across difference take place against a historical and geographical backdrop that highlights <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> such a crossing entail a U.S.-Mexico borderlands still in formation in 1846-1848…". [...] It cannot be stressed enough that beyond the Mexican/Anglo leap of faith taken, the text works with many layers of collaboration on the [...] "path of conocimiento". Caballero's structure of genres is [...] "part history, part tragedy, part romance, part feminist tract," [...] and [...] "its multivalent strategies of description reflect the very complexity of the historical transformations that it seeks to document.|$|E
