5|$|A second group, <b>the</b> <b>Foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Pure Spanish Horse or PRE Mundial, {{has begun}} another PRE {{registry}} {{as an alternative}} to the ANCCE.

Thus, the PRE Mundial registry asserts that their registry is the most authentic, purest PRE registry functioning today.|$|E

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and {{the culmination of}} the 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Among Harrison's most {{enduring}} legacies is {{the series of}} treaties that he either negotiated or signed with Native American leaders during his tenure as the Indiana territorial governor. As part of the treaty negotiations, the native tribes ceded large tracts {{of land in the}} west that provided additional acreage for purchase and settlement. Harrison's chief presidential legacy lies in his campaigning methods, which laid <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> modern presidential campaign tactics.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E

Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E
5|$|An Act of Congress created {{instruction}} in military science and tactics {{at the college}} level. As {{a result of the}} act, St. John's brought a cadet corps to campus. From 1885 to 1890, Lt. Herbert C. Squires—a veteran of the 7th U.S. Cavalry—built a cadet battalion to a strength of 200, which would provide <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> modern ROTC unit at Fordham. The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, academic regalia for students at commencement was first adopted.|$|E

5|$|Andersen went to sea at age 15, {{and later}} found {{work as a}} mason's assistant. On 7November 1916 he married Lovise Kristine Klausen, {{who worked as a}} {{waitress}} at a restaurant frequented by Andersen. They soon got an apartment at Torshov and had a son. Andersen got a better-paid job, laying <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, but when that job was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an upturn during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for the worse, no-one would hire a man with an institutional background, and he was out of work. He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it on the black market in Kristiania, but this was not enough for his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between bin Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used as <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> June 1998 New York indictment of bin Laden, although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, {{and the potential for}} civilian casualties.|$|E
5|$|As Mormonism gained {{popularity}} in the Pacific, church-sponsored schools became more common. The Makeke School, founded by Coombs in the 1920s, became <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> later established Liahona College. The church leased 276 acres near Nuku'alofa. The Liahona School opened in 1952 {{and led to a}} great expansion of the church. The Liahona School was intended to allow for more students with more hired faculty members and a broader curriculum. The education provided to Tongan students prepared them for life outside of Tonga, whether it was pursuing a secondary education or a job in America. Today, the school is known as Liahona High School.|$|E
