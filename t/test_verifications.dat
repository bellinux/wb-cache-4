40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} verification of a swing reducing controller for heli-copter slung load systems using intentional delayed feedback. It is intended for augmenting a trajectory tracking helicopter controller and thereby improving the slung load handing capabilities for autonomous helicopters. The delayed feedback controller is added to ac-tively reduce oscillations of the slung load by improving the damping of the slung load pendulum modes. Furthermore, it is intended for integration with a feedforward control scheme based on input shaping for concurrent avoidance and dampening of swing. The de-sign of the delayed feedback controller is presented as an optimization problem which gives {{the possibility of an}} automated design process. Simulations and flight <b>test</b> <b>verifications</b> of the control system on two different autonomous helicopters are presented and it is shown how a significant improvement of oscillation damping can be achieved.

40|$|Abstract. Testing multi-threaded {{systems is}} quite a challenge. The nondeterminism of these systems makes their {{implementation}} and their test implementation far more susceptible to error. It is common to have tests of these systems that may not pass sometimes and whose failures are not caused by application faults (bugs). For instance, this can happen when <b>test</b> <b>verifications</b> (assertions) are performed at inappropriate times. Unreliable tests make developers waste their time trying to find non-existing bugs, or else make them search for bugs in the wrong place. Another problem is that developers may cease to believe that certain test failures are caused by software bugs even when this is the case. In this paper, we propose an approach to avoid test failures that are caused, not by application bugs, but by test assertions performed either too early or too late. Our basic idea is to use thread monitoring to support test development. Moreover, we put forward a testing framework that follows the proposed approach, and we also {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} this framework for testing a multi-threaded system. 1...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the program and}} the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 16201 "Synergies among <b>Testing,</b> <b>Verification,</b> and Repair for Concurrent Programs". This seminar builds upon, and is inspired by, several past seminars on program <b>testing,</b> <b>verification,</b> repair and combinations thereof. These include Dagstuhl Seminar 13021 "Symbolic Methods in Testing"; Dagstuhl Seminar 13061 "Fault Prediction, Localization and Repair"; Dagstuhl Seminar 14171 "Evaluating Software Verification Systems: Benchmarks and Competitions"; Dagstuhl Seminar 14352 "Next Generation Static Software Analysis Tools"; Dagstuhl Seminar 14442 "Symbolic Execution and Constraint Solving"; and Dagstuhl Seminar 15191 "Compositional Verification Methods for Next-Generation Concurrency". These were held in January 2013; February 2013; April 2014; August 2014; October 2014; and May 2015, respectively. Two notable contributions of Dagstuhl Seminar 16201, which distinguish it from these past seminars, are (i) the focus on concurrent programming, which introduces significant challenges to <b>testing,</b> <b>verification</b> and repair tools, as well as (ii) the goal of identifying and exploiting synergies between the <b>testing,</b> <b>verification</b> and repair research communities in light of common needs and goals...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{questions}} of model credibility introduce more {{problems in a}} generic model {{than they do in}} models developed for one specific application since a generic formulation must allow for many applications of the model. This paper addresses the issues of model <b>testing,</b> <b>verification</b> and validation for a generic electro-optic sensor system model. A structural approach to <b>testing,</b> <b>verification</b> and validation is proposed that builds increasing confidence through bottom-up <b>testing,</b> structured <b>verification</b> procedures and carefully selected validation metrics. These metrics are based on a geometrical view of model outputs that may be compared with measurements using qualitative methods or quantitative approaches involving image processing, artificial neural networks or fuzzy pattern recognition. The advantage over traditional validation methods is most marked in the case of complex models with many key quantities where it not only provides insight about the validity but also about sensitivities. These validation tools have been applied, in conjunction with more traditional metrics, to the <b>testing,</b> <b>verification</b> and validation of the generic model configured as a thermal imager system...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{critical}} phases {{in the development of}} a spacecraft attitude control system (ACS) is the testing of its flight software. The <b>testing</b> (and <b>test</b> <b>verification)</b> of ACS flight software requires a mix of skills involving software, attitude control, data manipulation, and analysis. The process of analyzing and verifying flight software test results often creates a bottleneck which dictates the speed at which flight software verification can be conducted. In the development of the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) spacecraft ACS subsystem, an integrated design environment was used that included a MAP high fidelity (HiFi) simulation, a central database of spacecraft parameters, a script language for numeric and string processing, and plotting capability. In this integrated environment, it was possible to automate many of the steps involved in flight software testing, making the entire process more efficient and thorough than on previous missions. In this paper, we will compare the testing process used on MAP to that used on previous missions. The software tools that were developed to automate <b>testing</b> and <b>test</b> <b>verification</b> will be discussed, including the ability to import and process test data, synchronize test data and automatically generate HiFi script files used for <b>test</b> <b>verification,</b> and an automated capability for generating comparison plots. A summary of the perceived benefits of applying these test methods on MAP will be given. Finally, the paper will conclude with a discussion of re-use of the tools and techniques presented, and the ongoing effort to apply them to flight software testing of the Triana spacecraft ACS subsystem...|$|R
