50|$|A keel-shaped needle with a <b>titanium</b> <b>electrode</b> layer {{rides in}} the groove with {{extremely}} light tracking force (65 mg) and an electronic circuit is formed through the disc and stylus. Like an audio turntable, the stylus reads the disc, starting at the outer edge and going towards the center. The video and audio signals are stored on the Videodiscs in a composite analog signal which is encoded into vertical undulations {{in the bottom of}} the groove, somewhat like pits. These undulations have a shorter wavelength than the length of the stylus tip {{in the groove}}, and the stylus rides over them; the varying distance between the stylus tip and the conductive surface due to the depth of the undulations in the groove under the stylus directly controls the capacitance between the stylus and the conductive carbon-loaded PVC disc. This varying capacitance in turn alters the frequency of a resonant circuit, producing an FM electrical signal which is then decoded into video and audio signals by the player's electronics.|$|E

30|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken for searching {{the source of}} linear trends in JASC submarine cable data over the time interval of 6 years and estimating the electrode noise level. One {{of the reasons for}} a trend is probably the potential instability in the cable ground, which happened because the <b>titanium</b> <b>electrodes</b> of the ground were placed in sea water that is electrochemically active. To study this phenomenon, we have registered the voltage variations of three <b>titanium</b> JASC cable <b>electrodes,</b> which were closely spaced (≈ 15 cm) and placed at a depth of ≈ 15 m near the coast for 70 days, synchronously with JASC cable voltage observations. The electrode noise level and coherence between channels were estimated and linear trends in electrode pair voltage variation were revealed. The estimated linear trend magnitude is about 0.28 mV/day, which is comparable with 0.21 mV/day earlier observed in JASC submarine cable data. We concluded that the linear trend in JASC cable data is, at least partly, probably caused by the <b>titanium</b> <b>electrodes</b> potential variations. This linear trend should be registered simultaneously with JASC cable voltage observation, keeping in mind the possibility of finding a procedure for removing it, in order to enhance the signal/noise ratio in data.|$|R

40|$|Titanium is a {{valve metal}} that is {{reported}} to be corrosion-resistant in acid media; that property is attributed to the formation of a passive TiO 2 film at the surface of the metal. The chemical stability and the electrochemical properties of TiO 2 layers are strongly dependent on their preparation process. A careful study of those properties is a necessary step to propose titanium as a substrate for anodes in industrial electrolytic cells. Deposition of an electronic conductor coating on Ti/TiO 2 substrates leads to « modified <b>titanium</b> <b>electrodes</b> ». These deposits may be: a noble metal (platinum) or a metallic oxide (RuO 2, IrO 2, PbO 2 [...] .), i. e. conducting compounds which exhibit an electrocatalytic behaviour vs specific electrochemical reactions. In the present work, a particular attention is given to the electrochemical behaviour of modified <b>titanium</b> <b>electrodes</b> in aqueous solutions. First, the properties of the substrate are recalled. The passive layer is composed of TiO 2, a n-type semiconductor that may be formed by thermal oxidation, chemical oxidation, or anodisation. The composition, thickness and electrochemical properties of those films are reviewed. Their conductivity may be enhanced considerably by doping. Second, the modification of the substrates by cathodic electrodeposition of a metal is described. That procedure is useful for preparing anodes coated with a noble metal. For example, Ti/TiO 2 /Pt structures exhibit a very interesting reactivity that may be illustrated by cyclic voltammetry or impedance spectroscopy experiments. Third, the modification of <b>titanium</b> <b>electrodes</b> by a metallic oxide is reviewed. It leads to the preparation of the well-known Dimensionally Stable Anodes (DSA). It is also possible to deposit metallic oxides by an anodic process, for example PbO 2 electrodeposition, leading to « low-cost DSA » that may be used for the oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) in sulphuric acid.

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide {{generation}} {{is a major}} issue in sewer management. A novel method based on electrochemical sulfide oxidation was recently shown to be highly effective for sulfide removal from synthetic and real sewage. Here, we compare the performance of five different mixed metal oxide (MMO) coated <b>titanium</b> <b>electrode</b> materials for the electrochemical removal of sulfide from domestic wastewater. All electrode materials performed similarly in terms of sulfide removal, removing 78 +/- 5 %, 77 +/- 1 %, 85 +/- 4 %, 84 +/- 1 %, and 83 +/- 2 % at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) using Ta/Ir, Au/Ir, Pt/Ir, SnO(2) and PbO(2), respectively. Elevated chloride concentrations, often observed in coastal areas, did not entail any significant difference in performance. Independent of the electrode material used, sulfide oxidation by in situ generated oxygen was the predominant reaction mechanism. Passivation of the electrode surface by deposition of elemental sulfur did not occur. However, scaling was observed in the cathode compartment. This study shows that all the MMO coated <b>titanium</b> <b>electrode</b> materials studied are suitable anodic materials for sulfide removal from wastewater. Ta/Ir and Pt/Ir coated titanium electrodes seem the most suitable electrodes since they possess the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution, are stable at low chloride concentration and are already used in full scale applications.

Current abatement strategies typically involve addition of various types of chemicals to the wastewater, which incurs large operational costs.

In this study, we investigated high rate electrochemical oxidation of sulfide at Ir/Ta mixed metal oxide (MMO) coated <b>titanium</b> <b>electrodes</b> as a means to remove sulfide from wastewater. Both synthetic and real wastewaters were used in the experiments. Electrochemical sulfide oxidation by means of indirect oxidation with in-situ produced oxygen appeared to be the main reaction mechanism at Ir/Ta MMO coated <b>titanium</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The maximum obtained sulfide removal rate was 11. 8 +/- 1. 7 g S m(- 2) projected anode surface h(- 1) using domestic wastewater at sulfide concentrations of >= 30 mg L(- 1) or higher. The final products of the oxidation were sulfate, thiosulfate and elemental sulfur. Chloride and acetate concentrations did not entail differences in sulfide removal, nor were the latter two components affected by the electrochemical oxidation. Hence, the use of electrodes to generate oxygen in sewer systems may constitute a promising method for reagent-free removal of sulfide from wastewater. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
