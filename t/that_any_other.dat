5|$|Another {{option was}} to {{relocate}} to Anaheim, in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated {{they were willing to}} negotiate the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, which would make the media market small and limit revenue.|$|E

It explicitly stipulated that these associations were not to have operational command over the forces they administered.|$|E
5|$|If a P. schultzi female is mature, a male P. schultzi {{will try}} to copulate with her, or cohabit with a subadult female and copulate while she is moulting. They usually mate on a web or on a {{dragline}} made by the female, and P. schultzi typically copulates for about 100seconds, while others in the genus can take several minutes or even several hours. Females try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. Contests between Portia females are violent, and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60seconds. Sometimes, one female knocks the other {{on her back and}} the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. When hunting, P. schultzi mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> females, males, or juveniles of the same species may contend for the same prey.|$|E

5|$|In addition, the {{complaint}} {{alleged that the}} defendants made numerous false statements in attempting to collect payments from consumers, claiming that the computer owner or someone else consented to receiving the pop-up payment demands until they paid, the owner of any computer that received the pop-ups was legally obligated to pay Movieland, and that the computer owner was obligated to satisfy any contract <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> person entered into while using the computer.

5|$|When hunting, mature {{females of}} P. fimbriata, P. africana, P. fimbriata, P. labiata, and P. schultzi emit {{olfactory}} signals that {{reduce the risk}} <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> females, males or juveniles {{of the same species}} may contend for the same prey. The effect inhibits aggressive mimicry against a prey spider even if the prey spider is visible, and also if the prey is inhabiting any part of a web. If a female of one of these Portias smells a male of the same species, the female stimulates the males to court. These Portia species do not show this behaviour when they receive olfactory signals from members of other Portia species.|$|E

25|$|Before courtship, males spin a small web between boughs or twigs, {{that they}} hang under, {{ejaculate}} into, and then soak the semen into reservoirs on their pedipalps. If a female smells a male {{of the same}} species, the female stimulates the males to court. While hunting, mature females of P. africana emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> females, males or juveniles {{of the same species}} may contend for the same prey.|$|E

25|$|Colin McGinn {{argues that}} the Chinese room {{provides}} strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble.

It is plain <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.|$|E

25|$|During {{the year}} {{following}} that contract, with Dodsley, Burke founded the influential Annual Register, a publication in which various authors evaluated the international political {{events of the}} previous year. The extent to which Burke contributed to the Annual Register is unclear: in his biography of Burke, Robert Murray quotes the Register as evidence of Burke's opinions, yet Philip Magnus in his biography does not cite it directly as a reference. Burke remained the chief editor of the publication until at least 1789 {{and there is no}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> writer contributed to it before 1766.|$|E

On April 11, while the Corps was waiting for the snow to diminish, Lewis' dog, Seaman, was stolen by Indians, but was retrieved shortly. Worried that other such acts might follow, Lewis warned the chief <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> wrongdoing or mischievous acts would result in instant death.|$|E

25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind.

25|$|An {{elaborate}} fourteen-day {{period of}} mourning followed the cremation, {{during which the}} family performed various symbolic acts around the pyre and were regarded to be highly polluted in ritual terms, thus necessitating not only that they took regular baths but also <b>that</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> Nair who might touch them must also take a bath. The period {{was followed by a}} feast and by participation in sports events, which also involved Nairs from nearby villages. Subsequently, the family stayed in mourning while one male member undertook a diksha, during which time he had to maintain a pure life. This involved him living with a Brahmin, bathing twice daily and desisting from cutting either his hair or his fingernails, as well as being prevented from speaking with or indeed even seeing women. In some cases the diksha might last for a year rather than the more usual forty-one days, in which case there would be considerable celebration at its end.|$|E
