500|$|In one ending, Junpei {{learns that}} the first Nonary Game was run by Cradle Pharmaceutical, of which Ace is the CEO. Zero was a {{participant}} of this game, and had set up the second Nonary Game as revenge towards Ace. The surviving players confront Ace and learn he manipulated the 9th Man to violate the rules and get himself killed in order to both cover his identity and obtain the 9th Man's bracelet. As they find <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 9, Akane becomes weak. Santa watches over her while the others enter the door, leading to an incinerator, where Ace grabs Lotus and holds her at gunpoint. Discovering the incinerator is about to activate, Snake tackles Ace, and Lotus and Seven pull Junpei out of the incinerator before it goes off, consuming Snake and Ace. Junpei returns to Akane, finding her nearly dead. Zero says over the loudspeakers that the game's loser has been determined; Junpei acts defiant, but Zero clarifies that he is referring to himself. Junpei investigates a nearby room, and returns to find Akane and Santa have disappeared, after which he is knocked out by a gas grenade. After the player views this ending, they can then access the ultimate or [...] "true" [...] ending.|$|E
500|$|Graunt {{recorded}} the incompetence of the Searchers at identifying true causes of death, remarking on the frequent recording of 'consumption' rather than other diseases which were recognised then by physicians. He suggested {{a cup of}} ale and a doubling of their fee to two groats rather than one was sufficient for Searchers to change {{the cause of death}} to one [...] more convenient for the householders. No one wished to be known as having had a death by plague in their household, and Parish Clerks, too, connived in covering up cases of plague in their official returns. Analysis of the Bills of Mortality during the months plague took hold shows a rise in deaths other than by plague well above the average death rate, which has been attributed to misrepresentation of the true cause of death. As plague spread, a system of quarantine was introduced, whereby any house where someone had died from plague would be locked up and no one allowed to enter or leave for 40 days. This frequently led to the deaths of the other inhabitants, by neglect if not from plague, and provided ample incentive not to report the disease. The official returns record 68,596 cases of plague, but a reasonable estimate suggests this figure is 30,000 short of the true total. A plague house was marked with a red cross on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "Lord have mercy upon us", and a watchman stood guard outside.|$|E

2500|$|A {{simple way}} to {{demonstrate}} that a switching strategy really does win {{two out of three}} times with the standard assumptions is to simulate the game with playing cards (Gardner 1959b; [...] ). Three cards from an ordinary deck are used to represent the three doors; one 'special' card represents <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> car and two other cards represent the goat doors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trapdoor}} is [...] {{difficult to}} see when it is closed because the plant and soil materials effectively camouflage it. The trapdoor is hinged on one side with silk. The spiders, which are usually nocturnal, typically wait for prey while {{holding on to the}} underside of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> claws on their tarsi. Prey is captured when insects, other arthropods, or small vertebrates disturb the 'trip' lines the spider lays out around its trapdoor, alerting the spider to a meal within reach. The spider detects the prey by vibrations and, when it comes close enough, leaps out of its burrow to make the capture.|$|E
2500|$|Herbert sent Baralongs 12 Royal Marines, {{under the}} command of a Corporal Collins, to find the {{surviving}} German sailors aboard Nicosian. As they departed, Herbert told Collins, [...] "Take no prisoners." [...] The Germans were discovered in the engine room and shot on sight. According to Sub-Lieutenant Gordon Steele: [...] "Wegener ran to a cabin on the upper deck -- I later found out it was Manning's bathroom. The marines broke down <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> butts of their rifles, but Wegener squeezes through a scuttle and dropped into the sea. He still had his life-jacket on and put up his arms in surrender. Corporal Collins, however, took aim and shot him through the head." [...] Corporal Collins later recalled that, after Wegener's death, Herbert threw a revolver in the German captain's face and screamed, [...] "What about the Lusitania, you bastard!" [...] An alternative account says that the Germans who boarded Nicosian were killed by the freighter's engine room staff; this report apparently came from the officer in command of the muleteers.|$|E

2500|$|This {{question}} {{is called the}} Monty Hall problem due to its resembling scenarios on the game show Let's Make a Deal; its answer existed before it was used in [...] "Ask Marilyn". She said the selection should be switched to door #2 {{because it has a}} 2/3 chance of success, while door #1 has just 1/3. To summarize, 2/3 of the time the opened door #3 will indicate the location of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> car (the door you had not picked and the one not opened by the host). Only 1/3 of the time will the opened door #3 mislead you into changing from the winning door to a losing door. These probabilities assume you change your choice each time door #3 is opened, and that the host always opens a door with a goat. This response provoked letters from thousands of readers, nearly all arguing doors #1 and #2 each have an equal chance of success. A follow-up column reaffirming her position served only to intensify the debate and soon became a feature article {{on the front page of}} The New York Times. Parade received around 10,000 letters from readers who thought her wrong.|$|E
2500|$|The embattled under-marshal {{would try}} hard to retain {{his power and}} after two months of being accused of the felonies, at last, on 16 December, he showed his poorly written [...] "answer" [...] spread on 9 pages of foolscap. The {{document}} is {{a record of the}} names of all those places mentioned above, where Hitchen met the thieves and organised crimes with them. It also gives the examples of social details, one of which explains how Lord Barnard's bills through a chain of accidents appeared in Hitchen's hands. If one did not tip the porter in the General Post Office, he would throw the letter out. Pickpockets, visiting the Office for their own purpose in the midnight, saw the other one at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bills inside. Seeing the boys with the papers on the one side of the tavern and a sad victim on the other, set Hitchen to assist him. Certainly, this rather comic justification with others added to his main reason of being maliciously persecuted by the robbers was not to blindfold the Court of Aldermen, who were reluctant to take decision against him anyway for the clear reasons discussed above. On the other hand, they could not utterly ignore the Lord Mayor's reminder to the committee, that marshal's behaviour humiliated the City and reflected other officers' behaviour under the Mayor. All they did, though, was rather cynical. After waiting for Hitchen's written defence, presented itself as late as 16 December, they did not read it until 16 January 1713. As for their decision on marshal's suspension, it came over five months late, that was 24 June 1713 and [...] "forbade him attendance on the Lord Mayor" [...] while retaining his power as a constable to obtain warrant when needed and apprehend.|$|E
