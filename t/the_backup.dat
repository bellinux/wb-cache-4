5|$|During the 2010 {{regular season}} and playoffs, Kafka was {{inactive}} as the team's third quarterback for all but five games. In week two Kafka was <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> to Vick against the Detroit Lions after Kolb suffered a concussion in week one against the Green Bay Packers. In Week 5 against the San Francisco 49ers, week six against the Atlanta Falcons and week seven against the Tennessee Titans, Kafka was <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> to Kolb after Vick, who took over as the starting quarterback {{for the remainder of}} the season, suffered a rib injury in Week 4 against the Washington Redskins. In the week seventeen game against the Dallas Cowboys, Kafka was <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> quarterback to Kolb in a decision to rest Vick and the team's starters before the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the Gemini 9 mission, scheduled for early June. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> for Gemini 10, became the mission's backup crew, and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without the Gemini experience, it is unlikely that Aldrin would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The New York Jets signed Gault as a {{free agent}} in 1973, and he was slated to compete with Al Woodall for <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> quarterback spot behind Joe Namath. At the end of preseason, he lost <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> spot to Woodall, and was released. The {{following}} year, Gault signed with the New York Stars of the new World Football League in April. After practicing with the team throughout the offseason, he was released in August, ending his professional career.|$|E

5000|$|Differential : Each {{differential}} <b>backup</b> saves <b>the</b> {{data that}} has changed since <b>the</b> last full <b>backup.</b> It has <b>the</b> advantage that only a maximum of two data sets are needed to restore the data. One disadvantage, compared to <b>the</b> incremental <b>backup</b> method, is that as time from <b>the</b> last full <b>backup</b> (and thus <b>the</b> accumulated changes in data) increases, so does the time to perform <b>the</b> differential <b>backup.</b> Restoring an entire system would require starting from the most recent full backup and then applying just <b>the</b> last differential <b>backup</b> since <b>the</b> last full <b>backup.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Houston Texans, {{the newest}} {{franchise}} in the NFL, signed Quinn to a reserve/future contract on December 30, 2001. Following the 2002 NFL Draft {{in which the}} Texans drafted quarterback David Carr with their first ever pick, Quinn became <b>the</b> <b>backup.</b> Quinn and Tony Banks ended up winning <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> jobs to Carr over Kent Graham and Ben Sankey. Banks was secondstring with Quinn being the thirdstring quarterback. The Texans waived Quinn during final cuts on August 25, 2003. He was the final member of the Texans first signings still on the team. He was re-signed to the practice squad on November 17 after David Carr suffered a sprained right shoulder. However, when Banks also became injured, Quinn was signed from the practice squad {{to back up the}} now healthy Carr and rookie Dave Ragone.|$|E

50|$|A {{differential}} backup is a cumulative backup of all changes made since <b>the</b> last full <b>backup,</b> i.e., <b>the</b> differences since <b>the</b> last full <b>backup.</b> <b>The</b> advantage {{to this is}} the quicker recovery time, requiring only a full <b>backup</b> and <b>the</b> last differential <b>backup</b> to restore <b>the</b> entire data repository. The disadvantage is that for each day elapsed since <b>the</b> last full <b>backup,</b> more data needs to be backed up, especially if {{a significant proportion of}} the data has changed, thus increasing backup time as compared to <b>the</b> incremental <b>backup</b> method.|$|R

5|$|A {{four-year}} {{starting quarterback}} at Mississippi Valley State University, Dickinson {{was drafted by}} the Buccaneers in the seventh round of the 1976 NFL Draft. He served as <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> quarterback behind Steve Spurrier his rookie season, and saw playing time in eight games, including one start against the Miami Dolphins. His season ended after suffering an injury {{in a game against}} the Cleveland Browns. He recovered from the injury and tried to make the team in 1977, but was cut, ending his career. After retiring, he became a high school offensive coordinator in Tampa.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Vlasic played college {{football}} at the University of Iowa. For four years, {{he served as a}} backup to Chuck Long, now a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. During his junior year, as <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> quarterback, he also served as the holder for field goal kicks. After placekicker Rob Houghtlin won a 12-10 game against the University of Michigan thanks to a last second field goal, a mob tore down the goalpost, which injured four fans including Vlasic, who was {{at the bottom of a}} pile of fans.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Patriots, Zolak was signed to a one-year {{contract}} by the New York Jets. With Vinny Testaverde considered the starter, Zolak was competing against Ray Lucas for a backup job. He was the second-string quarterback as training camp began, but his competition increased when the Jets signed Rick Mirer and left three quarterbacks to battle for two open spots on the team. Two days after acquiring Mirer from the Green Bay Packers, the Jets released Zolak. In October, Zolak was signed to a one-year deal by the Miami Dolphins to serve as <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> quarterback behind Damon Huard and Jim Druckenmiller. He was later made <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> behind Huard, and made his only appearance of the season on November 21, failing to complete a pass in four attempts against the Patriots. As the 1999 season wrapped up, the Dolphins signed Zolak to a contract extension, keeping him on the team for another year. Despite the retirement of Dan Marino, the Dolphins cut Zolak in May 2000. Zolak trained for the Detroit Lions during the summer after they lost Mike Tomczak for the season, but instead he signed on as a host for Patriots Gameday alongside Bob Lobel in August, ending his professional football career.|$|E
5|$|Although Tolliver had the {{confidence}} of Dan Henning, Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard and owner Alex Spanos were unsatisfied with his production during the 1990 season, and they were looking towards Friesz as the future quarterback. Tolliver was the leading man for the starting quarterback position as training camp for the 1991 season began, with Friesz battling Bob Gagliano for <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> spot. However, after training camp ended, Friesz was named the starting quarterback for the 1991 season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not officially}} announced, the {{original}} backup crew consisted of Fred W. Haise (CDR), William R. Pogue (CMP) and Gerald P. Carr (LMP), who were targeted for the prime crew assignment on Apollo 19. However, after the cancellations of Apollos 18 and 19 were finalized in September 1970 this crew would not rotate to a lunar mission as planned. Subsequently, Roosa and Mitchell were recycled {{to serve as}} members of <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> crew after returning from Apollo 14, while Pogue and Carr were reassigned to the Skylab program where they flew on Skylab 4.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Kafka was <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> to C. J. Bachér {{and played}} {{in only two}} games. Despite being <b>the</b> <b>backup</b> quarterback again in 2008, Kafka threw for 330yards and {{finished}} second on the team in rushingyards with 321. Following Bachér's graduation after the 2008 season, Kafka became the starter for 2009. Against Syracuse he set the school record for most consecutive pass completions with 16. In the same game, {{he became the first}} Big Ten Conference player to score a passing, receiving, and rushing touchdown since Zack Mills from Penn State in 2004. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. Kafka received second-team All-Big Ten honors in 2009. In the 2010 Outback Bowl against Auburn, Kafka set the all-time bowl record with 47 completions and 78 passing attempts. He set Northwestern and Outback Bowl records with 532 passing yards and an Outback Bowl record with five interceptions. During his career at Northwestern, Kafka threw for 4,265yards with a completion percentage of 64.1%, 19 touchdowns and 20 interceptions.
