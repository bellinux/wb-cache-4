Three days later, Die Einigkeit criticized the SPD's {{stance on the}} war. It was then suppressed as well. The FVdG promptly responded by founding the weekly Mitteilungsblatt. After it was banned in June 1915, the federation founded the bi-weekly Rundschreiben, which survived until May 1917. Social Democratic publications {{on the other hand}} were allowed by Prussian War Minister Erich von Falkenhayn to be distributed even in <b>the</b> <b>army.</b> <b>In</b> the first days of the war, about 30 FVdG activists in Cologne, Elberfeld, Düsseldorf, Krefeld and other cities were arrested—some remaining under house arrest for two years. The government repression against the FVdG was heavy. While bans were often placed on the union's regular meetings, authorities in Düsseldorf even banned meetings of the syndicalist choir. Another problem for the union was that many of its members were conscripted. Half of the Berlin construction workers, the federation's largest union, were forced to serve in <b>the</b> <b>army.</b> <b>In</b> some places, all FVdG members were called into service.|$|E
