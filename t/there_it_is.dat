5|$|Information {{from the}} sense organs is {{collected}} in the brain. <b>There</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> used to determine what actions the organism is to take. The brain processes the raw data to extract information about {{the structure of the}} environment. Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} results, it generates motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.|$|E

A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter <b>there.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
5|$|Formed by the {{confluence}} of three tiny headstreams on the southwest flank of Two Oceans Plateau in western Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park, the Snake starts out as a small river flowing west and south into Jackson Lake. Its first 50 miles (80 km) run through the valley of Jackson Hole, which cuts between the Teton Range and the Continental Divide. The Snake takes a large bend northwest through Snake River Canyon, cutting through the Snake River Range and into eastern Idaho, receiving first the Hoback and Greys rivers before entering Palisades Reservoir. <b>There</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also met by the Salt River {{at the mouth of}} Star Valley. After passing through Palisades Dam, the Snake River flows through the Snake River Plain, a vast physiographic province extending through southern Idaho across the massif of the Rocky Mountains and underlain by the Snake River Aquifer, one of the most productive aquifers in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Found across Tasmania and Bass Strait islands, {{the green}} rosella {{is one of}} the commonest birds encountered. It also occurs on {{offshore}} islands such as Maria, Bruny, De Witt and Maatsuyker Islands. Its movements have not been much studied. Although possibly locally nomadic in places, the green rosella is sedentary; even birds at higher altitudes do not migrate. It has become rare on King Island, due to land clearing and possibly competition with the introduced common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) for nesting sites. During breeding season <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> restricted to the Pegarah forest, though may venture elsewhere at other times.|$|E
5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions {{of the inner}} and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids, In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: <b>There,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that St. Rynagh (also Reynagh, Rinagh), who founded Banagher and after whom the parish is named, was a sister of St. Finnian of Clonard.

It is known that contact was {{maintained}} between Rynagh's Wexford home and her foundation at Banagher; and her mother came to live <b>there.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> recorded that Reynagh's mother, Talech, or Talacia, became Abbess of the Banagher convent. The death of St. Finnian is assigned to 563, but there {{does not seem to}} be any authoritative statement as to the date of St. Rynagh's death, although according to St. Rynagh's Parish Church in Banagher, St. Rynagh died about 610. The place of her burial is uncertain but it is likely to have been in either Banagher or Kilmacduagh near Gort, the monastery founded by her son, St. Colman.|$|E

5|$|M-5 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-5 were the 68,793vehicles daily between 12 and 13Mile roads; the lowest counts were the 17,176vehicles per day southeast of Schoolcraft Road to I-96. All of M-5 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The trunkline is six- or eight-lanes wide along the freeway section {{to the north and}} west of the Grand River Avenue interchange; south and east of <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a four-lane freeway or six-lane highway all the way to I-96.|$|E
5|$|Pleistocene fossils {{have been}} found {{throughout}} its current range and beyond it. In Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul, the Lujanian (Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene) Sopas Formation has yielded remains of L. molitor, in addition to such other mammals as the extinct saber-toothed cat Smilodon populator and species of Glyptodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon. The type locality, Lagoa Santa, lies far northeast of the nearest record of live L. molitor; <b>there,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> known only from three skull fragments from a cave known as Laga da Escrivania Nr.5.

5|$|Red maple's rapid growth, ease of transplanting, {{attractive}} form, {{and value}} for wildlife (in the eastern US) {{has made it}} one of the most extensively planted trees. In parts of the Pacific Northwest, it is one of the most common introduced trees. Its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit, its attractive and early red flowers, and most importantly, its flaming red fall foliage. The tree was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation. <b>There</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> frequently found in many parks and gardens, as well as occasionally in churchyards.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the {{tawny nurse shark}} as Vulnerable worldwide, as it faces heavy fishing pressure and its low reproductive and dispersal rates limit the ability of over-exploited populations to recover. Furthermore, this shark's inshore habitat renders it susceptible to habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices (e.g. poisons and explosives, especially prevalent off Indonesia and the Philippines), and human harassment. Localized declines or extirpations of the tawny nurse shark have been documented off India and Thailand. Off Australia, this species has been assessed as of Least Concern, as <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not targeted by fisheries.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} {{reticulate}} whipray as Vulnerable. Its large size, inshore habitat preferences, and slow reproductive rate render it susceptible to overfishing. Although specific data is lacking, significant declines in overall ray catches {{have been documented}} within its range, including in the Gulf of Thailand, the Arafura Sea, and off Pakistan. Habitat degradation also threatens this species: over 30% of the mangroves in Indonesia and Malaysia have been cleared since 1980, while pollution and destructive fishing practices may have also taken their toll. Australian waters offer the reticulate whipray a refuge from fishing pressure, as <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not targeted commercially and the installation of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) have reduced bycatch mortality. However, there are indications of increasing illegal fishing in Australian territory by Indonesian vessels.|$|E

5|$|Use of this {{mushroom}} as a {{food source}} also seems to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of A.muscaria by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak. It is also consumed {{as a food}} in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. <b>There,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> primarily salted and pickled.|$|E
5|$|Highly abundant, {{the brown}} roll-rim is found across the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia, with records from India, China, Japan, Iran, and Turkey's eastern Anatolia. It is equally widely {{distributed}} across northern North America, extending north to Alaska, {{where it has}} been collected from tundra near Coldfoot in the interior of the state. In southwestern Greenland, P. involutus has been recorded under the birch species Betula nana, B. pubescens and B. glandulosa. The mushroom is more common in coniferous woods in Europe, but is also closely associated with birch (Betula pendula). Within woodland, it prefers wet places or boggy ground, and avoids calcareous (chalky) soils. It has been noted to grow alongside Boletus badius in Europe, and Leccinum scabrum and Lactarius plumbeus in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. <b>There</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> found in both deciduous and coniferous woodland, commonly under plantings of white birch (Betula papyrifera) in urban areas. It is one of a small number of fungal species which thrive in Pinus radiata plantations planted outside their natural range. A study of polluted Scots pine forest around Oulu in northern Finland found that P.involutus became more abundant in more polluted areas while other species declined. Emissions from pulp mills, fertiliser, heating and traffic were responsible for the pollution, which was measured by sulfur levels in the pine needles.|$|E
