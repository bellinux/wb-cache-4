5|$|On August 30, 1987, Parsons was hitchhiking along Interstate 15 near Barstow, California. He {{was picked}} up by 30-year-old Richard Lynn Ernest, a {{concrete}} laborer from Loma Linda, California {{on his way to a}} construction job in Denver, Colorado. Ernest did not know that Parsons was a fugitive. At about 3 a.m. on August 31, Ernest was too tired to drive and stopped at the Lunt Park rest area near Cedar City, Utah <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep.</b> Parsons stabbed Ernest to death and drove off in his blue Dodge Omni.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 2016, Pascu's wife called the {{emergency}} number (112) twice. The first time the artist complained about a panic attack and a 3 days lasting insomnia. The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed {{a couple of hours}} later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Chris pays a visit {{during his}} nightly jog, and Ann leaves with him {{so they can}} clear the air. Over dinner, Chris once again acts so optimistic while {{discussing}} the break-up that Ann thinks their relationship is back on and tries to kiss him, severely embarrassing her. Meanwhile, the camping trip proves unsuccessful and everybody decides to go home that night, but they are left without transportation because Tom and Ben have hooked all of their electronics to the van's battery, draining it. Everybody hikes to a strange bed and breakfast filled with cats and dolls called The Quiet Corn, run by a strict old lady named Elsa Clack (Annie O'Donnell). Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic tent in the yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival. Ron, recognizing how burnt out she is, solves Leslie's problem by locking her in a bedroom and ordering her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep.</b> With a rare full night's sleep energizing her, Leslie wakes up with numerous big ideas that are well received by Chris.|$|E
60|$|He laughed aloud at {{the absurdity}} of the idea, {{and then with a}} gesture of impatience threw his {{cigarette}} into the fire and went to his room <b>to</b> try and <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> for he was thoroughly wearied.|$|R
5000|$|This, {{along with}} SCTVs cult status, {{led to the}} shows celebrity fans clamouring to appear. Later on, Tony Bennett {{credited}} his appearance on Bob and Doug McKenzies variety-show debacle [...] "The Great White North Palace" [...] as triggering a significant career comeback. Sketch comedy giant Carol Burnett did an ad for the show in which an alarm clock goes off next to her bed, she rises up suddenly and advises those who couldnt stay up late enough (the NBC version aired from 12:30 to 2 a.m.) to go <b>to</b> bed, <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> then wake up to watch the show. Burnett later briefly appeared in a climactic courtroom episode of [...] "The Days of the Week".|$|R
60|$|The slumber of the Duchess was {{the signal}} {{for a general}} move. Her {{somnolence}} was catching. The restorative effects of the meal were beginning to wear off. There was a call for a chorus rehearsal at four o'clock, and it seemed the wise move to go <b>to</b> bed and <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep</b> while there was time. The Duchess was roused from her dreams {{by means of a}} piece of ice from one of the tumblers; bills were paid; and the company poured out, yawning and chattering, into the sunlight of the empty boardwalk.|$|R
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep.</b> Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E

Silvio is hit multiple times while Patsy abandons the car and flees while returning fire. Silvio is left in a medically-induced coma, from which doctors do not think he will awaken. Tony arrives back home and, hearing about the hits, orders his family to go into hiding. Carmela and Meadow visit the Baccalieris, who are all in shock over Bobby's death. At nightfall, Tony, Paulie, Carlo, and Dante Greco drive to an old suburban safe house. Tony goes upstairs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> clutching the AR-10 assault rifle that Bobby gave him for his birthday.|$|E
25|$|Ingle was a well-liked captain, {{according}} to David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, and unlike some Somerset amateurs got on {{well with the}} limited numbers of professionals the county employed. The life of a Somerset captain in the inter-war years was rarely easy, because the county rarely had {{more than half a}} dozen professionals, and the team was perennially made up of an itinerant band of amateurs of variable talent. In one of Ingle's more successful seasons, 1936, Somerset played 34 different cricketers in the County Championship matches. Ingle himself missed some games most seasons because of chronic hay fever which, {{according to}} Foot, he maintained was made worse by long train journeys: he told Foot that he would travel in the luggage rack <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep</b> and some respite from the dust.|$|E
50|$|The events {{following}} the party are depicted in flashback. All the guests {{leave for the}} night, except for Fitzerald who is drunk and sleeping. She spends {{the night at the}} couch of Gresham's apartment. The following morning, Gresham has yet to decide on an ending for his novel. He discusses the matter with Fletcher, his valet, and asks Fletcher to think of an ending. Fitzgerald wakes with a hangover and Gresham instructs her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> proper <b>sleep</b> in his apartment. He soon discovers that there is a handgun hidden in her purse. Meanwhile, the morning newspaper reports the death of actress Peggy Fanning. Fanning was Gresham's latest lover and the inspiration for Frailty. She had divorced her husband, a fellow actor, in hopes of marrying Gresham. However, Gresham rejected her and had no interest in marrying her. The newspaper reports that Fanning committed suicide in Paris.|$|R
5000|$|In Angel's dream, he relives {{the moment}} in which Spike drinks from the cup that signifies he is the {{champion}} referred to by the Shanshu Prophecy. In his dream, the cup isn't a fake, and radiance shines down on Spike, then incinerates Angel {{in the same way}} the amulet incinerated Spike when he sacrificed himself in Sunnydale. Meanwhile, Lindsey approaches Spike at a strip club, implying he was responsible for Spike's return from the dead and his subsequent return to corporeality. Introducing himself as Doyle, Lindsey claims he has visions of people in trouble and that he had a vision of a girl who's about <b>to</b> <b>get</b> attacked in an alley. Spike tells him to go to Angel instead, but “Doyle” says that Angel is [...] "working {{the other side of the}} tracks" [...] now. Spike saves the girl, after which Lindsey suggests that Spike may be the new champion of The Powers That Be. The next night, Spike saves a couple from vampires, telling them, “I’m the hero.” Meanwhile, at Wolfram & Hart, Wesley and Gunn present Angel with possible solutions to deal with an evil warlock, but Angel - weary of the [...] "gray area" [...] of morality in which he constantly finds himself - announces, “Let’s kill them all.” He then says that he’s just tired and the others tell him <b>to</b> go <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} {{the shade of the}} blanket overhead, Edgar found it tremendously hot {{in the middle of the}} day, but as soon as the sun had passed west, he was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> hours' {{comfortable}} <b>sleep.</b> A short time before sunset they started again and carried the sheik to the cave. The two Arabs did this while Edgar and Sidi loitered behind pulling up the parched-up bushes that grew here and there among the rocks, and making them into faggots. As soon, therefore, as the sheik was laid down the fire was lighted, giving a cheerful air to the dark chamber. Ali and Hassan went down again and brought up the provisions, water, and bundles. The air was cool and pleasant in the tomb, and a hearty meal was made by all but the sheik, who, however, not only drank a cup of broth, but ate some dates with something like an appetite.|$|R
500|$|The {{children}} {{then set}} up a radio show called [...] "We Know All Your Secrets", in which they expose {{the secrets of the}} adults of Springfield like the kids in the movie. The children are tracked down at the billboard by Professor Frink's machine, and an argument between the children and the adults ensues. Unfortunately, the argument rouses the ire of Grampa and the other senior citizens trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> and they vow to teach both groups a lesson. Their revenge turns out to be enforcing a curfew banning everyone under the age of seventy from the streets after dark, which is a measure that passed by a single vote, due to Homer refusing to cast a ballot.|$|E
500|$|At about dawn on October 26, {{the card}} game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp {{went home to}} bed. Ike Clanton testified later he saw Virgil take his six-shooter out of his lap and stick it in his pants when the game ended. Not having rented a room, Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton {{had no place to}} go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Ike Clanton in front of the {{telegraph}} office. Clanton had been drinking all night and Boyle encouraged him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> but Ike insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Ike was armed and covered his gun for him. Boyle later said that Ike told him, [...] "'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open—that they would have to fight'...I went down to Wyatt Earp's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when him and his brothers and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open." [...] Ike said in his testimony afterward that he remembered neither meeting Boyle nor making any such statements that day.|$|E
500|$|Command posts were dug in {{and weapons}} pits and shell scrapes were commenced, yet many were not {{completed}} to any depth {{due to a}} lack of time, while a heavy rainfall started at 18:00 and soon filled the pits with water anyway. No claymore mines or barbed wire were laid out either, as the wire had not yet arrived, while lack of materials also prevented the construction of overhead protection. 7.62mm M60 machine-guns were placed out around the perimeter, but there was no time to test fire them or to properly tie in their arcs of fire. Meanwhile, 90mm M67 recoilless rifles (RCLs) from the 1 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon armed with High Explosive Anti-tank (HEAT) and anti-personnel flechette ammunition were sited to support the forward machine-guns. Due to their previous experiences fighting the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province, the Australians were not overly alarmed despite the defences at FSB Coral suffering due to the hasty deployment and, although the recent fighting involving the US 1st Division only [...] to the west may have been additional cause for concern, its extent was unknown to the Australians at the time. Expecting the North Vietnamese to be operating in small groups while trying to avoid battle as they had done during the last three weeks, there was little thought of a major threat to the FSB. Commencing night routine, sentries were posted while the rest of the Australians stood down <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
40|$|Women face {{a myriad}} of ongoing and complex ethical {{dilemmas}} in caring for a frail elder (Bopp & Coleson, 1996). An ethical dilemma {{can be defined as}} a conflict in which the caregiver must make a choice “between two or more relevant, but contradictory ethical directives, or when every alternative results in an undesirable outcome for one or more persons ” (Loewenberg, Dolgoff & Harrington, 2000, p. 9). An example of an ethical dilemma highlights the complexity of decision making for caregivers. A spousal caregiver struggled to care for herself and also provide care for the frail elder. The frail elder was at risk for falling, had cognitive deficits and was getting out of bed at night to climb downstairs to a basement shop. The caregiver did not want to restrict the frail elder’s freedom, but after conversations with family, she decided to put a lock on their bedroom door to keep the frail elder from harming himself. The caregiver acted out of values of self-care and the care and safety of the frail elder. By putting the lock on the bedroom door, she was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> needed <b>sleep,</b> thereby taking care of herself {{and at the same time}} providing for the safety of the frail elder. Gerontological writers have described the importance of moral dialogue involving elders, caregivers and others for the purpose of addressing caregiving ethical dilemmas on such topics as health care treatment and home care options (Bopp & Coleson, 1996; Spano & Koenig, 2003). However, rarely have research efforts examined the way caregivers personally define and make decisions about ethical dilemmas. Hence, this dissertation focused on obtaining women’s perspectives about these ethical dilemmas...|$|R
5000|$|Later that evening, word {{comes to}} the Johnson house that Illinois has been found murdered. Johnson and his gang go to the {{warehouse}} where Illinois was killed and find him hanging by a chain on the outside wall, one of the 'numbers' tickets {{in his mouth and}} a suitcase with [...] "No More Secrets" [...] written across it attached to him. A local witness tells them that he saw a man with Captain's bars with Illinois shortly before his murder. Bumpy immediately knows who it is and gets his revenge on Foley by cutting his throat after finding him in a room with a prostitute. As Bumpy is leaving, he sees Bub Hewlett and asks if he had a hand in Illinois's murder. He denies any involvement so Bumpy spares him and tells him that he now owes him. Bumpy has a meeting with Bub and tells him that it's not in his best interest to continue working for Dutch. Bumpy later contacts Luciano and tells him that he wants to compromise. Luciano agrees to the terms and they devise a plan to kill Dutch. Cecil, Luciano's driver, appears to betray Luciano and Bumpy by telling Dutch what they are planning. Cecil, however, is being paid by Bumpy to do so. Believing he now has the upper hand, Dutch plans the murder of Luciano and Bumpy but fails to do so. Luciano and Bumpy's plan is revealed when Lulu (Ed O'Ross) (Dutch's right-hand man) follows Dutch into the restroom and shoots him three times. Dutch walks out of the restroom and down the stairs, sits down at a table and drops dead. Lulu walks outside, gets in Luciano's car and asks to be paid but instead, an associate of Luciano's shoots him dead and dumps his body on the sidewalk. The last scene shows Bumpy asking Bub if those involved have been paid, with Bub saying yes. With the Queen back in business, Johnson tells Bub that he has some unfinished business and Bub says he's going <b>to</b> go <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep.</b> The two shake hands and part company. Bumpy then walks across the street and enters the church to briefly pay his final respects to Illinois. The gospel choir sings [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] while he walks down the aisle, exchanging looks with Francine and Madame Queen. When he arrives at the coffin, he goes down on his knees with tears in his eyes, then turns and walks out. He takes off his hat and turns his face up to the pouring rain, letting it run down his face.|$|R
60|$|I {{advised her}} to go <b>to</b> bed and <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> which she did, and awoke in the evening quite recovered, so far as her {{strength}} was concerned. It struck me as an odd thing that a girl who could find the nerve to shoot a huge black ruffian rushing to kill her with a spear should have been so affected {{at the thought of}} it afterwards; but it is, after all, characteristic of the sex. Poor Flossie! I fear that her nerves will not get over that night in the Masai camp for many a long year. She told me afterwards that it was the suspense that was so awful, having to sit there hour after hour through the livelong night utterly ignorant {{as to whether or not}} any attempt was to be made to rescue her. She said that on the whole she did not expect it, knowing how few of us, and how many of the Masai -- who, by the way, came continually to stare at her, most of them never having seen a white person before, and handled her arms and hair with their filthy paws. She said also that she had made up her mind that if she saw no signs of succour by the time the first rays of the rising sun reached the kraal she would kill herself with the pistol, for the nurse had heard the Lygonani say that they were to be tortured to death as soon as the sun was up if one of the white men did not come in their place. It was an awful resolution to have to take, but she meant to act on it, and I have little doubt but what she would have done so. Although she was at an age when in England girls are in the schoolroom and come down to dessert, this 'child of the wilderness' had more courage, discretion, and power of mind than many a woman of mature age nurtured in idleness and luxury, with minds carefully drilled and educated out of any originality or self-resource that nature may have endowed them with.|$|R

2500|$|The {{students}} {{settle down}} for the night and reminisce about the past while also expressing anxiety about the battle to come. Enjolras tells the other students to stay awake in case the enemy strikes unexpectedly in the night, but he tells Marius <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> knowing Marius is still much too devastated over losing Éponine to stay awake. Grantaire gets angry and asks the students if they fear to die as Marius wonders if Cosette will remember him if he dies. ("Drink with Me"). As Marius sleeps, Valjean prays to God to protect Marius, even if the cost for Marius' safety is his own life ("Bring Him Home"). As dawn approaches, Enjolras realizes {{that the people of}} Paris have not risen up with them, but resolves to fight on in spite of the impossible odds ("Dawn of Anguish"). Their resolve is fired even further when the army kill Gavroche, who snuck out to collect ammunition from bodies {{on the other side of}} the barricade ("The Second Attack / Death of Gavroche"). The army gives a final warning, but the rebels fight to the last man with Enjolras exhorting [...] "Let others rise to take our place, until the Earth is free!". Everyone at the barricade is killed except Valjean and a gravely wounded Marius, who escape into the sewers ("The Final Battle"). Javert returns to the barricade, searching for Valjean amongst the bodies, and finds the open sewer grating.|$|E

50|$|The video {{opens up}} to several girls waiting for Cosgrove outside of her house. It is 11:00 pm, and Cosgrove is seen getting out of bed, {{grabbing}} her coat, and sneaking outside to the girls, as they {{pull out of the}} house, she sees her teenage neighbor walking the dog. It is unknown as to why he is walking his dog at 11pm, but nonetheless there is romantic chemistry between them. The two have eye contact momentarily, and smile at one another. As the first verse begins, Cosgrove and her friends are seen in the car, dancing to a song on the radio, while driving down the road. As the bridge begins, several other cars filled with teenagers are seen following them, and they all pull over and get out at a local high school. As the chorus begins, they are seen jumping over a fence onto a football field, where a car and large speakers have already been set up. As they turn on the music in the football field, the teens all begin to dance with one another. Shots of Cosgrove still sitting in the car with her friends dancing are shown at random moments, switching {{back and forth between the}} football field and the car. As the second verse begins, Cosgrove is seen sitting on the car at the football field. The cars should not technically be on the field, since Cosgrove and her companions were forced to jump a fence to gain entrance to the school and cars can obviously not jump fences, but this is ignored. More kids begin to arrive, including the neighbors that Cosgrove seen when she was leaving the house. As the bridge begins, he is seen greeting random kids, however, he does not appear to have noticed Cosgrove yet. As the chorus plays, the teens all form a circle, and one at a time several kids take turn break dancing in the center of the circle. As the second chorus closes, Cosgrove and her neighbors notice each other at the same time, and she walks over to him. After talking for a moment, they walk over to the bleachers as the third verse begins. They are seen talking and laughing for a while. He then puts his arm around her. A few moments later, they are shown holding hands on the bleachers, and as the third verse ends, they are seen kissing one another. As the final chorus plays, the two are seen together, dancing by the car on the football field. Clips of several teens break-dancing continue to switch back and forth. The sprinklers come on, however, and all of the teens run back home. Cosgrove is then shown back in the car with her girlfriends, presumably driving back home. As the sun begins to rise, Cosgrove arrives home and waves goodbye to her friends. As she sneaks up to her room and lays down, intending <b>to</b> finally <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sleep,</b> her alarm clock goes off, and it's time for her to wake up for school. This irritates her.
