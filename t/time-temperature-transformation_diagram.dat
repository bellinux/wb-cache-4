40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations with an embedded-atom method potential {{are used}} {{for the first time}} to determine the <b>time–temperature–transformation</b> <b>diagram</b> for crystallization of stoichiometric intermetallic NiAl. This diagram shows a typical nose-like shape. It is found that the shortest time, about 1 ns, needed for the beginning of the crystallization process of the undercooled liquid Ni₅₀Al₅₀ alloy is at a temperature about 41 % below the melting temperature and becomes longer as the temperature either increases or decreases. Analysis of the diagram demonstrates that the critical cooling rate of liquid Ni₅₀Al₅₀ alloy to produce an amorphous state is very high, about 10 ¹¹– 10 ¹² K s⁻¹, and is comparable with similar estimations for pure metals. These findings reveal a low glass-forming ability of the undercooled liquid Ni₅₀Al₅₀ alloy and suggest why there is a lack of experimental data on synthesizing of amorphous and nanocrystalline structures of this intermetallic by rapid solidification. At the same time, these findings support the possibility of the reaction synthesis of nanostructured intermetallic NiAl starting from elemental Ni and Al nanopowders which is in good agreement with recent experimental results (Moussa SO, El-Shall MS.

The thin-foil alloys were prepared by splat-quenching onto room temperature and warm substrates and the microstructures of electron-transparent areas were examined by transmission electron microscopy. It is found that lamellar structures formed in the thin-foils at significantly lower temperatures and with considerably smaller interlamellar spacings than in the bulk specimens investigated hitherto.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the results of an {{investigation}} of low-temperature martensitic transformation in a metastable PuGa 1 at. % alloy. The kinetics of this process were studied experimentally via in situ XRD characterizations performed during isothermal holds. This revealed a double-C <b>Time–Temperature–Transformation</b> <b>diagram</b> similar to that reported in the literature for enriched alloys. The originality of our results lies in the demonstration of the existence of different martensite morphologies corresponding to the upper and lower parts of the TTT diagram. These microstructural variations seem {{to be the result of}} different accommodation mechanisms. The experimental nucleation rate study has suggested an autocatalytic character of the isothermal martensitic nucleation process as well as a large sensitivity to elastic and plastic strain. Indeed, the incubation period and subsequent increase in nucleation rate could be related to the appearance of new embryos rather than the growth of existing plates, while the partial character of the transformation may be attributed to interactions between plates that are being formed in the two-phase delta + alpha′ alloy. These hypotheses have been confirmed by the classical heterogeneous nucleation approach by Pati and Cohen, which takes into account the autocatalytic character of the transformation. This approach has also indirectly revealed the existence of restraining forces that reflect a high sensitivity of the energy barrier for nucleation to the alpha′ phase amount...|$|E

Low-temperature <b>time-temperature-transformation</b> <b>diagrams</b> of alloys whose compositions lie at equally spaced points along the tie line from Zr 38. 5 Ti 16. 5 Cu 15. 25 Ni 9. 75 Be 20 to Zr 46. 25 Ti 8. 25 Cu 7. 5 Ni 10 Be 27. 5 are measured during isothermal annealing of initially amorphous specimens. Surprisingly, for all investigated alloys, a primary quasicrystalline phase forms at a rate which varies substantially with alloy composition. Subsequent constant heating measurements, x-ray-diffraction patterns obtained after various states of annealing, beam bending viscosity results, and previous thermal analysis are all used to describe the influences on crystallization in this series. The description of both the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of crystallization allows for an explanation of the crystallization mechanism. In addition, it explains why, in this series, thermal stability is greatest in those alloys with the poorest glass-forming ability. Overall, the investigations reveal that simple criteria like thermal stability or high viscosity fail to predict the glass-forming ability in complex bulk glass-forming systems...|$|R
40|$|Using {{different}} homogenization treatments, different initial microchemistry {{conditions in}} terms of solid solution levels of Mn, and number densities and sizes of constituents and dispersoids were achieved in an Al-Mn-Fe-Si model alloy. For each homogenized condition, the microchemistry and microstructure, which further change both during deformation and subsequent annealing, were quantitatively characterized. The influence of the different microchemistries, with special focus on different particle structures (constituents and dispersoids), on the softening behavior during annealing after cold rolling and the final grain structure has been systematically studied. <b>Time-Temperature-Transformation</b> <b>diagrams</b> with respect to precipitation and recrystallization {{as a basis for}} analysis of the degree of concurrent precipitation during back-annealing have been established. Densely distributed fine pre-existing dispersoids and/or conditions of significant concurrent precipitation strongly slows down recrystallization kinetics and lead to a grain structure of coarse and strongly elongated grains. At the lowest annealing temperatures, recrystallization may even be completely suppressed. In conditions of low number density and coarse pre-existing dispersoids, and limited additional concurrent precipitation, recrystallization generally results in an even, fine and equi-axed grain structure.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 By the {{investigation}} of the bulk metallic glass-forming liquids that have very low critical cooling rates, the thermodynamics of metallic glasses can be clarified. For studying thermodynamic properties, such as the specific heat capacity, calorimetry (DSC) is utilized {{and one of the most}} used instruments is the differential scanning calorimeter. In this study calorimetry was used to investigate the thermodynamics of the Pd₄₃Ni₁₀Cu₂₇P₂₀ alloy. The specific heat capacity of the liquid and crystalline state, enthalpy, entropy, as well as Gibbs free energy difference between the liquid and crystalline state were measured and evaluated in comparison with previous studies of the alloy. The Pd₄₃Ni₁₀Cu₂₇P₂₀ alloy is known as a metallic glass-forming alloy that has high ability for vitrification without crystallization. By observing the onset of heat flux of the exothermic reactions in the DSC, the <b>time-temperature-transformation</b> <b>diagram</b> can be constructed, and the diagram confirms the high ability for the vitrification for the sample. In addition, the effect of fluxing by B₂O₃ to reduce heterogeneous nucleation is determined by the TTT-diagram. The enthalpy change during the crystallization was directly measured in experiments in which the sample was held isothermally in the DSC. Both enthalpies, calculated from the specific heat capacity measurements and direct measured enthalpy exactly match each other. The very interesting effect in these experiments is an effect of heat treatment in the samples. Two glass transition temperatures can be noticeably recognized by scanning the exothermic event of the sample with the DSC. The material separates into two undercooled liquids.
