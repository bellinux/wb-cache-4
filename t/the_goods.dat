5|$|Coffin {{moved to}} the Cincinnati area in 1847, where {{he took over the}} {{management}} of a wholesale warehouse of free-labor goods. With the intention of returning to Newport, Indiana, after fulfilling his obligation in Cincinnati, Coffin rented out his Newport business and made arrangements for his Indiana home to continue serving as an Underground Railroad stop. At Cincinnati his first task was working with the eastern organizations to set up a steady supply of free-labor goods for the business. The enterprise's ongoing problem was the poor quality of its goods. Coffin had difficulty procuring free goods, such as cotton, sugar, and spices, whose quality was competitive with <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> produced by slave labor. With inferior quality goods to sell, he had a difficult time finding purchasers for <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> The problem plagued the business for years, causing the enterprise constant financial struggles.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Han–Xiongnu War on the north, {{the rising}} cost of {{administration}} in the distant state led to the Han abandoning the commandery.

5|$|During the First World War, an Army Remount Service depot {{was located}} nearby, with Shirehampton station {{handling}} <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> traffic, {{with up to}} 60 wagons per day inbound, mostly containing hay and sawdust for the horses.

5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions {{are very similar}} to those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of <b>the</b> <b>goods,</b> but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E
5|$|However, by {{this point}} the Palace Gates Line was in severe decline. Passenger numbers had fallen greatly since {{the opening of the}} Piccadilly line, while freight usage dropped {{throughout}} the 1950s as a result of improved road haulage and declining demand for coal. The line was closed to passengers on 7 January 1963. With freight usage dwindling to a trickle following the ending of passenger services, <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> yard was closed on 7 December 1964. The site of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> yard was used {{for the construction of a}} large apartment block known as The Sandlings, and Noel Park & Wood Green railway station was converted into commercial premises, before being demolished in the early 1970s to become the site of the eastern section of Wood Green Shopping City.|$|E

5|$|Quainton Road {{closed to}} {{passengers}} on 4 March 1963 and to goods on 4 July 1966. On 3 September 1966 the GCR line from Aylesbury to Rugby was abandoned, {{leaving only the}} stretch from Aylesbury to Calvert, running through the now-closed Quainton Road, open for freight trains. This {{was reduced to a}} single track shortly afterwards. The signal box at Quainton Road was abandoned on 13 August 1967, and the points connecting to <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> yard were disconnected.|$|E
5|$|The first {{station was}} a {{temporary}} terminus for the GWR {{on the west}} side of Bishop's Bridge Road, opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened, this became the site of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> depot. Brunel did not consider that anything less than a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR would be acceptable, and consequently this was approved in February 1853.|$|E
5|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{were growing}} desperate {{to remove their}} belongings from the City, especially the upper class.

Hiring a cart had cost a couple of shillings on the Saturday before the fire; on Monday, it rose to as much as £40, a fortune equivalent to more than £4,000 in 2005.|$|E

A {{temporary}} station was opened at Tunbridge Wells on 19September 1845 while Wells Tunnel was completed. The temporary station later became <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> depot. Tunbridge Wells (later Tunbridge Wells Central) station opened on 25November 1846. The Tunbridge Wells–Robertsbridge section opened on 1September 1851, with the Robertsbridge–Battle section opening on 1January 1852. The Battle–Bopeep Junction section opened on 1February 1852.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{humanitarian response}} was immediate, {{and in some}} cases even overwhelming. Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, helmet lights, knee pads, rain gear, and even football helmets were donated. The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop-off centers were set up to accept and sort <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the city, assisted rescue workers by providing 15,000 to 20,000meals over a ten-day period.|$|E
5|$|The open {{goods wagons}} were {{originally}} delivered {{with a single}} top-hung side door on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted to side hung double doors. By 1907, most had been fitted with tarpaulin rails. <b>The</b> <b>goods</b> vans used the same underframe, and were fitted with double sliding doors on each side.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to offer a theory of the {{constitutive}} value of intellectual character due to its transformative influence. The specific transformative influence ascribed to intellectual character is that it counteracts self-deceptive mechanisms and disposes agents to obtain true beliefs and to avoid false beliefs. The true beliefs such character reliably produces are accurate representations, and not merely of empirical inputs but also conceptual schemes. Agents {{do not appear to}} require such accurate representations to fulfill various desires, or to achieve certain aspects of mental, social and physical well-being as identified by some psychologists. Consequently, agents do not require intellectual character to achieve a variety of things some have identified as good. Nonetheless, a distinction can be made between achieving <b>the</b> <b>good</b> and identifying <b>the</b> <b>good,</b> and it can also be acknowledged that <b>the</b> <b>good</b> is itself a matter of dispute. That is, {{there are a number of}} competing notions of <b>the</b> <b>good,</b> which appear to be influenced by various conceptual schemes, and this makes the identification of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> difficult. Intellectual character can fulfill a valuable role in the attempt to settle such disputes through its ability to facilitate true beliefs concerning <b>the</b> <b>good.</b> In fact, intellectual character is necessary to assure agents that their beliefs concerning <b>the</b> <b>good</b> are true due to the imperceptible mechanisms of self-deception. This assurance is itself valuable for any agent who wants to identify <b>the</b> <b>good</b> due to <b>the</b> indispensable role of true belief in attempts to identify <b>the</b> <b>good.</b> Even further, identification of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> is valuable for any agent who wants to achieve <b>the</b> <b>good,</b> since <b>the</b> attempt to identify <b>the</b> <b>good</b> better facilitates achievement of <b>the</b> <b>good.</b> Consequently, <b>the</b> assurance that intellectual character is necessary for is valuable for agents who both want to identify and achieve <b>the</b> <b>good,</b> and for this reason such character is constitutively valuable...|$|R

5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Patchway {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. In 1949, there were 11 trains towards South Wales and 13 towards Bristol each weekday, with three trains per day in each direction on Sundays. However, by 1965 this had reduced to eight trains on weekdays towards South Wales and six towards Bristol, with no Sunday service. Traffic levels fell - the station was closed to goods traffic on 5 July 1965, and subsequently had all staff withdrawn on 14 October 1968. <b>The</b> <b>goods</b> loop was taken up and the station buildings demolished, replaced by small brick shelters. The structure of the footbridge remained, but the roof was removed. <b>The</b> <b>goods</b> yard was repurposed as vehicle storage.|$|E
5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E
