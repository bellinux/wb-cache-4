5|$|The SS {{transfer}} the Jews {{to one of}} two ghettos, each with its own council or Judenrat. Eliezer's house on a corner of Serpent Street was in the larger ghetto in the town centre, so his family was able <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> though the windows on the non-ghetto side had to be boarded up.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{wanted to}} join the war effort in August 1914 as a {{despatch}} rider, but his critically ill mother managed to persuade him <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and look after her. However, after his mother died in 1915, aged 42, Allingham enlisted with the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). He became formally rated as an Air Mechanic Second Class on 21 September 1915, and was posted to Chingford before completing his training at Sheerness, Kent. His RNAS serial number was RNAS F8317.|$|E
5|$|Barbera and {{his wife}} briefly {{separated}} {{when he went to}} California. They reunited but {{were on the verge of}} another separation when they discovered that Dorothy was pregnant with their first child. They had 4 children: two sons (Neal and an infant boy who died two days after his birth) and two daughters (Lynn and Jayne). The marriage officially ended in 1963. Shortly after his divorce, Barbera met his second wife, Sheila Holden, at Musso & Frank's restaurant, where she worked as bookkeeper and cashier. Unlike Dorothy, who had preferred <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> with the children, Sheila enjoyed the Hollywood social scene that Barbera often frequented.|$|E

5|$|In {{retirement}} Denning {{moved to}} Whitchurch and continued {{the work he}} had done outside court hours, lecturing and presenting awards. He also on occasion dispensed legal advice; in February 1983 he advised Patrick Evershed on the statutory duties of water suppliers. Further hip troubles were resolved with a full replacement in March 1983, although a fall later that year forced him <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> for six weeks. With free time on his hands Denning spoke in the House of Lords on matters that interested him, supporting {{an amendment to the}} Abortion Act 1967 and bills designed to allow the administration of companies in financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|On November8, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana president, Charlotte Randolph, {{declared}} a state of emergency for the parish as the storm approached the United States Gulf Coast. Although no evacuations were issued, all schools and government offices were closed through November10. Voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in Plaquemines Parish along coastal areas. The Belle Chasse Auditorium was converted into a shelter to house evacuees for the duration of the storm. Grand Isle mayor David Carmadelle issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents in recreational vehicles and trailers on the island. Nearly 1,400 families still living in temporary FEMA homes in Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, were urged <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{moved to}} Mysore {{to live with}} his family when his father was {{transferred}} to the Maharajah's College High School. The well-stocked library at the school, as well as his father's own, fed his reading habit, and he started writing as well. After completing high school, Narayan failed the university entrance examination and spent a year at home reading and writing; he subsequently passed the examination in 1926 and joined Maharaja College of Mysore. It took Narayan four years to obtain his bachelor's degree, a year longer than usual. After being persuaded by a friend that taking a master's degree (M.A.) would kill his interest in literature, he briefly held a job as a school teacher; however, he quit in protest when the headmaster of the school asked him to substitute for the physical training master. The experience made Narayan realise that the only career for him was in writing, and he decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and write novels. His first published work was a book review of Development of Maritime Laws of 17th-Century England. Subsequently, he started writing the occasional local interest story for English newspapers and magazines. Although the writing did not pay much (his income for the first year was nine rupees and twelve annas), he had a regular life and few needs, and his family and friends respected and supported his unorthodox choice of career. In 1930, Narayan wrote his first novel, Swami and Friends, an effort ridiculed by his uncle and rejected by a string of publishers. With this book, Narayan created Malgudi, a town that creatively reproduced the social sphere of the country; while it ignored the limits imposed by colonial rule, it also grew with the various socio-political changes of British and post-independence India.|$|E

25|$|With {{the demands}} of a large home and four young boys to raise, Mulligan's mother hired an African-American nanny named Lily Rose, who became {{especially}} fond of the youngest Mulligan. As he became older, Mulligan began spending time at Rose's house and was especially amused by Rose's player piano, which Mulligan later recalled as having rolls by numerous players, including Fats Waller. Black musicians sometimes came through town, and because many motels would not take them, they often had <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>homes</b> within the black community. The young Mulligan occasionally met such musicians <b>staying</b> <b>at</b> Rose's <b>home.</b>|$|R

Mitchell grew up as a child <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> until he was nineteen years old before moving out.|$|R

25|$|Prior to the Games, {{officials}} anticipated {{two million}} tourists, of which one-third would be from overseas. However, actual volume of visitors fell 9.2% year-on-year. Chinese officials cited the Sichuan earthquake, riots in Tibet, torch relay protests and the {{subprime mortgage crisis}} as factors. Locally, many people anticipated that Beijing would be too crowded during the Games. Businesses avoided scheduling meetings during these two weeks, and potential Chinese visitors decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and watch the events on TV.|$|E
25|$|The German Nazi {{government}} strongly encouraged women <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> to bear {{children and}} keep house. This policy {{was reinforced by}} bestowing the Cross of Honor of the German Mother on women bearing four or more children. The unemployment rate was cut substantially, mostly through arms production and sending women home so that men could take their jobs. Nazi propaganda sometimes promoted premarital and extramarital sexual relations, unwed motherhood and divorce, but at other times the Nazis opposed such behaviour.|$|E

25|$|The highest-rated game {{according}} to Nielsen was Super Bowl XVI in 1982, which was watched in 49.1 {{percent of households}} (73 share), or 40,020,000 households at the time. Ratings for that game, a San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, may have been aided by a large blizzard that had affected much of the northeastern United States on game day, leaving residents <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> more than usual. Super Bowl XVI still ranks fourth on Nielsen's list of top-rated programs of all time, and three other Super Bowls, XII, XVII, and XX, made the top ten.|$|E
25|$|Desirable actions such as enrolling {{children}} in school or receiving vaccinations can be encouraged by a form of aid known as conditional cash transfers. In Mexico, for example, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height. Initial fears that the program would encourage families <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> rather than work to collect benefits {{have proven to be}} unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children stopped begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program.|$|E
25|$|This is {{one reason}} for girls leaving {{secondary}} school or missing classes. No privacy and lack of water supply means that girls prefer <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> during menstruation. Girls may lack knowledge of menstrual hygiene since the subject is taboo. An intervention in four districts of Southern Ethiopia, identified and tested local material for making sanitary pads, trained local tailors to make and mass-produce them, established local supply outlets and lobbied stakeholders to up-scale. Successful testing and raising awareness of the problem resulted in improved facilities for girls in five primary schools and one secondary school.|$|E
