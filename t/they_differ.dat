5|$|The treeswifts, {{also called}} crested swifts, {{are closely related}} to the true swifts. <b>They</b> <b>differ</b> from the true swifts in that they have crests, long forked tails and soft plumage.|$|E
50|$|The Tasmanian Government Railways K {{class was}} the first class of Garratt {{locomotive}} ever produced. <b>They</b> <b>differed</b> from most later Garratts in two respects.|$|R
50|$|Prussia only {{started to}} operate 4-6-0 express freight {{locomotives}} of its S 10 family from 1910. While they were externally similar, <b>they</b> <b>differed</b> in engine arrangement.|$|R
60|$|The twelve crossed plants now {{averaged}} 33.28, and the ten self-fertilised 19.9 {{inches in}} height, or as 100 to 60; so that <b>they</b> <b>differed</b> somewhat less than before.|$|R

5|$|Falconidae is {{a family}} of diurnal birds of prey. <b>They</b> <b>differ</b> from hawks, eagles and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons. In Ancient Egyptian only one species is {{depicted}} as breeding in the Delta and called HrT (meaning unknown).|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. <b>They</b> <b>differ</b> from cruise missiles {{in that they are}} designed to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition is intended to be expended in an attack and has a built-in warhead.|$|E
50|$|The {{ships were}} {{designed}} {{to be capable of}} surveys supporting hydrographic and bathymetric charting and oceanographic requirements. <b>They</b> <b>differed</b> chiefly in installed equipment and systems, particularly data acquisition systems.|$|R
5000|$|Certain Greek and Roman authors saw the {{presence}} of the Etruscans in Italy as a [...] "historical problem," [...] since <b>they</b> <b>differed</b> from the other civilizations in the area.|$|R
5000|$|They were, in essentials, a {{continuation}} of Joseph Armstrong's 806 Class of 1873. <b>They</b> <b>differed</b> from the originals in having a cab and a domeless boiler from the start.|$|R
5|$|Observations of Io by {{spacecraft}} and Earth-based {{astronomers have}} led to the identification of differences in the types of eruptions seen on the satellite. The three main types identified include intra-patera, flow-dominated, and explosion-dominated eruptions. <b>They</b> <b>differ</b> in terms of duration, energy released, brightness temperature (determined from infrared imaging), type of lava flow, and whether it is confined within volcanic pits.|$|E
5|$|The Asian subspecies, the {{relatively}} large intermedius also differs in structure and voice, and {{may represent a}} distinct species. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested}} that they should be considered subspecies of T. maximus, but <b>they</b> <b>differ</b> in structure, voice and the appearance of the eye-ring.|$|E
5|$|The contemporative mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if {{the subject of the}} subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If <b>they</b> <b>differ,</b> the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative {{can also be used to}} form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.|$|E
25|$|The LFG V 59 and the LFG V 61 {{were single}} engine, twin float {{passenger}} seaplanes {{designed and built}} in Germany in 1926 by the Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft. <b>They</b> <b>differed</b> only in their engines.|$|R
50|$|The X2-class was a {{class of}} six trams built by the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board. Developed from the X1-class, <b>they</b> <b>differed</b> in having larger wheels, angled {{windshields}} and only two doors.|$|R

5|$|Both McLuhan and Innis {{assume the}} {{centrality}} of communication technology; where <b>they</b> <b>differ</b> is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology. Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan has {{much to say about}} perception and thought but little to say about institutions; Innis says much about institutions and little about perception and thought.|$|E
5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which <b>they</b> <b>differ</b> in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E
5|$|For example, when {{comparing}} the imaginary {{part of the}} refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15km and 18km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700nm (around 0.009), while <b>they</b> <b>differ</b> significantly around 300nm. Here, the 18km (k {{was found to be}} around 0.009) sample was much more absorbent than the 15km sample (k was found to be around 0.002).|$|E
5000|$|High cabs: T347-T356 and T357-T366 (second {{and third}} orders). <b>They</b> <b>differed</b> from the flat tops {{by having a}} high cab but were {{mechanically}} similar. The 3rd order had an altered radiator design.|$|R
50|$|The Firos {{were similar}} to the Russian BM-21 Grad in that they both used 122 mm rockets in groups of forty, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>differed</b> considerably in command and control systems and base vehicle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] said Carrie, languidly. [...] "No doubt <b>they</b> <b>differed</b> {{over the}} points of a steer, or {{one of them was}} too {{attentive}} to the waiting-maid. I believe they have two at the Occidental." ...|$|R
5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but <b>they</b> <b>differ</b> in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20â€“24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} easy to {{recognise}} {{that a particular}} insect is a bee. <b>They</b> <b>differ</b> from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (bristles), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in the limb structure and the venation of the hind wings, and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. <b>They</b> <b>differ</b> only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E
50|$|The 2130 {{class were}} an {{evolution}} of the 2141 class. <b>They</b> <b>differed</b> by having a flatter roofline to give better clearance when operating under wires. They were financed by the developers of the Saraji coal mine.|$|R
5000|$|Si35 models, RU35, and TN35 : These models used fixed wooden buttstock, {{and were}} {{chambered}} for the 9Ã—23mm (9mm Largo cartridge). <b>They</b> <b>differed</b> slightly in {{rate of fire}} and design. Used in the Spanish Civil War.|$|R
50|$|In June 1959 {{the first}} of an {{additional}} ten entered service. Although mechanically similar to the first batch <b>they</b> <b>differed</b> by having a cab raised above the hood line. A further ten entered service from December 1961.|$|R
