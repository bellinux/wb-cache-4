25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a [...] "heartbroken ballad", where Spears {{declares}} on the introduction, [...] "You tell me you're {{in love with me}} / That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me / It's not that I don't wanna stay / But every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> too close I move away". According to musicologist Melanie Lowe, [...] "Spears shows a different side of her personality [...] than she does in her other songs." [...] Both of them also commented the song [...] "lacks rhythmic drive and the backing track is fuller, with smoother and rounder synthsized instruments", while describing Spears' vocals as more natural when compared to [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy".|$|E
500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E

500|$|Spears {{originally}} envisioned [...] "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary", {{but felt}} {{all right with}} her label's producers, since [...] "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." [...] The album opens with the first single [...] "...Baby One More Time", a teen pop and dance-pop song that begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as [...] "We Will Rock You" [...] (1977), [...] "Start Me Up" [...] (1981), [...] "These Words" [...] (2004) and the theme song of the film Jaws {{due to the fact}} the track [...] "makes its presence known in exactly one second". According to magazine Blender, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is composed by [...] "wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps". Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend." [...] The next song and third single, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] runs through a moderately slow dance beat, and has a rhythm and blues melody mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals. The third track and second single [...] "Sometimes" [...] is a ballad, that Spears begins with [...] "You tell me you're in love with me/That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me/It's not that I don't wanna stay/But every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> too close I move away". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the song has [...] "a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent euro-dance rhythm." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 3 April 2017 it was {{revealed}} that Moyes had made a controversial remark after a post-match interview after Sunderland's goalless draw with Burnley on 18 March. After the interview with the BBC's Vicki Sparks, while the microphone was still audible, Moyes, said: [...] "It was getting a wee bit naughty at the end there so just watch yourself. You still might get a slap even though you’re a woman. Careful the next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> in". Moyes apologised for the incident. The FA wrote to Moyes to ask for his observations on the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Petrelis {{launched}} {{the effort in}} Concord, New Hampshire on December 10, 1991, when he disrupted conservative commentator Pat Buchanan's announcement of his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. Two minutes into Buchanan's speech, broadcast on the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN), Petrelis started screaming, [...] "Act up, fight back, fight AIDS!" [...] Off camera, senior Buchanan campaign officials tackled Petrelis and dragged him from the hall, while Buchanan advised, [...] "Be gentle. Be gentle with him." [...] Standing over Petrelis outside, the campaign officials were heard to threaten, [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> here, this is what you're going to get. Tell your friends." [...] Petrelis filed an assault complaint with the New Hampshire State Police against the two campaign officials, Paul Nagy and Chris Tremblay.|$|E
