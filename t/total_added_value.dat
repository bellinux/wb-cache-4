In addition, we analyze the geography of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in each case. We also study how the exchange rate fluctuations affect {{the distribution of the}} <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Our results show that the researched company creates 36 % of the <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> when the bicycle is made in its plant.

However, controlling for performance, we find that brand alliances between high brand equity players (defined as receiving enough votes to be an all-star starter) and medium brand equity teams (defined by stadium and broadcast revenues) generate the highest value.

Indias services sector has been burgeoning fast and one of the major drivers of the growth of services sector is information technology (IT) and information technology enabled services (ITES). It is well documented in literature that IT impacts growth by different channels. In this study we try to empirically verify the question : Can IT and ITES be an engine of growth? Using micro-level data of 100 households of 20 IT and ITES firms along with secondary data we tried to estimate the extent of indirect employment generation at macro level and the share of IT and ITES in total employment and <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> According to our study, one job for skilled professional employed in IT and ITES spins off jobs for 0. 48 semi-skilled, low skills or unskilled workers. As per our estimates, the 16 lakh workers who are expected to be directly employed in IT sector in the FY 2008 would generate secondary employment for 7, 68, 000 people which would constitute 0. 16 % of total employment. However, the share of consumption expenditure of 16 lakh professionals would be 20 % of <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Assuming the consumption expenditure of the IT and ITES workers and <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> to be the same/constant when we tried to assess the contribution of consumption expenditure of 2. 3 million workers (who are projected to be directly absorbed by IT sector by 2010, NASSCOM, 2005) to <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> it comes out to be 29 % of <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> The study says that the proportion of IT-ITES in total employment may be small but its contribution to <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> is still very high.

30|$|Second, the {{aggregate}} trade cost {{is not only}} the “global comparative advantage” in manufacturing industry, but also the determinants of “local comparative advantage”. Reducing {{the aggregate}} trade cost would significantly promote the export of manufacturing industry products, and the effect is more obvious in the industry with higher trade cost intensity. The same degree of declining in the aggregate trade cost has the most promotional effect on “Office, accounting and computing machinery manufacturing (C 30)” while that has the minimal effect on “food, beverage and tobacco manufacturing (C 15 T 16)”. Three kinds of the robustness tests demonstrate the results. The domestic additional value rates of the “food” and “drink” rank the second and first in 19 industries, respectively (Zhang et al 2013). Only the increasing in the export share and total amount in the products with high domestic export value added can transform the export of high “DVA” into the increasing of the total inventory of “DVA”, and realize the true transformation of foreign trade. Therefore, for the products that have highest domestic value-added rate but lowest trade cost intensity, they can play a promotional role in export, and is also the core in transforming the trade development mode. Government should make effort to reduce the trade cost, including transportation, customs, system implementation, etc. The “DVA” of the “office, mechanical manufacturing” is lowest in 19 industries (Zhang et al 2013). However, the trade cost intensity has the highest degree. Therefore, this kind of product is not the main object of reduce the trade cost since the declining of the trade cost would contribute to the increase of export share, which not only not make the <b>total</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> of export efficiently increase, but also consume too much resources to undermine the domestic natural ecological environment.|$|E

A quantitative assessment of these economic impacts is necessary for further investments to be made into the industry. By purchasing inputs, employing local residents, and selling products locally, the aquaculture industry in Indiana not only affects the local economy directly but indirectly as well. ^ The aquaculture industry in Indiana ranges from small-scale producers growing fish in their back yards to large-scale producers growing fish to sell in national and international markets. This industry includes the production of ornamental fish, {{fish for human consumption}} (food fish), and recreational fish that are used to stock private and public ponds and lakes. Fish are produced in both man-made ponds and indoor tank systems throughout the state. The different types of fish that are produced include, but are not limited to, yellow perch, tilapia, bait fish, hybrid striped bass, marine shrimp, freshwater fish, ornamentals, and trophy fish. ^ Economic data such as annual cost structures and sales was collected from a sample of fish farmers in Indiana and used to assess the overall economic impact of the industry using IMPLAN (IMpact Analysis for PLANning). The direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts of the aquaculture industry were estimated. The industry supports 280 jobs within the aquaculture industry and other supporting industries. Of those 280 jobs, 169 of them are employed directly by the producers in the aquaculture industry. The aquaculture industry generates 3, 731, 842 worth of labor income within the industry and a total of 7, 541, 867 worth of labor income in the aquaculture industry and other supporting industries.

40|$|In {{light of}} the European climate ambitions, there has been {{substantial}} growth in capacity of variable renewable energy sources in many Member States, with significant future growth expected. Such sources impact {{the operation of the}} power system by challenging its ability to maintain the short-term balance between supply and demand. Firstly, their output is variable and uncertain, increasing the need for short-term flexibility. Secondly, they displace part of the conventional flexibility providers, i. e. the dispatchable generation technologies, decreasing the supply of short-term flexibility. These sources also impact the planning of the power system by challenging its long-term ability to meet the aggregate demand for electricity. Firstly, only a limited share of their capacity can be called upon at any given time. Secondly, their impact on power system operation also has an impact on power system planning. The first aspect, related to firm capacity adequacy, is well understood and is mostly dealt with adequately in planning models. The second aspect, related to flexibility adequacy, has only recently emerged as an area of interest in planning. To study the importance of short-term flexibility adequacy in long-term power system planning, a high level of temporal and operational detail is needed, while managing the required computational effort. For that purpose, an alternative approach is developed for representing power system operation in planning: a clustered formulation of the unit commitment problem. Using this formulation, a planning model is developed which identifies the optimal investment portfolio, taking into account renewable energy objectives, and determines the scheduled production and consumption levels to deliver energy and reserve. The need for short-term flexibility is represented via the modeling of the day-ahead electricity market with an hourly resolution - to include the effects of variability, and operating reserve requirements following the guidelines of the European Network for Transmission System Operators for Electricity - to include the effects of uncertainty. The supply of flexibility is represented via mathematical models of dispatchable and variable generation, long-term demand response, re-electrifying and non re-electrifying storage, and flexibility through interconnection. First, the developed planning model is applied to a test system {{to assess the impact of}} short-term flexibility requirements on the cost and composition of the optimal investment portfolio. The supply of short-term flexibility is limited to the sources most commonly found in European power systems, namely dispatchable generation technologies and pumped hydro energy storage. Results show that renewable uncertainty is the most important driver of the short-term flexibility-related costs. Results further show that the way of handling this uncertainty, i. e. the adopted reserve sizing and allocation strategy, is decisive for the final impact of flexibility adequacy requirements. Based on the findings of this work it can be said that it will most likely no longer be cost-effective to centrally impose a level of reliability in a highly renewable power system. In a liberalized and decentralizing power system context, the value of reliability will also be something to be determined in a liberalized and decentralized way. Finally, it has to be noted that other elements than short-term flexibility requirements may have larger impacts on total system cost, and that it might therefore be more opportune for other planning models to dedicate additional computational resources to these issues, rather than to including the short-term flexibility constraints. This, naturally, depends on the goal of the research. Second, the planning model is used to assess the value of alternative sources of short-term flexibility, and the importance of the level of operational detail for assessing their impact. The supply of short-term flexibility is expanded to include a number of selected technologies of the three other types of flexibility sources: energy storage, demand response and interconnection. Results show that different technologies generate added value in different ways, but that they are also to a certain extent interchangeable. Results further show that the optimal level of investment depends on how well the technologies are able to compound different sources of added value, and that high operational detail in a power system planning model is therefore indispensable, as it enables the model to capture the <b>total</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> of the different technologies. The combined flexibility of the considered conventional and alternative flexibility providers allows to significantly reduce the cost of short-term flexibility requirements. Coupled to an ambitious operating reserve strategy, this flexibility could thus enable the integration of large shares of variable renewable energy sources without significant flexibility adequacy-related costs. One of the main challenges to be addressed is the remuneration of the flexibility providers for their added value. Regardless of the specific mechanism through which this will be realized, based on the findings of this work it can be said that such mechanisms should be technology-neutral and developed in an international context. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (1) describe the economic agents of the chain and their commercial and legal relationships; (2) identify the articulations between links, technological levels, indicators of efficiency, installed capacity (scale), and degrees of occupation; (3) characterize and estimate the costing and pricing structures, and the generation of value in different links of the chain; (4) identify those critical costs that can be modified through technological interventions, policy, or other activity; (5) determine the biological and economic risk factors throughout the chain; and (6) develop a methodology to identify and estimate the costs and benefits in each segment and evaluate the generation of value throughout the beef chain. Data at the farm level was obtained from a national livestock survey (CORFOGA 2005 b), which provided data on production systems, inventories, productivity, culling, and labor. In addition, surveys were carried out in different segments: (1) auction houses, (2) slaughterhouses, (3) butcher shops, and (4) supermarkets. The aim of these surveys was to describe behavior, determine risks and costs, and identify problems. The weak dynamics of livestock production in Costa Rica are reflected in unsatisfactory productivity indicators. The annual gross income was estimated as US$ 44 /ha for cow-calf operations, $ 126 /ha for dual purpose (including income from milk sales), and $ 135 /ha for fattening activities. Such income rates are considered extremely low, if one uses as reference the commercial value of land allocated to livestock production (ranging between $ 1000 and $ 2000 /ha). The aforementioned biological inefficiencies, combined with high land costs, impede the recovery of opportunity costs for the capital invested in land, thus making beef production uncompetitive. The cow-calf operation, with its low productivity, remunerates family labor with wages below the legal minimum. On the assumption that the only cash cost is that of labor, cow-calf farms pay family workers at a wage that is equivalent to 60 % of the legal minimum. Auctions present relatively good profits per event. However, when these profits are analyzed on a calendar-day basis, they are unattractive because of the low use of installed capacity. One strategy that would usefully improve the efficiency of the auction system in Costa Rica is its integration {{to reduce the number of}} fixed operational costs or encourage sharing of these houses so that administrative and operational personnel are rotated among the several existing auctions, taking advantage of the fact that they differ in their days of operation. This scheme would help reduce fixed costs and the commission collected without affecting profits, thus improving efficiency in this link of the chain. However, this option is not easy to implement, as auctions are run by private operators, whose various interests do not always coincide. The industrial sector formed by rural and industrial slaughterhouses shows a low occupation of installed capacity, resulting in high operational costs and low labor efficiency. The total operational costs of slaughtering and dressing are estimated as being between US$ 32 and $ 66 per animal. If the estimated unit costs are compared with the rates charged per slaughtered animal (between $ 15 and $ 23), then we have to conclude that rural slaughterhouses work at a loss and that industrial slaughterhouses cover their operational costs with processing services and the very small profit margins from sales of byproducts. The best performance in terms of efficiency and profitability is found in the retail sector of butchers and supermarkets. The rate of profits, expressed as the fraction of the final price paid by the consumer that remains in the butcher’s hands as remuneration of his work, ranges widely between 3 % and 40 %, with an average of 32 %. If these profit rates are compared with those of other retail businesses, which are about 8 %, then this type of activity presents excellent profit margins with relatively low risk. If, in addition, we take into account that this sector also offers the consumer a broad range of meat cuts from other animals such as pork and chicken, and processed meats, then profit margins are still higher. The value generated throughout the chain, as a percentage of the final value of the young steer at retail price according to activity, is distributed as follows: fattener (34 %), retailer (33 %), breeder (19 %), slaughterhouse (7 %), transporter (6 %), and auction house (1 %). As observed, the distribution of value throughout the beef chain is totally inequitable and incongruent with the level of individual risk confronted by the actors who form it. The inequity observed in the distribution of added value reflects a clear dominant position in the market of some actors of the chain, which enables them to capture a very high fraction of the profits. The value generated in the chain, adjusted for operational time in each link, ranges between US$ 0. 28 /animal per day for the breeder and $ 45. 85 /animal per day for the butcher. Thus, the highest proportion of the <b>total</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> concentrates on the final link of the chain. The butcher or supermarket obtains, on the basis of one animal in the same unit of time, 164 times more value that the breeder located in the first link of the chain. The latter has to confront biological and economic risks not covered by insurance policies, whereas retailers may mitigate risks through insurance policies for their raw materials, equipment, and infrastructure. The competitiveness of the beef chain is the aggregate of the efficiency and productivity of all the links that form it. In a situation where, in the final segment, the demand for beef is low and weakly dynamic, then economic signs of modernization and the technological change it promotes, are not being generated in other components of the chain, particularly in the first link of production. This, in turn, results in a vicious cycle, generating low productivity and lack of competitiveness. To promote technological change, efficiency, and competitiveness in the value chain for beef in Costa Rica, we propose the following six recommendations: 1. That successful experiences of other chains such as that of poultry be analyzed and learned from to identify strategies that would increase the efficiency of the beef chain as a whole. 2. That strategies for promoting the milk production of breeding cows be developed to increase family income, as remuneration of labor is currently below the minimum wage. This option would be viable only in localities where a milk market exists. That livestock producer funds [a livestock producer fund consists of granting livestock in company to produce meat, provided that the producer concerned has adequate pastures for this purpose on his farm] be created as mechanisms to develop social capital, reduce transaction costs, and help improve the chain’s productivity and profitability. These organizations would bring together the different classes of the chain and favor synergies in the interaction of public and private actors. 3. That incentives be created to promote the large-scale adoption of already available improved forage species, as most of the problem of low livestock productivity originates in poor and deficient feed. This strategy would emphasize feeding during dry seasons, thereby minimizing seasonal weight losses in the national herd and improving the profitability of farms. 4. That a carcass classification system be established, based on quality and price that would permit differentiating supplies for different segments of the market. 5. That consumer education be promoted on the health benefits of beef, forms of preparation, and differentiating between cuts, uses, and qualities of beef products...|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{percentage}} of the <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of other provinces contributed by a province’s exports to the <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contributed by the exports (i.e., export spillover effect), the export spillover effect of the eastern provinces was greater. Comparing the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of spillover effects, however, showed that the spillover effect of the eastern provinces was insignificant. The primary reason for this effect is that although the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of other provinces contributed by the export spillover effects of the eastern provinces was greater, China’s economy, especially the manufacturing industry, is concentrated in eastern provinces with strong agglomeration effects and supporting capacity. Therefore, the production of the products exported from eastern provinces is mainly completed in the local region, which contributes greatly to the eastern provinces’ economies but has a smaller spillover effect on other provinces.|$|R

The study presents potential use of beechwood (Fagus sylvatica L.) and an estimation method for <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of beechwood products. For easier and more transparent study and determination of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of over 350 so far identified products made of beechwood, 28 groups of products based on technological similarities were suggested. Since the indicator of <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of product cannot be used for comparison of diverse products (due to different amounts of wood in the material structure of a product as well as due to variety of technological and other requirements of the production), we have developed a model for estimation of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of beechwood products. In this model, three additional indicators were proposed: (1) <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> per amount of wood used in the product, (2) <b>total</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> on share of value of wood used in the product and (3) share of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in the selling price of the product. The latter is the most important for business decisions. One of the main obstacles to apply the model and evaluate as well as collect the data is to determine the prices of both inputs and outputs. This is closely related to incomparability in determination of the quality of wood in the entire forest-wood chain. Application of the model and identification of problems is presented in detail for the case of sawn wood product...|$|R
