5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} <b>to</b> <b>seed</b> plants {{has been}} identified from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
5|$|This nuthatch, {{like most}} of its genus, is non-migratory, and the adults {{normally}} stay in their territory year-round. There may be more noticeable dispersal due <b>to</b> <b>seed</b> failure or high reproductive success in some years, and this species has occurred as a vagrant to Vancouver Island, Santa Cruz Island, and Bermuda. One bird landed on the RMS Queen Mary six hours sailing east of New York City in October 1963.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the survival, multiplication, and {{transmission}} <b>to</b> <b>seeds</b> of plant pathogenic bacteria {{is central to}} study their pathogenesis. We hypothesized that the type III secretion system (T 3 SS), encoded by hrp genes, could {{have a role in}} host colonization by plant pathogenic bacteria. The seed-borne pathogen Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. fuscans causes common bacterial blight of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Directed mutagenesis in strain CFBP 4834 -R of X. fuscans subsp. fuscans and bacterial population density monitoring on bean leaves showed that strains with mutations in the hrp regulatory genes, hrpG and hrpX, were impaired in their phyllospheric growth, as in the null interaction with Escherichia coli C 600 and bean. In the compatible interaction, CFBP 4834 -R reached high phyllospheric population densities and was transmitted <b>to</b> <b>seeds</b> at high frequencies with high densities. Strains with mutations in structural hrp genes maintained the same constant epiphytic population densities (1 × 105 CFU g− 1 of fresh weight) as in the incompatible interaction with Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris ATCC 33913 and the bean. Low frequencies of transmission <b>to</b> <b>seeds</b> and low bacterial concentrations were recorded for CFBP 4834 -R hrp mutants and for ATCC 33913, whereas E. coli C 600 was not transmitted. Moreover, unlike the wild-type strain, strains with mutations in hrp genes were not transmitted <b>to</b> <b>seeds</b> by vascular pathway. Transmission <b>to</b> <b>seeds</b> by floral structures remained possible for both. This study revealed the involvement of the X. fuscans subsp. fuscans T 3 SS in phyllospheric multiplication and systemic colonization of bean, leading <b>to</b> transmission <b>to</b> <b>seeds.</b> Our findings suggest a major contribution of hrp regulatory genes in host colonization processes...|$|R
5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum {{counter-terrorism}} consultant, contacts {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on the planet, {{in a bid to}} become a kind of god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares <b>to</b> <b>seed</b> Earth with a mutagenic virus—the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E
5|$|This {{problem has}} been the object of growing concern. For example, {{researchers}} at the University of Hohenheim are studying how bees can be poisoned by exposure <b>to</b> <b>seed</b> disinfectants. In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an expert group, the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. Researchers at the Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have pondered the intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even has published standards for testing chemicals for bee intoxication.|$|E
5|$|While {{the root}} of the parsnip is edible, {{handling}} the shoots and leaves of the plant requires caution as the sap is toxic. Like many other members of the family Apiaceae, the parsnip contains furanocoumarins as a defense against herbivory, photosensitive chemicals that causes a condition known as phytophotodermatitis. The condition is a type of chemical burn rather than an allergic reaction, and is similar to the rash caused by poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made but these have been small in number compared to {{the number of people who}} grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur on a sunny day when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone <b>to</b> <b>seed.</b> The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate.|$|E

40|$|Egg-laying {{females of}} the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus {{discriminate}} against occupied (egg-laden) seeds, and thus reduce competition among larvae within seeds. Two strains (S and B) differed genetically in this trait. A factorial experiment {{was performed to}} distinguish whether greater avoidance of occupied hosts by S-strain females {{was caused by a}} stronger chemical deterrent associated with S-strain eggs, a keener response to the presence of eggs by S-strain females, or both. The degree of host discrimination depended on both the source of eggs and the source of test females; the strongest avoidance of egg-laden seeds was exhibited by S-strain females presented with clean <b>seeds</b> as opposed <b>to</b> <b>seeds</b> bearing S-strain eggs, whereas the weakest host discrimination was exhibited by B-strain females presented clean <b>seeds</b> as opposed <b>to</b> <b>seeds</b> bearing B-strain eggs. When presented with only egg-laden seeds, females from both strains added more eggs <b>to</b> <b>seeds</b> bearing B-strain eggs than <b>to</b> <b>seeds</b> bearing S-strain eggs, but the degree of discrimination between the two kinds of egg-laden seeds was stronger among S-strain females. Population differences in host discrimination appear to reflect differential costs associated with multiple larvae/seed; the more discriminating S strain has been associated with a relatively small host and its larvae engage in exceptionally strong interference competition...|$|R
