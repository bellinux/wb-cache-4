5|$|Many brick {{structures}} {{have been}} located at Kaveripumpattinam during on-shore, near shore and off-shore explorations; these provide proof for building construction during Sangam age. The on-shore structure include an I-shaped wharf and {{a structure that}} looks like a reservoir. The wharf has a number of wooden poles planted in its structure to enable anchorage of boats and to facilitate the handling of cargo. Among other structures, there is a Buddhist vihara with parts of it decorated using moulded bricks and stucco. Near shore excavations yielded a brick structure and a few terracotta ring wells. Off-shore explorations located a fifteen course brick structure, three courses of dressed stone blocks, brick bats and pottery. At Arikamedu, there were indications of a structure built substantially of timber, possibly a wharf. Conical jars <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used for storing wine and oil have been found near structures <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shops or storage areas. Evidence of continued building activity are present at this site, with the most distinctive structures being those of a possible warehouse, dyeing tanks and lined pits.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice {{deposits}} <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{caused by}} the Thera eruption.

Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta, but this is now known to be a misidentification.|$|E
5|$|However, {{throughout}} the history of Christianity a number of relics attributed to Jesus have been claimed, although doubt has been cast on them.

Similarly, while experts debate whether Jesus was crucified with three nails or with four, at least thirty holy nails continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{airborne}} forces made several mistakes, most notably when pilot error caused paratroopers from the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a regiment of the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, to miss their drop zone and {{land on a}} British drop zone instead. However, the operation was a success, with both divisions capturing Rhine bridges and securing towns <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used by Germany to delay the advance of the British ground forces. The two divisions incurred more than 2,000 casualties, but captured about 3,500 German soldiers. The operation was the last large-scale Allied airborne operation of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The method {{chosen by}} PAVN {{to defeat the}} {{invasion}} was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied 122mm and 130mm pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive edge <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the communist forces. Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor would then finish the job.|$|E

5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} introduced {{at the same time}} made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great deal of money was wasted on resolving the problems of a class designed for duties <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of Dragoon by some Allied generals and contemporary commentators such as Bernard Montgomery, Arthur R. Wilson, and Chester Wilmot in the aftermath, {{mostly because of}} its geo-strategic implications. It was argued that Dragoon diverted highly-experienced men and much-needed material away from the continuing fighting at the Western front <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used, instead, to bolster the Italian front or to hasten the advance towards the Rhine by the Overlord forces. The resulting loss of momentum gave Stalin on the Eastern Front a free hand to pursue his offensive efforts with more determination, allowing him to win the race towards Berlin and occupy the Balkans. Dragoon therefore had consequences reaching into the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|In May 1915, Hamilton {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} his {{resources in the}} Helles sector. Birdwood withdrew Colonel McCay's 2nd Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and they moved by sea to Cape Helles on 6 May. During the subsequent Second Battle of Krithia the two brigades suffered 1,827 casualties, including McCay, in an ill-advised daylight advance over open ground <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> occupied after dark without loss. During May Turkish snipers were particularly active in Monash Valley. On 15 May, one shot and fatally wounded Major General Bridges.

5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E
5|$|In March 2003, Carney {{joined the}} staff of Lt. Gen. Jay Garner in Iraq and served for several months as a senior staff member in the Ministry of Industry and Minerals {{as part of the}} Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) that governed Iraq in the {{aftermath}} of U.S. forces overthrowing the regime of Saddam Hussein. Upon arrival in Baghdad, he became critical of the plan set out by CPA, making clear that Iraq czar Paul Bremer's ideological vision was impeding progress <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to stabilize Iraq. He left Baghdad two months after arriving in April 2003, disillusioned by an inability to execute a more pragmatic plan for Iraq's reconstruction. Carney returned to Washington where he made known his disagreement with the Bremer plan. In 2007,Under a significant reorganization of the Iraq reconstruction effort by the Bush administration that witnessed other policy dissenters return to Baghdad, Carney was asked by the State Department to return to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to oversee the overall U.S. effort to rebuild Iraq.|$|E

The alien expresses its gratefulness to Ninten's family for raising it, but explains that George stole vital information from its people <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to betray them, and proceeds to accuse Ninten of interfering with their plans. Giygas offers to save Ninten alone if he boards the Mother Ship. When Ninten declines, Giygas attempts to put Ninten to sleep. The party begins to sing the Eight Melodies while Giygas tries to quiet the party through an attack. When the party finishes the lullaby, Giygas is overcome with emotion at the thought of Maria's motherly love. Giygas says they will meet again and flies off in the Mother Ship. The game ends with Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd facing the player as the credits roll behind them.|$|E

5|$|Wiseau {{has been}} secretive about {{exactly how he}} {{obtained}} the funding for the project, but he did tell Entertainment Weekly that he made {{some of the money}} by importing leather jackets from Korea. According to Sestero in his book The Disaster Artist, Wiseau was already independently wealthy at the time production began, having amassed a fortune over several years of entrepreneurship and real estate development in and around Los Angeles and San Francisco. The budget for The Room reached , all of which was spent on production and marketing. Wiseau has stated that the reason the film was relatively expensive was because many members of the cast and crew had to be replaced, and each of the cast members had several understudies. According to Sestero, Wiseau made numerous poor decisions during filming that unnecessarily inflated the film's budget, such as building sets for sequences <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> filmed on location, purchasing unnecessary equipment, and filming identical scenes multiple times using different sets. Sestero further wrote that the film's budget skyrocketed as a result of minutes-long dialogue sequences taking hours or days to shoot due to Wiseau's inability to properly remember his lines or move to the appropriate place on camera.|$|E
