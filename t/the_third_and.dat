5|$|Their dactyli are {{powerful}} and curved into a scimitar-like shape. The second pair of gnathopods are densely covered in hair-like setae {{while the first}} pair only has setae on the posterior margins. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> fourth pereopods are absent. In their place are two pairs of elongated oval gills arising from <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> fourth pereonites, respectively. In mature females, two brood pouches also develop in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> fourth pereonites. These are formed by oostegites – platelike expansions from the basal segments (coxae) of the appendages. The fifth to seventh pereopods function as clasping appendages. They all have propodi with two spines on their inside margins. The seventh pair of pereopods are the longest of the three pairs, followed by the sixth pereopod pair and the fifth pereopod pair.|$|E
