5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a <b>trespasser</b> if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Trespasser</b> was an {{important}} film for Swanson, following the disastrous Queen Kelly and the hit Sadie Thompson, and garnered Swanson her second Oscar nomination. Sadly for Swanson, The <b>Trespasser</b> proved {{to be one of}} her only two hit talkies, the other being Sunset Boulevard, made over 20 years later. Subsequent follow-ups like What a Widow!, Indiscreet, Tonight or Never, Perfect Understanding, and Music in the Air all proved to be box-office flops. Despite the disappointments following The <b>Trespasser,</b> Swanson was well remembered by Billy Wilder, a writer on Music in the Air, when he was casting the part of Norma Desmond in his masterpiece Sunset Boulevard (1950).|$|E
5|$|<b>Trespass</b> in English law {{is an area}} of {{tort law}} broadly divided into three groups: <b>trespass</b> to the person, <b>trespass</b> to goods and <b>trespass</b> to land.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Trespass</b> to chattels, {{also known}} as <b>trespass</b> to goods or <b>trespass</b> to {{personal}} property, is defined as [...] "an intentional interference with the possession of personal property … proximately causing injury". <b>Trespass</b> to chattel {{does not require a}} showing of damages. Simply the [...] "intermeddling with or use of … the personal property" [...] of another gives cause of action for <b>trespass.</b> Since CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, various courts have applied the principles of <b>trespass</b> to chattel to resolve cases involving unsolicited bulk e-mail and unauthorized server usage.|$|R
25|$|The Act {{extends the}} common {{duty of care}} to trespassers as well as visitors, {{providing}} that this duty is to be required when the occupier has actual or constructive knowledge that a danger exists and that a <b>trespasser</b> is or may be near it. Unlike the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the 1984 Act only allows an injured <b>trespasser</b> to claim for death and personal injury, not for damage to personal property. The Act also makes amendments to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, with the stated intent of allowing additional educational and recreational use of land.|$|E
25|$|A {{person is}} guilty of {{burglary}} if they enter any building or part of a building as a <b>trespasser</b> with intent to steal, inflict grievous bodily harm or do unlawful damage to the building or anything in it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trespasser</b> is {{the third}} and the last single-player {{downloadable}} content for the game. Players continue to {{assume the role of}} the Inquisitor, and have to face against a Qunari invasion and reestablish the authority of the Inquisition. The <b>Trespasser</b> DLC is set two years after the original game's ending. New wardrobe options and a Golden Nug statue, which allows players to keep all their acquired schematics and recipes, are also introduced in this downloadable content. It was announced during PAX Prime on August 29, 2015, and was released on September 8, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. According to BioWare, the team took inspirations from Indiana Jones and Captain America to create the game's story.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Trespass</b> and <b>trespass</b> on the case, or [...] "case", {{began as}} {{personal}} remedies {{in the royal}} courts in London in the 13th century. These early forms of <b>trespass</b> reflected {{a wide range of}} wrongs.|$|R
25|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, it became the {{practice}} that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common-law system would petition the King in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at common law (as opposed to equity)) was not sufficient redress for a <b>trespasser</b> occupying their land, and instead request that the <b>trespasser</b> be evicted. From this developed the system of equity, administered by the Lord Chancellor, in the courts of chancery. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other, {{even though it was}} established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.|$|E
25|$|A {{person is}} guilty of {{burglary}} if, having entered a building or part of a building as a <b>trespasser,</b> he steals or attempts to steal anything in the building, or inflicts or attempts to inflict grievous bodily harm on any person in the building.|$|E

5000|$|If an act {{is direct}} but unintentional, a {{plaintiff}} in Australia may pursue an action based on either negligent <b>trespass</b> or negligence. Because intent {{is a requirement}} for <b>trespass</b> under UK law, negligent <b>trespass</b> is not possible in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Trespass</b> to chattels, {{also known}} as <b>trespass</b> to goods or <b>trespass</b> to {{personal}} property, is defined as [...] "an intentional interference with the possession of personal property...proximately causing injury". While originally a remedy for the asportation of personal property, the tort grew to incorporate any interference with the personal property of another. In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, <b>trespass</b> to chattels has been codified to clearly define {{the scope of the}} remedy; in most jurisdictions, <b>trespass</b> to chattel remains a purely common law remedy, the scope of which varies by jurisdiction.|$|R
25|$|On 18 June {{after the}} match between England and Algeria a fan {{was able to}} break through the FIFA-appointed {{security}} staff at Green Point stadium and gain access to the England team dressing room. The breach took place shortly after Prince William and Prince Harry had left the room. The <b>trespasser</b> was then released before he could be handed over to the Police. The Football Association lodged a formal complaint with FIFA and demanded that security be increased.|$|E
25|$|The main remedy against {{tortious}} loss is compensation in 'damages' or money. In {{a limited}} range of cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a <b>trespasser.</b> This is a defence against the tort of battery. Further, {{in the case of}} a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction. This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm.|$|E
25|$|On March 29, 1929, at the {{bungalow}} of Mary Pickford at United Artists, Swanson, Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charles Chaplin, Norma Talmadge, John Barrymore, Dolores del Río and D. W. Griffith met {{to speak on}} the radio show, The Dodge Brothers Hour, to prove they could {{meet the challenge of}} talking movies. To try to recover from the Queen Kelly fiasco, Swanson jumped into making talkies, including The <b>Trespasser</b> (1929), What a Widow! (1930), Indiscreet (1931), Perfect Understanding (1933), and Music in the Air (1934).|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of <b>trespass,</b> {{the first of which}} is <b>trespass</b> to the person. Whether intent is a {{necessary}} element of <b>trespass</b> to the person varies by jurisdiction. Under English decision, Letang v Cooper, intent is required to sustain a <b>trespass</b> to the person cause of action; in the absence of intent, negligence is the appropriate tort. In other jurisdictions, gross negligence is sufficient to sustain a <b>trespass</b> to the person, such as when a defendant negligently operates an automobile and strikes the plaintiff with great force. [...] "Intent is to be presumed from the act itself." [...] Generally, <b>trespass</b> to the person consists of three torts: assault, battery, and false imprisonment.|$|R

25|$|After {{moving to}} what would become Iowa, he helped found Burlington, Iowa, in 1833 and 1834. He had {{established}} a ferry across the Mississippi River in 1833, but his settlement was twice burned out as a <b>trespasser</b> on land then owned by Native Americans. Once the Black Hawk Purchase was complete in June 1833 he rebuilt his cabin {{in what was then}} the Iowa Territory. While in Iowa he served as commissary general of Iowa, earning him the nickname of general. In 1843, he joined the Great Migration and traveled the Oregon Trail west to the Oregon Country, arriving at the Willamette Valley in November of that year.|$|E
25|$|In 1911 Lawrence was {{introduced}} to Edward Garnett, a publisher's reader, who acted as a mentor, provided further encouragement, and became a valued friend, as did his son David. Throughout these months the young author revised Paul Morel, {{the first draft of}} what became Sons and Lovers. In addition, a teaching colleague, Helen Corke, gave him access to her intimate diaries about an unhappy love affair, which formed the basis of The <b>Trespasser,</b> his second novel. In November 1911, he came down with a pneumonia again; once he recovered, Lawrence decided to abandon teaching in order to become a full-time writer. He also broke off an engagement to Louie Burrows, an old friend from his days in Nottingham and Eastwood.|$|E
25|$|The main remedy against {{tortious}} loss is compensation {{in damages}} or money. In a {{limited range of}} cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a <b>trespasser.</b> This is a defense against the tort of battery. Further, {{in the case of}} a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction, such as in the English case Miller v Jackson (1977). This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm. Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors, but some Australian jurisdictions can make an order for specific performance to ensure that the defendant carries out their legal obligations, especially in relation to nuisance matters.|$|E
50|$|The writs of <b>trespass</b> and <b>trespass</b> on {{the case}} are the two {{catchall}} torts from English common law, the former involving <b>trespass</b> against person, the latter involving <b>trespass</b> against anything else which may be actionable. The writ is also known in modern times as action {{on the case}} and can be sought for any action that may {{be considered as a}} tort but is yet to be an established category.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{given that}} a {{substantial}} number of interviewed trespassers considered <b>trespassing</b> to be safe and so many trespassers assumed that <b>trespassing</b> is legal, it is worth considering information campaigns to raise awareness of the illegality of <b>trespassing</b> and the dangers related to it as one form of preventing <b>trespassing.</b> Finnish Rail Agency is participating in the Operation Lifesaver, which is a non-profit, international, public education programme (originally from the United States) to prevent collisions, deaths and injuries at highway-rail grade crossings and on railroad rights-of-way [11]. Therefore, the support of Operation Lifesaver should be considered when campaigning to prevent <b>trespassing.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Trespass</b> to land is {{any direct}} {{interference}} with {{land in the}} possession of another and is actionable per se. Examples of <b>trespass</b> are unauthorised entry to land, placing things on land and inducing animals to enter. Also, continuing <b>trespass,</b> which is actionable from day to day, occurs when there is continuation of presence after permission is withdrawn. The position taken with regards to the elements of <b>trespass</b> is similar in the UK and India.|$|R
25|$|Tournament {{organiser}} Danny Jordaan dismissed {{concerns that}} {{the attack on the}} Togo national team which took place in Angola in January 2010, had any relevance to the security arrangements for the World Cup. There were also reports of thefts against visitors to the country for the World Cup. Tourists from China, Portugal, Spain, South Korea, Japan and Colombia had become victims of crime. On 19 June after the match between England and Algeria, a fan was able to break through the FIFA-appointed security staff at Green Point stadium and gain access to the England team dressing room.

25|$|The {{first version}} of the Patriot Act was {{introduced}} into the House on October 2, 2001 as the Provide Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (PATRIOT) Act of 2001, and was later passed by the House as the Uniting and Strengthening America (USA) Act (H.R. 2975) on October 12. This {{was based on the}} afore-mentioned Anti-Terrorism Act, but had been changed after negotiations and work between Attorney General Ashcroft, Senators Leahy, Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), Bob Graham, Trent Lott (R-MS) and Orrin Hatch. It was introduced into the Senate as the USA Act of 2001 (S. 1510) by Tom Daschle (D-SD) where Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) proposed a number of amendments, none of which were passed. Feingold amended the provision relating to interception of computer <b>trespasser</b> communications, limited the roving wiretap authority under FISA and modified the provisions relating to access to business records under FISA. The USA Act was later vitiated and indefinitely postponed, because the Senate and House bills could not be reconciled in time.|$|E
500|$|Glure {{tries to}} {{encourage}} the Master to support the [...] "war effort" [...] by killing his non-utilitarian animals, including his dogs. The Master quickly points out that Glure himself did not [...] "sacrifice" [...] his dogs but lost them to distemper. Pointing out that Lad had just chased off a <b>trespasser</b> from the Place, he fiercely argues that his dogs are his home's best protection. A few days later during a livestock show, Lad attacks Glure's new groom, recognizing him as the <b>trespasser</b> he chased away earlier. Lad's attack frees a vicious bull, which goes into homicidal rage. Lad abandons his attack of the groom {{to protect him from}} the bull. The bull chases Lad over the river and consequently gets stuck in the mud. The Master quickly determines why Lad attacked the man and Glure grudgingly thanks them.|$|E
50|$|In its {{submission}} to the Burns Inquiry, the League Against Cruel Sports presented evidence of over 1,000 cases of <b>trespass</b> by hunts. These included <b>trespass</b> on railway lines and into private gardens. <b>Trespass</b> can occur as the hounds cannot recognise human-created boundaries {{they are not}} allowed to cross, and may therefore follow their quarry wherever it goes unless successfully called off. However, in the United Kingdom, <b>trespass</b> is a largely civil matter when performed accidentally.|$|R
