50|$|Simlipal National Park is a {{protected}} wildlife area and tiger reserve spread over 2750 km2 {{of the northern}} part of Mayurbhanj district. It has 1078 species of plants, including 94 orchids. The sal tree is the primary tree species there. The park has 55 mammals, including barking deer, Bengal tiger, common langur, four-horned antelope, Indian bison, Indian elephant, Indian giant squirrel, Indian leopard, jungle cat, sambar deer, and wild boar. There are 304 species of birds in the park, such as the common hill myna, grey hornbill, Indian pied hornbill and Malabar pied hornbill. It also has 60 species of reptiles, notable among which are the king cobra and <b>tricarinate</b> <b>hill</b> <b>turtle.</b> There is also a mugger crocodile breeding program in nearby Ramtirtha.The Chandaka Elephant Sanctuary is a 190 km2 protected area near the capital city, Bhubaneswar. However, urban expansion and over-grazing have reduced the forests and are driving herds of elephants to migration. In 2002, there were about 80 elephants. But by 2012, their numbers had been reduced to 20. Many of the animals have migrated toward the Barbara reserve forest, Chilika, Nayagarh district, and Athagad. Some elephants have died in conflicts with villagers, while some have died during migration from being electrocuted by power lines or hit by trains. Outside the protected area, they are killed by poachers. Besides elephants, the sanctuary also has Indian leopards, jungle cats and chitals.|$|E

25|$|This {{exhibit is}} {{primarily}} a herpetarium for the zoo's Komodo dragons, Jantan who arrived from Prague Zoo and three juvenile dragons called Sathi, Lara and Mia who came from Colchester zoo in 2014 and Mezcal, a young female who arrived from Los Angeles Zoo, originating from the Lesser Sunda Islands. It was opened in 1998 and extended in 2003 to include an outdoor enclosure used by the dragons in the warmer summer months. The exhibit is built {{on the site of}} the zoo's former bird house. In 2007, several young baby Komodo dragons were put on display after one of the zoo's two females laid eggs which hatched although the female had not been mated; this is parthenogenesis, the first such case recorded in this species. The exhibit was revamped in 2009 to house Caribbean iguanas in one section of the building.

50|$|The bridge extends 1.6 {{kilometers}} (1 mile) from <b>Turtle</b> <b>Hill</b> in Hanyang, on {{the northern}} bank of the Yangtze, to Snake Hill in Wuchang, on the southern bank of the Yangtze. Plans for the bridge's construction were first made in 1910. A total of four exploratory surveys were made between 1913 and 1948 to identify a suitable site, but economic limitations and the combination of World War II and the Chinese Civil War prevented the bridge's building until the 1950s. Actual construction began in September 1955 and was completed in October 1957.|$|R
50|$|The {{summit of}} <b>Turtle</b> <b>Hill</b> rises to about 666 ft.

You see, Billy thought that he was so far ahead that he might just as well take it easy, and that was what he was doing. Spotty the Turtle didn't waken him. He just kept right on going the same slow way he had come all day, and so, just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was going to bed behind the Purple <b>Hills,</b> Spotty the <b>Turtle</b> found the cause of the trouble in the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower was}} built on <b>Turtle</b> <b>Hill</b> 300 ft {{from the edge of}} the cliff; due to the {{cumulative}} effects of shoreline erosion, it is now 100 ft away from the edge. After World War II, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a seawall at its base, but the erosion continued. The Coast Guard considered tearing down the lighthouse in 1967 and replacing it with a steel tower further {{from the edge of the}} bluff. In the wake of protests over the announced dismantling of the tower, Congressman Michael Forbes proposed a bill to the United States Congress to hand over the Lighthouse to the Montauk Historical Society from the Public so it could be preserved; the bill was passed.|$|R
60|$|The {{eastern end}} of Long Island, the Peconic bay region, I knew quite well too--sail'd more than once around Shelter island, and down to Montauk--spent many an hour on <b>Turtle</b> <b>hill</b> by the old light-house, on the extreme point, {{looking out over the}} ceaseless roll of the Atlantic. I used to like to go down there and fraternize with the blue-fishers, or the annual squads of sea-bass takers. Sometimes, along Montauk peninsula, (it is some 15 miles long, and good grazing,) met the strange, unkempt, half-barbarous herdsmen, at that time living there entirely aloof from society or civilization, in charge, on those rich pasturages, of vast droves of horses, kine or sheep, own'd by farmers of the eastern towns. Sometimes, too, the few {{remaining}} Indians, or half-breeds, at that period left on Montauk peninsula, but now I believe altogether extinct.|$|R
50|$|The EEF did {{not make}} another attempt to take Gaza until November, after months of preparation. As part of the {{operation}} to clear the Gaza-Beersheba Line (the Third Battle of Gaza, 27 October-7 November), 54th Division attacked directly towards the town on 2 November. It was a holding attack but the leading brigades made such good progress that 162nd Bde was able to pass through by 06.00 {{to move on to}} the final objective, Sheikh Hasan, which it secured after a 15-minute bombardment. The attack was continued on 7 November, with 162nd Bde heading towards <b>Turtle</b> <b>Hill,</b> north west of Gaza town. Supported by powerful artillery, the infantry walked through the defences to find that the Turks had evacuated Gaza. The EEF pursued the defeated Turks back to the Jaffa-Jerusalem defence line, and Jerusalem fell on 7 December.|$|R
500|$|Lion Trench, [...] {{north-east}} of Sheikh Hasan, {{was attacked}} at 07:30 by the 1/4th Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment (162nd Brigade) {{with the objective}} of clearing a gap through which the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade could advance. However, 20 minutes after their successful attack, the Northamptonshire without artillery support were almost surrounded and forced to retreat to Sheikh Hasan on the coast. Here a strong counterattack was threatened by two regiments of reinforcements from the Ottoman 7th Division, which were advancing from Deir Sneid to the north and north-east. (See Falls Map 6 Coastal sector) These Ottoman reinforcements were stopped by accurate shelling by the Corps Heavy Artillery, which fired on a [...] line previously registered and by shelling from the monitors off the coast. A planned repeat of the Lion Trench attack was postponed when the 1/4th Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment attacked Yunis Trench instead. Although they captured the trench they were driven back by a counterattack. Throughout the remainder of the day, Ottoman heavy batteries shelled Sheikh Hasan, before the batteries were withdrawn during the night to the north-east of Gaza. During the night of 2/3 November, Ottoman troops strengthened their defences on <b>Turtle</b> <b>Hill,</b> facing Sheikh Hasan.|$|R
500|$|The EEF's {{occupation}} of Gaza was not strongly resisted {{and a general}} advance during the morning of 7 November found the town abandoned. [...] Orders for an attack at 04:50 by the 75th Division on Outpost Hill {{on the eastern side}} of Gaza had been issued; these were expanded to include Middlesex Hill and a 54th (East Anglian) Division attack on the Belah and Yunis trenches, and <b>Turtle</b> <b>Hill</b> in the coastal sector. However, by 04:35, two battalions each from the 161st and the 162nd Brigades (54th Division) supported by artillery had already advanced to occupy Lion and Tiger Trenches and Sheikh Redwan in the coastal sector to the north-north-west of Gaza. The advance by the 162nd Brigade took them through [...] "the gardens and fields of Gaza to the main road northwards", when patrols sent into the city found it deserted. British artillery had destroyed all the homes, of the 40,000 people who had lived in Gaza before the war. The 54th (East Anglian) Division subsequently took up a line stretching from the Jaffa road north of Sheikh Redwan to the Mediterranean sea.|$|R

50|$|Paint Creek {{originates}} {{in a small}} marsh south of Ellsworth Road in Pittsfield Township. It runs parallel to Ellsworth Road going east, turns north and enters a culvert under Ellsworth Road, exiting the culvert into Montibeller Park. From Montibeller Park, it enters a culvert near the intersection of Cole Boulevard and Hillside Drive, and exits the culvert east of the intersection of Golfside Road and Packard Street, entering a golfcourse where its channel has been artificially widened into a pond. After exiting this pond the creek enters another culvert in {{the northeast corner of}} the golfcourse, flowing east along Packard Street, turning south along Hewitt Road, turns back East to flow roughly parallel to Valley Drive, before turning south to Congress Road east of Hewitt Road, where it exits the second culvert. Paint Creek continues roughly south parallel to Stevens Drive, then turning southeast to go under Michigan Avenue north east of Michigan Avenue's intersection with Ellsworth Road. Paint Creek continues southeast crossing under Interstate 94 after which it roughly follows Huron Street south, turning southeast under Stony Creek Road toward Whittaker Road, which it follows west of. Near the intersection of Whittaker Road and Merrit Road Paint Creek turns east crossing under Whittaker, before continuing following Whittaker before turning more southeast and crossing under Martz Road, after which it turns dead south following <b>Turtle</b> <b>Hill</b> Road, all the way to its mouth where it discharges into Stony Creek.|$|R
