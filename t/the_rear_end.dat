5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all drivers {{at the front of the}} grid got away without {{incident}} and with no changes in position. On the outside of turn three, Nico Hülkenberg was able to get around Pastor Maldonado for sixth position. Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa, who both started from <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the grid, made up places early in the race, running in twelfth and thirteenth by lap 9, when Vettel came into the pit lane for his first stop. The pit stop did not go well, as his car was stationary for about six seconds. Massa in turn went past Marcus Ericsson for eleventh two laps later in a wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre through turns one and two. Meanwhile, at the front, Lewis Hamilton had built a sufficient gap to second-placed Rosberg to deny Rosberg the chance to use DRS and try to overtake.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E

5|$|The P90 uses {{a unique}} {{horizontally}} mounted feeding system—patented in the United States—that {{contributes to the}} weapon's compact profile and unusual appearance. U.S. Patent 4,905,394 ("Top mounted longitudinal magazine") was awarded in 1990, naming René Predazzer as the sole inventor. The detachable box magazine is mounted parallel to the P90's barrel, fitting flush with {{the top of the}} weapon's frame, and it contains 50 rounds of ammunition which lie in two rows facing left, offset 90° from the bore axis. As the cartridges are pushed back by spring pressure and arrive at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the magazine, they are fed as a single row into a spiral feed ramp and rotated 90 degrees, aligning them with the chamber. The magazine body is composed of polymer, and it is semi-transparent to allow the shooter to see the amount of ammunition remaining at any time.|$|E
5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the larva grows, more material is added at the front, and the larva can turn round in the tube and trim <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} propels itself {{underwater}} by moving <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of its body, including its tail and hind feet, up and down, and {{is capable of}} speeds of up to 9km/h (5.6mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times {{greater than that of}} similar-sized land mammals – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.|$|E

5|$|The {{unfolding}} events {{seemed to}} {{have a negative impact on}} the cohesion between U.S. and South Vietnamese indigenous forces. The resolve of the South Vietnamese, Montagnard CIDG soldiers in particular, had apparently been shaken and they disobeyed an order to carry out a sweep operation at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the camp, and their Vietnamese commander even refused to leave his bunker to encourage the soldiers. The morale and discipline of the indigenous forces had sunk so low that they began to leave their defensive positions without permission, although their section of the camp was never subjected to a major ground attack. Consequently, the behavior of indigenous CIDG soldiers during the various stages of the battle, coupled with information that 'friendly' Montagnard soldiers had turned on U.S. Marines at Ngok Tavak, had the effect of unnerving U.S. Army soldiers in Khâm Đức. To ensure CIDG soldiers would not abandon their posts, U.S. soldiers threatened to shoot anyone attempting to run away.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Lucas di Grassi {{challenged}} Jarno Trulli for the lead, but Trulli closed the racing line into turn one. As Trulli lost <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of the car going into turn three, di Grassi took the lead. The other Audi Sport Abt of Daniel Abt was less fortunate, being sent into a spin at the same corner, dropping {{to the back of the}} field. Nelson Piquet, Jr. immediately made up for ground lost in qualifying, gaining three positions during the first lap, running in tenth place. At turn six on the following lap, he went past Stéphane Sarrazin (Venturi) for ninth. While di Grassi built an early lead, several manoeuvres were made behind him, with Nicolas Prost (e.dams-Renault) losing two positions to Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Dragon Racing) and Vitantonio Liuzzi (Trulli GP), dropping back to seventh. Pole sitter Jarno Trulli looked to be in trouble with his car and lost positions continuously, running in thirteenth after lap twelve. Third placed Nick Heidfeld was also unable to hold onto his podium position, being overtaken by d'Ambrosio on lap thirteen.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{began to}} pull away {{from the rest of the}} field. Trulli made a pit stop for a {{replacement}} nose cone at the start of the second lap after another car made contact with <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of his car and his front wing was removed. Webber battled Hülkenberg for eighth position but was unable to overtake the latter. Trulli made a second pit stop on the fifth lap to allow his mechanics to rectify a problem with his car's gearbox and turned off his engine to allow for repairs to occur. Vettel set a fastest lap of the race on lap five, a 1:43.055, and was three seconds ahead of Hamilton, who in turn was being caught by Alonso. It was reported by Red Bull on the following lap that eighth-placed Webber had no mechanical issues. Webber made an early pit stop on lap seven for the medium compound tyres but his crew had a minor problem fitting his left-front wheel which meant he was stationary for 7.9 seconds, and rejoined in 18th position. Rosberg made a similar stop on the next lap but he overshot his pit stall and rejoined in 19th place.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Hamilton set the fastest lap {{of the day}} at one minute and 35.078 seconds; Rosberg was second, and Bottas third. Button was fourth-fastest, ahead of Vettel and Räikkönen. Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo followed in the top ten. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an oversteer sent him into the turn-18 barrier. Kobayashi lost control of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, and Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban Gutiérrez later lost control of his Sauber entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14, which brought out a second red flag; the session ended early, due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at one minute and 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Massa was fourth-fastest; Bottas was fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Magnussen was seventh, Vergne eighth, Kvyat ninth and Button completed the top ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto the run-off area and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car. Although Gutiérrez lost control of his car's rear end leaving turn 15, he avoided crashing into the wall.|$|E

50|$|Taking {{a design}} {{lead from the}} US parent, a well overdue new 10/12/15 cwt range was {{therefore}} decided upon, {{to be of the}} forward control type all based on the same 'outrigger' chassis. With regard to this 'outrigger chassis', Cab and chassis windscreen variants, (subsequently described as 'open' back) differed from the van, estate car, and express bus body models, (subsequently described as 'closed' back) models by the addition of an extra rear crossmember to support the spare wheel carrier and to close <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> chassis horns. On the 'closed' back models the nature of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> bodywork meant <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> crossmember could be omitted for this purpose.|$|R
