5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he thought there was good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E

5|$|Other Marxists, such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner, {{have argued}} that Childe's archaeological work should not {{correctly}} be considered Marxist because he failed {{to take into account}} the existence of class struggle as an instrument of social change, something which was a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor he considered in his archaeological work, Childe did accept that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, and that most of his contemporaries were producing studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe also diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. Furthermore, he denied Marxism's ability <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> development of human society, and did not consider humanity's development into pure communism to be inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{recorded}} history of Mars observation {{dates back to}} the era of the ancient Egyptian astronomers in the 2nd millennium BCE. Chinese records about the motions of Mars appeared before the founding of the Zhou Dynasty (1045 BCE). Detailed observations of the position of Mars were made by Babylonian astronomers who developed arithmetic techniques <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> position of the planet. The ancient Greek philosophers and Hellenistic astronomers developed a geocentric model to explain the planet's motions. Measurements of Mars' angular diameter can be found in ancient Greek and Indian texts. In the 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model for the Solar System in which the planets follow circular orbits about the Sun. This was revised by Johannes Kepler, yielding an elliptic orbit for Mars that more accurately fitted the observational data.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Peace of Nisibis, Diocletian and Galerius returned to Syrian Antioch. At some time in 299, the emperors took part in a ceremony of sacrifice and divination in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> The haruspices were unable to read the entrails of the sacrificed animals and blamed Christians in the Imperial household. The emperors ordered all members of the court to perform a sacrifice to purify the palace. The emperors sent letters to the military command, demanding the entire army perform the required sacrifices or face discharge. Diocletian was conservative in matters of religion, a man faithful to the traditional Roman pantheon and understanding of demands for religious purification, but Eusebius, Lactantius and Constantine state that it was Galerius, not Diocletian, who was the prime supporter of the purge, and its greatest beneficiary. Galerius, even more devoted and passionate than Diocletian, saw political advantage in the politics of persecution. He was willing to break with a government policy of inaction on the issue.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Persian wars in 299, co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius traveled from Persia to Syrian Antioch (Antakya). The Christian rhetor Lactantius records that, at Antioch some time in 299, the emperors were engaged in sacrifice and divination in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> The haruspices, diviners of omens from sacrificed animals, were unable to read the sacrificed animals and failed to do so after repeated trials. The master haruspex eventually declared that this failure was the result of interruptions in the process caused by profane men. Certain Christians in the imperial household had been observed making {{the sign of the cross}} during the ceremonies and were alleged to have disrupted the haruspices divination. Diocletian, enraged by this turn of events, declared that all members of the court must make a sacrifice themselves. Diocletian and Galerius also sent letters to the military command, demanding that the entire army perform the sacrifices or else face discharge. Since there are no reports of bloodshed in Lactantius's narrative, Christians in the imperial household must have survived the event.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Many {{theories}} in cognitive psychology assume that per-ception and action systems are clearly {{separated from the}} cognitive system. Other theories suggest that important cognitive functions re-side in the interactions between these systems. One consequence of the latter claim is that the action system may contribute <b>to</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> consequences of currently perceived actions. In particular, such predictions might be more accurate when one observes one’s own ac-tions than when one observes another person’s actions, because in the former case the system that plans the action is the same system that contributes <b>to</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> action’s effects. In the present study, par-ticipants (N 104) watched video clips displaying either themselves or somebody else throwing a dart at a target board and <b>predicted</b> <b>the</b> dart’s landing position.

25|$|Pirogue racing has {{traditionally}} been the most important sport among the Duala. The sport reached its peak during the German colonial period, when organisers held races annually on 27 January (the Kaiser's birthday). Under the French, they became semiannual, occurring on 14 July (Bastille Day) and 11 November (Armistice Day). A typical Duala racing pirogue is 20–28 metres long with no keel and a bow carved with intricate designs. A team of 40-50 canoeists, mostly men who make their livings as fishermen, mans each vessel.

25|$|For signal processing, the Wiener filter is {{a filter}} {{proposed}} by Wiener during the 1940s {{and published in}} 1942 as a classified document. Its purpose {{is to reduce the}} amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimation of the desired noiseless signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. It is necessary <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> because by the time the shell reaches the vicinity of the target, the target has moved, and maybe has changed direction slightly. They even modeled the muscle response of the pilot, which led eventually to cybernetics. The unmanned V1's were particularly easy to model, and on a good day, American guns fitted with Wiener filters would shoot down 99 out of 100 V1's as they entered Britain from the English channel, on their way to London. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality---a theory for predicting the future as best as one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that didn't strictly speaking predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener's earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms.|$|E
