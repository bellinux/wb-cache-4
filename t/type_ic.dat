The cortical collecting duct (CCD) mediates net secretion or reabsorption of protons according to systemic acid/base status. Using indirect immunofluorescence, {{we examined the}} localization and abundance of the vacuolar H+-ATPase and the AE 1 {{anion exchanger}} in intercalated cells (IC) of rat kidney connecting segment (CNT) and CCD during acute (6 hr) metabolic (NH 4 Cl) acidosis and respiratory (NaHCO 3) alkalosis. AE 1 immunostaining intensity quantified by confocal microscopy was elevated in metabolic acidosis and substantially reduced in metabolic alkalosis. AE 1 immunostaining was restricted to <b>Type</b> A <b>IC</b> in all conditions, and the fraction of AE 1 + IC was unchanged in CNT and CCD. Metabolic acidosis was accompanied by redistribution of H+-ATPase immunostaining towards the apical surface of IC, and metabolic alkalosis was accompanied by H+-ATPase redistribution towards the basal surface of IC. Therefore, acute metabolic acidosis produced changes consistent with increased activity of <b>Type</b> A <b>IC</b> and decreased activity of <b>Type</b> B <b>IC,</b> whereas acute metabolic alkalosis produced changes corresponding to increased activity of <b>Type</b> B <b>IC</b> and decreased activity of <b>Type</b> A <b>IC.</b> These data demonstrate that acute systemic acidosis and alkalosis modulate the cellular distribution of two key transporters involved in proton secretion in the distal nephron...|$|R
5|$|The NGC 4038 Group is a {{group of}} galaxies across Corvus and Crater. The group may contain between 13 and 27 galaxies. The best-known member is the Antennae {{peculiar}} galaxy, located 0.25 north of 31 Crateris. It consists of two interacting galaxies—NGC 4038 and 4039—that appear to have a heart shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies' original rotation. Both original galaxies were spiral galaxies and are now experiencing extensive star formation due to the interaction of gas clouds. The galaxies are 45 million light-years from Earth and each has multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting binary stars or intermediate-mass black holes. The Antennae Galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude. SN 2004gt was a <b>type</b> <b>Ic</b> supernova that erupted on December 12, 2004. The progenitor was not identified from older images of the galaxy, and is either a type WC Wolf–Rayet star with a mass over 40 times that of the Sun, or a star 20 to 40 times as massive as the Sun in a binary star system. SN 2007sr was a Type Ia supernova event that peaked in brightness on December 14, 2007. The galaxy has been identified as a good place to take detailed images in case of further supernovae.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{nucleosynthesis}} process {{arrives at}} iron-56, {{the continuation of}} this process consumes energy (the addition of fragments to nuclei releases less energy than required to break them off the parent nuclei). If {{the mass of the}} core exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, electron degeneracy pressure will be unable to support its weight against the force of gravity, and the core will undergo sudden, catastrophic collapse to form a neutron star or (in the case of cores that exceed the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit), a black hole. Through a process that is not completely understood, some of the gravitational potential energy released by this core collapse is converted into a Type Ib, <b>Type</b> <b>Ic,</b> or Type II supernova. It is known that the core collapse produces a massive surge of neutrinos, as observed with supernova SN 1987A. The extremely energetic neutrinos fragment some nuclei; some of their energy is consumed in releasing nucleons, including neutrons, and some of their energy is transformed into heat and kinetic energy, thus augmenting the shock wave started by rebound of some of the infalling material from the collapse of the core. Electron capture in very dense parts of the infalling matter may produce additional neutrons. Because some of the rebounding matter is bombarded by the neutrons, some of its nuclei capture them, creating a spectrum of heavier-than-iron material including the radioactive elements up to (and likely beyond) uranium. Although non-exploding red giants can produce significant quantities of elements heavier than iron using neutrons released in side reactions of earlier nuclear reactions, the abundance of elements heavier than iron (and in particular, of certain isotopes of elements that have multiple stable or long-lived isotopes) produced in such reactions is quite different from that produced in a supernova. Neither abundance alone matches that found in the Solar System, so both supernovae and ejection of elements from red giants are required to explain the observed abundance of heavy elements and isotopes thereof.|$|E

Our objective was to standardize the surgical approach for IC complicating aortic reconstruction. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting General surgery, vascular surgery, anesthesiology, and critical care units in a university-affiliated hospital. Methods From January 5, 1997, to December 15, 2003, 49 cases of IC complicating aortic reconstruction were diagnosed (rate, 2. 7 %). Nonoperative management was used for patients with type 1 or type 2 without multiple organ failure (MOF). All patients with type 3 or with type 2 with MOF underwent urgent resection of the ischemic colon without anastomosis. Results: Immediate surgery was performed on 24 patients (49. 0 %). Nineteen (76. 0 %) of 25 patients without MOF and with transient endoscopic findings underwent secondary surgery for progression to final <b>IC</b> <b>type</b> 3 (16 patients) or to final <b>IC</b> <b>type</b> 2 with MOF (3 patients). Twenty-three (53. 5 %) of 43 patients died after colorectal resection (overall mortality, 46. 9 %). Factors causing significant risk of death were surgery, MOF, final <b>IC</b> <b>type,</b> and amount of perioperative transfusion.

500|$|TypeIb and Ic light curves are {{basically}} similar to TypeIa although {{with a lower}} average peak luminosity. [...] The visual light output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation, {{but there is a}} much lower mass of the created nickel-56. The peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional Type Ib/c supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm. [...] The most luminous <b>Type</b> <b>Ic</b> supernovae are referred to as hypernovae and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity. [...] The source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole, which also produce gamma-ray bursts.|$|E
500|$|Because {{their energy}} is {{strongly}} focused, the gamma rays emitted by most bursts {{are expected to}} miss the Earth and never be detected. When a gamma-ray burst is pointed towards Earth, the focusing of its energy along a relatively narrow beam causes the burst to appear much brighter {{than it would have}} been were its energy emitted spherically. When this effect is taken into account, typical gamma-ray bursts are observed to have a true energy release of about 1044J, or about 1/2000 of a Solar mass (...) energy equivalent—which is still many times the mass-energy equivalent of the Earth (about 5.5×1041J). This is comparable to the energy released in a bright type Ib/c supernova and within the range of theoretical models. Very bright supernovae have been observed to accompany several of the nearest GRBs. Additional support for focusing of the output of GRBs has come from observations of strong asymmetries in the spectra of nearby <b>type</b> <b>Ic</b> supernova and from radio observations taken long after bursts when their jets are no longer relativistic.|$|E

40|$|We {{reported}} previously that angiotensin II (AngII) increases net Cl− absorption in mouse cortical collecting duct (CCD) by transcellular transport across type B intercalated cells (IC) via an H+-ATPase–and pendrin-dependent mechanism. Because intracellular trafficking regulates both pendrin and H+-ATPase, {{we hypothesized}} that AngII induces the subcellular redistribution of {{one or both of}} these exchangers. To answer this question, CCD from furosemide-treated mice were perfused in vitro, and the subcellular distributions of pendrin and the H+-ATPase were quantified using immunogold cytochemistry and morphometric analysis. Addition of AngII in vitro did not change the distribution of pendrin or H+-ATPase within <b>type</b> B <b>IC</b> but within <b>type</b> A <b>IC</b> increased the ratio of apical plasma membrane to cytoplasmic H+-ATPase three-fold. Moreover, CCDs secreted bicarbonate under basal conditions but absorbed bicarbonate in response to AngII.
