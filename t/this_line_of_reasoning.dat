5|$|Events in {{the world}} {{appeared}} to play into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War and the Austro-Turkish War); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War). At first, King Poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain Russian support for the reforms; they attempted to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans {{as an opportunity to}} strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. <b>This</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. With the new Polish-Prussian alliance seeming to provide security against Russian intervention, King Poniatowski drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. This alliance was also helped as the 1790 elections were more supportive of the royal faction then Potocki's; and the conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten the reformers if they were to stay divided. With the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, Potocki and Poniatowski begun to reach a consensus on a more constitutional monarchy approach, and started to draft a constitutional document.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} and practical {{implementation of the}} Value-at-Risk (VaR) criterion is an active and exciting area of research, with numerous recent contributions. This research has almost exclusively been concerned with the accuracy of various estimation techniques and risk measures. Compared to the statistical approach, the financial economic analysis of VaR has been relatively neglected. Guthoff, Pfingsten and Wolf (1996) consider the ranking of projects and traditional performance criteria, while Kupiec and O’Brien (1997) and Steinherr (1998) discuss incentive compatible regulation schemes. The wider issue of the benefits for society of VaR based risk management and supervision has hardly been addressed, see however Danielsson, Jorgensen and de Vries (1999 b) and Danielsson, Jorgensen and de Vries (1999 a).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} history of the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, which lowered the minimum voting age in federal and state elections from twenty-one to eighteen. Drawing on a close reading of Congressional documents about the minimum voting age, I offer a typology of the various arguments that were offered for and against a lower voting age between 1942, when the issue first surfaced on the national agenda, and 1971, when the amendment was ratified. I maintain that the rationales behind eighteen-year-old voting were more varied and complicated than has been generally acknowledged. Commentators have tended to emphasize arguments about synchronizing the minimum draft and voting ages; while <b>this</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> was undoubtedly a crucial part of the voting age debates, the rhetorical power of the soldier-voter link was limited in some important ways. Beyond the military service angle, advocates of eighteen-year-old voting also asserted, especially during the 1950 s and early 1960 s, that the voting age should be reduced because contemporary young people were far better educated and politically aware than previous generations had been. Later, during the late 1960 s, the idea that eighteen-year-old voting would channel young people’s rising discontent and undermine campus demonstrations gained considerable momentum in the halls of Congress. Finally, advocates made both philosophical and legal arguments that the situation of eighteen- to twenty-year-olds was analogous to that of women and African-Americans in earlier eras. This work seeks not only to deepen our understanding of {{the history of}} the Twenty-sixth Amendment, but also to illuminate the nature of political debate. Eighteen-year-old voting might have been a narrow goal, but the issue nevertheless prompted a lengthy process of justification in which both sides struggled to respond to immediate political events and trends while also wrestling with the inevitable theoretical questions that surfaced in the course of debate. The voting age debates offer a window into this process of political deliberation, which lies at the heart of politics itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{relationship}} between economic deve/opment and popu/ation gravvth has frequently been treated -especially in the last two decades- {{from the point of view}} of value judgments which postulate a marked incompatibility between the two variables, in such a way that birth control appears to be justified. Myrdal, more than anyone perhaps, has formulated this pessimistic postulate in a very complete manner. Nelson has also followed <b>this</b> same <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning,</b> expressing in a highly technical manner the supposed dichotomy between the two variables in his well-known Theory 01 the Low-/eve/ Equilibrium Trap.

At the same time, basing himself in Keynes, the author offers an outline which purports to solve the stated problem. This implies, logically, a new axiomatic approach -which is very much in accordance with the results achieved by Sauvy, Livi, Gonnard, Hirschmann, and Hansen- according. to which true economic development is impossible without population growth.

40|$|This Chapter {{addresses}} the uncertainty and the still unclear judicial standards for assessing contributory trademark infringement in the United States. The Chapter proceeds as follows. Part II outlines the {{developments of the}} doctrine of contributory trademark infringement, first in the brick-and-mortar world and subsequently in the online context. Based upon this analysis, Part III criticizes the uncertainty that surrounds the application of the judicial standards to determine contributory infringement, particularly in the online market place. Part III also attempts to provide some explanations for the current judicial decisions and highlights that courts seem to apply a “we know it when we see it” standard to identify contributory trademark infringers. Notably, Part III states that courts seem to distinguish between intermediaries who acted in “good faith” and who are generally not held liable for contributory infringement, and intermediaries who acted in “bad faith” and profited from the infringement, and who are held liable for contributory infringement. Part III concludes that although <b>this</b> judicial <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> may prevent broader liability for “good” intermediaries, all intermediaries and legal operators would benefit from a clearer interpretation of the current standards in this important area of trademark law...|$|R
40|$|While it {{may remain}} {{difficult}} for the student of modernity to understand the weight of Paley’s teleological arguments for nineteenth century British scientists, {{the idea of a}} design in nature and the implication of a designer nevertheless provided lasting explanatory power amongst competing hypotheses until up to Darwin. As Richard Dawkins points out, it was reasonable for English scientists to maintain telic 'causes' in the explanation of biological origins until the observations of Paley were ascribed to a natural mechanism as evidenced by Charles Darwin. When viewed in the light of contemporary debates on the possibility of evolution by natural selection in opposition to purposeful intervention, it is useful, then, to understand clearly why not long ago scientists moved away from <b>this</b> very <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> to accepting the Darwinian picture of “descent with modification” by natural selection.

25|$|Against the new calendar, the {{argument}} is made that inasmuch {{as the use of}} the Julian calendar was implicit in the decision of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea (325), no authority less than an Ecumenical Council may change this decision. However, the fact is that that Council made no decision or decree at all concerning the Julian calendar. Its silence constituted an implicit acceptance not of the Julian calendar, but of the civil calendar, which happened to be, at that time, the Julian calendar (the explicit decision of Nicaea being concerned, rather, with the date of Easter). By virtue of this, defenders of the new calendar argue that no decision by an Ecumenical Council was or is necessary today in order to revise (not abandon) the Julian calendar; and further, that by making the revision, the Church stays with the spirit of Nicaea I by keeping with the civil calendar in all its essentials—while conversely, failure to keep with the civil calendar could be seen as a departure from the spirit of Nicaea I in this respect. Lastly, it is argued that since the adoption of the new calendar evidently involves no change in or departure from the theological or the ethical teachings of Orthodox Christianity, but rather amounts to a merely disciplinary or administrative change—a clock correction of sorts—the authority to enact that change falls within the competency of contemporary, local episcopal authority. Implicit acceptance of <b>this</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning,</b> or something very close to it, underlies the decision to adopt the new calendar by those Orthodox churches which have done so.|$|E

The shift from predicting effects to being responsive to societal concerns also explains why public participation or public engagement is considered an essential part of Responsible Innovation. A central role for the public is also prescribed by the ideal of a deliberative democracy, as set out, for instance, in Habermas’s discourse ethics.

30|$|In <b>this</b> {{functional}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning,</b> the informational {{dimension is}} most prominent and {{often seen as}} providing the grounds for other functional considerations. As far as TA is concerned, it provides {{the rationale for the}} whole enterprise. Seen the other way round, participation was justified as part of an ideal concept and methodology of TA. In the German discussion, participation is one of five basic elements of the concept of a “comprehensive TA” (Paschen and Petermann 1991 : 26 – 30). Apart from such conceptual and methodological justifications, participation is sometimes presented as an instrument of information distribution or information collection, that is, it can help gaining access to the “local” knowledge of potential users or affected groups. As far as the social dimension is concerned, participation can be seen as an instrument of overcoming sceptic and hostile attitudes among certain groups in specific places or the citizenry at large, helping to create public understanding and acceptance. As for the time dimension, there are many calls for early participation of potentially interested, affected or engaged groups, often suggesting that such early inclusion, although costly in time (and money) upon first sight, might actually save time {{at the end of the}} day, if it helps avoiding conflicts usually leading to delays of the original schedule.

2500|$|To {{lower the}} larynx is to {{increase}} the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering formant frequencies so that the voice sounds [...] "deeper"nbsp&— giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself. Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests, falsifying <b>this</b> whole <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning.</b> W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans {{had nothing to do with}} speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.|$|R
