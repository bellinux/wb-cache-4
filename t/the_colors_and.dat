5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> then, burning.|$|E
5|$|On the Coalition side, Mack {{was given}} {{much of the}} credit for Coburg's triumph. Blamed for the defeat, Miranda {{traveled}} to Paris to intrigue against Dumouriez. The Austro-Dutch reported losses of 97 officers, 2,762 rank and file and 779 horses. The French lost 4,000 killed and wounded, plus 1,000 men and 30 artillery pieces captured. General of Brigade Georges Guiscard de Bar was killed and four generals were wounded. Another source estimated Austrian losses as 2,600 killed and wounded and 400 missing while French casualties were 3,000 killed and wounded plus 1,000 missing or prisoners. Immediately after the battle, about 6,000 French volunteers deserted <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> went home. Three days later, Dumouriez's army only numbered about 20,000 troops as the men deserted in hundreds. On 23 March there was a clash at Pellenberg where Coburg with 38,000 soldiers defeated Dumouriez with 22,000. The Austrians sustained 900 casualties while inflicting 2,000 on the French.|$|E

50|$|While early color {{television}} experiments {{were kept in}} the component domain of RGB, most <b>color</b> television broadcasting <b>and</b> post production was compromised in the 1960s and 1970s to simplify infrastructure and transmission by combining <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> luminance (composite).

50|$|When {{the entire}} {{activity}} of the eye is completely qualitatively partitioned, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> its spectrum (afterimage) appear with maximum energy as being vivid, bright, dazzling, and brilliant. If the division is not total, however, part of the retina can remain undivided. A union of the quantitative intensive division with the qualitative division of the retina occurs. If the remainder is active, then <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> its spectrum are lost as they fade into white. If the remainder is inactive, then <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> its spectrum are lost as they darken into black. If the remainder is only partially inactive, then <b>the</b> <b>color</b> loses its energy by mixing with gray.|$|R

The unsharp masking, or sharpening, operation used in image editing software is a high-boost filter, a generalization of high-pass. A high-pass filter, if the imaging software does not provide one, {{can be achieved by}} duplicating the image, applying a Gaussian blur to the dupe, inverting <b>the</b> <b>colors,</b> <b>and</b> blending the images using a low opacity (say 50%) for the dupe.|$|E
25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} finale was to {{take place}} on the hands of Big Ben with Ratigan eventually falling to his demise. However, layout artist Mike Peraza approached Musker with the idea of restaging the final confrontation so the characters would break through the face of the Big Ben with the grinding clockwork gears providing added menace, in which Musker agreed. Pereza and his team was sent to London for video reference and were granted unprecedented access to the clockworks inside Big Ben. Because the bells would chime at every quarter-hour, the team completed their research in one hour. Back at the Feature Animation building, animators Phil Nibbelink and Dave Gielow spent months designing the interior of Big Ben, with each gear produced as wire-frame graphics on a computer that was printed out and traced onto animation cels onto which <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> characters were added.|$|E

25|$|The stains or mineral powder (such as Hematite) are earth {{colors in}} various hues of brown, black, green, and blue. These colors are also accented by the {{original}} colors of the clay (red, white, or gray) to provide a further rich texture. After the stain {{is applied to the}} ceramic piece, Al-Zahawi would use a cloth with turpentine to remove some of the stain and reveal the texture of clay and patterns of the rib tool. The stain is then protected by a transparent wax that has limited shine but nevertheless allows <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> shades of the stain and the rich texture to become more pronounced. Al-Zahawi has also experimented with engraving designs on the surface of certain sculptures to bring out a particular area or special form. With staining versus glazing, these engravings are extenuated and truly give the art a unique and exotic feel.|$|E
