5|$|By {{her junior}} year, Rodham became a {{supporter}} of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy. In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty. In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges. A number of her fellow students <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> some day become the first female President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} {{she felt she was}} unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E
25|$|In April 1996 she fell, {{breaking}} her collarbone, {{and four}} months later she had malaria and heart failure. Although Teresa had heart surgery, her health was clearly declining. According to Archbishop of Calcutta Henry Sebastian D'Souza, he ordered a priest to perform an exorcism (with her permission) when she was first hospitalised with cardiac problems because he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be under attack by the devil.|$|E
60|$|Helen {{acknowledged}} his greeting while <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> rapidly. <b>She</b> <b>might</b> just as {{well see}} him and have that inevitable interview done with.|$|R
60|$|She stirred {{her coffee}} absently. At first he <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be offended, for {{she did not}} look up for several moments.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet?"--said his wife, {{encouraging}} him to proceed. If {{she could}} only learn the real truth, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> perhaps yet save him, with assistance from their friends.|$|R
25|$|As Roberts {{drove away}} with Mangum, {{the two women}} began to argue. Roberts pulled over and {{attempted}} to push Mangum out of the car. When that failed, Roberts drove Mangum to a nearby Kroger supermarket, went inside, and told a female security guard that a woman was refusing to leave her car. The guard walked {{to the car and}} asked Mangum to leave, but Mangum remained in the vehicle. The guard said that she did not smell alcohol on Mangum's breath, but <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have been under the influence of other drugs. At 1:22 AM, the guard called 911 to report that Mangum refused to leave the car. Police then arrived, removed Mangum from the car and questioned her.|$|E
25|$|Edith Shain {{wrote to}} Eisenstaedt {{in the late}} 1970s {{claiming}} to be {{the woman in the}} picture. In August 1945, Shain was working at Doctor's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City as a nurse when she and a friend heard on the radio that World War II had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace and kissed her. She related that at the time she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> as well let him kiss her since he fought for her in the war. Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later when she wrote to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut called George Orwell his {{favorite}} writer, and {{admitted that he}} tried to emulate Orwell. [...] "I like his concern for the poor, I like his socialism, I like his simplicity", Vonnegut said. Vonnegut also said that Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, and Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, heavily influenced his debut novel, Player Piano, in 1952. Vonnegut commented that Robert Louis Stevenson's stories were emblems of thoughtfully put together works {{that he tried to}} mimic in his own compositions. Vonnegut also hailed playwright and socialist George Bernard Shaw as [...] "a hero of [...] ", and an [...] "enormous influence." [...] Within his own family, Vonnegut stated that his mother, Edith, had the greatest influence on him. [...] " [...] mother <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> make a new fortune by writing for the slick magazines. She took short-story courses at night. She studied magazines the way gamblers study racing forms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{the brother}} of a marquis, anyway," [...] said Lizzie, who <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> thus best answer {{the mother of a}} Scotch Earl.|$|R
60|$|Now at the <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> bring {{death to}} Rames also, Tua's tears began to gather, {{and her voice}} choked in her throat.|$|R
60|$|I was {{conscious}} of a distinct sense of relief. The <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have told me a falsehood {{had given me a}} sudden stab.|$|R
500|$|Carey plays a fictionalized {{version of}} himself. Drew is an {{assistant}} director of personnel at the Winfred-Lauder department store. Carey explained [...] "I wanted a white-collar job with no authority and a bad boss. Someone {{to do all the}} work and get no credit. He could've worked in a bank, in insurance." [...] Carey said it was [...] "a no-brainer" [...] on settling on the character, saying [...] "It's just me." [...] While Christa Miller was trying out for the role of Drew's close friend Kate O'Brien, ABC <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be too inexperienced for the role and they asked to see her appearance in the Seinfeld episode [...] "The Doodle". The episode had yet to be aired and Miller had to beg the show's co-creator Larry David for a rough cut to show to ABC. Miller went on to secure the role of Kate and Helford considered her to be the only person right for the role.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, who {{reviewed}} the episode for TrekNation in May 2007, <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be more forgiving in hindsight as {{she knows that}} the follow-ups to [...] "Datalore" [...] were great episodes. She thought it was reminiscent of the evil twin of Captain James T. Kirk in [...] episode [...] "" [...] and the mirror universe version of Spock seen in [...] "". She felt that Lore lacked any motivation for what he was intending to do, and that the crew were made to look [...] "pretty stupid" [...] by their inaction to the Lore threat. She thought that the ending was shocking, as transporting the villain into space would never have occurred if they were human, and [...] "a moment of utter inconsistency" [...] as Lore had only just told the entity to attack when the shields drop following a transporter activation. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] valued the episode for providing backstory to Data, but said that [...] "no one is smart enough to realize the obvious. None of the crew except Boy Wesley realizes that Lore is impersonating Data — and when Wesley (who is always somehow more observant than the silly adults) brings this to their attention, we get helpful lines like, [...] "Shut up, Wesley," [...] which lead to even more helpful lines of would-be teenage rebellion when Wesley complains about the officers not listening to him. Quite simply, this is annoying material, continuing in season one's trend of Wesley's child status as a plot device. Meanwhile, all the adults look terminally clueless." [...] He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with People in February 2006, Spears explained that she was anxious to resume her career, saying, [...] "This may sound weird, but I miss traveling. I miss the road, seeing different places and being with the dancers and having fun. That feeling {{of being on the}} stage, knowing it's your best— I love that. I needed a break. I needed to be hungry again." [...] On April 26, 2007, Ivan Kane, the owner of Los Angeles nightclub Forty Deuce, told E! News that Spears had pulled out of a surprise performance at the venue the previous night. Kane stated that during rehearsal, she was [...] "looking very hot, with four backup dancers and [...] sang three songs. They ran through the set several times, the choreography was smokin', and she sounded great." [...] Marc Malkin of E! News said that Spears <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> need more time to prepare. He also reported that she was planning to tour House of Blues venues in the United States. Spears wanted to keep the rehearsals a secret, and did not even inform the owners of the different dance studios the reason for the preparation. In late April 2007, a marquee reading [...] "The M+M's" [...] appeared at the House of Blues in San Diego. Several gossip websites and local media sources identified the act as Spears, prompting the show to quickly sell out. The title, [...] "M+M's" [...] code name was claimed to be Mother (after having two children) and Miss (after being divorced). On May 1, 2007, a front-page story on The San Diego Union-Tribune fueled the speculation. The same day, the doors opened at 19:00 PST (03:00 UTC), and Spears took the stage at 22:00 PST (06:00 UTC). It marked the first time Spears was on stage since her knee injury caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled in June 2004.|$|E
6000|$|What was Madonna {{thinking}} of? If she {{had been}} willing, and able, to utter her <b>thoughts,</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have expressed them thus: [...] "I wonder whether he likes my drawing? Shall I try hard if I can't make it better worth pleasing him? I will! it shall {{be the best thing}} I have ever done. And then, when it is nicely finished, I will take it secretly to Mrs. Blyth to give from me, as my present to Zack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Leave that to me, Ruby. May I {{bring him}} if I can?' Then Ruby {{in a very}} low whisper told Mrs Hurtle, that if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> proper <b>she</b> <b>might</b> bring John Crumb back again. 'And there shall be no more nonsense?' ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Larsson {{stated that he}} <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be looked upon as {{somewhat}} of an unusual kind of sociopath, due to her traumatic life experiences and inability to conform to social norms.|$|R
2500|$|When Stirling {{first saw}} Congress he sailed towards her, {{in the hope}} that she was a {{privateer}} of twenty 9-pounder guns that had been raiding in the area. However, when he got closer and saw that she was significantly stronger even than the privateer he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be, Stirling attempted an escape. However, by 10:30 am the Americans came within range and opened fire with their bow chasers. By 11:00 Congress had closed the distance and her crew engaged with muskets and pistols, to which the British replied with [...] "energy". At this point Captain Geddes observed that his ship was faster than that of the enemy so he maneuvered ahead of Savage until almost abreast, in preparation for a broadside.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her final}} departure, {{numerous}} rumours circulated in the British press predicting the character's {{return to the}} soap. In 2005 {{it was reported that}} EastEnders producers were attempting to lure Gillian Taylforth back with the offer of a £200,000 a year pay cheque. Gillian said: [...] "I've always wanted to go back because I love EastEnders — I have great friends in the cast and always enjoyed working with Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell)." [...] However, in January 2006 it was announced that the character was being killed off-screen in a storyline to facilitate the return of her young son Ben to his father Phil Mitchell. Taylforth has commented: [...] "I was a bit upset at first because it was 13 years of my life and I didn't like the thought of being killed off. I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> come back to see Ian and have some illness. But that's the way it goes." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this the}} courtiers tittered, and, instead of growing angry, as I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might,</b> Irene burst out laughing.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Lavender {{remained}} {{for a moment}} as if transfigured; then entering his garden, he stood gazing up at her window, until the <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> appear there was too much for him, and he went in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Brinsmade," [...] she cried, [...] "mother is dying. You {{have done}} so much for us, sir,--couldn't you come to her for a little while? <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>she</b> <b>might</b> see you once more, she would die happy." [...] The voice was choked by a sob.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> {{indeed that}} <b>she</b> <b>might</b> perhaps borrow money, but there again her paralyzing honesty made her recoil from the {{prospect}} of uncertain repayment. And besides, from whom could she borrow?...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What has she hidden herself for?' demanded Mr. White. 'I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{have been}} here to welcome this---Miss Adeline.' ...|$|E
60|$|She rose suddenly, {{squarely}} confronting him, desperate now, {{driven to}} play the only card upon which she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> count.|$|E

60|$|Therefore it {{was that}} when we {{invested}} our savings in a small sloop-rigged pungy, {{with the idea of}} making a living by fishing, we named her the Avenger, with never a <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> one day do something toward avenging poor Tom's wrongs.|$|R
50|$|Anne is rumoured to have {{attracted}} Henry VIII in 1538 and 1539, and is rumoured {{to have been}} the king's mistress. The ambassadors <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> become his fourth wife in 1540, and again in 1542, just after Queen Catherine Howard was sentenced to death.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has been}} {{staying at the}} farm," [...] Kate answered, [...] "for days. I brought her with me to-night because I <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> know {{something}} about Lord Ronald's disappearance. She is there waiting. If I do not return by daylight, she {{will go to the}} police." ...|$|R

60|$|From this {{exasperating}} sight Il Duca {{glanced at}} Patsy. She {{was holding the}} revolver rigidly extended, and her blue eyes blazed with {{the excitement of the}} moment. It was a wonder she did not pull the trigger inadvertently, and the <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> do so caused the brigand to shudder.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{the girl}} protested almost tearfully. [...] "Of course I {{did not think}} that, but I <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be dark.

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Adam, [...] "but I <b>thought</b> {{it likely}} <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be away, seeing as it's Sunday. But {{the other young}} woman--is she at home, or gone along with Dinah?" ...|$|R
