40|$|This paper defines {{constraint}} <b>search</b> <b>trees,</b> {{a general}} tree data structure for storing and accessing items with constraints as keys. Constraint <b>search</b> <b>trees</b> can mimic binary <b>search</b> <b>trees,</b> radix <b>search</b> <b>trees,</b> k-d trees, R-trees {{and many other}} kinds of <b>search</b> <b>trees.</b> The unifying framework of constraint <b>search</b> <b>trees</b> immediately suggests new kinds of spatial data indexing techniques, as well as showing how to generalize intersection queries in spatial data structures for arbitrary shapes defined by constraints. Constraint <b>search</b> <b>trees</b> provide a data structure for storing sets (or disjunctions) of constraints. Hence they provide a useful data structure for implementing constraint databases.

2500|$|Monte Carlo {{methods have}} been {{developed}} into a technique called Monte-Carlo <b>tree</b> <b>search</b> that is useful for searching for the best move in a game. [...] Possible moves are organized in a search tree {{and a large number}} of random simulations are used to estimate the long-term potential of each move. A black box simulator represents the opponent's moves.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{improvement}} can {{be achieved}} without sacrificing accuracy, by using ordering heuristics to search parts of the tree {{that are likely to}} force alpha–beta cutoffs early. For example, in chess, moves that capture pieces may be examined before moves that do not, or moves that have scored highly in earlier passes through the game-tree analysis may be evaluated before others. Another common, and very cheap, heuristic is the killer heuristic, where the last move that caused a beta-cutoff at the same level in the <b>tree</b> <b>search</b> is always examined first. [...] This idea can also be generalized into a set of refutation tables.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{paradigms}} {{resulting from}} {{research into the}} game {{have been used to}} create digital computer Hex playing automatons starting about 2000. [...] The first implementations used evaluation functions that emulated Shannon and Moore's electrical circuit model embedded in an alpha-beta search framework with hand-crafted knowledge-based patterns. [...] Starting about 2006, Monte Carlo <b>tree</b> <b>search</b> methods borrowed from successful computer implementations of Go were introduced and soon dominated the field. [...] Later, hand crafted patterns were supplemented by machine learning methods for pattern discovery. [...] These programs are now competitive against skilled human players. Elo based ratings have been assigned to the various programs and can be used to measure technical progress as well as assess playing strength against Elo-rated humans. [...] Current research is often published in either the quarterly ICGA Journal or the annual Advances in Computer Games series (van den Herik et al. eds.).|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, a ternary <b>search</b> <b>tree</b> {{is a type}} of trie (sometimes {{called a}} prefix tree) where nodes are arranged {{in a manner similar to}} a binary <b>search</b> <b>tree,</b> but with up to three children rather than the binary tree's limit of two. Like other prefix <b>trees,</b> a ternary <b>search</b> <b>tree</b> can be used as an associative map structure with the ability for incremental string search. However, ternary <b>search</b> <b>trees</b> are more space efficient compared to standard prefix trees, at the cost of speed. Common applications for ternary <b>search</b> <b>trees</b> include spell-checking and auto-completion.|$|R

50|$|In particular, Monte Carlo <b>tree</b> <b>search</b> {{does not}} need an {{explicit}} evaluation function. Simply implementing the game's mechanics is sufficient to explore the search space (i.e. the generating of allowed moves in a given position and the game-end conditions).

40|$|We {{consider}} {{here the}} probabilistic {{analysis of the}} number of descendants and the number of ascendants of a given internal node in a random <b>search</b> <b>tree.</b> The performance of several important algorithms on <b>search</b> <b>trees</b> is closely related to these quantities.
