5|$|The {{isotopes}} of nobelium {{are mostly}} produced by bombarding actinide targets (uranium, plutonium, curium, californium, or einsteinium), {{with the exception}} of nobelium-262, which is produced as the daughter of lawrencium-262. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> isotope, 255No, can be produced from bombarding curium-248 or californium-249 with carbon-12: the latter method is more common. Irradiating a 350μgcm−2 target of californium-249 with threetrillion (3×1012) 73MeV carbon-12 ions per second for ten minutes can produce around 1200 nobelium-255 atoms.|$|E
