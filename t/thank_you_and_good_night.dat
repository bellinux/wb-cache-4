The story {{was the result}} of a long investigation carried out by journalists from the newspaper and from Granada Television's World in Action programme. Aitken had called a press conference at the Conservative Party offices in Smith Square, London, at 5 p.m. that same day denouncing the claims and demanding that the World in Action documentary, which was due to be screened three hours later, withdraw them. He said: If it falls to me to start a fight to cut out the cancer of bent and twisted journalism in our country with the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play, so be it. I am ready for the fight. The fight against falsehood and those who peddle it. My fight begins today. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> afternoon.|$|R

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The team acknowledges the support, cooperation, effort, and enthusiasm that AVSC contributed to this evaluation. AVSC/New York worked with the team for four days at the onset of the evaluation and concluded the evaluation with two debriefings in Washington. A considerable portion of this time was devoted to the enjoyable and exciting, but risky, task of developing results and indicators for the follow-on Cooperative Agreement. It is noteworthy that AVSC suggested to USAID that the evaluation include work on developing these results and indicators and that AVSC actively seeks results that will have a significant impact. In particular, the team thanks Evie Landry, who managed and led this evaluation effort. The team also thanks the staff of AVSC/Kenya, AVSC/India, and AVSC/Nepal for graciously hosting us for three weeks and sharing their programs with us. We particularly acknowledge their contribution to the recommended results and indicators. Although these results and indicators were tentatively drafted with New York staff, AVSC field staff were the testing ground. In response to the team's question as to whether it is realistic for AVSC to strive to have an impact at the level connoted by those results and indicators and whether field staff were willing to be measured and held accountable at that level, field staff enthusiastically said yes. Also, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> luck to Joseph Dwyer, John Pile, Harriet Stanley, and their staffs...|$|R

In her essay, “The Crisis in Education ” (1958), Hannah Arendt wrote: “Education is {{the point at which}} we decide whether we love the world enough to assume responsibility for it…And education, too, is where we decide whether we love our children enough not to expel them from our world … nor to strike from their hands their chance of undertaking something unforeseen by us, but to prepare them in advance for the task of renewing a common world. ” Jan framed our Colloquium around building a “new ” scientific mind—a mind that consciously reasons and behaves its way into creating a sustained constructive human presence on the earth. This presence is not only manifested by “scientific and social literacy, but by ecological integrity, economic vitality and social equity ” (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2005). As an educator, this grounds my work in a social and cognitive context of generative and restorative learning—in wholeness, interconnections, stewardship and life-affirming design, and it creates the imperative to love our children enough that we ignite and nurture what I’m calling “decidedly different,” “both/and ” scientific minds prepared for the task of renewing a common world ” (Arendt) ...|$|R

The family became friends several African-Americans: Ollie, a neighboring African-American, and insisted an African-American family eat with them at their kitchen table. There was a [...] "visit" [...] from the social ladies of the town who communicated to them that the norm in the area was in favor of maintaining segregated eating - and her grandfather quiped back, as Mayberry recalled, [...] "Tell your menfolks this. As a boy I fought in the Civil War for Abe Lincoln. The idee was to fix things so black folks are free to be like God wanted 'em to be. Free and equal. A colored man or woman is as good as Becky'n me. In my house they eat at my table, because I eat at my table. And tell your menfolks this, too. I keep a loaded shotgun under my bed. And the first man, or men, steps on my land I bought and paid for to force me or my woman to change how we treat folks on our property will get its full blast. And I reload fast.

6000|$|Our last, in {{a double}} sense. For here finally these wide roamings of ours through so many times and places, in search and study of Heroes, are to terminate. I am sorry for it: there was {{pleasure}} for me in this business, if also much pain. It is a great subject, and a most grave and wide one, this which, {{not to be too}} grave about it, I have named Hero-worship. It enters deeply, as I think, into the secret of Mankind's ways and vitalest interests in this world, and is well worth explaining at present. With six months, instead of six days, we might have done better. I promised to break ground on it; I know not whether I have even managed to do that. I have had to tear it up in the rudest manner in order to get into it at all. Often enough, with these abrupt utterances thrown out isolated, unexplained, has your tolerance been put to the trial. Tolerance, patient candor, all-hoping favor and kindness, which I will not speak of at present. The accomplished and distinguished, the beautiful, the wise, something of what is best in England, have listened patiently to my rude words.

40|$|Isolation {{of cells}} from the primary source is a {{necessary}} step in many more complex protocols. Miltenyi offers kits to isolate cells from several organisms including humans, non-human primates, rat and, as we describe here, mice. Magnetic bead-based cell separation allows for either positive selection (or cell depletion) as well as negative selection. Here, we demonstrate negative selection of untouched or na ve CD 4 + helper T cells. Using this standard protocol we typically purify cells that are ≥ 96 % pure CD 4 +/CD 3 +. This protocol is {{used in conjunction with}} the protocol Dissection and 2 -Photon Imaging of Peripheral Lymph Nodes in Mice published in issue 7 of JoVE, for purification of T cells and other cell types to adoptively transfer for imaging purposes. Although we did not demonstrate FACS analysis in this protocol video, it is highly recommended to check the overall purity of isolated cells using the appropriate antibodies via FACS. In addition, we demonstrate the non-sterile method of T cell isolation. If sterile cells are needed for your particular end-user application, be sure to do all of the demonstrated procedures in the tissue culture hood under standard sterile conditions. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> for watching <b>and</b> <b>good</b> luck with your own experiments...|$|R
