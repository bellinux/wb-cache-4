5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{process of}} erosion continues {{to try to}} reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.|$|E
5|$|In 1720, Squire Boone, {{who worked}} {{primarily}} as a weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700–77). Sarah's family were Quakers from Wales, and had settled in 1708 in the area which became Towamencin Township of Montgomery County. In 1731, the Boones moved to the Oley Valley, near the modern city of Reading. There they built a log cabin, partially preserved <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Daniel Boone Homestead. Daniel Boone was born there, the sixth of eleven children.|$|E
5|$|In his {{directorship}} of ACTS, George {{is known}} <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> unofficial {{leader of the}} men in the Army Air Corps who closed ranks and pushed exclusively toward the concept of daylight precision bombing as a strategic, war-winning doctrine.

5|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the light pollution from Cleveland was beginning to make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site.

In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E

5|$|According to one theory, Shakespeare's {{main source}} is an earlier play—now lost—known <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, {{and would have}} {{incorporated}} a ghost. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, {{it is impossible to}} compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.|$|E
5|$|During the 25th and 26th dynasties, the Book of the Dead was updated, {{revised and}} standardised. Spells were {{consistently}} ordered and numbered {{for the first}} time. This standardised version is known <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 'Saite recension', after the Saite (26th) dynasty. In the Late period and Ptolemaic period, the Book of the Dead remained based on the Saite recension, though increasingly abbreviated {{towards the end of}} the Ptolemaic period. New funerary texts appeared, including the Book of Breathing and Book of Traversing Eternity. The last use of the Book of the Dead was in the 1st century BCE, though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in Roman times.|$|E

5|$|Early in January 1864, the Yavapai raided {{a number}} of ranches that {{supplied}} cattle to the miners in the Prescott and Agua Fria area. As {{a result of this}} and a series of recent killings, a preemptive attack was organized to discourage future depredations. Therefore, a group of well-armed volunteers were quickly outfitted with King S. Woolsey as their leader. Their mission was to track the raiding party back to their rancheria. What followed was an infamous footnote in Arizona history known <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Bloody Tanks incident.|$|E
5|$|Education was a {{personal}} priority of Rutherford's, as evidenced by his retention {{of the office of}} Education Minister for his entire time as Premier and by his enthusiastic work in founding the University of Alberta. In 1911 he was elected by Alberta's university graduates to the University of Alberta Senate, responsible for the institution's academic affairs. In 1912 he established the Rutherford Gold Medal in English for the senior year honours English student with the highest standing; the prize still exists <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Rutherford Memorial Medal in English. In 1912, with the University's first graduating class, Rutherford instituted a tradition of inviting convocating students to his house for tea; this tradition would last for twenty-six years.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 the Bull Head Turnpike Company built {{a private}} toll road known <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Sag Harbor Turnpike, which {{operated}} successfully until a competing railroad line {{opened in the}} 1880s. In 1906 the town of Southampton {{took control of the}} now dilapidated road and removed the toll gates. NY114 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and is known in part as the Sag Harbor Turnpike. The bridge carrying NY114 between Sag Harbor and North Haven is an arched bridge that serves as a village landmark. In 1999, residents successfully fought state proposals to replace it with a girder bridge. Instead, the bridge was replaced with a new, wider bridge with ornamental lamps that closely resembles the original and is in the same location.|$|E

5|$|Legends of vampires {{have existed}} for millennia; {{cultures}} {{such as the}} Mesopotamians, Hebrews, ancient Greeks, and Romans had tales of demonic entities and blood-drinking spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity we know <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century Southeastern Europe, particularly Transylvania as verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire itself. Belief in such legends became so rife that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{returned}} to the United States in 1836 and took up the professorship at Harvard.
