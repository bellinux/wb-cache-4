5|$|After {{participating}} in the planned rebellion, Edmund became less popular at court. He was still allowed to accompany the king's wife Philippa to her coronation in January 1330, but his appearances at court became less frequent. At this point he became involved in another plot against the court, when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive. It later emerged that Roger Mortimer himself was responsible for leading Edmund into this belief, in a form of entrapment. The plot was revealed, and in the parliament of March 1330 Edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor. Upon hearing that the verdict was death, the condemned earl pleaded with Edward III for his life, offering to walk from Winchester to London with a rope around his neck {{as a sign of}} atonement. Edward III however knew that leniency was not an option for the aforementioned entrapment utilized by Mortimer could extend to him and potentially be subversive to his own kingship if his father, Edward II truly was alive. Thus Edward III sanctioned the killing of his uncle. It was almost impossible <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> willing to perform the execution of a man of royal blood, until a convicted murderer eventually beheaded Edmund in exchange for a pardon. Edmund's body was initially buried in a Franciscan church in Winchester, but it was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1331.|$|E
25|$|What {{remains in}} my memory of this day is the {{constant}} taking up of new positions, followed by constant orders to retire, terrible blocks on the roads, inability <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> anywhere; by exceeding good luck almost complete freedom from shelling, a complete absence of food of any kind except what could be picked up from abandoned dumps.|$|E

25|$|On December 2, James Kim {{left his}} family to look for help, wearing tennis shoes, a jacket, and light clothing. He {{believed}} the nearest town (Galice) was located four miles away after studying a map with his wife. He promised his wife he would turn back the same day if he failed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone,</b> {{but he did not}} return. Kim backtracked about 11 miles down BLM Road 34-8-36 before leaving the roadway and electing to follow a ravine northeast down the mountain.|$|E
25|$|There are divers {{who enjoy}} {{specific}} underwater activities but are unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> who shares the specific interest sufficiently to dive with them, {{and where the}} activity is incompatible with a less than dedicated buddy. The option of simply not diving is not a practical solution, as the diver is then almost permanently prevented from pursuing the interest. Diving with buddies who get bored or tired quickly also {{does not lead to}} enhanced enjoyment for either party. When the underwater activity is of interest only to one person, diving solo is the only option that allows the activity to be undertaken.|$|E
25|$|A 1995 book found further {{inconsistencies}} in Smith’s allegations; {{the authors found}} no newspaper record of the car crash that the book describes in the time frame described {{despite the fact that}} the local newspaper reported on all vehicle accidents at the time. Former neighbors, teachers and friends were interviewed and yearbooks from Smith’s elementary school were reviewed and found no indication of Smith being absent from school or missing for lengthy periods of time, including the alleged 81-day non-stop ceremony. Ultimately the book's authors were unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> who knew Smith in the 1950s who could corroborate any of the details in her allegations.|$|E

25|$|On 27 February 1985 Doctor Who {{was placed}} on an 18-month hiatus. The BBC {{originally}} planned to axe the series as they wished to spend its budgets on new programming for the channel, but was forced to back down from public pressure and Doctor Who returned in September 1986. At the time Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell were blamed for the decision (Grade {{was the target of}} death threats) but it was later revealed that the decision was taken due to the series running out of creative inspiration, making it impossible <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> (at the time) who knew {{what to do with the}} series.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the film was {{nominated}} for best picture in the 35th Hong Kong Film Awards, the state-owned China Central Television announced that it would not live telecast the ceremony, as it had done every year since 1991. The online video website Tencent has said that it will also not cover the event. China's leading film review websites Douban and Mtime.com do not allow users to create a page for the film. Derek Yee, chairman of Hong Kong Film Awards, who presented the award to the directors, said that it had been hard <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> else to present the award, due to fears of being blacklisted for mainland opportunities.|$|E
25|$|A failure <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> {{prepared}} {{to work on the}} Western Division from Thrapston to Northampton resulted in a third Act being obtained in 1756, which allowed the Commissioners to borrow money to finance the work. Lenders would become Proprietors of the Navigation, and the work was to begin at Thrapston and extend the navigable section towards Northampton. It took the Commissioners two years to agree who should carry out the work, but on 22 June 1758, John Smith jnr from Attercliffe, Yorkshire was contracted to construct 20 pound locks, 20 horse haling bridges and various other works at a cost of £14,070. The river opened to navigation in stages over the next three years, with a great celebration being held at Northampton on 7 August 1761 when the work was completed.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the most}} {{significant}} consequence of Brekka was narrowing the scope of [...] "without authorization" [...] to exclude breaches of loyalty, the Brekka court opened a murky area of liability in the post-employment context. The court held that [...] "a person uses a computer 'without authorization' ... when the employer has rescinded permission to access the computer and the defendant uses the computer anyway." [...] This has led several courts <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that <b>anyone</b> can access a computer without authorization after employment, even if the employer has not technologically revoked the employee's access credentials.|$|R

50|$|Matrimonial {{prospects}} presented themselves, but it {{is likely}} she repulsed all advances. In a madrigal, Denis Sanguin de Saint-Pavin made light of the situation: “And so the world is just too small / <b>To</b> <b>find</b> in it <b>anyone</b> at all / Who could be deemed worthy of her. / And the belle, knowing it well, / Disdains all, finds none acceptable.|$|R
25|$|Users of {{the canal}} felt that the tolls, which had not altered since 1770, were too high, as the volume of traffic using the {{navigation}} had increased. In order to rectify the situation, a new Act of Parliament was obtained in 1828, which reduced the tolls and formalised the 99-year lease of 1777. In 1847, the East Lincolnshire Railway Company obtained an Act which allowed them to purchase the lease of the Louth Navigation, and later the same year, the Great Northern Railway Company (GNR) obtained another Act allowing them to purchase or lease the East Lincolnshire Railway and Canal. They held it for the remaining 29 years, as a tactical move to prevent opposition from the existing leaseholders. When the lease came to an end, the General Manager of the GNR {{reported that they had}} kept the tolls as high as was legally possible, but suggested that they refrain from renewing the lease. The commissioners were unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> wanting to bid for the tolls, and collected them themselves until a bidder was found three months later. Although the tolls were lower than they had been under railway ownership, income was satisfactory into the early 1900s.|$|E
500|$|Marcus Bagwell had {{competed in}} the tag team {{division}} in WCW since 1993, during which time he held the WCW World Tag Team Championship with two different partners. Teaming with 2 Cold Scorpio, he held the title belts for three weeks. He later won the title twice more while teaming with The Patriot, {{a team that was}} dubbed Stars and Stripes due to the patriotic theme both wrestlers were using at the time. After being left behind by both partners, he expressed a desire to form a new tag team to challenge for the title again. According to WCW's storylines, his former partners believed that he was too demanding, and he was unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> interested in teaming with him due to his reputation as being [...] "difficult to work with".|$|E
500|$|Bryan Cranston {{plays the}} role of Shannon. He {{was one of the first}} actors Refn looked to cast, as he was a fan of the TV series Breaking Bad. Knowing Cranston had other opportunities, Refn tried to {{interest}} him by asking how he would like to develop the role. After not hearing back, Refn called him, at the very same time that Cranston was writing on a piece of paper the pros and cons of doing Drive. Moved by Refn's interest, he accepted the part. Christina Hendricks plays the small role of Blanche. [...] "Trying to work in a more reality arena for a character like that," [...] Refn originally auditioned porn stars for Blanche. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> with the necessary acting talent. After meeting with Hendricks, he decided to cast the actress, feeling her [...] "powerhouse" [...] persona would click with the character.|$|E

500|$|Mechthild Gretsch {{describes}} Israel as [...] "one of {{the most}} learned men in Europe", and Lapidge says that he was [...] "an accomplished grammarian and poet, {{and one of the}} few scholars of his time to have first-hand knowledge of Greek". Greek scholarship was so rare in western Europe during this period that in the 870s Anastasius the Librarian was unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> competent to edit his translation of a text from Greek, and had to do it himself. Israel wrote on theology and collected works of medicine. In the 940s he became interested in the Irish philosopher John Scottus Eriugena, and commented on his works in a manuscript which survives in Saint Petersburg. In a manuscript glossing Porphyry's Isagoge, he recommended John's Periphyseon. His redaction of a commentary on Donatus's Ars Minor was a major teaching text in the Middle Ages, and still in print in the twentieth century.|$|E
500|$|Three {{recording}} engineers parted {{ways with}} Deal in 1997. The first engineer she hired—Mark Freegard, who had co-produced Last Splash—has remarked that Deal was [...] "totally lost" [...] and that after seven {{weeks in the}} studio, there were no usable recordings. Two subsequent engineers, John Agnello and Bryce Goggin, had each worked with Deal in 1995 on parts of the Amps' album Pacer. Agnello became increasingly frustrated with Deal's drug use {{and the difficulty of}} retaining musicians. When Deal disappeared for several days without notice, Agnello left the recording sessions. Goggin later said it would have been impossible <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> able to play at the standards Deal required. She was unsatisfied with a drumming performance (by the percussionist of the Flaming Lips) that Goggin thought was outstanding, so he [...] "told her to go home and practice playing drums." [...] Deal followed his advice, and returned to her home in Ohio to practice the instrument.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} her {{daughter}} Leopoldina of typhoid fever on 7 February 1871 devastated the small Imperial Family. PedroII decided {{on a trip to}} Europe that same year to [...] "cheer up" [...] his wife among other reasons (as stated in his own words) and to pay a visit to Leopoldina's four small boys, who had lived in Coburg with their parents since the late 1860s. The Imperial couple would travel abroad again during 1876 and 1887. Teresa Cristina preferred her ordinary life in Brazil, [...] "dedicating herself to her family, religious devotions, and charitable works." [...] In fact, visiting her native land only served to resurrect painful memories. Her family had been dethroned in 1861 and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had been annexed to what would later become the unified Kingdom of Italy. Everyone she had known from her youth was gone. As she wrote in 1872: [...] "I {{do not know how to}} tell what was the impression I had upon seeing again, after 28 years, my fatherland and not <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> for whom I cared." ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the problem}} areas in the {{competition}} of small businesses with large businesses is the inefficient use or nonexistent use of the latest technology, i. e. computers. Beating the competition frequently only means being able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> answers before <b>anyone</b> else. Incorporation of automated processes for accounting, communications, and expert systems either singly or together can help create an accounting information system that will decrease time spent on routine tasks as well as make information available quickly for use in decision making...|$|R

500|$|Gilmour and Shirley also backed Barrett for his one {{and only}} live concert during this period. The gig took place on 6 June 1970 at the Olympia Exhibition Hall {{as part of a}} Music and Fashion Festival. The trio {{performed}} four songs, [...] "Terrapin", [...] "Gigolo Aunt", [...] "Effervescing Elephant" [...] and [...] "Octopus". Poor mixing left the vocals barely audible until part-way through the last number. At the end of the fourth song, Barrett unexpectedly but politely put down his guitar and walked off the stage. The performance has been bootlegged. Barrett made one last appearance on BBC Radio, recording three songs at their studios on 16 February 1971. [...] All three came from the Barrett album. After this session, he took a hiatus from his music career that lasted more than a year, although in an extensive interview with Mick Rock and Rolling Stone in December, he discussed himself at length, showed off his new 12-string guitar, talked about touring with Jimi Hendrix and stated that he was frustrated in terms of his musical work because of his inability <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> good to play with.|$|E
500|$|Morley {{concludes that}} [...] "Anti-rockism was always violently pro-pop, largely because we {{original}} campaigning anti-rockists {{had been given}} such a tough time at school for liking [...] Bowie and [...] Bolan and not ELP and Led Zep." [...] Regarding the definition, music writer Ned Raggett noted: [...] "Every article, every discussion, anything which involves the word seems to get bogged down or get taken apart in ways which prevent there from being any consensus." [...] Accordingly, some people have used rockism as a polemical label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism. Rockism is therefore not a connotatively neutral term, according to Raggett: [...] "You’re not going <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> arguing FOR [...] any time soon, or at least coming out and saying sobut that’s {{precisely because of the}} terms of the discourse." [...] Popmatters Robert Loss wrote that [...] "traditionalism" [...] describes the policing of the present with the past, making it a better word for [...] "rockism". Design critic and indie pop musician Nick Currie (aka Momus) compared rockism to the international art movement Stuckism, which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, American Continental's profits {{were in the}} {{millions}} and it had become the biggest single-family home builder in Phoenix and Denver. At its peak it would have $6 billion in assets, {{a large number of}} subsidiaries, 2,500 employees, and a headquarters complex on Phoenix's Camelback Road. It had three corporate jets and a helicopter. He was a very hard worker and a strong presence to his employees; one later said, [...] "It's almost magnetic. When he moves, things happen. The office would come alive when he walked in." [...] He inspired both camaraderie and fervent loyalty in them. While he demanded long hours, he often rewarded employees monetarily and with gifts. Businesspeople outside his company often found Keating arrogant and difficult to deal with. Congressman William Keating, who was well-liked, said of his brother: [...] "Charlie is impatient, aggressive, always on the move. He has clearly defined goals. I don't think he worries about the popularity of his positions." [...] A Fortune profile in 1977 reported, [...] "It seems almost impossible <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>anyone</b> who actually likes Charlie Keating." [...] The story rankled Keating, who later had over five thousand large yellow [...] "I Like Charlie Keating" [...] buttons made up which he handed out to employees and visitors. Keating said, [...] "There {{are a lot of people}} that would say nasty things, I'm sure, about me, but it ain't true that nobody ever liked Charlie Keating." ...|$|E
