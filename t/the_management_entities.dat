Introduction As network management applications become increasingly distributed, it is important to study how this new generation of management applications will be handled by standards as Open Distributed Processing (ODP) [1]. Therefore, it is helpful to describe them from the five viewpoints introduced by ODP to cope with the complexity of distributed systems. These are the enterprise, information, computation, engineering and technology viewpoints.

40|$|Distributed event {{monitoring}} is {{an important}} service for fault, performance and security management. Next generation event monitoring services are higly distributed and invovling {{a large number of}} monitoring agents. In order to support scalabel event monitoring, the monitoring agents use IP multicasting as a group communication for exchanging events and control information. However, dueto the dynamic nature of event detection and correlation during the monitoring process, agents groups organization and coordination such as membership and tasks assignments becomes a challenging issue. Thus, supporting an appropriet group mangement infrastrcutre is a key issue for developing scalable event monitoring services. This paper presents an efficient group management framework based on IP multicast that dynamically reconfigure the group strcutures and memebership assignments at run-time according to the event correlation requirements which allows for optimal delivery of multicast messages between <b>the</b> <b>management</b> <b>entities.</b> This framework provides techniques for solving agents ’ state synchronization, free-collision group allocation and agents bootstrap problems in distributed event monitoring. The presented framework has been implemented within HiFi monitoring system which is a distributed hierarchical monitoring system...|$|E

The objectives of increasing agricultural production and incomes {{are common to}} all types of irrigation in Zimbabwe, though the relative importance given to different objectives varies somewhat among irrigation system types.

The digitalization and circulation of works on the Internet is another challenge that Copyright {{will be able to}} overcome. In a European Union (EU) context, the answer involves the removal of borders in what must become a common market. The principle of territoriality, which is the foundation of Copyright, will necessarily be affected in a common digital market. We view, with particular interest, the clear definitions of legal and illegal actions, as well as similar surveillance for all countries in EU in terms of the illegal actions. Moreover, it is necessary to reestablish the equilibrium between right owners and users, creating new exceptions for users and applying them in the same manner in all 28 member EU countries. In this context, the Regulation on exportable content, the revision of the Directive on Satellite and Cable and the multi-territorial licenses provided by <b>the</b> <b>management</b> <b>entities,</b> are very welcome. In terms of the compensation for private copy, a common system and a common surveillance system must be implemented for all Member Countries. The Commission predicts that in the long-term an European Copyright Code will be possible. In the meantime any legal solutions that unify legislations within the EU is welcome. In what concerns legislation outside EU multinational treaties should be encouraged because the legal questions online are spread beyond any physical borders. Because our CDADC had already problems when it was enacted and is now a patchwork of several Directives, perhaps it would be advisable to create a new Code. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
