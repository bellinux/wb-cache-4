5|$|In early March, Dreamer {{challenged}} the New Breed to a match at WrestleMania 23 {{on behalf of}} <b>the</b> <b>Originals.</b> The following week, Dreamer won a battle royal featuring members of the New Breed and <b>the</b> <b>Originals.</b> In the final {{weeks leading up to}} WrestleMania, the stables continued to clash, with Van Dam defeating Burke on the March 27 episode of ECW. This provoked an attack on Van Dam by the other New Breed members, until <b>the</b> <b>Originals</b> made the save. At WrestleMania, the New Breed members lost to the ECW Originals in an eight-man tag team match, but on the following episode of ECW on Sci Fi, they defeated the ECW Originals in an extreme rules rematch.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, Nipper {{began to}} have her oil {{paintings}} made into prints, after getting requests from people who could not afford <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Queen Victoria {{had given}} Beatrice {{the task of}} editing the {{journals}} for publication, which meant removing private material as well as passages that, if published, might be hurtful to living people. Beatrice deleted so much material that the edited journals are only a third as long as <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b> The destruction of such large passages of Queen Victoria's diaries distressed Beatrice's nephew, King George V, and his wife Queen Mary, who were powerless to intervene. Beatrice copied a draft from the original and then copied her draft into a set of blue notebooks. Both <b>the</b> <b>originals</b> and her first drafts were destroyed as she progressed. The task took thirty years and was finished in 1931. The surviving 111 notebooks are kept in the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese company Norinco {{has made}} an effort to {{reproduce}} this firearm. The Norinco 97 is an almost exact copy of the Winchester 1897, produced in both Trench and Riot grades, yet lacking in the fit and finish of <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Originals</b> played 35 matches on tour, {{and their}} only loss was a 3–0 defeat to Wales in Cardiff. The match has {{entered into the}} {{folklore}} of both countries because of a controversy over whether All Black Bob Deans scored a try which would have earned his team a 3–3 draw. In contrast {{to the success of}} <b>the</b> <b>Originals</b> on the field, the team did antagonise some in the Home Nations' rugby establishment; both administrators and the press complained that the All Blacks did not play the game within the amateur and gentlemanly spirit promoted by the International Rugby Football Board. This complaint continued to dog New Zealand teams until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{general idea}} for the {{restoration}} {{was to make the}} locomotives appear as if they were built in the 1880s. The original, dilapidated boilers of the four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works were replaced with new, smaller boilers built by Dixon Boiler Works. Their worn-out wood and steel cabs were replaced with new ones made of fiberglass, and they were given new tenders, which used the trucks from <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b> Many of the smaller original parts on the locomotives such as the domes and brass bells on top of the boilers, the wheels, and the side rods were successfully refurbished and retained. The locomotives' fireboxes were also reconfigured to burn diesel oil. Replicas of their builder plates were also made to replace <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b>|$|E
50|$|That {{is why it}} {{is often}} {{necessary}} to preserve <b>the</b> <b>original,</b> in order to preserve its <b>original</b> integrity. <b>The</b> copy is made to preserve <b>the</b> <b>original</b> recording by saving <b>the</b> <b>original</b> from degenerating as it is being played, rather than to replace <b>the</b> <b>original.</b>|$|R

5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b> Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.|$|E

As per <b>the</b> <b>originals,</b> the other Pokémon can be obtained later on.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1870s Busch's {{illustrations}} {{were printed}} using zincography. With this technique {{there was no}} longer any danger that a wood engraver could change the character of his drawings. <b>The</b> <b>originals</b> were photographed and transferred onto a photosensitive zinc plate. This process allowed for the application of a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster printing method. Busch's use of zincography began with Mr. and Mrs. Knopp.|$|E

5|$|Hellblazer {{boosted the}} {{popularity}} and {{image of the}} occult detective fiction genre and shaped it to its modern form. Many modern examples of the genre such as Hellboy, Supernatural, Grimm, <b>The</b> <b>Originals,</b> and The Dresden Files {{have been influenced by}} it, and many imitators of both the series and its character flourished such as Criminal Macabre, Gravel, Planetary, and others. Its elements and style have been used countless of times in other works and many analogues of the cynical John Constantine have appeared.|$|E
5|$|Photographer Ansel Adams {{made his}} first trip to Yosemite in 1916; his {{photographs}} of the valley made him famous in the 1920s and 1930s. Adams willed <b>the</b> <b>originals</b> of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association, and visitors can still buy direct prints from his original negatives. The studio in which the prints are sold was established in 1902 by artist Harry Cassie Best.|$|E
5|$|Viva el Príncipe {{received}} a positive review from David Jeffries of Allmusic praising Botija's production and Castro's vocal delivery. It earned a negative review from {{an editor of}} Terra Networks who felt that the album did not add anything to <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b> The album {{received a}} nomination for a Latin Grammy, two Billboard Latin Music Awards nominations, and an Oye! award. The success led to a 2011 release of more José José songs titled Mi Amigo El Príncipe.|$|E

5|$|According {{to one of}} her biographers, Giles St Aubyn, Victoria {{wrote an}} average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life. From July 1832 until just before her death, she kept a {{detailed}} journal, which eventually encompassed 122 volumes. After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned <b>the</b> <b>originals</b> in the process. Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them. Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson, Hector Bolitho, George Earle Buckle, Lord Esher, Roger Fulford, and Richard Hough among others.|$|E
5|$|Augusta, Lady Gregory retold many of {{the legends}} of Cú Chulainn in her 1902 book Cuchulain of Muirthemne, which paraphrased <b>the</b> <b>originals</b> but also romanticized some of the tales and omitted most of the more violent content. This first {{translation}} was very popular, supported by the Celtic Revival movement. It featured an introduction by her friend William Butler Yeats, who wrote several pieces based on the legend, including the plays On Baile's Strand (1904), The Green Helmet (1910), At the Hawk's Well (1917), The Only Jealousy of Emer (1919) and The Death of Cuchulain (1939), and a poem, Cuchulain's Fight with the Sea (1892).|$|E

50|$|Mignogna and the {{production}} team recreated the style of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> series in its sets, cinematography, costumes, acting, and storytelling style. They duplicated the four-act structure used in <b>the</b> <b>original</b> because of <b>the</b> need for commercial breaks. They primarily used <b>the</b> <b>original</b> series incidental music, as well as <b>the</b> <b>original</b> theme song and credit typography.

They shot the episodes in 4:3 aspect ratio to duplicate <b>the</b> <b>original</b> series TV format.|$|R
5|$|Australia was {{the first}} Commonwealth nation to create its own VC, on 15 January 1991. Although it is a {{separate}} award, its appearance is identical to its British counterpart. Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from FOR VALOUR to the Latin PRO VALORE. The New Zealand and Australian awards are still made by the jewellers Hancocks from the gunmetal used for <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b> The Canadian Victoria Cross also includes metal from the same cannon, along with copper and other metals from all regions of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Few of the {{original}} windows survive in the tower, but those that remain are larger than {{in some of the}} other older peles, suggesting it may have been built with defence less in mind than in some earlier pele towers. <b>The</b> <b>originals</b> have mainly been replaced by 17th- and 18th-century versions. The original roof would have resembled that at nearby Yanwath Hall, but was replaced at a later date with the current hipped-roof design, probably during the late 16th or 17th centuries. The current roof was further restored in 1979.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost a}} century {{only a few of}} the texts were published. In 1875, the {{director}} of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, Rudolf Philippi, published the Santiago Staff, and Carroll (1892) published part of the Oar. Most texts remained beyond the reach of would-be decipherers until 1958, when Thomas Barthel published line drawings of almost all the known corpus in his Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinselschrift ("Bases for the Decipherment of the Easter Island script") which remains the fundamental reference to rongorongo. He transcribed texts A through X, over 99% of the corpus; the CEIPP estimates that it is 97% accurate. Barthel's line drawings were not produced free-hand but copied from rubbings, which helped ensure their faithfulness to <b>the</b> <b>originals.</b>|$|E
30|$|We {{describe}} {{the effect of}} commitment operations on trust. Before we {{describe the}} effects, let us consider some situations wherein a commitment exists from a debtor toward a creditor. Effect of discharge. When a commitment is discharged, the creditor’s trust for the debtor increases. Effect of violation. When a commitment is violated, the creditor’s trust in the debtor decreases. Effect of delegation and discharge. When a commitment is delegated by <b>the</b> <b>original</b> debtor to a new debtor, and the new debtor satisfies it, the creditor’s trust in both <b>the</b> <b>original</b> and <b>the</b> new debtor increases. Effect of delegation and violation. When a commitment is delegated from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> debtor to a new debtor and the new debtor violates it, the creditor’s trust in both <b>the</b> <b>original</b> and <b>the</b> new debtor decreases.
