500|$|During the war, {{relations}} between writers in Nigeria and Biafra were strained. Achebe and John Pepper Clark had a tense confrontation in London over their respective support for opposing {{sides of the}} conflict. Achebe demanded that the publisher withdraw the dedication of A Man of the People he had given to Clark. Years later, their friendship healed and the dedication was restored. Meanwhile, their contemporary Wole Soyinka was imprisoned for meeting with Biafran officials, and {{spent two years in}} jail. Speaking in 1968, Achebe said: [...] "I find the Nigerian situation untenable. If I had been a Nigerian, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in the same situation as Wole Soyinka is– in prison." ...|$|E
500|$|The Giants allowed six {{sacks in}} their week seven 17–12 {{loss to the}} Seattle Seahawks. Seahawks {{defensive}} end Jacob Green outplayed offensive tackle Karl Nelson and recorded a career-high four sacks. Phil Simms threw four interceptions but coach Bill Parcells denied he was struggling, [...] "ou'd like not to take a sack in the scoring zone, but sometimes it's hard {{to know when to}} throw it away. Two of Phil's interceptions were rebounds {{that had nothing to do}} with the quarterback. On the interception on fourth and 14 at the end, he was trying to make a play. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thrown there, too. The other interception was his mistake. I don't think he's in a slump." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Clarkson, {{when she}} first heard the song in March 2012, she decided {{to put it on}} hold. She explained, [...] "My goal as a singer is to capture the {{sentiment}} of a song and emote what the feeling is. I'm in a relationship and super happy, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been able to sing this song eight months ago. Love should be celebrated, and this is a great description of where I'm at in my life. This is a couple's skate, not an all skate song." [...] "Don't Rush" [...] is one of the three new tracks (the other two being [...] "Catch My Breath" [...] and [...] "People Like Us") that Clarkson recorded for her first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits – Chapter One. In an interview with Billboard, Clarkson expressed her excitement of recording the song, saying ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{was given}} a Test trial in 1946 when he took 149 wickets and {{believed}} {{he should have been}} included in Wally Hammond's doomed team to Australia that following winter: [...] "I turned the ball more than most off-spinners and I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been effective in Australia." [...] The Australians rated him too, Ian Johnson, Australia's premier off-spinner, sought Robinson's advice when touring England in 1948.|$|E
2500|$|Banville {{was educated}} at CBS Primary, Wexford, a Christian Brothers school, and at St Peter's College, Wexford. Despite having {{intended}} to be a painter and an architect, he did not attend university. Banville has described this as [...] "A great mistake. I should have gone. I regret not taking that four years of getting drunk and falling in love. But I wanted to get away from my family. I wanted to be free." [...] Alternately he has stated that college would have had little benefit for him: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> learned much more, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had the nerve to tackle some of the things I tackled as a young writer if I had been to university — I would have been beaten into submission by my lecturers." [...] After school he worked as a clerk at Aer Lingus, which allowed him to travel at deeply discounted rates. He took advantage of this to travel in Greece and Italy. He lived in the United States during 1968 and 1969. On his return to Ireland, he became a sub-editor at The Irish Press, rising eventually to the position of chief sub-editor.|$|E

2500|$|During pre-production, the {{producers}} debated on whether Martin would own slaves, ultimately {{deciding not to}} make him a slave owner. This decision received criticism from Spike Lee, who in a letter to The Hollywood Reporter accused the film's portrayal of slavery as being [...] "a complete whitewashing of history". Lee wrote that after he and his wife went to see the film, [...] "we both came out of the theatre fuming. For three hours The Patriot dodged around, skirted about or completely ignored slavery." [...] Gibson himself remarked: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made him a slave holder. Not to seems kind of a cop-out." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 6, 2007, Calò and his co-defendants {{were cleared}} of murdering Calvi. The {{presiding}} {{judge in the}} trial threw out the charges because of [...] "insufficient evidence" [...] in a surprise verdict after 20 months of evidence. Calò, who gave evidence from his high security prison, denied the charges. [...] "I {{had no interest in}} killing Calvi," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't have the time, nor the inclination. Besides, if I had wanted him dead do you not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> picked my own people to do the job?" [...] Calò's defence argued there were others who had wanted Calvi silenced.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2006, Ellis {{joined the}} {{original}} London {{cast of the}} musical Wicked at the Apollo Victoria Theatre to play Elphaba, the misunderstood Wicked Witch of the West, serving as a temporary standby to Idina Menzel for three months from the show's opening on 27 September 2006. Ellis had it written in her contract that she would assume the lead role on 1 January 2007 when Menzel left: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> agreed to do the show otherwise." [...] Having been part of rehearsals from the start, she gained the original direction from Joe Mantello. During Menzel's run, Ellis played Elphaba on nine occasions in Menzel's absence; some fans turned up at the theatre expressly hoping to witness Ellis.|$|E

2500|$|Lamont {{replaced}} Major as Chancellor in Major's new Cabinet, thereby inheriting Major's {{exchange rate}} policy. In his memoirs, Lamont recalls a senior Treasury civil servant answering his question on why Britain {{had joined the}} ERM as replying, [...] "It's politics," [...] to which Lamont replied, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> given up {{the flexibility of the}} exchange rate." [...] In public, Lamont justified the decision to join the ERM in terms of the government's counter-inflation strategy. In the House of Commons debate shortly after the pound joined the ERM, he argued that under a regime of floating exchange rates, the consequences of depreciating the currency had been short lived in terms of output and competitiveness, [...] "but have been lasting in terms of inflation. That {{is one of the reasons}} why the Government concluded that it would be right to join the ERM." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Loser" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Beck {{while he was}} visiting Stephenson's home. Although the song was created spontaneously, Beck has claimed {{to have had the}} idea for the song since the late 1980s; he once said, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been able to go in and do 'Loser' in a six-hour shot without having been somewhat prepared. It was accidental, but it was something that I'd been working toward for a long time." [...] Beck played some of his songs for Stephenson; Stephenson enjoyed the songs, but was unimpressed by Beck's rapping. Stephenson recorded a brief guitar part from one of Beck's songs onto an 8-track, looped it, and added a drum track to it. Stephenson then added his own sitar playing and other samples. At that point, Beck began writing and improvising lyrics for the recording. For the song's vocals, Beck attempted to emulate the rapping style of Public Enemy's Chuck D. According to Beck, the line that became the song's chorus originated because [...] "When [...] played it back, I thought, 'Man, I'm the worst rapper in the world, I'm just a loser.' So I started singing 'I'm a [...] baby, so why don't you kill me.'" [...] According to Rothrock, the song was largely finished in six and a half hours, with two minor overdubs several months later.|$|E
