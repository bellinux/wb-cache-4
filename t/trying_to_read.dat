5|$|In the 1920s, {{government}} censorship was commonplace. Magazines {{were routinely}} confiscated under the anti-obscenity Comstock laws; permits for labor rallies were often denied; {{and virtually all}} anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the First Amendment during an Industrial Workers of the World rally.|$|E

500|$|The {{fantasy and}} science fiction author Alexa Chipman writes that while Tolkien was [...] "firmly against any prose {{translation}} of Beowulf, as it is, at heart, a poem", he agreed that [...] "if one is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the original, having {{a translation of}} it handy can sometimes be of assistance". She recalls her own Beowulf studies with [...] "a huge stack of dictionary and grammar books", and draws attention to Tolkien's comment that [...] "Perhaps the most important function of any translation used by a student is to provide not a model for imitation, but an exercise for correction." ...|$|E

500|$|The two {{blue collar}} TV shows {{the people at}} NASA watch are Home Improvement and Married... with Children. In the scene where the family arrives at Cape Canaveral, the car is a parody of The Beverly Hillbillies, with Marge sitting in Granny's position. Homer and Barney's duel is a {{reference}} to the classic [...] episode [...] "The Gamesters of Triskelion", complete with one of Star Treks fight themes (originally from the episode [...] "Amok Time") and the NASA administrators betting on the combatants in [...] "quatloos". Homer running while lying on the floor and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> {{the back of his head}} is a homage to the Three Stooges, particularly Curly. The TV anchor is a parody of Tom Brokaw, and is voiced by Harry Shearer. A lot of words containing the letter L were intentionally written into the dialogue because the writers [...] "enjoy the way Tom says them". Astronaut Race Banyon is a parody of Jonny Quest character Race Bannon.|$|E
500|$|In Willow's dream {{she struggles}} {{to find her}} place in the school theater {{production}} of Death of a Salesman, while her friends and classmates are apparently fully costumed, prepared, and ready to go on stage. Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and know what is going on. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously {{at the front of the}} class, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz whispers into Tara's ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and her breath is sucked out of her body.|$|E

2500|$|Peel {{had often}} spoken wryly of his {{eventual}} death.

2500|$|Dershowitz is {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of gun control. He has criticized the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, saying that it has [...] "no place in modern society". Dershowitz supports repealing the amendment, but he vigorously opposes using the judicial system to read it out of the Constitution because it would open the way for further revisions to the Bill of Rights and Constitution by the courts. [...] "Foolish liberals who are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a public safety hazard don't see the danger in the big picture. They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like." ...|$|E

Bennet also checks the readout of a machine used to gauge when Parkman is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Bennet's mind. Bennet explains that the Haitian is blocking Matt's powers. Nevertheless, Matt is able to pull the name [...] "Claire" [...] from Bennet's mind. Bennet is impressed by Matt's growing ability, and then tells the Haitian to [...] "go deep" [...] with Matt, who is last heard screaming. That morning, back at the Bennet house, Bennet finds that a distraught Claire has just come home. Bennet assumes from Claire's bare, mud-covered feet that she was out all night. Bennet has to get to work, but states that they'll talk later. He is then seen monitoring Nathan Petrelli, who has just had a one-night stand with Niki/Jessica Sanders. Bennet tells the Haitian to kidnap [...] "just the one" [...] (Nathan).|$|E
2500|$|Brando {{used his}} Stanislavski System skills {{for his first}} summer stock roles in Sayville, New York, on Long Island. Brando {{established}} a pattern of erratic, insubordinate behavior in the few shows he had been in. His behavior had him {{kicked out of the}} cast of the New School's production in Sayville, but he was soon afterwards discovered in a locally produced play there. Then, in 1944, he made it to Broadway in the bittersweet drama I Remember Mama, playing the son of Mady Christians. The Lunts wanted Brando {{to play the role of}} Alfred Lunt's son in O Mistress Mine, and Lunt even coached him for his audition, but Brando's reading during the audition was so desultory that they couldn't hire him. New York Drama Critics voted him [...] "Most Promising Young Actor" [...] for his role as an anguished veteran in Truckline Caf√©, although the play was a commercial failure. In 1946, he appeared on Broadway as the young hero in the political drama A Flag is Born, refusing to accept wages above the Actors' Equity rate. In that same year, Brando played the role of Marchbanks alongside Katharine Cornell in her production's revival of Candida, one of her signature roles. Cornell also cast him as the Messenger in her production of Jean Anouilh's Antigone that same year. He was also offered the opportunity to portray one of the principal characters in the Broadway premiere of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, but turned the part down after falling asleep while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the massive script and pronouncing the play [...] "ineptly written and poorly constructed".|$|E
