5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|In the {{fountain}} effect, a chamber is constructed which {{is connected to}} a reservoir of heliumII by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If the interior of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In {{order to maintain the}} equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of <b>the</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E

50|$|Today, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of non-bulk cargo is transported in intermodal <b>containers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>containers</b> arrive at a port by truck, rail or another ship and are stacked in the port's storage area. When the ship that will be transporting them arrives, <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> that it is offloading are unloaded by a crane. <b>The</b> <b>containers</b> either leave <b>the</b> port by truck or rail or are put in the storage area until they are put on another ship. Once the ship is offloaded, <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> it is leaving with are brought to the dock by truck. A crane lifts <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> from <b>the</b> trucks into the ship. As <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> pile up in the ship, the workers connect them to the ship and to each other. The jobs involved include the crane operators, the workers who connect <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> to <b>the</b> ship and each other, the truck drivers that transport <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> from <b>the</b> dock and storage area, the workers who track <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> in <b>the</b> storage area as they are loaded and unloaded, as well as various supervisors. Those workers at the port who handle and move <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> are likely to be considered stevedores or longshoremen.|$|R
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. <b>The</b> <b>container</b> must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5|$|The hoard was {{concentrated}} {{in a single}} location, within the completely decayed remains of a wooden chest. The objects had been grouped within the chest; for example, pieces such as ladles and bowls were stacked inside each other, and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box. Some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing, but the overall amount of disturbance was low. It was possible to determine the original layout of the artefacts within <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> {{and the existence of}} <b>the</b> <b>container</b> itself, due to Lawes' prompt notification of the find, which allowed it to be excavated in situ by professional archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E

50|$|General {{average was}} {{declared}} {{and at least}} one third of <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> were damaged by <b>the</b> blaze.

5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with <b>the</b> <b>container</b> to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with <b>the</b> <b>container</b> decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of <b>the</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{approximately}} three weeks, the expedition arrived in Lambaréné {{and met with}} Albert Schweitzer. Klevan later described the meeting with Schweitzer as the greatest moment of the entire expedition. Later, the hospital received 500kg of Norwegian klippfisk (dried and salted cod), a particular favourite with the hospital's patients. The medicines were handed over, and <b>the</b> <b>container</b> was opened. Even though the drainage had been monitored throughout the expedition, there was still great excitement associated with seeing the result firsthand. The block of ice {{turned out to be}} almost entirely intact.|$|E
5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under the lid of <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> and can detonate upon opening.|$|E

5|$|Elemental gallium is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, {{it should not be}} stored in glass or metal containers because <b>the</b> <b>container</b> may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with a short list of other materials that includes water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on <b>the</b> <b>container</b> geometry.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, redback spiders {{were found}} in Fukuoka, Japan. Over 700 have been found near <b>the</b> <b>container</b> {{terminal}} in Hakata Bay, Fukuoka City. Dispersal mechanisms within Japan are unclear, but redbacks {{are thought to have}} spread by walking or by being carried on vehicles. In September 2012, after being bitten a woman was hospitalised in the Higashi Ward of Fukuoka City. As Japan previously had no dangerous spiders, signs warning about redback spiders have been posted in parks around the city.|$|E

5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with <b>the</b> <b>container</b> ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around <b>the</b> <b>container</b> to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E
