In a first part, influence of <b>thermal</b> <b>ageing</b> on mechanical behavior is analyzed by means of hardness tests, reversed tensile tests on dog-bone specimens and compression test on solder balls used for electronic components. In the second part, the impact of <b>thermal</b> <b>ageing</b> on the solder joint reliability is analyzed thanks to torsion tests on assembled boards. The results show systematically a decrease of 20 – 60 % of the mechanical properties or of the number of cycles to failure (in the case of torsion test).

The thermal ageing-induced degradation of RPV steels becomes more significant with extended operational lives of NPPs. Consequently, the evaluation of <b>thermal</b> <b>ageing</b> effects is important for the structural integrity assessments required for the lifetime extension of NPPs. As a part of NRG's research programme on Structural Materials for safe-LTO of Light Water Reactor (LWR) RPVs, WWER- 440 surveillance specimens, which have been <b>thermal</b> <b>aged</b> for 27 years (∼ 200, 000 h) at 290 °C in a surveillance channel of Armenian-NPP, are investigated. Results from the mechanical and microstructural examination of these <b>thermal</b> <b>aged</b> specimens are presented in this article. The results indicate the absence of significant long term <b>thermal</b> <b>ageing</b> effect of 15 Cr 2 MoV-A steel. No age hardening was detected in aged tensile specimens compared with the as-received condition. There is no difference between the impact properties of as-received and <b>thermal</b> <b>aged</b> weld metals. The upper shelf energy of the aged steel remains the same as for the as-received material at a rather high level of about 120 J. The T 41 value did not change and was found to be about 10 °C.

Prior <b>thermal</b> <b>ageing</b> at 793 and 873 K for durations ranging from 10 to 5000 h did not cause {{a significant change in}} room temperature tensile properties.

Prior <b>thermal</b> <b>ageing</b> at 793 K for 5000 h and at 873 K for 1000 and 5000 h produced significant reduction in strength values at intermediate temperatures (523 - 723 K) compared to that observed at high temperatures. At intermediate temperatures, the alloy in all heat treatment conditions exhibited serrated flow, a manifestation of dynamic strain ageing (DSA). The significant loss of strength in thermally aged conditions at intermediate temperatures has been attributed to reduced propensity to DSA.
