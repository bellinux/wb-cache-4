Parker in 1932 from King's College. He {{presented}} the land to the Ruislip Village Trust {{as the site of}} a future public hall and the Trust gave it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating <b>that</b> <b>that</b> would be the sole use.|$|E
5|$|By October 11, {{investigators}} had conducted 124 interviews and had found 174 {{pieces of evidence}} related to the case.

As a result of the September 27 incident, Platte Canyon High School increased its security, leaving only one school entrance unlocked. It plans to install more security cameras.

5|$|In {{preparation}} of the storm, a high surf advisory and a tropical storm watch were issued for the Hawaiian Islands.

5|$|It occurs along {{almost the}} entire eastern coast of Australia, from Geelong, Victoria to Proserpine, Queensland.

The species no longer occurs at any of these Tasmania locations, and has been declared extinct in Tasmania under that state's Threatened Species Protection Act 1995.

The final managerial role in the association is that of the Group Scout Leader and their assistant, who are both in charge of a local Scout group. All of these roles are uniformed and for those volunteer roles from County level downwards training is required in the basic values of the association, safety and child protection, inclusion and advanced managerial skills to achieve their Wood Badge.|$|E

5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view <b>that</b> <b>that</b> recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E

Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents.

5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view <b>that</b> <b>that</b> class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film {{was a low}} budget {{production}} as Lombardo did not care for horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt <b>that</b> <b>that</b> style would better suit the special effects in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked on the special effects on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up that would only be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on her. This effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, <b>that</b> <b>that</b> could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said <b>that</b> <b>that</b> aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
