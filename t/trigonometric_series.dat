500|$|Cantor's {{first ten}} papers were on number theory, his thesis topic. At the {{suggestion}} of Eduard Heine, the Professor at Halle, Cantor turned to analysis. Heine proposed that Cantor solve an open problem that had eluded Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Rudolf Lipschitz, Bernhard Riemann, and Heine himself: {{the uniqueness of the}} representation of a function by <b>trigonometric</b> <b>series.</b> Cantor solved this difficult problem in 1869. It was while working on this problem that he discovered transfinite ordinals, which occurred as indices n in the nth derived set S'n of a set S of zeros of a <b>trigonometric</b> <b>series.</b> Given a <b>trigonometric</b> <b>series</b> f(x) with S as its set of zeros, Cantor had discovered a procedure that produced another <b>trigonometric</b> <b>series</b> that had S1 as its set of zeros, where S1 is the set of limit points of S. If S'k+1 is the set of limit points of S'k, then he could construct a <b>trigonometric</b> <b>series</b> whose zeros are S'k+1. Because the sets S'k were closed, they contained their Limit points, and the intersection of the infinite decreasing sequence of sets S, S1, S2, S3,... formed a limit set, which we would now call S'ω, and then he noticed that Sω would also have to have a set of limit points Sω+1, and so on.
