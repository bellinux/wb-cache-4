40|$|In TREC- 8, we {{participated in}} {{automatic}} ad-hoc retrieval {{as well as}} the query and filtering tracks. The theme of our participation is `retrieval lists combination', and the technique is applied throughout our experiments to various degree. It is pointed out that our PIRCS system may be considered as a combination of probabilistic retrieval model and a language model approach. For adhoc, three types of experiments were done with short, medium and long queries as before. General approach is similar to TREC- 7, but combination of retrieval lists from different query types were used to boost effectiveness. For query track, we submitted one shortquery set, and performed retrieval for twenty one natural language query vairants. For filtering track, experiments for adaptive, batch filtering, and routing were performed. For adaptive, historical selected document list was used to <b>train</b> <b>profile</b> term weights and dynamically vary retrieval status value (rsv) threshold for deciding document selection during the course of filtering. For batch filtering, Financial Times FT 92 data was used to define 6 retrieval profiles whose results were combined based on coefficients trained via a genetic algorithm. Logistic regression transforms rsvs to probabilities. Routing was similarly done with additional training data obtained from non-FT collections and two additional profiles were defined and combined 1...|$|E
40|$|Annotation of {{the rapidly}} accumulating body of {{sequence}} data {{relies heavily on}} the detection of remote homologues and functional motifs in protein families. The most popular methods rely on sequence alignment. These include programs that use a scoring matrix to compare {{the probability of a}} potential alignment with random chance and programs that use curated multiple alignments to <b>train</b> <b>profile</b> hidden Markov models (HMMs). Related approaches depend on bootstrapping multiple alignments from a single sequence. However, alignment-based programs have limitations. They make the assumption that contiguity is conserved between homologous segments, which may not be true in genetic recombination or horizontal transfer. Alignments also become ambiguous when sequence similarity drops below 40 %. This has kindled interest in classification methods that do not rely on alignment. An approach to classification without alignment based on the distribution of contiguous sequences of four amino acids (4 -grams) was developed. Interest in 4 -grams stemmed from the observation that almost all theoretically possible 4 -grams (204) occur in natural sequences and the majority of 4 -grams are uniformly distributed. This implies that the probability of finding identical 4 -grams by random chance in unrelated sequences is low. A Bayesian probabilistic model was developed to test this hypothesis. For each protein family in Pfam-A and PIR-PSD, a feature vector called a probe was constructed from the set o...|$|E

Starting from the initial research instrument, students' answers were organized in eight categories within three clusters, organized around their perception of the utility and interest of studying History for their professional life, for general learning, and for their personal development. In more technical terms, three testlets were developed in order to better pinpoint their attitudes towards History as a subject.

40|$|AbstractMany machine {{learning}} based algorithms contain a training step {{that is done}} once. The training step is usually computational expensive since it involves processing of huge matrices. If the <b>training</b> <b>profile</b> is extracted from an evolving dynamic dataset, {{it has to be}} updated as some features of the training dataset are changed. This paper proposes a solution how to update this profile efficiently. Therefore, we investigate how to update the <b>training</b> <b>profile</b> when the data is constantly evolving. We assume that the data is modeled by a kernel method and processed by a spectral decomposition. In many algorithms for clustering and classification, a low dimensional representation of the affinity (kernel) graph of the embedded training dataset is computed. Then, it is used for classifying newly arrived data points. We present methods for updating such embeddings of the training datasets in an incremental way without the need to perform the entire computation upon the occurrences of changes in a small number of the training samples. Efficient computation of such an algorithm is critical in many web based applications...|$|R

40|$|Background. To {{investigate}} if {{the characteristics}} and <b>training</b> <b>profiles</b> of runners are significant indicators to predict a {{successful completion of}} a marathon. Methods. Experimental design: comparative investigation between two groups of runners at a marathon race. Setting: participants of the study came from the 1998 Standard Chartered New Airport International Marathon in Hong Kong. Participants: 113 runners were investigated, of which 58 runners dropped out at the first 10 km of the race, while the other 55 were those that consulted for physiothearpy service after the marathon. Measures: using questionnaire, the characteristics and the <b>training</b> <b>profiles</b> of these runners were obtained. These included weekly training distance, longest and shortest training distance per session in one week; warm-up and stretching exercise with the training sessions, number of marathons previously finished and the runners' opinion of optimal training mileage to complete a marathon. Results. Independent t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment were used to investigate {{the difference between the}} two groups, the results showed significant difference in the weekly training distance (p= 0. 00), longest and shortest training distance per week (p= 0. 00), and personal opinion on optimal weekly training distance for a marathon (p= 0. 00). Logistic regression modeling was then employed to determine variables that best predict the likelihood of completing a marathon. Conclusions. The findings indicate that the non-finishers are poorly prepared and the results also identify that the longest mileage covered per training session is the best predictor for a successful completion of a marathon with an odds of 1. 21.

40|$|Speech {{compression}} {{has become}} an integral component in all modern telecommunications networks. Numerous codecs have been developed and deployed for efficiently transmitting voice signals while maintaining high perceptual quality. Because {{of the diversity of}} speech codecs used by different carriers and networks, the ability to distinguish between different codecs lends itself {{to a wide variety of}} practical applications, including determining call provenance, enhancing network diagnostic metrics, and improving automated speaker recognition. However, few research efforts have attempted to provide a methodology for identifying amongst speech codecs in an audio signal. In this research, we demonstrate a novel approach for accurately determining the presence of several contemporary speech codecs in a non-intrusive manner. The methodology developed in this research demonstrates techniques for analyzing an audio signal such that the subtle noise components introduced by the codec processing are accentuated while most of the original speech content is eliminated. Using these techniques, an audio signal may be profiled to gather a set of values that effectively characterize the codec present in the signal. This procedure is first applied to a large data set of audio signals from known codecs to develop a set of <b>trained</b> <b>profiles.</b> Thereafter, signals from unknown codecs may be similarly profiled, and the profiles compared to each of the known <b>training</b> <b>profiles</b> in order to decide which codec is the best match with the unknown signal. Overall, the proposed strategy generates extremely favorable results, with codecs being identified correctly in nearly 95 % of all test signals. In addition, the profiling process is shown to require a very short analysis length of less than 4 seconds of audio to achieve these results. Both the identification rate and the small analysis window represent dramatic improvements over previous efforts in speech codec identification...|$|R
