50|$|The {{cross-slide}} (3) {{rides on}} the carriage {{and has a}} feedscrew that travels {{at right angles to}} the main spindle axis. This permits facing operations to be performed, and the depth of cut to be adjusted. This feedscrew can be engaged, through a gear train, to <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> <b>shaft</b> (mentioned previously) to provide automated 'power feed' movement to the cross-slide. On most lathes, only one direction can be engaged at a time as an interlock mechanism will shut out the second gear train.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} rest (or top slide) (2) is usually where {{the tool post}} is mounted. It provides a smaller amount of movement (less than the cross-slide) along its axis via another feedscrew. The {{compound rest}} axis can be adjusted independently of the carriage or cross-slide. It is used for turning tapers, to control depth of cut when screwcutting or precision facing, or to obtain finer feeds (under manual control) than <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> <b>shaft</b> permits. Usually, the compound rest has a protractor marked in its base (2b), enabling the operator to adjust its axis to precise angles.|$|E
5000|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} carriage holds the tool bit and moves it longitudinally (turning) or perpendicularly (facing) {{under the control}} of the operator. The operator moves the carriage manually via the handwheel (5a) or automatically by engaging <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> <b>shaft</b> with the carriage feed mechanism (5c). This provides some relief for the operator as the movement of the carriage becomes power assisted. The handwheels (2a, 3b, 5a) on the carriage and its related slides are usually calibrated, both for ease of use and to assist in making reproducible cuts. Calibration marks will measure either the distance from center (radius), or the work piece's diameter, so for example, on a diameter machine where calibration marks are in thousandths of an inch, the radial handwheel dial will read [...]0005 inches of radius per division, or [...]001 inches of diameter. The carriage typically comprises a top casting, known as the saddle (4), and a side casting, known as the apron (5).|$|E

Through {{woodworking}} four-side planer vibration test, {{this article}} studies its dynamic characteristics and dynamic response {{to identify the}} vibration magnitudes law of each <b>feed</b> roll <b>shafts</b> of <b>the</b> four-side <b>feed</b> beam; then finds the natural frequency and damping ratio of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> beam and lathe bed; obtains the mathematical model of <b>feed</b> roll <b>shaft</b> vibration magnitude changing with <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> rate U under different process thicknesses. <b>The</b> analysis of <b>feeding</b> quantity and <b>the</b> rationality of lathe bed {{from the perspective of}} vibration design supplies the designs and operation staff with reference data. Overview Woodworking four-side planer is the lathe bed that processes the four sides of wood simultaneously, it can process the molding surface of various shapes, mainly is used to process plate, square timber into four planes or molding surfaces vertically. Processed wood products can obtain their exact sizes, cross-sectional shapes and surface finish, and the machine is a typical process centralized multi-joint lathe. It increases the processing capacity and production efficiency, is a widely applied finishing machine in the wood processing industry.

40|$|Based on {{the concept}} of long range {{prediction}} in the context of self-tuning control theory, a generalized predictive kinetic energy controller (GPKEC) suitable for applications to high speed machining processes is developed. A three dimensional lumped mass model capable of representing both tool and workpiece dynamics in a single point turning operation on a lathe machine is first developed to accurately reflect their interactions in a machining process. Based on the linearized uncoupled one dimensional model for the machining dynamics and noting that feed can effectively be used to control the unstable machine-tool dynamics, a single-input single-output (SISO) discrete time predictive control law (GPKEC) is derived by minimizing the predicted incremental kinetic energy of the cutting process. <b>The</b> instantaneous <b>feed</b> is used as the control variable of this controller which is calculated using the feedback of instantaneous displacement of the tool tip in <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> direction. It is observed from the simulation results that the proposed GPKEC controller is capable of suppressing the unstable and marginally stable system dynamics in their incipient stages, even in the presence of uncertain disturbances. The GPKEC strategy is also found to be robust against modeling or estimation errors. In order to verify the simulation results, a number of experimental runs are carried out. An estimate of acceleration signal, instead of displacement, in <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> direction is used as feedback signal due to practical reasons. A servomotor, which is connected to <b>the</b> main <b>feed</b> drive <b>shaft</b> through a high performance timing (HPT) belt, has been used to control <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>feed</b> of a cutting process. It is observed {{that there has been a}} good agreement between the experimental and simulation results. The experimental results show that the GPKEC strategy can effectively suppress the chatter vibration in a machining process. It is also observed from experimental results that the proposed controller is robust against overparametrization, estimation errors, uncertain inputs, system noise, and even against changes in the system dynamics...|$|R
5000|$|For {{model year}} 1997, a design update {{occurred}} {{for both the}} Talon and the Eclipse that is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "2Gb". The update was primarily limited to the non-metal portions of the car. The front and rear fascias were heavily revised to incorporate more aggressive looking features. At the front, a larger air intake was created and the [...] "Eagle" [...] emblem was enlarged and embossed {{into the center of the}} bumper cap (as opposed to a badge that inset into a similarly shaped hole). At the rear, a new high-mount spoiler was introduced that projected further into the airstream, replacing the flush-mounted sickle spoiler. Added plastic moldings on the bumper caps and doors completed the revisions to the body. Lastly, on the TSi and TSi AWD models, the aluminum wheels were increased to 17 in and incorporated more angles replacing the 16 in curved 5-spoke wheel. Another important, non-cosmetic change concerned the driveline. There was a slight change in gear ratios and the number of splines on <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>feeding</b> power to <b>the</b> transfer case was altered.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to evaluate the}} technical state of a Francis turbine by shaft rotor dynamic simulation. There are several rotor dynamic criteria that define the technical state of a turbomachine. To <b>feed</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> rotor dynamic model this delivers the required information to accomplish the technical assessment. The numerical rotor dynamic model uses as input, the field forces obtained by the fluid-solid interaction analysis undertaken over the blades of the runner. The rotor dynamic numerical simulations allow to determinate the record-in-time of the displacements of any point along the shaft. This information is relevant for diagnosis tasks, because {{it is possible to}} decompose it spectrally and to estimate the severity of the vibrations. Comparing the results of the numerical model against those obtained from machines that operates under normal conditions, it is possible to determinate the technical state of the turbomachine. This allows studying the stability of the turbine working on several operation ranges. A Francis turbine is a very complex machine that involves many physical phenomena of different nature. In this way, the hydraulic input forces needed by the rotor dynamic model should not be assumed but calculated directly from the fluid interaction over the turbine structure...|$|R
50|$|The 624-acre Silver Creek Metro Park {{is tucked}} away in a quiet, rural area near Norton. Observant {{visitors}} will see traces of the past. Open fields, fence rows and a stately old barn, part of which {{dates back to the}} Civil War, are evidence of the parkâ€™s former life as the Harter Dairy Farm. Other secrets are less visible. Buried beneath the surface is a maze of tunnels and shafts - remnants of a 19th-century mining operation. The one-time farm has changed a great deal since Metro Parks acquired the land in 1966. Thousands of trees have been planted, and the bathhouse and 50-acre lake - fed by a spring from an old mine near Wall Road - were built in the early 1990s. Today, iron-laden water from <b>the</b> mine <b>shafts</b> <b>feed</b> into Silver Creek, coating the bottom of the stream with reddish-brown iron-oxide, yet fish, frogs and other animals thrive. The open fields are home to woodcocks, meadowlarks and eastern bluebirds. Many butterflies flutter among the flowers and grasses. Hawks circle overhead to hunt rabbits, mice and voles living in the grasses and weeds below. Deer travel among the woods, fields and wetlands. Tall sycamores grow in soggy areas, and hickory woods grow in drier spots. The beech-maple woods contain spring wildflowers. One of the largest northern red oaks in Summit County - 20 feet in circumference - stands in this park.|$|R

To separate <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> flow structures from the background, an objective threshold grey level was calculated. At the positions under <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> pipe, average values of several parameters characterising <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> flow have been determined. The trends in the relation between an average parameter and the position under <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> pipe are <b>the</b> same for different feed pipe openings and impeller speeds.
