40|$|This paper {{presents}} a neural <b>time-base</b> <b>generator</b> (TBG) that can generate {{a family of}} neural control signals with a controllable finite duration and bell-shaped velocity profile. Then, a bio-mimetic trajectory generation method using the neural TBG model is explained. Using the proposed model, the generation ability of human-like trajectories is examined through comparisons between computer simulations and human arm trajectories during reaching movements according to the curvature of constrained trajectories...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA {{study of the}} physics of the piano reveals that while the upper partials of the steel strings are the eigen-frequencies of the complex tone, they are not integer multiples of the respective fundamentals. To properly measure and tune these eigen-partials, a digital filter capable of sweeping {{a major portion of}} the audio-frequency spectrum had to be implemented. Such a filter, a tuneable fixed-coefficient digital filter, is discussed as well as a simple pole-zero design procedure for determining the required coefficients. Each module, including the frequency deviation detector and counter, the <b>time-base</b> <b>generator,</b> the digital filter, the reference frequency generator and the display and control module, of the proposed tuner is illustrated and discussed[URL] Hall of Fame author (Presented May 23, 2009) Second Lieutenant, United States Marine Corp...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Image {{acquisition}} and processing for closed-loop control purposes {{is known as}} visual servoing. There are fundamental scientific problems here, the most important perhaps is conceptual, since the image is a static variable {{in the formulation of}} the problem. The technological challenges is the time delay induced by the CCD camera itself. In this paper, the exper-imental validation of a decentralized non-linear PID-like structure of a visual feedback controller under an uncalibrated fixed-camera configuration [7] is addressed in this paper. By using the projection algorithm as an adaptive prediction technique, our scheme evades the time delay problem associated CCD cameras. Addition-ally, finite-time tracking is ensured provided that a <b>time-base</b> <b>generator</b> models a time-varying feedback gain. Since no regressor is computed and robot dynamics is only considered in the stability analysis, the system is very inexpensive in comparison to the few dynamic visual servoing controllers available in the literature. The high performance of the proposed controller has been tested successfully in real time on a direct drive robot that tracks a desired image-based trajectories, using a IEEE 1394 standard camera.

Computer-controlled, polynomial-driven <b>time-base</b> and pseudonoise <b>generator</b> enables {{radar system}} to achieve range resolution of about 80 m with radar pulses of 1 -s duration. Normally, unmodulated 1 -s pulse has relatively coarse range resolution {{of several thousand}} kilometers. Radar system effectively compresses modulated pulse into one of 100 -ns pseudonoise-modulating pulses. Intended primarily for use with interplanetary radar, time-base/pseudonoise concept proves useful in test instruments or in time-base correction for video recording...|$|R
40|$|This handout is {{intended}} to provide a brief technical overview of the lab instruments which we will be using in 6. 002 : the oscilloscope, multimeter, function generator, and the protoboard. It incorporates much of the material found in the individual instrument manuals, while including some background information as to how each of the instruments work. The goal of this handout is {{to serve as a}} reference of common lab procedures and terminology, while trying to build technical intuition about each instrument's functionality and familiarizing students with their use. Students with previous lab experience might find it helpful to simply skim over the handout and focus only on unfamiliar sections and terminology. THE OSCILLOSCOPE The oscilloscope is an electronic instrument based on the cathode ray tube (CRT) – not unlike the picture tube of a television set – which is capable of generating a graph of an input signal versus a second variable. In most applications the vertical (Y) axis represents voltage and the horizontal (X) axis represents time (although other configurations are possible). Essentially, the oscilloscope consists of four main parts: an electron gun, a <b>time-base</b> <b>generator</b> (that serves as a clock), two sets of deflection plates used to steer the electron beam, and a phosphorescent screen which lights up when struck by electrons. The electron gun, deflection plates, and the phosphorescent screen are all enclosed by a glass envelope which has been sealed and evacuated. The visible part of the CRT tube, the "screen", is the outside of the glass wall on whose inner surface lies the phosphorescent film. The screen is inscribed with a set of axes enclosed by a grid.
