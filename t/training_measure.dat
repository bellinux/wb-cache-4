40|$|Aim: The use of {{external}} and internal load is {{an important aspect of}} monitoring systems in team sport. The aim {{of this study was to}} validate a novel measure of training load by quantifying the training-performance relationship of elite Australian footballers. Methods: The primary <b>training</b> <b>measure</b> of each of 36 players was weekly load derived from a weighted combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) data and perceived wellness over a 24 -week season. Smoothed loads representing an exponentially weighted rolling average were derived with decay time constants of 1. 5, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. Differential loads representing rate of change in load were generated in similar fashion. Other derived measures of training included monotony, strain and acute:chronic ratio. Performance was a proprietary score derived from match performance indicators. Effects of a 1 SD within-player change below and above the mean of each <b>training</b> <b>measure</b> were quantified with a quadratic mixed model for each position (defenders, forwards, midfielders, and rucks). Effects were interpreted using standardization and magnitude-based inferences. Results: Performance was generally highest near the mean or ~ 1 SD below the mean of each <b>training</b> <b>measure,</b> and 1 SD increases in the following measures produced small impairments: weekly load (defenders, forwards, and midfielders); 1. 5 -week smoothed load (midfielders); 4 -week differential load (defenders, forwards, and midfielders); and acute:chronic ratio (defenders and forwards). Effects of other measures in other positions were either trivial or unclear. Conclusion: The innovative combination of load was sensitive to performance in this elite Australian football cohort. Periods of high acute load and sustained increases in load impaired match performance. Positional differences should be taken into account for individual training prescription...|$|E

Evidence reviewed by Calmfors et al. (2001) suggests that the reduced employment probability during participation may even outweigh the positive treatment effect after participation. Lechner et al.

Three years after programme entry her results imply positive effects on the participants’ shares in unsubsidized employment of around 20 to 40 percentage points, but a considerably lower reduction of their unemployment rate as comparison persons withdraw from the labour market more often. Similarly, people taking up a subsidized job {{during the first two}} quarters of 2002 were investigated as part of the Hartz evaluation (Jaenichen and Stephan 2011 ZEW et al. 2006). Three years after the start of the subsidy, 40 to 70 per cent of recipients were in regular employment and their employment rate was 20 to 40 percentage points higher than for the comparison group of similar unemployed persons. Again, effects in terms of avoiding unemployment were much lower. In particular older unemployed comparison persons in West Germany seemed to use retirement as an alternative. As hiring subsidies are often combined with a preceding short-term <b>training</b> <b>measure</b> within a firm, the authors also asked whether there is an additional advantage of a subsequent subsidy in comparison to short-term training only. While they found positive treatment effects of an additional subsidy, effects are smaller than those from estimates which were not conditional on the participation in a short-term <b>training</b> <b>measure.</b> Furthermore, ZEW et al.

30|$|Assessing wage {{returns to}} {{intensity}} of training, rather than incidence of training, provides additional {{insights into the}} effectiveness of employer-sponsored adult training in Canada. We measure intensity of training as {{the total number of}} hours spent in course enrollment in each of the panel years. As the intensity of <b>training</b> <b>measure</b> is a continuous variable, we implement generalized propensity scores (GPS) with continuous treatments (Hirano and Imbens 2004) to estimate dose–response functions on wage growth. The GPS is defined as the conditional probability of receiving a particular level of treatment ‘t’ (hours of training) conditional on the same set of baseline covariates X used in section 6.1. Identification of causal effects follows after invoking the standard unconfoundedness assumption used in the binary-treatment case, but this time, it is weakly defined at the ‘local’ treatment level of interest ‘t’. Applications of the GPS approach in the context of training programs can be found in Kluve et al. (2012) and Galdo and Chong (2012).|$|E
30|$|Fifth, this {{literature}} shows higher returns to adult training for men relative to women (e.g., Parent 2003 and Hui and Smith 2001, Zhang and Palameta 2006), although {{the evidence is}} far from conclusive as the wage differences by gender are modest and dependent on the <b>training</b> <b>measure.</b> For example, while Drolet (2002) reported positive impacts on the wages of men (but not women) for measures of intensity of training, Havet (2006) reports statistically significant results for women (but not for men) for measures of incidence of training. Finally, and given that our research design {{is based on the}} SLID data, it is important to notice in Table  1 that there are only two government reports by Zhang and Palameta (2006) and Drewes (2008) that employed this dataset to address wage returns to adult education and training in Canada. The former used two complete but early panels, from 1993 – 1998 and 1996 – 2001, while the latter used a more restricted period of analysis, 2002 – 2004 data. The picture that emerges from these government reports suggests that formal adult education and training in Canada has positive and statistically significant returns, ranging between 3 and 10 percent.|$|E

40|$|The Rhine River {{catchment}} {{was heavily}} trained {{over the past}} decades and faced {{the construction of the}} Rhine weir cascade, flood protection dikes and detention basins. For the same time period, several studies detected positive trends in flood flows and faced the challenge of flood trend attribution, i. e. identifying the drivers of observed change. The presented study addresses the question about the responsible drivers for changes in annual maximum daily flows at Rhine gauges starting from Maxau down to Lobith. In particular, the role of river <b>training</b> <b>measures</b> including the Rhine weir cascade and a series of detention basins in enhancing Rhine floods was investigated. By applying homogenisation relationships to the original flow records in the period from 1952 till 2009, the annual maximum series were computed that would have been recorded had river <b>training</b> <b>measures</b> not been in place. Using multiple trend analysis, the relative changes in the homogenised time series were found to be smaller up to about 20 % points compared to the original records. This effect is attributable to the river <b>training</b> <b>measures</b> and primarily to the construction of the Rhine weir cascade. The increase in Rhine flood discharges was partly caused by the unfavourable superposition of the Rhine and Neckar flood waves. It resulted from the acceleration of the Rhine waves due to construction of the weir cascade. However, at the same time, the tributary flows across the entire Upper and Lower Rhine, which enhance annual Rhine peaks, showed very strong positive trends. This suggests the dominance of a large-scale driver such as climate variability/change which acted along with river training. In particular, the analysis suggests that the river <b>training</b> <b>measures</b> fell in a period with increasing flood trends driven by factors other than river training of the Rhine main channel...|$|R

As expected, across all runners, men reported greater competitiveness with two previously validated instruments, greater competitiveness on a new elite competitiveness scale, and greater training volume, a known correlate of competitiveness. Among faster runners, the sex difference decreased for one measure of competitiveness but did not decrease for the two other competitiveness measures or either measure of training volume. Across NCAA athletic divisions (DI, DII, DIII), the sex difference did not decrease for any competitiveness or <b>training</b> <b>measure.</b> Further analyses showed that these sex differences could not be attributed to women suffering more injuries or facing greater childcare responsibilities.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents for}} the first time panel evidence on the performance and wage effects of middle mangers' training in Italy. It also offers an analysis of the determinants of training by investigating the relationship between training provision and firm characteristics. It is based on a rich and reliable panel dataset covering Italian firms for the years 2006 - 2011. Several estimation techniques and model specifications are implemented to argue that middle mangers' training significantly increases productivity and to prove the existence of a 'too-much-of a good' thing effect. Similarly a simulation of the wage effects of training shows how the positive magnitude of the coefficients seems to be severely affected by the <b>training</b> <b>measure</b> used. All the analysis implemented suggests the importance of firm's size and geographic location in explaining training provision, firm's performance, and wages. Indeed larger firms and firms located in Northern Italy appear to be more likely to offer training of higher intensity, quality and variety. Furthermore training is found to be more effective for what concerns business results and individual wages. This might suggest that medium-small firms and firms located in Southern areas could be trapped in a circle of scarce, low quality and standardised training provision with obvious implications on its efficiency and returns. ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Employment Promotion Act (GDR) on 01. 07. 1990, short-time working benefit was put to use as an employment and <b>training</b> <b>measure</b> in eastern Germany, too. In particular in the first year after reunification it contributed on a large scale to relieving the pressure on the labour market in quantitative terms: at times some 2 million people, that was at that time about a quarter of all those in employment in the new federal states, were working short-time with an average of over 50 % loss of working time. Since then changes in regulations as well as economic and institutional adjustment processes have brought about a steady decrease. At {{the end of the first}} six months of 1996 the statistics still revealed some 61, 000 recipients of short-time working benefit. Using statistical data and findings from the labour market monitor, this article provides an over-view of the utilisation and effect of short-time working in the new federal states. By drawing comparisons with the development in the old federal states, it is possible to show the convergence trend. At the same time, in connection with this some rather fundamental questions regarding the function of short-time working benefit are mentioned and experiences are reappraised.

In addition to short-term and medium-term follow-up surveys (six months and one year after the end of rehabilitation), it also became necessary to organise long-term follow-up surveys (three and more {{years after the end of}} rehabilitation) as a result of the general decline on the labour market and the associated increase in the length of the reintegration process.

40|$|Patient {{safety is}} an active field of {{research}} in medicine and {{the driving force behind}} healthcare policy and practices to ensure the delivery of safe, quality patient care. However, it is a concept in its infancy in the veterinary profession. Veterinary medical error is under reported, poorly understood and inadequately managed with consequences for patients, owners and clinicians. The aim of this thesis is to explore the causes and types of error in veterinary practice and develop solutions to improve patient safety, and by extension quality of care for veterinary patients. A mixed methodology was employed in the investigation of this aim, with data gathered by focus groups, insurance claim review and questionnaires. The findings of the study suggest that the causes of error in veterinary practice mirror those in other safety critical industries, namely individual errors and system failures. These findings {{led to the development of}} a reliable, validated safety culture survey for veterinary practice, to assess and understand the attitudes which drive safety critical behaviours of veterinary staff.
