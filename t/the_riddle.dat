5|$|The Philistines were infuriated by <b>the</b> <b>riddle.</b> The thirty groomsmen told Samson's {{new wife}} {{that they would}} burn her and her father's {{household}} {{if she did not}} discover the answer to <b>the</b> <b>riddle</b> and tell it to them. At the urgent and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson told her the solution, and she told it to the thirty groomsmen.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{testing has}} shown that Kiger Mustang is a {{descendant}} of the Spanish horse. Many of today's Kiger Mustangs {{can be traced back}} to a single stallion named Mesteño, captured with the original herd in 1977 and released back to the Kiger HMA. Several organizations exist which inspect and register Kiger Mustangs; each has their own standards for entry into the stud book. In 1988, the Kiger Mustang Association (now the Kiger Mesteño Association) was formed as the original registry for the herd. By 2013, the organization had registered around 800 horses, and annually inspects between 75 and 100 new horses. Two other associations are the Steens Mountain Kiger Registry, established in 1993, and the Kiger Horse Association and Registry. The Kiger Mustangs of <b>the</b> <b>Riddle</b> Mountain and Kiger HMAs are the best known herds of mustangs in Oregon, despite making up only a small portion of the population. As of 2013, the state had a total estimated BLM-managed feral horse population of almost 2,600, roaming over 17 HMAs and a Wild Horse Territory co-managed with the US Forest Service. A census taken in April 2010 found 60 Kiger Mustangs in <b>the</b> <b>Riddle</b> Mountain HMA and 81 in the Kiger HMA; estimates made in February 2013 list 40 horses in Riddle Mountain and 61 in Kiger.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>riddle</b> {{of water}} and {{nutrient}} transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E
5000|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> were {{crammed into}} {{the pages of the}} {{manuscript}} with hardly any organization, many of <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> vary in structure. <b>The</b> boundaries between <b>riddles</b> were often unclear and translations are relatively rough. The object of <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> is generally preserved despite these possible errors. Notably, not a single one of <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> found in <b>the</b> Exeter book were accompanied with answers. In fact, some remain unanswered to this day, such as Riddle 91: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> have religious themes and answers. Some {{of the religious}} contexts within <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> are [...] "manuscript book (or Bible)," [...] "soul and body," [...] "fish and river" [...] (fish are often used to symbolize Christ). <b>The</b> <b>riddles</b> also were written about common objects, and even animals were used as inspiration for some of <b>the</b> <b>riddles.</b> One example of a typical, religious riddle is Riddle 41, which describes the soul and body: ...|$|R
5000|$|While the Exeter Book {{was found}} in a cathedral library, and while it is clear that {{religious}} scribes worked on <b>the</b> <b>riddles,</b> not all of <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> in <b>the</b> book are religiously themed. Many of the answers to <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> are everyday, common objects. There are also many double entendres, which can lead to an answer that is obscene. One example of this is Riddle 23: ...|$|R
5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of <b>the</b> <b>riddle</b> game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than {{the content of the}} riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Discovery of the Kiger Mustang was {{the result}} of a BLM Mustang roundup in the Beatys Butte area in Harney County in 1977. During the roundup, it was noticed that among the horses {{collected}} from the area, there was a group with similar color and markings. DNA testing by the University of Kentucky showed close relation to the Spanish horses brought to the Americas in the 17th century. These distinct horses were separated from the other horses and the BLM placed two groups in separate areas of Steens Mountain to preserve the breed. Seven horses were placed in <b>the</b> <b>Riddle</b> Mountain Herd Management Area (HMA) and twenty in the Kiger HMA.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphs {{retained}} their pictorial appearance, {{and classical}} authors emphasised this aspect, {{in sharp contrast}} to the Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote Hieroglyphica, an explanation of almost 200 glyphs. His work was believed to be authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga in the 18th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called <b>the</b> <b>riddle</b> of the Sphinx.|$|E
5000|$|Some others try {{to extract}} letters from <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> {{to form a}} [...] "super riddle". Their {{reasoning}} is based on Valentin's public answers about [...] "remainders", and {{the solution of the}} 600 page. Since the atomic masses left some letters behind (the [...] "s" [...] inside [...] "Cl.Es.F"), it is theorized that other unique letters must exist. But the book does not provide any clear system with which to extract letters from <b>the</b> <b>riddles,</b> and devising a rule that works for all <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> is complicated, as <b>the</b> <b>riddles</b> consist of varying amounts of text and numbers.|$|R
