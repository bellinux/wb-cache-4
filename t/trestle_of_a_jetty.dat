50|$|Community {{lobbying}} for <b>a</b> <b>jetty</b> commenced in 1879: the people believed that deep {{water in the}} bay would provide safer anchorage than other nearby locations. Eventually in 1882 construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jetty</b> was undertaken by Frank George. Originally 155 metres long, it provided <b>a</b> depth <b>of</b> 2.1 metres at low tide. When lime burning became an established industry at Wool Bay the jetty was extended by a further 18 metres in anticipation of increased use. During this time, a steamship service dropped off and picked up provisions three times a week. When bulk-handling of grain was introduced at Port Giles in 1970, Wool Bay's importance as a port dwindled.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} June to the {{beginning}} of July 2009, archaeological television programme Time Team investigated the Roman remains of Piercebridge Roman Fort and the supposed Roman bridge, and it is now suspected that the remains on the south bank are not a bridge at all, but the footings <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jetty,</b> and that the location of the Roman bridge is unknown. A similar view had previously been suggested by Raymond Selkirk. Gravel extraction in the 1940s and later landfill and landscaping on the south bank have hampered archaeology.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of arrival {{processes}} on the ship handling process. Two types of arrival processes are considered: controlled and uncontrolled. Simulation results show that uncontrolled arrivals of ships perform worst {{in terms of both}} ship delays and required storage capacity. Stock-controlled arrivals perform best with regard to large vessel delays and storage capacity. The combination of stock-controlled arrivals for large vessels and equidistant arrivals for barges also performs better than the uncontrolled process. Careful allocation of ships to the mooring points <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jetty</b> further improves the efficiency. supply chain management;logistics;simulation;transportation;case study...|$|R

[...] The two mining operations were consolidated {{under the control}} of one company, the Waratah Gypsum Pty Ltd, at a time during the late 1920s or the 1930s. It is reported that 6000000 LT of gypsum was extracted from sites at Marion, Inneston and Spider Lakes between the years 1905 and 1973. In 1970, mining continued on land not included in Innes National Park and is reported as ceasing sometime immediately prior to 2003.|$|R

Other restoration activities included removal of polluted silt, de-weeding of the entire lake surface, removing 30 cm of silt from the lake, restoration of feeder channels, construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jetty</b> to start boating facility, and the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bridge to the newly created 'butterfly park'. A watch tower was also constructed to view the birds and study their behaviour. A giant fountain which can spew water up to 40 feet has been recently added as an attraction. <b>A</b> nursery <b>of</b> medicinal plants is also present here.|$|R

Measures against sand deposition inside the port were investigated and the most appropriate measure found for preventing sand deposition was the extension <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>jetty</b> by 100 m {{at the tip of}} the west breakwater.

It was at time that, among others, the German ship Hohenfels fell into British hands and became Empire Kamal.|$|R
