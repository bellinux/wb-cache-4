5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones at <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E

50|$|SPAs {{have not}} been shown to {{directly}} modify DNA or have activity other than direct blocking of other factors or processes. However, modifying agents can be bound to <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hairpin structure. The specific binding of the SPA to DNA allows for site-specific targeting of the conjugated modifying agent. SPAs have been paired with the DNA-alkylating moieties cyclopropylpyrroloindole and chlorambucil that were able to damage and crosslink SV40 DNA. This effect inhibited cell cycling and growth. Chlorambucil, a chemotherapeutic agent, was more effective when conjugated to an SPA than without.|$|R
5|$|Tropical Depression Ten {{formed from}} the complex {{interaction}} between an upper-level low, a tropical wave that produced Tropical Storm Ingrid, and <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a cold front. By September17, the system produced widespread thunderstorm activity over The Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level {{low over the}} Florida Panhandle increased convection across the area, and on September18 the system began crossing Florida. Initially very disorganized, surface pressures gradually decreased across the region, with a weak low-pressure area developing on September19.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Ten was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that made landfall on the Florida Panhandle in September2007. The system {{developed as a}} subtropical depression on September21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the interaction of a tropical wave, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a cold front, and an upper-level low. Initially containing a poorly defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned into a tropical depression after convection increased over the center. Tracking northwestward, the depression moved ashore near Fort Walton Beach early on September22 and dissipated over southeastern Alabama shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|John Henry Johnson (November 24, 1929 – June 3, 2011) was a {{gridiron}} football {{running back}} {{known for his}} excellence at the fullback position as both a runner and a blocker.

5|$|Through {{the first}} months of 1918, the {{composition}} of Battleship Division Nine changed to reflect the lessons learned from operating in a war zone with the Grand Fleet. It soon became apparent that with only four ships, the division could not maintain the level of preparedness required by the constant need to be ready to sail at limited notice. The inevitable result was machinery breakdowns that reduced the squadron to three ships, a development considered unacceptable given the Division's important position at <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the battle line. The British—faced with the same problem—responded by allocating a spare battleship to each of their squadrons. In this way, each squadron always remained at full strength even when a ship was being repaired.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, a new fastest lap of the track ever at 1:36.006. However, he also came under investigation of the stewards as he failed to obliged the rules set for turn 2, rejoining the track earlier than allowed after running wide. After being summoned to the stewards at the end of qualifying, he walked away with a reprimand, but was not penalised. Behind Rosberg in second place, the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen were third and fourth respectively. At <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the field, three pairs of cars were eliminated: both Sauber, Manor and Renault drivers missed Q2.|$|E
5|$|These {{events are}} at <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the long GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They {{have been proposed}} to form a separate class, caused {{by the collapse of}} a blue supergiant star, a tidal disruption event or a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may be a result of low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} system on <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a stationary cold front organized into a subtropical depression on August 8 near the South Carolina coast, and drifted southward. Convection became more organized, and {{the storm was}} classified Tropical Depression Three on August 10 over the Bahamas. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status on August 11, based on reports from Hurricane Hunters. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs in its path. A trough of {{low pressure}} near Bermuda initially inhibited strengthening. However, after high pressures to its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane on August 22. Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance of an eye feature on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast into the cold waters of the north Atlantic Ocean, and on August 23 it became extratropical about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating on August 28 over Spain.|$|E
50|$|Some helmets {{retain a}} {{symbolic}} ribbon at the back, which dates from mounted hunting. Traditionally, black ribbon {{was used for}} fox hunting or general hunting, with red ribbon used when stag hunting or arme blanche hunting. The ribbon was “sewn up” (i.e. with a bow {{at the base of}} the helmet and <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ribbon either cut off or glued pointing upwards on the body of the helmet) for “common” riders. The ribbon was “sewn down” (i.e. with <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> dangling from <b>the</b> bow, below the edge of the helmet) for hunt masters and hunt staff. Because any rider is entitled to wear a sewn up black ribbon, this is the standard for modern helmets retaining the ribbon. The use of “sewn down” ribbons by those not entitled to them sometimes occurs in the United States but is considered a serious transgression by traditionalists.|$|R

Ferritin particles were found to attach to the head parts of calspectin dimers at a position 10 - 20 nm {{from the top of}} the head. The number of the calmodulin-binding sites seemed to be only one for each dimer and two for each tetramer.
