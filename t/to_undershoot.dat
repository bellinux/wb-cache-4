R.C. had espied a big black bear walking a slide some four hundred yards down the canyon slope, and forgetting that he had a heavy close-range shell in his rifle instead of one of high trajectory, he had aimed accordingly, <b>to</b> <b>undershoot</b> half a foot and thus lose his opportunity. Nielsen had been lost most of the day. It seemed everywhere he heard yells and bays down in the canyon, and once he had heard a loud rattling crash of a heavy bear tearing through the thicket. Edd told of the fearful climb he and his father had made, how they had shot at the grizzly a long way off, how funny another bear had rolled around in his bed across the canyon. But the hounds got too tired to hold the trails late in the day. And lastly Edd said: [...] "When you an' Ben were smokin' the grizzly I could hear the bullets hit close above us, an' I was sure scared stiff for fear you'd roll him down on us. But father wasn't scared. He said, 'let the old Jasper roll down! We'll assassinate him!'" ...|$|E

50|$|SEVC-d {{has a major}} {{advantage}} over SEVC-c in allowing the experimenter to measure membrane potential, and, as it obviates passing current and measuring voltage at the same time, there is never a series resistance error. The main disadvantages are that the time resolution is limited and the amplifier is unstable. If it passes too much current, so that the goal voltage is over-shot, it reverses the polarity of the current in the next duty cycle. This causes it <b>to</b> <b>undershoot</b> the target voltage, so the next cycle reverses the polarity of the injected current again. This error can grow with each cycle until the amplifier oscillates out of control (“ringing”); this usually results {{in the destruction of}} the cell being recorded. The investigator wants a short duty cycle to improve temporal resolution; the amplifier has adjustable compensators that will make the electrode voltage decay faster, but, if these are set too high the amplifier will ring, so the investigator is always trying to “tune” the amplifier as close to the edge of uncontrolled oscillation as possible, in which case small changes in recording conditions can cause ringing. There are two solutions: to “back off” the amplifier settings into a safe range, or to be alert for signs that the amplifier is about to ring.|$|E

50|$|Second, when on a northerly heading and a turn {{towards the}} {{east or west}} is made, the magnet causes the compass to lag behind the actual heading the {{aircraft}} is flying through. This lag will slowly diminish as the aircraft approaches either east or west and will be approximately correct when on an east or west heading. When the aircraft turns further towards South, the magnetic compass needle will tend to lead the actual heading of the aircraft. When a turn is made from south to an east or west heading the compass will lead the actual heading the aircraft is flying through, it will diminish as the aircraft approaches either east or west, and it will lag as the aircraft turns further towards North. This happens in a coordinated turn because {{of the bank of}} the aircraft and resulting bank of the compass. The North-seeking pole of the magnet is pulled towards the earth's magnetic field in the turn. This results in an angular displacement of the compass. The magnitude of the lead/lag will be approximately equal to the aircraft's latitude. (An aircraft at 30° north latitude will need <b>to</b> <b>undershoot</b> 30° while turning directly north, and overshoot 30° while turning directly south) The pilots community uses acronym UNOS (undershoot North overshoot South) to memorize this rule. Some other acronyms which pilots find easier to remember is NOSE (North Opposite, South Exceeds), OSUN (Overshoot South, Undershoot North), and South Leads, North Lags in the southern hemisphere This guideline is based not on a standard-rate turn, but on a bank angle of 15°-18°, which would equal a standard rate turn at the airspeeds typical of light aircraft.|$|E

Firstly, we give weighted fair share from the very beginning, i.e., we estimate traffic loads of all APs in a distributed manner and distribute the transmission intervals to the contending APs according to this weighted estimation. Secondly, to avoid transmission overlapping, we use undershooting, e.g., the least traffic load estimation; the estimation process involves one hop neighborhood information exploitation only. Thirdly, the undershooting again helps PowerNap to reduce transmission overlapping among the APs unlike SleepWell and thus promotes fairness; and fourthly, the unused portions (created due <b>to</b> <b>undershooting)</b> of transmission rounds are also distributed in a weighted manner, and thus, it maintains good level of network throughput. Finally, we also address the existing hidden terminal problems in our algorithm.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{primarily}} concerned with assessing the bias of the CNB’s predictions in re-lation <b>to</b> <b>undershooting</b> of the inflation target. We conclude that the inflation prediction error has decreased over time. We further point out that GDP growth and interest rates were, respectively, {{above and below the}} forecast most of the time, even in a situation of systematic undershooting of the target. Thus, the undershooting cannot be explained with the help of standard demand mechanisms. Positive supply impulses were admittedly underestimated in the past. According to our findings, about half of the apparent target undershooting in 2003 was due to errors in the predictions of exogenous factors (foreign interest rates, GDP, and inflation). As follows from the distribution of the inflation pre-diction errors across separate price segments, overpredictions of inflation during most of the period under review were due to mistakes in the prediction of food prices and core CPI ex food, while prediction errors in energy prices mostly fostered convergence to the target. The prediction errors in regulated prices acted in both directions. 1...|$|R

Saccadic eye movements were recorded and experimental trials were compared with control, unstimulated trials. Magnetic stimulation was triggered in 70 % of the trials selected randomly.

40|$|In {{the former}} Soviet Union and {{throughout}} Eastern Europe, black-market exchange rates and second-economy prices often are interpreted by policy-makers as indicative of post-reform levels. However, these exchange rates and prices can provide highly-biased signals for policy setting.

This paper traces the paths and biases in black-market exchange rates, second-economy prices, hoarding stocks, and privately-held dollars balances after policy-initiatives or other changes in the economic environment are implemented. The stimuli studied are official exchange-rate adjustments, price reforms, foreign-aid packages, altered risks of monetary confiscation or currency reforms, and goods-supply related initiatives.

We simulated motion towards a surface with hyperstereopsis and compared judgements of time to contact with that under normal stereopsis as well as under binocular viewing without stereopsis. We simulated approach of a large, random-field textured and found that time to contact estimates were shorter under the hyperstereoscopic condition than those under normal stereo and no stereo, indicating that hyperstereopsis may cause observers to underestimate time to contact leading operators <b>to</b> <b>undershoot</b> the ground plane when landing. <br /...|$|E

25|$|The {{change in}} the MR signal from {{neuronal}} activity is called the hemodynamic response (HDR). It lags the neuronal events triggering it {{by a couple of}} seconds, since it takes a while for the vascular system to respond to the brain's need for glucose.

If the neurons keep firing, say from a continuous stimulus, the peak spreads to a flat plateau while the neurons stay active. After activity stops, the BOLD signal falls below the original level, the baseline, a phenomenon called the undershoot. Over time the signal recovers to the baseline.

The authors expect that Czech exports will be positively influenced by an accelerating growth in the EU, but not to such an extent to compensate fully for the increase of Czech domestic demand. The imbalance of the current account will be covered with the record inflow of foreign direct investment in 2000.

The possibility of using charm data in polarized electron-proton collisions to constrain the polarized gluon density in the proton is also discussed. Charm quarks are copiously produced at HERA. Total cross sections in photoproduction have been measured [1, 2], and appear to be in reasonable agreement with next-to-leading order QCD calculations [3, 4, 5, 6].

In this study, it was investigated whether the so-called post-stimulus BOLD signal undershoot is solely a passive vascular effect or actively induced by neural responses. Prolonged static and flickering black-white checkerboard stimulation with isoluminant grey screen as baseline condition were employed on eight human subjects. Within the same region of interest, the positive BOLD time courses for static and flickering stimuli were identical over the entire stimulus duration. In contrast, the static stimuli exhibited no post-stimulus BOLD signal undershoot whereas the flickering stimuli caused a strong BOLD post-stimulus <b>undershoot.</b> <b>To</b> ease the interpretation, we performed an additional study measuring both BOLD signal and cerebral blood flow (CBF) using arterial spin labeling (ASL).
