Signifying the ship's importance the launch had been planned to be a large elaborate festive event, however as the court was still in mourning for Queen Alexandra's father who had died twelve days before, she did not attend and a more sober event occurred.|$|E
5|$|Brentwood Academy {{sued the}} {{association}} over this action. Brentwood {{argued that the}} enforcement of the rule constituted state action which they claimed violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The school asserted that their due process rights had been violated because there were no evidentiary hearings to determine the validity of the claim that they inappropriately recruited football players. Further, they argued that the rule violated their freedom of speech because it restricted <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> Academy could recruit. In July 1998, the District Court agreed with this argument and granted summary judgement to the Academy, while enjoining the association from enforcing the rule. A year later, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the actions of the association did not constitute 'state action'. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari of the case to review this question.|$|E

25|$|Although Les Demoiselles had an {{enormous}} and profound influence on modern art, its impact was not immediate, and the painting stayed in Picasso's studio for many years. At first, only Picasso's intimate circle of artists, dealers, collectors and friends {{were aware of the}} work. While many were shocked and some outraged, influential people such as Georges Braque and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler were supportive. Soon after the late summer of 1907, Picasso and his long-time lover Fernande Olivier (1881–1966) had a parting of <b>the</b> <b>ways.</b> <b>The</b> re-painting of the two heads on the far right of Les Demoiselles fueled speculation that it was an indication of the split between Picasso and Olivier.

500|$|Louis Dupré differentiates between {{signs and}} symbols, proposing that a sign points to {{something}} while a symbol represents it. A symbol holds its own meaning: {{rather than merely}} pointing someone towards another object, it {{takes the place of}} and represents that object. He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign. Dupré believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself. A symbol reveals a reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> current reality is perceived. Dupré differentiates between religious and aesthetic symbols, suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which [...] "remains forever beyond our reach". He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it.|$|E

Writing for The Huffington Post {{at the time of}} the film's release, Religion News Service reporter Steve Rabey referred to [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] as a song that [...] "illuminates [...] theology and sense of artistic vocation", and he said of the former Beatle: [...] "his greatest legacy may be the way his decades-long spiritual quest shaped <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> West looks at God, gurus and life."

500|$|American rapper B.o.B is {{featured}} on an official remix of [...] "Blow" [...] that was released to iTunes on May 17, 2011.

[...] Following this verse Kesha proclaims [...] "We are taking over", before the track resumes as it normally would without B.o.B's addition. Scott Shetler from PopCrush criticized the remix for not technically being a remix, rather being just the original song with added verses. Shetler wrote [...] "the term 'remix' makes us imagine all <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> song could be creatively re-arranged. And a fun song like ‘Blow,’ with its brash lyrics and skittering beat, holds endless remix possibilities. But this version doesn’t substantially improve the original."

500|$|In Michell's opinion, Austen was a [...] "proto-feminist" [...] who {{possessed a}} [...] "clear-sighted vision of <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> world is tilted against women". As evidence, Michell cites a book {{scene in which}} Anne {{discusses}} how songs and proverbs about women's fickleness were all written by men. Scholz argues that Anne's marginal status as {{a woman in the}} film is linked to that of the servants; the parallel between class and gender is conveyed with Anne's trip to Uppercross in a cart containing animals. Julianne Pidduck adds that the director [...] "pointedly foregrounds themes of class and gendered social constraint by juxtaposing the stuffy interiors of mannered society with the inviting, open horizons of the sea". As an example, Pidduck discusses Anne's stay in a gated residence in Bath, where she gazes out of an upper story window in search for Wentworth on the streets below. To her, Wentworth and the sea represent freedom and possibility.|$|E

500|$|Carey's second book, Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome, {{examines}} {{developments in}} the study of junk DNA, or noncoding DNA. DNA that doesn't code for proteins has been dismissed as nonfunctional until recently. [...] She explains the [...] "most fundamental reason for the shift in emphasis is the sheer volume of junk DNA that our cells contain. One of the biggest shocks when the human genome sequence was completed in 2001 was the discovery that over 98 per cent of the DNA in a human is junk. It doesn't code for any proteins." [...] Carey describes how this Junk DNA maintains the integrity of our chromosomes; regulates <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> protein-coding genes are expressed; influences how we age and generally introduces incredible degrees of subtlety and flexibility into how we use the relatively small numbers of genes that code for proteins... contributes to all sorts of situations, from the correct control of gene expression in female cells to the regulation of pathways that drive cancer. [...] From Ernest Hemingway's mutant cat to exoneration of the innocent through DNA fingerprinting, junk DNA impacts on an astonishing range of biological phenomena.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. {{frequently}} {{uses its}} economic power {{in order to}} punish other countries. [...] One of <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food. [...] Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they {{can be broken down}} into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives. [...] The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S. [...] An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government. [...] More examples related to the containment objective would be no aid to communist countries, socialist governments, countries who support radical regimes, regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti-communist (effectively), and countries who will not accept U.S. agreements. [...] An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically. [...] The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.|$|E

[...] He praised all aspects of the game, commenting, [...] "the cohesiveness of its striking visual presentation, soundtrack and effects, and almost entirely incomprehensible story combine to create an atmosphere of peculiar strength." [...] Onyett concluded his preview of the game by stating, [...] "it's a pleasure to experience, and never ceases to delight and surprise over its short run." [...] Anthony Burch from Destructoid gave a positive review, stating that it [...] "is so stylistically unified, so consistently cool and weird and imaginative, that it's damn near impossible not to fall in love with—even as the game ends and you're wondering what the hell happened, and why." [...] He also applauded several technical and design aspects of the game, expressing appreciation for the game's [...] "stylistic choices", as well as the [...] "nigh unbelievable" [...] bloom effects featured in the game.

While Bubblegum is resistant to embrace magical ways of thinking, by the episode's end, she realizes that [...] "magic has its uses". Moynihan later noted on his personal website that, [...] "in helping to write the episode, it wasn’t important (for me) to impart an idea of who is right or wrong about magic and science {{in the land of}} Ooo. It was important to impart the idea of a complex and contradictory fantasy."
