40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in using ultrasonic guided waves to assess the structural degradation of above-ground storage <b>tank</b> <b>floors.</b> This is a non-invasive and economically viable means of assessing structural degradation. Above-ground storage <b>tank</b> <b>floors</b> are ageing assets which need to be inspected periodically to avoid structural failure. At present, normal-stress type transducers are bonded to the tank annular chime to generate a force field in the thickness direction of the floor and excite fundamental symmetric and asymmetric Lamb modes. However, the majority of above-ground storage tanks in use have no annular chime due to a simplified design and/or have a degraded chime due to corrosion. This means that transducers cannot be mounted on the chime to assess structural health according to the present technology, and the market share of structural health monitoring of above-ground storage <b>tank</b> <b>floors</b> using ultrasonic guided wave is thus limited. Therefore, {{the present study investigates}} the potential of using the tank wall to bond the transducer instead of the tank annular chime. Both normal and shear type transducers were investigated numerically, and results were validated using a 4. 1 m diameter above-ground storage tank. The study results show shear mode type transducers bonded to the tank wall can be used to assess the structural health of the above-ground <b>tank</b> <b>floors</b> using an ultrasonic guided wave. It is also shown that for the cases studied there is a 7. 4 dB signal-to-noise ratio improvement at 45 kHz for the guided wave excitation on the tank wall using shear mode transducers...|$|R

50|$|The {{basic unit}} for the ID PMTs is a “supermodule”, a frame which {{supports}} a 3×4 array of PMTs. Supermodule frames are 2.1 m in height, 2.8 m in width and 0.55 m in thickness. These frames {{are connected to}} each other in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Then the whole support structure is connected {{to the bottom of the}} tank and to the top structure. In addition to serving as rigid structural elements, supermodules simplified the initial assembly of the ID. Each supermodule was assembled on the <b>tank</b> <b>floor</b> and then hoisted into its final position. Thus the ID is in effect tiled with supermodules. During installation, ID PMTs were pre-assembled in units of three for easy installation. Each supermodule has two OD PMTs attached on its back side. The support structure for the bottom PMTs is attached to the bottom of the stainless-steel tank by one vertical beam per supermodule frame. The support structure for the top of the tank is also used as the support structure for the top PMTs.|$|E

40|$|In {{support of}} an erosion {{evaluation}} for the modified cooling coil guide and its supporting {{structure in the}} DWPF SME vessel, a computational model was developed to identify potential sites of high erosion using the same methodology established by previous work. The erosion mechanism identified in the previous work {{was applied to the}} evaluation of high erosion locations representative of the actual flow process in the modified coil guide of the SME vessel, abrasive erosion which occurs by high wall shear of viscous liquid. The results show that primary locations of the highest erosion due to the abrasive wall erosion are at {{the leading edge of the}} guide, external surface of the insert plate, the <b>tank</b> <b>floor</b> next to the insert plate of the coil guide support, and the upstream lead-in plate.

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) {{technique is}} often used to detect inaccessible area of large storage <b>tank</b> <b>floor</b> with AE sensors placed outside the tank. For tanks with fixed roofs, the drop-back signals caused by condensation mix with corrosion signals from the <b>tank</b> <b>floor</b> and interfere with the online AE inspection. The drop-back signals are very difficult to filter out using conventional methods. To solve this problem, a novel AE inner detector, which works inside the storage tank, is adopted and a pattern recognition algorithm based on CRF (Conditional Random Field) model is presented. The algorithm is applied to differentiate the corrosion signals from interference signals, especially drop-back signals caused by condensation. Q 235 steel corrosion signals and drop-signals were collected both in laboratory and in field site, and seven typical AE features based on hits and frequency are extracted and selected by mRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) for pattern recognition. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the recognition result of CRF model was compared with BP (Back Propagation), SVM (Support Vector Machine), and HMM (Hidden Markov Model).

The main problem related to the inspection of the storage tanks and their floors, using conventional non-destructive testing methods is that, in most cases, the storage tank has to be emptied, cleaned and made safe for human entry before any inspection could be performed.

An initial literature survey helped identify the principal drivers of erosion for a solids laden fluid: the solids content of the working fluid, the regions of recirculation and particle impact with the walls, and the regions of high wall shear. A series of CFD analyses was performed to characterize slurry-flow profiles, wall shear, and particle impingement distributions in key components such as coil restraints and the vessel floor. The calculations showed that the primary locations of high erosion resulting from abrasion were {{at the leading edge}} of the coil guide, the <b>tank</b> <b>floor</b> below the insert plate of the coil guide support, and the upstream lead-in plate. These modeling results based on the calculated high shear regions were in excellent agreement with the observed erosion sites in both location and the degree of erosion.
