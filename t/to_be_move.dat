40|$|In grid {{computing}} environment, we {{can create}} a global ontology for multiple local ontologies to integrate geographically distributed data sources. However, some data sources are likely to dynamically join and quit grid environment. Thus, {{it is very important}} for data semantic access to build dynamic mapping relation between global ontology and local ontologies. In this study, we present mapping algorithms of joining and quitting for data sources in grid system. When a new data source joins grid system, elements mapping between global ontology and its local ontology can be rapidly established through using the method of subtree interception and the corresponding global elements should be added to active elements set. During processing of quitting algorithms, elements mapping between global ontology and the quitted ontology should be canceled and the corresponding global elements need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>move</b> to suspended elements set. In semantic data operation, we regulate only mappings generated from active elements set can be employed for data semantic query. Experimental results show that proposed algorithm effectively fulfils dynamic mappings between global ontology and local ontologies and improves the accuracy of user semantic query in grid environment...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{provides}} {{a case study}} for how settler colonialism intertwined with ethnonationalism to shape social identification in the Israeli town of Kiryat Shemona. Jews from Arab and Muslim lands were categorized by Zionist nation-builders as Mizrahim and disproportionally placed on the geographic and socio-economic margins of Israeli society to Judaise territory, to prevent {{the return of the}} displaced indigenous Palestinian population and to provide cheap labour for Ashkenazi settlements. They were excluded from the Ashkenazi-dominated centre of power, yet included as essential members of a militaristic frontier ethos. The thesis explores how Mizrahim negotiated Israeliness from the margins within the dynamics of ethnocratic exclusion and inclusion, in what I have termed peripheral nationhood. It examines the Israeli State’s attempt to mould loyal subjects through Hebrew education, national ceremonies and military campaigns. In everyday life, Mizrahim contested the socio-economic and cultural hegemony of the Ashkenazi through ethnic and transnational identifications and practices. Simultaneously, their support for the nation-in-arms and creative self-fashioning as ‘strong’ and ‘civilized’ reinforced the dominant logic of ethno-nationalism. Mizrahi residents redeployed stereotypes and an Oriental stigma in their descriptions of Mizrahim, Russian-speaking Israelis and Arabs to elevate their own social status and position in the ethnocracy. The nation was only intermittently salient as a category of belonging, thus challenging theories of ‘everyday nationalism’ that consider it omnipresent. During the Israeli war on Gaza in 2008 / 2009, sentiments of national unity were heightened, and the border Mizrahim appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>move</b> and/or moved themselves from the periphery to the centre of the nation as key actors in the moral legitimization of war. The dissertation argues that the qualities that make up peripheral nationhood are coeval with construction of national unity as a colonial practice by the centre...|$|E
40|$|The {{cohesive}} method can {{be combined}} easily with Finite Element method to simulate a fracture problem which can contains fracture initiation and propagation. Nevertheless, the insertion of cohesive elements is not straightforward. Indeed, the two classical approaches suffer from severe limitations. On one hand, in the intrinsic approach, as the cohesive element is inserted at the beginning, this element has to model the continuum stage of deformation before fracture. This is ensured by an initial slope in the cohesive law {{which leads to a}} stiffness modification and to an alteration of propagation of wave. On the other hand, the introduction of the cohesive element during the simulation in extrinsic approach requests a dynamic modification of mesh. This operation is very difficult to implement {{especially in the case of}} a parallel implementation which is almost mandatory due to the very important number of degrees of freedom inherent to a fine mesh used to track the crack path. A solution to these limitations, pioneered by J. Mergheim and R. Radovitzky is to recourse to a discontinuous Galerkin formulation. Indeed this one used discontinuous test functions and integration at the interface of elements to discretize a structure with discontinuous elements. The integration on the boundary of elements allows ensuring weakly the continuity of displacements in a stable and consistent manner. As interface elements are present they can be easily substituted by cohesive elements when a fracture criterion is reached. The interest of the method has been recently proved by R. Radovitzky etal. for 3 D elements and by the authors for Euler-Bernoulli beams. An extension of the formulation to Kirchhoff-Love shell is presented here. A novel extrinsic cohesive law is developed to model a through the thickness fracture. In fact, as in thin bodies formulation the thickness is not “discretized” this operation is not straightforward. Indeed, as the fracture occurs only in tension, in a pure bending case the position of neutral axis has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>move</b> to propagate the fracture. To avoid this complicated step, it is suggested to integrate on the thickness the cohesive law which is then applies on resultant efforts. The coupling between the openings in displacement and rotation is performed in a way which guarantees a proper release of energy for any loading. Furthermore, the combination between fracture modes I and II is realized as suggested by M. Ortiz etal. Some numerical quasi-static and dynamic benchmarks are simulated to show the interest and the good performance of the presented framework...|$|E

40|$|Two {{immiscible}} fluids {{flowing in}} parallel {{with respect to the}} interface separating them in a two-dimensional porous medium has been studied using a dynamic network model. Two immiscible fluids, one wetting and the other non-wetting moving in parallel is a complicated process that haven't gotten much attention. It is found that there is a competition between imbibition and drainage displacements at the pore-scale along the front separating the two fluids due to an external force driving both the fluids in the direction parallel to this front. Imbibition is the process where a wetting fluid displaces a non-wetting fluid, while drainage is when a non-wetting fluid displaces a wetting fluid. When an external force driving the system in the direction parallel to the front separating the two liquid is small, such that the capillary forces are much strong that viscous forces, we find that imbibition displacements will dominate along the front. The wetting fluid is found to displace the non-wetting such that the front separating the non-wetting fluid from the wetting fluid moves with a velocity proportional to the volumetric flow rate perpendicular to the imposed flow direction. A wetting fluid will prefer to displace a non-wetting fluid along narrow channels {{due to the fact that}} capillary forces provide suction in imbibition, as opposed to resistance in drainage. When the front is moving, we find that clusters of non-wetting fluids are left behind the front, concentrated in the widest part of the network. These cluster will not be able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>move</b> as long as the external driving force is not large enough to overcome the the capillary forces holding back the cluster. Wetting fluid will flow in the space around the clusters. If the external driving force is large enough so that these clusters can be mobilized, then we'll have viscous forces start dominating, and there will be a mixture of imbibition and drainage depending on the local geometry and boundary conditions. If drainage starts dominating the front will stop moving and become unstable, and non-wetting fingers will start moving in the direction of the wetting liquid. If the driving force is strong enough, these fingers will break up into bubbles due to crossing wetting fluids, and non-wetting bubbles will start migrating into the wetting fluid. For special case of a band of non-wetting fluid surrounded by wetting fluid on both sides, we find that the wetting fluid will try to displace the non-wetting fluid from both sides simultaneously. If the external driving force is not strong enough so that the clusters broken off from either side can be mobilized, we find that both the fronts stabilize and stop moving. The non-wetting and wetting fluid will then flow by themselves as if they were part of its own effective network separated by the fluid-fluid front, without any influence from the other fluid. The two fronts will be stationary as long as the capillary forces are dominating over viscous forces. </p...|$|E
