5|$|By the 1890s, the {{observatory}} had become crowded by {{the rapidly growing}} university. Electrification of the tramways along College Street just to the south, and the large quantities of metal used in the modern buildings surrounding the site <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> the instruments. A new magnetic observatory opened in 1898 in Agincourt, at that time largely empty fields, leaving the downtown campus location with its meteorological and solar observation duties.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, {{a revolt}} against Angevin rule, {{known as the}} Sicilian Vespers, <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> Charles of Anjou's rule of the island of Sicily. The Angevins managed to {{maintain}} control in the mainland part of the kingdom, which became a separate entity also styled Kingdom of Sicily, although it is {{commonly referred to as}} the Kingdom of Naples, after its capital. The island became a separate kingdom under the Crown of Aragon.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, {{following}} {{the signing of}} the Declaration of Independence and the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Maryland <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> proprietary control and established a new constitution. Under this new constitution, the upper house of the General Assembly first became known as the Maryland Senate. The new body consisted of fifteen Senators appointed to five-year terms by an electoral college. The college, made up of two electors from each county and one each from the cities of Baltimore and Annapolis, was limited in its selections only by the stipulation that nine Senators need be from the western shore and six from the eastern shore.|$|E
5000|$|A player [...] "throws off" [...] when, after a fail card {{is played}} and the player {{does not have}} any of that fail suit but does have trump, decides to play a fail card rather than trump.

5|$|During {{the year}} the North Vietnamese transported or stored 60,000 tons of {{supplies}} with a net loss rate of 2.07 percent. During the same period, 195,000 PAVN replacements moved through the system to the southern battlefields. As during the previous year, PAVN continued to expand the system. By the end of May the North Vietnamese had occupied Muong Phalane, Ban Houei Sai, and Paksong. They also retook Attopeu, Saravane, and Ban Thateng, cementing their hold on the strategic Bolovens Plateau of south central Laos. Commando Hunt VI, launched during the wet season, was hampered by heavy rain {{and the arrival of}} two typhoons which <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> both the PAVN logistical effort and U.S. attempts to interdict it.|$|E
5|$|Portugal, in contrast, {{resisted}} diplomatic solutions. It viewed {{its continued}} possession of its Indian enclaves {{as a matter}} of national pride and, in 1951, it amended its constitution to convert its possessions in India into Portuguese provinces. In July 1954, an uprising in Dadra and Nagar Haveli <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> Portuguese rule. The Portuguese attempted to send forces from Daman to reoccupy the enclaves, but were prevented from doing so by Indian troops. Portugal initiated proceedings before the International Court of Justice to compel India to allow its troops access to the enclave, but the Court rejected its complaint in 1960, holding that India was within its rights in denying Portugal military access. In 1961, the Constitution of India was amended to incorporate Dadra and Nagar Haveli into India as a Union Territory.|$|E
5|$|Hastati (singular: Hastatus) were a {{class of}} {{infantry}} employed in the armies of the early Roman Republic who originally fought as spearmen, and later as swordsmen. These soldiers were the staple unit after Rome <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> Etruscan rule. They were originally some of the poorest men in the legion, and could afford only modest equipment—light chainmail and other miscellaneous equipment. The Senate supplied their soldiers with only a short stabbing sword, the gladius, and their distinctive squared shield, the scuta. The hastatus was typically equipped with these, and several soft iron tipped throwing spears called pila. This doubled their effectiveness, {{not only as a}} strong leading edge to their maniple, but also as a stand-alone missile troop. Later, the hastati contained the younger men rather than just the poorer, though most men of their age were relatively poor. Their usual position was the first battle line. They fought in a quincunx formation, supported by lighter infantry. The enemy was allowed to penetrate the first battle line consisting of hastati, after which the enemy would deal with the more hardened, seasoned soldiers, the principes. They were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms of 107 BC.|$|E

The two rulers also were active against the Ilkhanate. After Kaidu's death in 1301, Duwa <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> his allegiance to his successor.

Sometime after this, she met the witch-priestess, Ainet, who took her in and became her surrogate mother. Once, when their village {{was going through a}} terrible drought, Storm commanded rain for days just to help them. By doing this, she <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> the natural order of nature, and droughts were formed over numerous villages, and hundreds of animals were killed. Sensing the damage she had done, Ainet told Storm of her kind but ill-thought-out gesture, and of the damage she caused. Ainet took this opportunity to explain to Ororo how her powers worked with nature, and how she could fix the problem by properly distributing rain.|$|E
25|$|Then after {{reaching}} the Cincinnati 42-yard line, Montana spotted defensive back Lewis Billups {{trying to cover}} Rice one-on-one and made him pay for it by completing a pass to the receiver at the 10. But two plays later on a third-down play, Bengals safety David Fulcher made a touchdown saving tackle at the 2-yard line to keep Rathman from scoring. Cofer then attempted a 19-yard field goal, but a poor snap from center Randy Cross (though NBC's Dick Enberg initially blamed backup guard Chuck Thomas; who lined up next to Cross and split long-snapping duties; primarily on punts) <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> the kicker's timing and his kick sailed wide left. Cofer succeeded Rich Karlis, who missed a 21-yard field goal in Super Bowl XXI, as the kicker with the shortest missed field goal in Super Bowl history, a record that still holds.|$|E

The Giants {{responded with a}} drive to the San Francisco 20-yard line, but with 3:01 left in the game, a poor snap from 41-year-old Trey Junkin, who had been signed back out of retirement {{less than a week}} before the game, <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> the timing on Bryant's 42-yard field goal attempt and it went wide left. Garcia then took over, converting two third downs, one of them a 25-yard completion to tight end Eric Johnson, and rushing for 12 yards {{on the way to a}} 13-yard touchdown pass to Streets. This time, the two-point conversion failed when Will Allen intercepted Garcia's pass intended for Owens, but the 49ers took the lead, 39–38, with one minute left in regulation.|$|E
25|$|The Avan dynasty {{was partly}} {{contemporary}} {{with that of}} the Mesopotamian emperor Sargon of Akkad, who not only defeated the Awan king Luhi-ishan and subjected Susa, but attempted to make the East Semitic Akkadian the official language there. From this time, Mesopotamian sources concerning Elam become more frequent, since the Mesopotamians had developed an interest in resources (such as wood, stone, and metal) from the Iranian plateau, and military expeditions to the area became more common. With the collapse of Akkad under Sargon's great great-grandson, Shar-kali-sharri, Elam declared independence under the last Avan king, Kutik-Inshushinak (c. 2240 – c. 2220), and <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> the Akkadian language, promoting in its place the brief Linear Elamite script. Kutik-Inshushinnak conquered Susa and Anshan, and seems to have achieved some sort of political unity. Following his reign, the Awan dynasty collapsed as Elam was temporarily overrun by the Guti, another pre-Iranic people from what is now north west Iran who also spoke a language isolate.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequences}} of Androgeos' death {{are described in}} the Bibliotheca as follows. Minos received the news of his son's death when he was performing a sacrificial rite {{in honor of the}} Charites at Paros. Overcome by grief, he <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> his garland and ordered for the music to stop, but did complete the sacrifice, from which circumstance the festivals in honor of the Charites at Paros involved no music or flowers from then on. Minos led a war against Athens to avenge the death of his son, but failed to sack the city and prayed to Zeus that the Athenians may be punished. The city was struck with famine and pestilence. The Athenians consulted an oracle as to how to avert the calamity, and were instructed to sacrifice the daughters of Hyacinthus the Lacedaemonian, but this didn't help. The citizens consulted the oracle once again and were told to give Minos whatever he might ask in retribution. The king obliged the Athenians to send several youths every seven or nine years to be devoured by the Minotaur. This continued until the Minotaur was killed by Theseus.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{led to a}} {{temporary}} collapse of Mercian power. Penda's son Peada, who had converted to Christianity at Repton in 653, succeeded his father as king of Mercia; Oswiu set up Peada as an under-king; but {{in the spring of}} 656 he was murdered and Oswiu assumed direct control of the whole of Mercia. A Mercian revolt in 658 <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> Northumbrian domination and resulted in the appearance of another son of Penda, Wulfhere, who ruled Mercia as an independent kingdom (though he apparently continued to render tribute to Northumbria for a while) until his death in 675. Wulfhere initially succeeded in restoring the power of Mercia, but the end of his reign saw a serious defeat by Northumbria. The next king, Æthelred, defeated Northumbria in the Battle of the Trent in 679, settling once and for all the long-disputed control of the former kingdom of Lindsey. Æthelred was succeeded by Cœnred, son of Wulfhere; both these kings became better known for their religious activities than anything else, but the king who succeeded them in 709, Ceolred, is said in a letter of Saint Boniface to have been a dissolute youth who died insane. So ended the rule of the direct descendants of Penda.|$|E
25|$|The {{peace with}} Germany was tense, as {{both sides were}} {{preparing}} for the military conflict, and abruptly ended when the Axis forces led by Germany swept across the Soviet border on 22 June 1941. By the autumn the German army had seized Ukraine, laid a siege of Leningrad, and threatened to capture the capital, Moscow, itself. Despite {{the fact that in}} December 1941 the Red Army <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> the German forces from Moscow in a successful counterattack, the Germans retained the strategic initiative for approximately another year and held a deep offensive in the south-eastern direction, reaching the Volga and the Caucasus. However, two major German defeats in Stalingrad and Kursk proved decisive and reversed the course of the entire World War as Germans never regained the strength to sustain their offensive operations and the Soviet Union recaptured the initiative {{for the rest of the}} conflict. By the end of 1943, the Red Army had broken through the German siege of Leningrad and liberated much of Ukraine, much of Western Russia and moved into Belarus. By the end of 1944, the front had moved beyond the 1939 Soviet frontiers into eastern Europe. Soviet forces drove into eastern Germany, capturing Berlin in May 1945. The war with Germany thus ended triumphantly for the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|In {{northwest}} India, in the Punjab, Sikhs developed {{themselves into}} a powerful force {{under the authority of}} twelve Misls. By 1801, Ranjit Singh captured Lahore and <b>threw</b> <b>off</b> the Afghan yoke from North West India. In Afghanistan Zaman Shah Durrani was defeated by powerful Barakzai chief Fateh Khan who appointed Mahmud Shah Durrani as the new ruler of Afghanistan and appointed himself as Wazir of Afghanistan. Sikhs however were now superior to the Afghans and started to annex Afghan provinces. The biggest victory of the Sikh Empire over the Durrani Empire came in the Battle of Attock fought in 1813 between Sikh and Wazir of Afghanistan Fateh Khan and his younger brother Dost Mohammad Khan. The Afghans were routed by the Sikh army and the Afghans lost over 9,000 soldiers in this battle. Dost Mohammad was seriously injured whereas his brother Wazir Fateh Khan fled back to Kabul fearing that his brother was dead. In 1818 they slaughtered Afghans and Muslims in trading city of Multan killing Afghan governor Nawab Muzzafar Khan and five of his sons in the Siege of Multan. In 1819 the last Indian Province of Kashmir was conquered by Sikhs who registered another crushing victory over weak Afghan General Jabbar Khan. The Koh-i-Noor diamond was also taken by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1814. In 1823 a Sikh Army routed Dost Mohammad Khan the Sultan of Afghanistan and his brother Azim Khan at Naushera (Near Peshawar). By 1834 the Sikh Empire extended up to the Khyber Pass. Hari Singh Nalwa the Sikh general remained the governor of Khyber Agency till his death in 1837. He consolidated Sikh hold in tribal provinces. The northernmost Indian territories of Gilgit, Baltistan and Ladakh was annexed between 1831-1840.|$|E
