5|$|Connolly {{has argued}} that they were armed as a pike phalanx. This has been disputed by Head, because Plutarch states <b>they</b> <b>carried</b> spears shorter than the Roman triarii and by Daly {{because they could not}} have carried an {{unwieldy}} pike {{at the same time as}} a heavy Roman-style shield.|$|E

5|$|At 21:00, about 100 {{men of the}} 19th Infantry {{moved into}} the hills {{to the east of}} the town. <b>They</b> <b>carried</b> with them about 30 wounded, {{including}} several litter-bound patients too seriously wounded to walk. Some of the group of 100 were ordered to carry these men, but many of them separated from the group in the mountains. By the time they {{reached the top of the}} mountain, officers decided some of the seriously wounded could not be carried any further, as their carriers were exhausted. The regimental medical officer, Captain Linton J. Buttrey, and Chaplain Herman G. Felhoelter remained behind with the wounded, intending to move them when another group of troops came through who could carry them. Buttrey wore a Red Cross brassard identifying him as a medic, while Felhoelter wore a large white Latin cross brassard, identifying him as a military chaplain in the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps. The two who remained and the wounded were non-combatants under international law, as <b>they</b> <b>carried</b> no weapons.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} palace, three {{servants}} and guards were killed, and about thirty more staff were injured. Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop {{where he had}} been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, indifferent to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and though <b>they</b> <b>carried</b> enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions.|$|E

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officials questioned about 500 people across several Texas cities, including known sex offenders and Garza's family members, co-workers and ex-boyfriends. <b>They</b> <b>carried</b> out almost 50 polygraph examinations, and they offered a $2,500 reward {{for information about}} her death, which was larger than any amount of money previously offered in a Rio Grande Valley murder case. South Texas businessmen later posted $10,000 of reward money. The priest who heard Garza's last confession, Father John Feit, came under suspicion soon after her disappearance.

5|$|The Japanese {{units in}} the area also defended strongly, but they too were short on {{supplies}} {{and in the end}} they were forced to withdraw further north. Wareo subsequently fell to the Allies on 8 December, who then established a line east from Wareo to Gusika on the coast. From there <b>they</b> <b>carried</b> out further advances north later in the month and into early January 1944.|$|E

5|$|The Kolberg class {{represented}} {{the first major}} improvement in combat power for German light cruisers, both qualitatively and quantitatively. They were armed with the longer-barrel 10.5 cm SK L/45 gun, which had a higher muzzle velocity and thus greater range than the earlier L/40 weapon. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>carried</b> an extra pair of guns, which strengthened their broadside. This was on a displacement of over a thousand tons greater than the preceding Dresden class. All four ships were also powered by turbines, which granted them {{a significant increase in}} speed over the earlier vessels.|$|E
5|$|The New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company {{formed a}} {{football}} team, New Brighton Tower F.C., and applied for membership to the Lancashire League. The team {{joined at the}} start of the 1897–98 season and promptly won the league. The club then applied for election to the Football League. Although they were initially rejected, the league later decided to expand Division Two by four clubs and New Brighton Tower were accepted. <b>They</b> <b>carried</b> on playing until 1901 when the company disbanded the team as they did not gain the fan base they were hoping for and so it was no longer considered financially viable.|$|E
5|$|The Stuckists gained {{significant}} {{media coverage}} {{for eight years}} of protests (2000–2006 and 2008) outside Tate Britain against the Turner Prize, sometimes dressed as clowns. In 2001 they demonstrated in Trafalgar Square at the unveiling of Rachel Whiteread's Monument. In 2002, <b>they</b> <b>carried</b> a coffin marked The Death of Conceptual Art to the White Cube Gallery. In 2004 outside the launch of The Triumph of Painting at the Saatchi Gallery they wore tall hats with Charles Saatchi's face emblazoned and carried placards claiming that Saatchi had copied their ideas.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be more eager {{to take on a}} wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task <b>they</b> <b>carried</b> out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers would be paid a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E
5|$|The second Königsberg {{class was}} {{authorized}} in 1913 and laid down starting in 1914. They were named for cruisers {{that had been}} sunk {{in the early months}} of the war.
