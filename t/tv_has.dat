500|$|The show Grey's Anatomy is mocked in [...] "The Ring"; Kenny and Tammy, and {{the other}} {{characters}} who wear purity rings, develop a strong affinity for the show as they become more boring. (Incidentally several actors and actresses connected to Disney {{have appeared in the}} Disney-produced Grey's Anatomy, broadcast on a Disney-owned network.) Those characters also frequently watch movies from Netflix, at that time an online DVD rental service; the company is referenced in one of the episode's semi-parodies of a Jonas Brothers song [...] "I've Got a Ring" [...] (which parodies [...] "SOS"): [...] "Who needs sex and drugs and partying when we can cook a meal and sit around and watch Netflix?" [...] T.G.I. Friday's, a real-life American restaurant chain, is referenced several times as the place where Tammy gave her ex-boyfriend a blowjob. A can of Dr. Pepper appears repeatedly in the South Park Elementary cafeteria; David Hiltgrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer said of the product placement, [...] "I never thought I'd see this type of crass commercialism turn up on South Park, which may be the most brazenly iconoclastic show <b>TV</b> <b>has</b> ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{metaphor of}} the MCU as [...] "the world's biggest TV show" [...] was {{discussed}} again, {{after the release of}} Captain America: Civil War, by Todd VanDerWerff of Vox, who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, [...] "Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of Captain America: Civil War makes little to no sense ... when you think about where [...] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense." [...] VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many [...] "common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context" [...] such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack [...] "visual spark", or [...] "shoehorn in story elements" [...] that [...] "are necessary to set up future films", all characteristics that [...] "are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series Game of Thrones specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks [...] "in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)", with Guardians of the Galaxy being equivalent to the character Daenerys Targaryenâ€”"both separated by long distances from everybody else." [...] He noted that this format was an extension of early [...] "TV-like" [...] film franchises such as Star Wars, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. [...] "I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend", VanDerWerff concluded, [...] "For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's {{the end of the world}} if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason <b>TV</b> <b>has</b> stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that." ...|$|E
