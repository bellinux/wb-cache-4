5|$|Locomotives were used, {{the first}} one running by November 8, but this {{was too late to}} affect the outcome of the siege. The {{locomotives}} were not effective because they could not manage even the easy gradient from Balaclava to Kadikoi with more than a light load. Five second-hand locomotives, purchased by the contractors from collieries and railway companies in England, are known to have arrived. Alliance and Victory were two small 0-6-0 saddle tanks built by E. B.

5|$|Similarly, {{the other}} notes issued by this banks range from scarce to rare.
