5|$|Historian Jonathan Stock {{notes that}} the bent bow {{described}} in the poem above represents <b>the</b> <b>arched</b> bow used to play the huqin, while {{the sound of the}} instrument itself represented the discontent expressed by the prisoners-of-war with their defeated khan.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>arched</b> niche at the mosque's {{entrance}} facing Wazir Khan Chowk is richly {{decorated with}} floral motifs, and features one of Lahore's first {{examples of a}} muqarna - an architectural element found at the Alhambra in Spain, {{as well as on}} several imperial mosques in Iran. The low domes over the prayer hall reflect the style of the earlier Lodi dynasty, which ruled Lahore prior to the Mughal era.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{was to have}} been a riot of Burgesian excess but not a single room was completed to Burges's designs. Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was altered or diluted by Heathcoat-Amory and his successors. However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and <b>the</b> <b>arched</b> red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.|$|E

5|$|In the Outer Hebrides {{all of the}} {{inhabited}} {{islands are}} now connected {{to at least one}} other island by a land transport route, but only four Inner Hebridean islands are connected by road, all to the mainland. The Clachan Bridge from Argyll to Seil was designed by Thomas Telford and dates from 1792. Skye has been connected to Kyle of Lochalsh by the Skye Bridge since 1995. Danna is also connected to the Tayvallich peninsula in Argyll by a stone causeway; and tiny Eilean Donan, dominated by its castle, has had a connection to the mainland perhaps from as early as the 13th century. <b>The</b> <b>arched</b> bridge in use today was constructed in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the creek}} whaler is {{spindle-shaped}} and rather stocky. The long snout has a narrowly parabolic shape and large nostrils preceded by small, nipple-shaped flaps of skin. The eyes are circular and of medium size, and are equipped with nictitating membranes. <b>The</b> <b>arched</b> mouth has very short furrows at the corners. There are 30 upper and 28–30 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are long and triangular with strongly serrated edges, and become increasing angled towards {{the sides of the}} jaw. The lower teeth are slender and upright with finely serrated edges. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} has two rooms and an attached kitchen {{on the ground}} floor with a staircase between them leading to the living quarters in the first floor rooms. The front room may originally have been a shop but was not used for trade after the installation of the new front wall in the 16th century. The front room has recesses on either side of <b>the</b> <b>arched</b> fireplace. The rear room {{on the ground floor}} was the hall and still has its 16th-century ceiling panels and four-light window. The ceiling has plaster decorations from the Elizabethan era, when the kitchen block was also added.|$|E
5000|$|Following the Olympics, {{plans to}} install <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> {{in some kind}} of park were formulated. Many of Salt Lake's {{citizens}} wanted <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> to be used in an amphitheater or some kind of concert venue, possibly at downtown's Gallivan Center or Pioneer Park. But because <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> was a symbol of the 2002 games, the United States Olympic Committee put restrictions on possible future locations for <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> (to protect Olympic sponsors from other businesses who do not have Olympic sponsor contracts). Because of these restrictions, and a lack of consensus among Salt Lake's leaders on where it would go, SLOC announced plans, on December 5, 2002, to install <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> at <b>the</b> Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Cauldron Park. [...] On July 30, 2003, <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> was lifted onto its new base at the park using 3 cranes. <b>The</b> <b>arch</b> was located just outside the park's southern fence and was partly open which allowed visitors to walk through it, while at night <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> was lit with multicolored lights. <b>The</b> <b>arch</b> was removed from the park in August 2014. On December 6, 2014, pieces of <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> were stolen from an impound lot where it had been stored.|$|R
2500|$|Saarinen {{and city}} functionaries collaborated to zone {{buildings}} near <b>the</b> <b>arch.</b> In April 1959, {{real estate developer}} Lewis Kitchen decided to construct two 40-level edifices across from <b>the</b> <b>arch.</b> In July, after the plan was condemned for its potential obstruction of <b>the</b> <b>arch,</b> Kitchen discussed <b>the</b> issue with officials. A decision was delayed for several months because Saarinen had yet to designate <b>the</b> <b>arch's</b> height, projected between [...] By October, Mayor Tucker and Director Wirth resolved to restrict the height of buildings opposite <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> to [...] (about 27 levels), and the city stated that plans for buildings opposite <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> would require its endorsement.

5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases can be seen in <b>the</b> <b>arched</b> gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosaurids {{are named}} for their {{strongly}} heterodont dentition. There were three premaxillary teeth. In the Early Jurassic Abrictosaurus, Heterodontosaurus, and Lycorhinus, {{the first two}} premaxillary teeth were small and conical, while the much larger third tooth resembled the canines of carnivoran mammals and is often called the caniniform or 'tusk'. A lower caniniform, larger than the upper, took the first position in the dentary and was accommodated by <b>the</b> <b>arched</b> diastema of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. These caniniforms were serrated on both the anterior and posterior edges in Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus, while those of Abrictosaurus bore serrations only on the anterior edge. In the Early Cretaceous Echinodon, {{there may have been}} two upper caniniforms, which were on the maxilla rather than the premaxilla, and Fruitadens from the Late Jurassic may have had two lower caniniforms on each dentary.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} (rear) of the Ellwood House, the {{circular}} limestone water tower is about 50 feet (15.2 m) tall {{and has a}} diameter of 18 feet (5.5 m). The tower has windows occurring at different levels, which are arched and include keystones in their design. The water tower was built in 1879, {{the same year as}} Ellwood House, and at that time the structure was topped with a wooden water tank with a conical roof. Between 1897 and 1910 the wooden tank was removed and replaced with an additional 30 courses of stone which matched the original structure. <b>The</b> <b>arched</b> door {{at the base of the}} water tower was replaced with a larger square-shaped double door. The roof remained conical and of wood construction until about 1950 when it was replaced with sheet metal.|$|E
50|$|A {{springer}} is {{an architectural}} {{term for the}} lowest voussoir {{on each side of}} an arch. Since it is the bottom-most element of <b>the</b> <b>arch,</b> it is where <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> support terminates at the responds. It rests on the impost or pier of <b>the</b> <b>arch,</b> that is, <b>the</b> topmost part of the abutment, from which <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> arises.|$|R

5|$|The Pondicherry shark has {{a robust}} build and a {{moderately}} long, pointed snout. The large and circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes. Each nostril is broad with a small, narrow nipple-shaped lobe on the anterior rim. <b>The</b> <b>arched</b> mouth lacks conspicuous furrows or enlarged pores at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 14–15 and 12–14 tooth rows on either side respectively; in addition, there are one or two rows of small teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The upper teeth have a single narrow, smooth-edged central cusp, flanked on both sides by very large serrations. The lower teeth are narrower and more upright than the uppers, and may be smooth to finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E
5|$|The {{pavilion}} is rectangular in shape, {{situated in}} the west of Sheesh Mahal, and is prominent because of its centrally arched and extraordinarily curved roof. This unique feature is symbolic of Shajahani architecture. It reflects a mixture of contemporary traditions (at {{the time of its}} construction) of sloping-roof from Bengal, and Baldachin from Europe. This demonstrates the imperial as well as religious image of the subject. The original roof was probably gilded. The inner walls are minutely inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones and silver with delicate parchin kari ornamentation are considered among the finest in the world.Glazed tile mosaics have been used to decorate the spandrels of <b>the</b> <b>arched</b> openings with floral designs and images of angels, genies, and solomonic symbols. The marble screens of the pavilion are crowned with merlons to prevent inmates being seen from the grounds in between the Fort and the river. The overall quadrangle comprises private quarters for royal family and closely resembles Agra fort.|$|E
5|$|The south (front) face of {{the eastern}} wing has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet at eaves level. The central bay is set forward to form a stone centrepiece around <b>the</b> <b>arched</b> main {{entrance}}, which is flanked by fluted Ionic columns. Immediately above the entrance are doubled tapering pilasters flanking a three-light window, all surmounted by a large cartouche decorated with strapwork. On {{the first floor of}} the central bay is a triple-mullion window, and above the parapet is a coat of arms. Flanking the centrepiece are two bays with diapered brickwork and single-mullion windows. The two ends of the south face are also set forward; they have canted, triple-mullion bay windows and are surmounted above the parapet by shaped gables with attic windows. All the main windows of this face are double transomed.|$|E
50|$|At {{the west}} end of the decumanus rises a 12 m high triumphal <b>arch,</b> called <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> of Trajan, which was {{partially}} restored in 1900. <b>The</b> <b>arch</b> is principally of sandstone, and is of the Corinthian order with three <b>arches,</b> <b>the</b> central one being 11' wide. <b>The</b> <b>arch</b> is also known as <b>the</b> Timgad <b>Arch.</b>|$|R
