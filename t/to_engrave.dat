5|$|In 1816, the Prince Regent {{had first}} {{suggested}} a medal {{to be presented}} to allies and commanders from Waterloo. The Royal Academy proposed work by John Flaxman, one of its members, but Pistrucci, whose responsibility it was <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> the dies, refused to copy another's work, and brought forth designs of his own. The Prince Regent and William Wellesley-Pole, Master of the Mint were impressed by Pistrucci's models, and he gained the commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, {{for reasons}} unknown, the Wanderers, despite having turned aside four challengers, did not record {{their names on}} the Cup. The next year, the Ottawa Senators added a second band onto the Cup. Despite the new room, the 1910 Wanderers and the 1911 Senators did not put their names on the Cup. The 1915 Vancouver Millionaires became the second team <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> players' names, this time inside the bowl along its sides.|$|E
5|$|When his {{apprenticeship}} {{ended in}} 1847, Evans, then 21, refused {{an offer of}} employment from Landells, deciding instead to go into business for himself as a wood-engraver and colour printer. In 1848 Evans engraved a title-page illustration, among other commissions, for the Illustrated London News. However, the Illustrated London News stopped employing him {{on the basis that}} his wood engraving was too fine for newspaper work. His final print for the Illustrated London News showed the four seasons, and was illustrated by Foster. In fact Foster received his first commission from the publisher Ingram, Cook, and Company to reproduce the four scenes in oil. In 1851, Ingram chose Evans <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> three prints for Ida Pfeiffer's Travels in the Holy Land. He used three blocks for the work: the key-block, outlining the illustration, was printed in a dark-brown hue; the other two were in a buff colour and a grayish-blue colour. For the same firm, Evans completed an order for a book-cover using bright reds and blues on white paper. That year he received the first commission to print a book, written by Fanny Fern and illustrated by Foster. Evans had enough business to apprentice his two younger brothers, Wilfred and Herbert, and to buy a hand-press. Soon he moved his premises to Racquet Court, and bought three more hand-presses.|$|E

25|$|Artists used {{a variety}} of tools <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> designs and {{pictures}} onto the pottery. Most of the tools used were made up of stones, sticks, bones and thin metal picks. Artists used boar-hair brushes and feathers used to distribute the sifted clay evenly on the pottery.|$|E
25|$|The {{first issue}} of government-authorized paper {{currency}} in America was printed by the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1690. This first issue, dated 10 December 1690, was printed from an engraved copper plate with four subjects to a sheet. The first engraver identified in archival records was John Coney who {{appears to have been}} paid 30£ on 12 March 1703 <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> three copper plates for the Massachusetts issue dated 21 November 1702. Given the many design similarities between the 1690 note and those engraved by Coney in 1702, there has been speculation that he may have engraved the earlier note. If true, he would be the first American <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> on copper plates. Several historical figures with a background in engraving and printing were involved in the production of early American currency.|$|E
50|$|Errors {{are known}} {{at every stage}} of production, {{starting}} from design, <b>to</b> <b>engraving,</b> <b>to</b> replication of the die, to printing itself, and to perforation. (In theory gumming errors are possible, in practice used stamps have no gum, so any error would become undetectable).|$|R
50|$|He studied under Giovanni Maria Viani, Carlo Rambaldi, and Donato Creti. He {{abandoned}} {{the art of}} painting, and devoted himself entirely <b>to</b> <b>engraving,</b> in which he gained widespread fame. He {{became a member of}} the Accademia Clementina.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} allusion <b>to</b> <b>engraving</b> in the Bible may be {{the reference}} to Judah's seal ring (Ge 38:18), followed by (Ex 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jer 17:1).|$|R
25|$|During the 1770s, Blake {{had come}} to feel {{that one of the}} major {{problems}} with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would engrave it (the engraver), another print it (the printer) and another publish it (the publisher). It was unusual for artists <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> their own designs, due primarily to the social status attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction. Artists like James Barry and John Hamilton Mortimer were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> their own material. A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable letterpress, whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.|$|E
25|$|Many Mississippian {{ceramics}} {{are decorated}} by incising or engraving. Implements such as sticks, reeds, or bone fragments, were dragged through wet clay to incise it, {{or they were}} scratched into {{the surface of the}} dried but as yet unfired pieces <b>to</b> <b>engrave.</b> Sharpened reeds or fingernails were also used to punch small marks. Ornate designs and motifs are common decorative elements, which archaeologists use to track the spread of influences from one culture onto another culture. Many of the designs have symbolic meanings, usually associated with aspects of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex.|$|E
25|$|In late April 1861, four Confederate half dollars {{were struck}} {{on a hand}} press by certain {{employees}} of the New Orleans Mint. Because of the high relief of the coin die, a test striking was made to see if coins would release from the Confederate die. The die was made by a printing plate engraver (A.H.M. Peterson) in New Orleans who was unfamiliar with techniques required <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> coining dies. These coins were struck using a U.S. obverse die (Seated Liberty) and the Confederate die made by Peterson. These coins are known as originals, {{and the location of}} all four of the coins is known today.|$|E

50|$|He {{had more}} success commercially as a {{portrait}} painter and was appointed <b>to</b> <b>Engraver</b> <b>to</b> the Danish Court in 1799. In 1803, he went abroad on {{a grant from}} Fonden ad usus publicos. In 1805, {{he was able to}} purchase a property in Gothersgade from where he ran a successful business. The young artists Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg and Johannes Senn boede lived in the building and worked for him.|$|R
25|$|Ledoux, who was {{eventually}} released, ceased building {{and attempted to}} prepare {{the publication of his}} complete œuvre. Since 1773, he had started <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> his constructions and his projects but, because of the evolution of his style, he did not cease retouching his drawings, and the engravers constantly had to redo their boards. Ledoux evolved towards an architecture always more detailed and colossal, with vast walls that were increasingly smooth, and with increasingly rare openings. The differences between a drawing of the Pavillon de Louveciennes as it first was, made by the British architect Sir William Chambers and the engraving that was published in 1804 illustrate this process.|$|E
25|$|By 1881 the Volta Associates {{had succeeded}} in {{improving}} an Edison tinfoil phonograph significantly. They filled the groove of its heavy iron cylinder with wax, then instead of wrapping a sheet of foil around it and using a blunt stylus to indent the recording into the foil, as Edison did, they used a chisel-like stylus <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> the recording into the wax. The result was a clearer recording. Rather than apply for a patent at that time, however, they sealed the machine into a metal box and deposited it at the Smithsonian, specifying {{that it was not}} to be opened without the consent of two of the three men. By 1937 Tainter was the only one of the Associates still living, and the box preserved at the Smithsonian was opened with his permission. For the occasion, descendants of Alexander Graham Bell gathered in Washington, but Tainter, who held a lifelong admiration of Bell, was too ill to attend and remained at home in San Diego.|$|E
25|$|There is no very {{definite}} {{statement as}} to the material which was in most common use {{for the purposes of}} writing {{at the start of the}} early writing systems. In all ages it has been customary <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> on stone or metal, or other durable material, with the view of securing the permanency of the record; and accordingly, in the very commencement of the national history of Israel, it is read of the two tables of the law written in stone, and of a subsequent writing of the law on stone. In the latter case there is this peculiarity, that plaster (sic, lime or gypsum) was used along with stone, a combination of materials which is illustrated by comparison of the practice of the Egyptian engravers, who, having first carefully smoothed the stone, filled up the faulty places with gypsum or cement, in order to obtain a perfectly uniform surface on which to execute their engravings. Metals, such as stamped coins, are mentioned as a material of writing; they include lead, brass, and gold. To the engraving of gems there is reference also, such as with seals or signets.|$|E
50|$|Cerography or glyphography is a printmaking {{technique}} related <b>to</b> <b>engraving,</b> using a {{layer of}} wax over a metal substrate. After the image is engraved into the wax, a positive plate is produced through stereotyping or electrotyping. This plate {{can be used with}} conventional letterpress equipment.|$|R

500|$|William Wellesley-Pole, {{elder brother}} of the Duke of Wellington (the victor at Waterloo) and the Master of the Mint, in 1819 {{instructed}} Benedetto Pistrucci <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> Flaxman's work to make steel dies for the medal. [...] Pistrucci, an Italian {{who had come to}} Britain in 1815, was performing the duties of Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint. He believed he had been promised the title, which as a foreigner he was ineligible for, and this would be a longtime grievance for him. Pistrucci refused <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> Flaxman's model, unwilling to copy the work of another artist. This refusal angered the Royal Academy. Pole instead asked Pistrucci to prepare a design of his own, and in a day he had produced wax models, about which the Prince Regent was enthusiastic. In August 1819, Pole received instructions from the Treasury to employ Pistrucci to produce the medal. The fee was £2,400, to be paid in instalments. [...] Pole promised an advance that would allow Pistrucci to bring his family from Rome. According to Carlo Milano in his article on Pistrucci for the Royal Mint, [...] "The Waterloo Medal could not be compared to any previous medal: it was much bigger and its iconography more complicated than had ever been seen before in the history of medallic art. But Pistrucci believed that it could be done and immediately began to work." ...|$|E

500|$|Pole had Pistrucci create three {{portraits of}} the King in {{different}} sizes. [...] Only two were used, one for the obverse of the half crown, {{and the other for}} the shilling and sixpence. Both were modified by Thomas Wyon of the Mint, who engraved the designs in steel. What was dubbed the [...] "bull head" [...] of the King on the 1816 half crown was disliked by the public, and it was replaced by another in 1817. The criticism incensed Pistrucci, who blamed Wyon for bungling the design, and who set about learning <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> in steel himself.|$|E
500|$|Longacre's first {{important}} commission were plates for S.F. Bradford's Encyclopedia in 1820; an engraving of General Andrew Jackson by Longacre {{based on}} a portrait by Thomas Sully achieved wide sales. Longacre then agreed <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> illustrations for Joseph and John Sanderson's Biographies of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, published in nine volumes between 1820 and 1827. [...] Although the venture was marked by criticism of the writing, sales were good enough that the project was completed. [...] Numismatic writer Richard Snow suggests that the books sold {{on the strength of}} the quality of Longacre's illustrations. [...] Longacre also completed a series of studies of actors in their roles in 1826 for The American Theatre.|$|E
500|$|In 1819, Pistrucci {{was awarded}} the {{commission}} to design the Waterloo Medal, a huge piece some [...] in diameter that the government planned to award to the victorious generals and national leaders who had defeated Napoleon. Such a medal had been proposed by the Prince Regent (later George IV) soon after the battle. Pistrucci's price was £2,400, and the down payment allowed him to bring his family from Italy. The medal was originally supposed to be to a design by John Flaxman, but Pistrucci refused <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> the work of another artist, and Pole allowed him to design his own medal, a decision that antagonised London's art establishment against Pistrucci. [...] A gigantic undertaking, the medal would take Pistrucci 30 years to complete.|$|E

25|$|Design or artwork is {{generally}} prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers {{are able to}} draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior <b>to</b> <b>engraving.</b> The work <b>to</b> be <b>engraved</b> may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or stippled. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.|$|R
