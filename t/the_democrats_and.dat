5|$|Bradley {{was inaugurated}} December 10, 1895. During his term, Republicans {{controlled}} the Kentucky House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled the Kentucky Senate. This led to infighting {{between the two}} houses of the General Assembly and between the General Assembly and the governor. On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one who supported <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> another who supported the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|In the 1946 elections, Republicans wrested {{control of}} both houses of Congress from the Democrats {{for the first time}} since the Great Depression and gained control of the {{majority}} of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>and</b> when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|Since {{before the}} Civil War, {{the two major}} parties were the Republicans and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>and</b> {{after the end of the}} Reconstruction Era in 1877, the {{national}} electorate was closely divided between them. Party membership was only partly based on ideology; party identification often reflected ethnic and religious background, as well as Civil War loyalties that were still keenly felt by many voters. Most Northern Protestants voted Republican, as did black Southerners. On the other hand, white Southerners and Northern Catholics generally voted Democratic.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Weaver {{returned}} to the lame-duck session of Congress and proposed an unsuccessful constitutional amendment that would have provided for the direct election of Senators. After his term expired in March, he resumed his speaking tour, promoting the Greenback Party across the nation. He and EdwardH. Gillette, another Iowa Greenback Congressman, bought the Iowa Tribune in 1882 to help spread the Greenback message. That same year, Weaver ran for his old 6th district seat in the House against the incumbent Republican, MarsenaE. Cutts. This time <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> Greenbackers ran separate candidates, and Weaver finished a distant second. Cutts died before taking office, and the Republicans offered to let Weaver run unopposed in the special election if he rejoined their party; he declined, and JohnC. Cook, a Democrat, won the seat.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Old Court – New Court controversy, Kentucky's {{politicians}} became divided between <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> the National Republicans. Crittenden's alliance with Henry Clay and his own personal political views put him squarely in the National Republican Party. Because of Crittenden's support of his presidential bid, President Adams appointed him United States district attorney for the district of Kentucky in 1827. In 1828, Adams nominated him to replace Kentuckian Robert Trimble as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, but Jackson supporters in the Senate refused to confirm him. When Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, he removed Crittenden from his post as district attorney because of his association with Clay and his opposition to Jackson's financial policies.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
5000|$|From 1928 to 1985, <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> Chronicle was Gannett's {{flagship}} paper, and Gannett's {{corporate headquarters}} {{were located in}} <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> Chronicle building. Gannett moved its headquarters to Tysons Corner, Virginia; home of USA Today, in 1985. <b>The</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> Chronicle who moved into the building in 1959 continued to occupy the historic Gannett Building at 55 Exchange Boulevard until moving to a new smaller building at the Midtown Plaza site on East Main Street in May, 2016. At 153,350 square feet, the former headquarters in the Gannett building was considerably larger than the current headquarters, which is 42,000 square feet. <b>The</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> Chronicle no longer needed the much larger space in the new digital age where newsprint in the United States is on the decline and the building which included the space that formerly held the printing presses prior to 1996 was expensive to maintain.|$|R

5|$|On Election Day in November 1876, Tillman {{served as}} an {{election}} official at a local poll, as did two black Republicans. One arrived late and was scared off by Tillman. As there was as yet no secret ballot in South Carolina, Tillman threatened to remember any votes cast for the Republicans. That precinct gave 211 votes for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> 2 for the Republicans. Although almost two-thirds of those eligible to vote in Edgefield were African Americans, the Democrats were able to suppress the (Republican) African-American vote, reporting a win for Hampton in Edgefield County with over 60 percent of the vote. Bolstered by this result, Hampton gained a narrow victory statewide, {{at least according to}} the official returns. The Red Shirts used violence and fraud to create Democratic majorities that did not exist, and give Hampton the election.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Texas {{declared}} {{independence from}} the Republic of Mexico on March 2, 1836. At the time {{the vast majority of}} the Texian population favored the annexation of the Republic by the United States. The leadership of both major U.S. political parties, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> the Whigs, opposed the introduction of Texas, a vast slave-holding region, into the volatile political climate of the pro- and anti-slavery sectional controversies in Congress. Moreover, they wished to avoid a war with Mexico, whose government refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of its rebellious northern province. With Texas's economic fortunes declining by the early 1840s, the President of the Texas Republic, Sam Houston, arranged talks with Mexico to explore the possibility of securing official recognition of independence, with Great Britain mediating.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E

5|$|On April 4, 1991 H. John Heinz III, {{one of the}} US Senators from Pennsylvania, {{was killed}} when his {{chartered}} plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear. Under the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the legislature of each state {{has the power to}} permit the governor to fill the vacant seat until a special election can be held. In Pennsylvania, this power had been delegated, and Governor Robert P. Casey signed a writ on May 13, 1991, declaring November 5 the date for a special election and temporarily appointing Harris Wofford to fill Heinz's now-vacant seat. Under Pennsylvanian law, {{there was no need for}} a primary in such a situation; instead, both <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> Republicans would each internally select their candidate, who would run in the special election. John S. Trinsey Jr., a member of the Pennsylvanian electorate and potential candidate, challenged the constitutionality of this law, claiming that it violated his rights under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio {{legislature}} had elected Garfield to the Senate in 1880, {{and when}} he was elected President before taking his seat, they elected Sherman in his place. Sherman's position in the Senate changed after his four-year absence. He rejoined the Finance Committee, but Justin Smith Morrill, his old House colleague, now held the chairmanship. When Sherman re-entered the Senate in the 47th United States Congress, the Republicans were not in the majority. The Senate was divided among 37 Republicans, 37 Democrats, one independent (David Davis) who caucused with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>and</b> one Readjuster (William Mahone), who caucused with the Republicans. Arthur's tie-breaking vote as Vice President left the Republicans with a narrow hold on the chamber. Even so, the special session convened in March 1881 remained deadlocked for two months over Garfield's nominations because of Conkling's opposition to some of them, resulting in the resignation of Conkling and the other Senator from New York, Thomas C. Platt, in protest of Garfield's continuing opposition to their faction. Sherman sided with Garfield on the appointments and was pleased when the New York legislature declined to reelect Conkling and Platt, replacing them with two less troublesome Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Trinsey v. Pennsylvania 941 F.2d 224 (1991) {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that {{confirmed}} the validity of special elections held without a primary under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The case came about due {{to the death of}} H. John Heinz III, one of the US Senators from Pennsylvania, in a plane crash on April 4, 1991. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, state legislatures may give the Governor the power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant Senate seats until a special election can be held, and Pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for the special election. Instead, both <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> Republicans would each internally select their candidates. John S. Trinsey Jr., a voter and potential candidate, asked the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to declare the statute unconstitutional as a violation on the Fourteenth and Seventeenth amendments, because the lack of a primary removed his right to properly vote for candidates and delegated that power to political parties.|$|E
