60|$|The whole {{being at}} discretion, I beg leave just to suggest some matters for your consideration:--Whether the {{government}} in Church or State {{is likely to be}} more secure by continuing causes of grounded discontent to a very great number (say two millions) of the subjects? or whether the Constitution, combined and balanced as it is, will be rendered more solid by depriving so large a part of the people of all concern or interest or share in its representation, actual or virtual? I here mean to lay an emphasis on the word virtual. Virtual representation is that {{in which there is a}} communion of interests and a sympathy in feelings and desires between those who act in the name of any description of people and the people in whose name they act, though the trustees are not actually chosen by them. This is virtual representation. Such a representation I think to be in many cases even better than the actual. It possesses most of its advantages, and is free from many of its inconveniences; it corrects the irregularities in the literal representation, when the shifting current of human affairs or the acting of public interests in different ways carry it obliquely from its first line of direction. The people may err in their choice; but common interest and common sentiment are rarely mistaken. But this sort of virtual representation cannot have a long or sure existence, if it has not a substratum in the actual. The member must have some relation to the constituent. As things stand, the Catholic, as a Catholic, and belonging to a description, has no virtual relation to the representative,--but the contrary. There is a relation in mutual obligation. Gratitude may not always have a very lasting power; but the frequent recurrence of an application for favors will revive and refresh it, and will necessarily produce some degree of mutual attention. It will produce, at least, acquaintance. The several descriptions of people will not be kept so much apart as they now are, as if they were not only separate nations, but separate species. The stigma and reproach, the hideous mask will be taken off, and men will see each other as they are. Sure I am that there have been thousands in Ireland who have never conversed with a Roman Catholic in their whole lives, unless they happened to talk to their gardener's workmen, or to ask their way, when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>it</b> in their sports,--or, at best, who had known them only as footmen, or other domestics, of the second and third order: and so averse were they, some time ago, to have them near their persons, that they would not employ even those who could never find their way beyond the stable. I well remember a great, and in many respects a good man, who advertised for a blacksmith, but at the same time added, he must be a Protestant. It is impossible that such a state of things, though natural goodness in many persons will undoubtedly make exceptions, must not produce alienation on the one side and pride and insolence on the other.|$|E

5000|$|Various words {{may have}} shifted gender under the {{influence}} from words either of the same meaning or similar sound in Gaulish, {{as a result of}} the Celtic substrate. A connectionist model predicting shifts in gender assignment for common nouns more accurately predicted historical developments when the Gaulish genders of the same words were considered in the model. Additionally the loss of the neuter may have been accelerated in French because Gaulish neuters were very hard to distinguish and possibly lost earlier than Latin neuters. For comparison, Romanian retains the neuter case and Italian retains it for a couple words; Portuguese, Sardinian, Catalan, and Spanish also retain remnants of the neuter outside of nouns in demonstrative pronouns and the like though <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>it</b> for nouns.|$|R

40|$|Theme: Critical ConnectionsIn the {{emergent}} society of consumption {{and under the}} sway of cosmopolitanism, Shanghai and her past are being dissolved into spectacles. Cultural production has demonstrated a decline to the immediate and the everyday, to consumption practices and personal pleasure. In opposition to this, writers like Wang Anyi strive to renew engagement with history and memory, endeavoring to understand the swift changes in social reality through revisiting the past. Previous scholarship on Wang probed occasionally the thematic implications of cosmopolitcs but has not engaged in systematic study {{of the relationship between}} local culture, memory, and the flow of migrant workers in the age of globalization. This paper aims to examine the notions of history and the body as the protagonists reconcile their estrangement in everyday life through recalling the memories that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost.</b> <b>It</b> will also look closely at this work of Wang, for how it redefines contemporary Shanghai urbanites’ everyday experience through the issue of cosmopolitanism, and how the recovery of the past provides a critique of the materialistic culture of Shanghai and China.

40|$|The author {{begins with}} a {{definition}} of faith which is, on the one hand, a gift of God, on the other, man 2 ̆ 7 s response too, collaboration with, and acceptance of this gift. Among the crises young people {{have to go through}} there is also the crisis of faith, of maturing, of bringing new decisions. Faith thus becomes more personal. Young people are caught in a dilemma between faith and faithlessness. The crisis itself and the issues concerning faith do not mean that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>it</b> or do not have it. The author suggests several answers to these problems and to questions that might arise. On two examples - the Washing of the Feet and the episode of the two disciples from Emmaus - he shows how young people who are undergoing a crisis of faith should be approached and helped. Metaphorically speaking each young person should, for himself, experience the voyage from Jerusalem to Emmaus and personally encounter the resurrected Lord. This encounter, if it is profound and true, brings about a turn. The sad, frightened, confused being becomes a joyous, courageous, and confident herald of faith...|$|R

God, remember, is a being infinitely good, and therefore the loss of such a being must be a loss infinitely painful.

At the very instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and the soul at once flies towards God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my dear little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from God, we live by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalienably His. God loves with a divine love every human soul, and every human soul lives in that love. How could it be otherwise? Every breath that we draw, every thought of our brain, every instant of life proceeds from God's inexhaustible goodness. And if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her child, for a man to be exiled from hearth and home, for friend to be sundered from friend, O think what pain, what anguish it must be for the poor soul to be spurned from the presence of the supremely good and loving Creator Who has called that soul into existence from nothingness and sustained it in life and loved it with an immeasurable love. This, then, to be separated for ever from its greatest good, from God, and to feel the anguish of that separation, knowing full well that it is unchangeable: this is the greatest torment which the created soul is capable of bearing, POENA DAMNI, the pain of loss.|$|R
