40|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) {{has been}} widely used by {{professionals}} and practitioners to support diverse applications such as navigation, surveying, mapping and engineering purposes. However, for highly precise applications (i. e. landslide detection, petrology and high rise structural monitoring) the key limitations currently facing this satellite-based positioning system is the signal propagation delay caused by the effect of troposphere where most of world's weather takes place. The effect is much more pronounced in Malaysia as it {{is located at the}} equatorial region where the troposphere extends up to 16 km above the earth surface. High humidity climate within the nation exaggerates the effect even further. This paper leads to an understanding on residuals in GPS measurement due to <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> at the equatorial region. Based on series of GPS observation made within Johore RTK Network (which is located in the equatorial region), it is obvious that <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> leads to variations or uncertainties in GPS measurement. Result shows that by neglecting the use of a standard tropospheric model, maximum residuals in Easting, Northing and Height components due to <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> are 68. 880 cm, 68. 970 cm and 119. 100 cm respectively. Similarly, reaching to the minimum and maximum RMS value of 16. 8 and 29. 2 respectively, GPS Height component {{is by far the most}} affected component compared to the Horizontal components (Easting and Northing). Based on comparative study between short (UTMJHJY) baseline and long (UTM-MERS) baseline, result shows that the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> is a distance-dependent error that increases when the baseline length between two GPS stations increases. Better result in the derived position is therefore can be expected from short GPS baseline compared to the long baseline...|$|E
40|$|A two-satellite system {{configuration}} is designed {{in which one}} satellite transmits a signal which is reflected from the sea surface and received by the other satellite. The time delay of the signal is measured. By selecting the geometry such that the signal path makes a small grazing angle with the sea surface, the amount of troposphere passed through and hence {{the magnitude of the}} <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> is maximized; requirements on timing accuracy are thus relaxed. The vacuum path length of the radar signals must be subtracted from the measured path length in order to compute the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect,</b> which is highly correlated to the atmospheric surface pressure. This is done by measuring the time delays along three additional paths. The use of an operational constellation of several satellites further decreases sensitivity to geoidal errors...|$|E

Various methods for modeling and correcting the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on such GPS applications are then investigated. The Saastamoinen model and ground meteorological data are first {{used to calculate the}} tropospheric delays. A Kalman filter model is then used to estimate the tropospheric zenith delays in GPS solutions. Finally, we use such information as known building height as constraints in GPS solutions. The performances of these methods are evaluated using a data set obtained in monitoring a building that is over 200 m tall. The SIGMA-Îµ GPS stochastic model is also used in combination with the various methods to reduce the effects of the various noise.

40|$|The {{geographical}} {{locations of}} data collection platforms (DCP) in the Brazilian Environmental Data Collection System are obtained by processing Doppler shift measurements between satellites and DCP. When the signals travel from a DCP to a satellite crossing the terrestrial atmosphere, they {{are affected by the}} atmosphere layers, which generate a delay in the signal propagation, and cause errors in its final location coordinates computation. The signal propagation delay due to the atmospheric effects consists, essentially, of the ionospheric and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effects.</b> This work provides an assessment of ionospheric effects using IRI and IONEX models and tropospheric delay compensation using climatic data provided by National Climatic Data Center. Two selected DCPs were used in this study in conjunction with SCD- 2 satellite during high and low solar activity periods. Results show that the ionospheric effects on transmission delays are significant (about hundreds of meters) in equatorial region and should be considered to reduce DCP location errors, mainly in high solar activity periods, while in those due to <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effects</b> the zenith errors are about threemeters. Therefore it is shown that the platform location errors can be reduced when the ionospheric and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effects</b> are properly considered. Pages: 1 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Hot and wet {{conditions}} in the equatorial or low latitude region degrade satellite positioning accuracy noticeably. The degradation {{is related to the}} strong <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect,</b> especially the wet component which is approximately proportional to the content of water vapor in the troposphere and thus makes satellite positioning more challenging in this region. Despite the efforts to achieve better understanding of the signal delay in the low latitude troposphere, much more still remains to be improved. Knowing that the water vapor content is heavy in this region, it is of special interest for meteorologists to look into the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect.</b> Such knowledge is vital for understanding the global climate, whereas a short term variation of water vapor is very useful input to local weather forecasting. South-East Asia is selected in this study to investigate the effect of regional tropospheric delay, and broadly to understand the behavior of a low latitude troposphere. The study area covers Malaysia and Singapore where GPS CORS networks have already been established. Results from GPS data processing show that a wide variation of the tropospheric delay can be observed. As expected, the largest variation occurs during the North-East monsoon (November to early March) and the South-West monsoon (early May to August). Coordinate repeatabilities of the sites in the network are calculated to show the impact of the tropospheric delay on the precision of GPS positioning activities. In addition, the variations of the tropospheric delay estimated from a local and a regional GPS network are compared to the results from the global network...|$|E
40|$|Fast high {{precision}} relative Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning {{is very important}} to various applications and ambiguity resolution is a key requirement. It has been a continuing challenge to determine and fix GNSS carrier-phase ambiguity, especially for medium-and long-distance baselines. In past research, with dual-frequency band Global Positioning System (GPS), it is almost impossible for fast ambiguity resolution of medium- and long-distance baselines mainly due to the ionospheric and tropospheric effects. With the launch of the BeiDou system, triple-frequency band GNSS observations are available for the first time. This research aims to test the ambiguity resolution performance with BeiDou triple-frequency band observations. In this research, two mathematical models are compared: zenith tropospheric delay as an unknown parameter versus corrected tropospheric delay. The ambiguity resolution performance is investigated in detail with BeiDou observations. Different distance baselines are tested: 45 km, 70 km and 100 km and the performances are investigated with different elevation cut-off angles. Also the performance with BeiDou alone and combined BeiDou and GPS are compared. Experimental results clearly show that with practical observations of triple-frequency bands, ambiguity of medium-or long-distance baselines can be fixed. The results also show that: the performance of ambiguity resolution with an elevation cutoff angle of 20 degrees is much better than that of 15 degrees; The performance with <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> corrected is slightly better than that with <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> as an estimated parameter; Dual-frequency band GPS observations will benefit ambiguity resolution of integrated BeiDou and GPS.

40|$|Tropospheric {{water vapor}} causes a {{refractive}} path length effect which is typically 5 - 10 % of the 'dry' <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> and {{as large as}} several meters at elevation angles below 5 deg. The vertical water vapor profile is quite variable, and measurements of intensive atmospheric parameters such as temperature and humidity limited to the surface do not adequately predict the refractive effect. It is suggested that a water vapor refraction model that {{is a function of}} the amount of precipitable water alone can be successful at low elevation angles. From an extensive study of numerical ray tracings through radiosonde balloon data, such a model has been constructed. The model predicts the effect at all latitudes and elevation angles between 2 and 10 deg to an accuracy of better than 4 % (11 cm at 3 deg elevation angle) ...|$|E

40|$|Geodetic time-series from {{continuous}} GPS (cGPS) and 1 DORIS stations {{across the}} Himalaya of central Nepal show strong seasonal fluctuations observed on the {{horizontal and vertical}} components. Because the fluctuations determined at the different stations have similar phase but different amplitudes, these observations would imply that the secular shortening across the range is modulated by a seasonal strain. Given the geographic and climatic setting, there is however a possibility that the GPS positions be biased by <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effects.</b> We process these data using two different software packages and two different analysis strategies. Our analysis shows evidence for 1 -strong seasonal fluctuation of zenithal delays consistent with in situ meteorological data and two strong horizontal tropospheric gradients in particular in the EW direction, that is, parallel to the mountain front at Gumba, also detected in DORIS results. We show that the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effects</b> cannot however {{be the source of}} the observed seasonality of horizontal strain. This study supports the view that the seasonal strain in the Himalaya is real and probably driven by seasonal surface load variations. Our study adds support to the view that seasonal variations of seismicity in the Himalaya reflects seasonal variations of geodetic strain...|$|R

40|$|Mt. Baekdu is a Cenozoic stratovolcano, where {{a series}} of micro-seismic events and gaseous {{emissions}} have been reported recently. Two-pass DInSAR technique was applied to detect possible displacement. Most interferometric phases out of 58 JERS- 1 differential interferograms show concentric fringe patterns that correlate with elevation. From an analysis of fringe-duration relation, the fringe patterns can be interpreted mostly as an atmospheric contamination by stratified troposphere. To estimate the tropospheric delay, we used the data in Mt. Sobaek that is located about 20 km away from the summit of Mt. Baekdu and whose diameter is about 5 km. After removing the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect,</b> about 3 mm/yr of inflation was detected from 1992 to 1998.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{use of the}} Doppler shift {{measurements}} {{to locate}} a transmitter has been studied and tested within the Brazilian Environmental Data Collection System. To improve the location of Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) with their transmitters, some effects such as corrections due to the ionosphere and the troposphere have been considered in a previous work (Celestino et al., 2007) using simulated data and some initial error evaluation for one existing DCP. This work presents {{an evaluation of the}} impacts on the geographical location due to the ionospheric and the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effects,</b> however using two meteorological DCPs and covering a longer test period (one year). The seasonal and day-night effects are also analyzed during this test period. The results of the analysis indicated that correction of the ionospheric and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effects</b> can, on the average, reduce the location errors to the scale between ten and hundred meters for the test conditions independent of the DCP location that was used. Due to the complexity of modeling sources of errors in the location of a platform, still a considerable work need to be done to reduce location errors in the system.

30|$|It {{is widely}} {{known that the}} {{positioning}} precision determined by global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations is affected by different sources of bias because of structural and nonstructural issues. One of the main biases is due to ionospheric and tropospheric refraction during the crossing of the atmosphere by the electromagnetic GNSS signal. The ionospheric effect can be eliminated by combination of the L 1 and L 2 phases for double-frequency receivers; it can be modeled for single-frequency receivers. In contrast, tropospheric bias is frequency-independent and cannot be reduced by means of any combination. The <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> produces a bias in each satellite receiver observation that {{can be related to}} the so-called zenith total delay (ZTD). The ZTD can be computed in the zenith direction above the GNSS station using an appropriate mapping function. The estimation of the ZTD helps to enhance the positioning precision and interpret severe meteorological events, as demonstrated in previous studies (Bouma and Stoew 2001; De Pondeca and Zou 2001; Basili et al. 2003; Bock et al. 2008; Boniface et al. 2009; Bennitt and Jupp 2012; Sguerso et al. 2013, 2015; Tsuda et al. 2013).|$|E

Among many troposphere models, Saastamoinenâs and Neillâs models have been widely used. The troposphereâs zenith path delay in GPS signals can be estimated by the hydrostatic component of the Saastamoinen model and then the delay can be mapped with the dry Niell mapping function in order to obtain the slant path delay. This paper aims to identify and analyse the characteristics of the tropospheric delay associated with an aircraftâs flight trajectory using the aforementioned troposphere models. The test data consists of the kinematic data observed during a 700 km-long flight at the maximum elevation of 3, 300 m and the static data observed at seven reference stations distributed across the study area. The data was processed on an epoch-by-epoch basis in the double-differenced mode with mixed, kinematic and static stations. The correlation between the delay and the flight height is addressed {{as a result of the}} analysis.

40|$|Although {{the topic}} of the {{positioning}} precision of the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been studied extensively, it focuses mostly on the error sources such as the ionospheric effect, antenna phase center variation and tropospheric influence. This investigation addresses the influence of the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on the results of the height determination. Used data are obtained from GPS receivers of a network and co-located surface meteorological instruments in 2003. Two approaches, parameter estimation and external correction, are utilized to correct the zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) by applying the surface meteorological measurements (SMM) data. The GPS height can be affected by an incorrect pressure measurement up to a few meters, and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the daily solution can range from millimeters to a few centimeters, no matter which approach is adopted. The effect is less significant when using SMM for parameter estimation, but the trend of corrections on the GPS height is more consistent at either higher or lower altitudes.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{increasingly}} sophisticated deep space missions have placed correspondingly stringent requirements on navigational accuracy. As {{part of the effort}} to increase navigational accuracy, and hence the quality of radiometric data, much effort has been expended in an attempt to understand and compute the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> on range (and hence range rate) data. The general approach adopted has been that of computing a zenith range refraction, and then mapping this refraction to any arbitrary elevation angle via an empirically derived function of elevation. The prediction of zenith range refraction derived from surface measurements of meteorological parameters is presented. Refractivity is separated into wet (water vapor pressure) and dry (atmospheric pressure) components. The integration of dry refractivity is shown to be exact. Attempts to integrate wet refractivity directly prove ineffective; however, several empirical models developed by the author and other researchers at JPL are discussed. The best current wet refraction model is here considered to be a separate day/night model, which is proportional to surface water vapor pressure and inversely proportional to surface temperature.

Typical root-mean-square (RMS) differences of GNSS-MR derived sea level time series with respect to nearby tide gauges are {{on the order of}} 6 â 40 [*]cm, sufficiently accurate to estimate tidal and secular sea level variations but are possibly biased due to delay of the signal through the troposphere. In this study we investigate the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effect</b> from more than 20 GNSS coastal sites located from several meters up to 280 [*]m above sea level. We find a bias in the estimated heights that is elevation and height dependent and can reach orders of 1 [*]m for a 90 [*]m site. Without correcting for tropospheric delay we find that GNSS-MR estimated tidal coefficients will be smaller than their true amplitudes by around 2 % while phases seem unaffected. Correcting for the tropospheric delay also improves levelling results as a function of reflector height.

The solar signal is transferred from the upper to the lower stratosphere through a modulation of the polar night jet and the Brewer-Dobson circulation. These model experiments are further investigated here to show {{the transfer of the}} solar signal from the lower stratosphere to the troposphere and down to the surface during Northern Hemisphere winter. Analysis focuses on the transition from significant stratospheric effects in October and November to significant <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effects</b> in December and January. The results highlight the importance of stratospheric circulation changes for the troposphere. Together with the poleward-downward movement of zonal wind anomalies and enhanced equatorward planetary wave propagation, an AO-like pattern develops in the troposphere in December and January during solar maximum. In the middle of November, one third of eddy-forced tropospheric mean meridional circulation and surface pressure tendency changes {{can be attributed to the}} stratosphere, whereas most of the polar surface pressure tendency changes from the end of November through the middle of December are related to tropospheric mechanical forcing changes. The weakening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation during solar maximum leads to dynamical heating in the tropical lower stratosphere, inducing circulation changes in the tropical troposphere and down to the surface that are strongest in January.

The largest error source of the SAR interferometry measurements is differential atmospheric delay of water vapor. It reflects detailed distribution of water vapor in troposphere at data acquisition.

Specific acquisition conditions characterizing andesitic stratovolcanoes, mainly vegetated areas with large elevation ranges, induce low signal coherence as well as strong tropospheric artefacts that result in small signal-to-noise ratio.

Troy holds a BSurv and a Masters degree in satellite geodesy and has previously worked in hydrographic surveying and marine data Open-pit mine deformation monitoring presents interesting challenges for GPS-based positioning systems. Many of the issues of GPS positioning, such as the number and geometry of available satellites, signal multipath, and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effects</b> are of particular concern in the precise geometrical determination of pit wall deformations. This paper describes a monitoring system under development at Curtin University of Technology which utilises the integrated positioning technologies of GPS and GLONASS, together with the hardware and software issues involved in successfully implementing such a system...|$|R
30|$|However, {{also for}} post processing, where the current focus of VLBI {{analysis}} lies, {{the application of}} a KF is justified. When considering physical effects that show a stochastic behavior, the deterministic approach of LSM is not optimal. In particular for troposphere and clock parameters, the stochastic approach of a KF is closer to reality. Any improvement in the handling of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>effects</b> is welcome as they are the most significant source of errors in VLBI analysis (Pany et al. 2011) and should thus help to improve other estimated parameters like station coordinates, which are of particularly great interest in geodesy, as well. However, also the tropospheric delays from VLBI are sought to be derived with highest possible quality as they are useful for climatic studies (Heinkelmann et al. 2007) or could in the future possibly help to improve numerical weather models.|$|R
