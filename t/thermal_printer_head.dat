50|$|The COMX <b>Thermal</b> <b>Printer</b> came {{including}} a dedicated interface card, printing {{was done on}} thermal paper by using a head that with 9 pins which could heat the paper and as such print both text and images. You needed to be careful when writing your own printer drivers, which was needed for graphic printing, as it was very easy to 'burn' the <b>printer</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>printers</b> {{are still}} {{commonly}} used in seafloor exploration and engineering geology due to their portability, speed, and ability to create continuous reels or sheets. Typically, <b>thermal</b> <b>printers</b> found in offshore applications are used to print realtime records of side scan sonar and sub-seafloor seismic imagery. In data processing, <b>thermal</b> <b>printers</b> are sometimes used to quickly create hard copies of continuous seismic or hydrographic records stored in digital SEG Y or XTF form.|$|R
50|$|Label {{printers}} use a {{wide range}} of label materials, including paper and synthetic polymer ("plastic") materials. Several types of print mechanisms are also used, including laser and impact, but <b>thermal</b> <b>printer</b> mechanisms are probably the most common. There are two common types of <b>thermal</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>printer</b> (or direct <b>thermal</b> <b>printer)</b> {{produces}} a printed image by selectively heating coated thermochromic paper, or thermal paper {{as it is}} commonly known, when the paper passes over the thermal print head. The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} barcode {{printers}} employ {{one of two}} different printing technologies. Direct <b>thermal</b> <b>printers</b> use a printhead to generate heat that causes a chemical reaction in specially designed paper that turns the paper black. <b>Thermal</b> transfer <b>printers</b> also use heat, but instead of reacting the paper, the heat melts a waxy or resin substance on a ribbon that runs over the label or tag material. The heat transfers ink from the ribbon to the paper. Direct <b>thermal</b> <b>printers</b> are generally less expensive, but they produce labels that can become illegible if exposed to heat, direct sunlight, or chemical vapors.|$|R

Spanning the entire horizontal 6m of the base is a <b>printer</b> <b>head</b> with 300 nozzles, each spaced 20mm apart.
