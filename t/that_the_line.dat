5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. <b>That</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in finding}} the funding, {{opposition}} from the two mainline companies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was intended to connect, and World War I, led {{to the start of}} construction work being delayed until 1927. The line was completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service was provided by the Southern Railway. The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned, but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November 1909 a train {{en route}} from Bergen rolled into Oslo Østbanestasjon, and two days later the railway was officially opened at Voss. King Haakon VII stated upon the opening <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was the Norwegian {{engineering}} masterpiece of his generation.|$|E

5|$|A-line. Founded by Anselmo, born 1926. One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} lines today, descendants include the second-largest number of stallions at stud. Anselmo was brought back to stud {{at the age of}} 21, when a lack of stallions after World War II led to concerns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> would not survive, and produced several stallions now represented in all Haflinger breeding populations worldwide.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} it was {{considered}} that the two former Line E stations and tunnels {{should be used for}} Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would be roughly similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{theories}} were <b>that</b> <b>the</b> geometric <b>lines</b> {{could indicate}} <b>the</b> flow of water, irrigation schemes, or {{be a part}} of rituals to [...] "summon" [...] water. The spiders, birds and plants may be fertility symbols. It has also been theorized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> could act as an astronomical calendar.|$|R

5|$|Bull's station {{building}} {{burned down}} in 1914 {{and was replaced}} two year later by a new. By then it was decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> past Lysaker would be upgraded and Lysaker became {{the first of many}} stations on the line to be designed as an elevated station. The tracks were thereby placed elevated with an island platform with the station on the side, as the first station in Norway designed for double-track operation. The new station was designed in Baroque Revival by Adalbert Kielland at NSB Arkitektkontor. One year later the wooden bridge over Lysakerelven was replaced by a stone bridge.|$|E
5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} line had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the nonprofit}} {{organization}} Friends of the High Line {{was formed by}} Joshua David and Robert Hammond, residents of the neighborhood <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> ran through. They advocated for the line's preservation and reuse as public open space, {{so that it would}} become an elevated park or greenway, similar to the Promenade Plantée in Paris. The organization was initially formed as a small community group to advocate for the High Line’s preservation and transformation {{at a time when the}} historic structure was under the threat of demolition during Rudy Giuliani’s second mayoral term.|$|E
30|$|Depending on {{the area}} of <b>the</b> garment, <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> should be larger and longer than the outer shell, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> has {{sufficient}} ease. If there is not sufficient ease, the constant pulling and friction <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> is subject to, will cause tears in <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> fabric (Cabrera 1996). Previous research showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> jacket <b>lining</b> is 2.4 – 5.6  cm larger than the outer shell pattern in the chest circumference (Kim 2014). Along with the consideration of circumference ease when developing a pants lining pattern, length ease from the waist to the hem is also important when over-locking is performed in the sewing process. This {{is due to the}} general placement of <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> in <b>the</b> front area of the pant only. Thus, the circumference ease and length ease of <b>the</b> pant <b>lining</b> would be different from <b>the</b> jacket <b>lining</b> ease.|$|R

50|$|One {{paradigm}} experiment involved college students. In the experiment, {{the subject}} arrived late (by premeditation) at a psychology experiment {{in which the}} other 'subjects' {{were asked to rate}} whether two lines were of equal length or unequal. The only seat for the subject {{was at the end of}} the semi-circle of other subjects, all of whom had been prompted how to respond to the prompt. Even when <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> were of clearly unequal length, <b>the</b> 'stooges' replied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> were of equal length. Subjects who were field-dependent also agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> were equal. Field independent subjects asserted <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> were unequal, even when the differences were very small.|$|R
5|$|On 16 January 1958, a {{passenger}} train {{collided with a}} light engine which was standing foul {{of the line and}} was derailed. The light engine ended up on its side. Thirteen people were injured. A signalman was blamed for the accident as he failed to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was clear for the passenger train.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} constructed as double track between Illawarra Junction and Hurstville with single track thereafter; however, its rising use meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> required duplication soon afterwards. The line was duplicated between Hurstville and Loftus Station (with {{the exception of}} the Como bridge over the Georges River) in April 1890, then southward to Waterfall by 12 December 1890. The section of track between Illawarra Junction and Hurstville was quadruplicated between 1913 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|The {{railways}} {{arrived on}} Anglesey {{with the construction}} of the Chester and Holyhead Railway, of which the section from Llanfairpwll to Holyhead opened in 1848, two years before the Britannia Bridge was finished. The Chester and Holyhead railway surveyed a branch to Llangefni in 1852, but chose not to proceed. George Stephenson notably reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was not worth building.|$|E

5|$|The {{service was}} {{introduced}} in 1990 as a temporary measure to reduce congestion during construction work on I-95. However, it proved more popular than expected, and service was continued after construction ended despite criticisms <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was too expensive to operate. The service has been continually upgraded since its inception with rebuilt stations and new rolling stock as well as extensions to New London in 1996 and to Stamford in 2001. Around 1,900 to 2,100 riders use the service every weekday depending on the season.|$|E
5|$|Within {{three hours}} of the {{derailment}} {{the site of the}} accident had been sealed off with a five-mile cordon. The line was expected to be closed for two weeks, with Virgin Trains saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> would not reopen to passenger services until 12 March 2007. The recovery operation was slowed by problems in getting heavy lifting gear to the site which required temporary roads to be constructed.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} {{proposal was}} presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It {{became clear that}} Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbours to {{the route of the}} Sognsvann Line complained about this proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line. Also, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration protested to the plans, and stated that funding should be allocated to upgrading Ring 3 to six lanes before public transport investments were made in the area.|$|E

5|$|Amulets and idols {{fashioned}} from assorted natural materials have occupied an important place among many ethnic groups of Madagascar for centuries. Ody, personal amulets believed to protect or allocate powers to the wearer, were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. The name sampy {{was given to}} those amulets that, while physically indistinguishable from ody, were distinct in that their powers extended over an entire community. The sampy were often personifiedcomplete with a distinct personalityand offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo amassed twelve of the most reputed and powerful sampy from neighboring communities. He furthermore transformed {{the nature of the}} relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the leader's sovereignty and the integrity of the state which would be preserved through their power on the condition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampytwelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmologyand transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|Castile regained {{control of}} Gibraltar in the Eighth Siege of 1462. The Moorish threat receded {{following}} {{the completion of}} the Reconquista and the fortifications were allowed to fall into decay, with very few cannon mounted on the batteries. In 1535, the Spanish naval commander Álvaro de Bazán the Elder warned King Charles I that Gibraltar's defences were seriously inadequate and recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> Wall Curtain be extended all the way to Europa Point on the southern tip of Gibraltar and that the town's southern wall should be strengthened. However, his advice was ignored. The soldier and writer Pedro Barrantes Maldonaldo noted that by 1540 Gibraltar's north-west bastion (presumably referring to North Bastion) had only four guns, while the castle's few guns were all dismounted (and therefore unusable), and there were no gunners. The garrison's equipment was antiquated and their numbers were few. The town's walls were still essentially medieval and could not have resisted mid-16th century artillery. The fall of Constantinople 90 years earlier showed just how vulnerable such walls could be {{in the face of a}} heavy artillery bombardment.|$|E
5|$|During 2005–06, a Bakerloo {{extension}} {{was proposed}} with three route options. The options were extensions to Hayes via Peckham Rye, Beckenham Junction via Camberwell, or Hayes via New Cross. In July 2011, Network Rail recommended {{an extension of}} the Bakerloo line from Elephant & Castle to Lewisham, where it would take over the line to Hayes. In September 2014, Transport for London ran a consultation on the Bakerloo extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction with options via Lewisham and Camberwell or Old Kent Road, taking over Network Rail's Hayes line. The cost of the extension is estimated at around £2–3 billion with construction expected to take place between the mid-2020s and early 2030s. A February 2017 consultation indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> could extend to Lewisham via Old Kent Road with future extension options later on.|$|E
