5|$|The {{northern}} approach takes {{traffic from}} the A12 {{and the southern}} approach takes traffic from the A2, making the <b>tunnel</b> <b>crossing</b> a key link for both local and longer-distance traffic {{between the north and}} south sides of the river. It forms part of a key route into Central London from South East London and Kent and was the easternmost all-day crossing for vehicles before the opening of the Dartford Tunnel in 1963. It remains the easternmost free fixed road crossing of the Thames, and regularly suffers congestion, to the extent that tidal flow schemes were in place from 1978 until controversially removed in 2007. Proposals to solve the traffic problems have included building a third bore, constructing alternative crossings of the Thames such as the now cancelled Thames Gateway Bridge or the Silvertown Tunnel, and providing better traffic management, particularly for heavy goods vehicles.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of a}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>crossing</b> {{was first}} {{proposed}} by the Ministry of Transport in 1924. Initial reports {{at the start of}} the year suggested a crossing between Tilbury and Gravesend, replacing a ferry service, but this had been rejected by July in favour of a route further upstream, near Dartford. By 1929, the total cost of building the tunnel had been estimated at £3 million (£ million as of [...] ). The tunnel was planned to be part of a general orbital route around London and was provisionally known as part of the [...] "South Orbital Road".|$|E

500|$|Prior to the {{completion}} of this facility, Amtrak served the 1901 depot located in downtown Sturtevant. Due to the age and condition of the facility, in summer 1998 village officials applied for a federal grant {{for the construction of}} a new station. By November, initial construction costs for the facility were estimated at $1 million. Financing for the facility would come 80 percent through a state grant with the remaining 20 percent coming from the village. In July 2000, the original architectural plans were unveiled illustrating a [...] station, two side platforms, and a pedestrian <b>tunnel</b> <b>crossing</b> beneath the tracks. Additionally, construction costs were revised to $1.2 million with an estimated completion date of spring 2001.|$|E

Other ideas have proved unpopular or incorrect, such as her desire to demolish Hyde Park Barracks or build heliports in the CBD and her contention that the Sydney Opera House would be a white elephant.|$|E
