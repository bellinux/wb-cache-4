2500|$|Gwynn {{attended}} Long Beach Polytechnic High School, {{which was}} a high-profile school in sports. He was a two-sport star in both basketball and baseball. In his final two years, his Jackrabbits baseball teams were a combined 3-25-2 in the league, while the basketball teams went 53-6 and twice reached the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section 4A championship game. Gwynn had considered quitting baseball as a senior to concentrate on basketball, but his mother talked him out of it. [...] "She said it might be something {{down the road and}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> sorry later if I didn’t play", recalled Gwynn.|$|E
2500|$|The Sufi view of {{the meaning}} of life stems from the hadith qudsi that states [...] "I (God) was a Hidden Treasure and loved to be known. Therefore I created the Creation <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> known." [...] One {{possible}} interpretation of this view is that the meaning of life for an individual is to know the nature of God, and the purpose of all of creation is to reveal that nature, and to prove its value as the ultimate treasure, that is God. However, this hadith is stated in various forms and interpreted in various ways by people, such, as 'Abdu'l-Bahá of the Bahá'í Faith, and in Ibn'Arabī's Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Lords {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD science fiction movie, Princess of Mars, alongside Antonio Sabàto, Jr. She later regretted making the movie saying: [...] "Somewhere in my heart of hearts I was worried <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> doing something wrong but I believed the voices of those around me who said 'No, it'll be artistic, no it'll be creative. You'll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.' And it was bad, very bad. At least that was what I was told. After watching the first two minutes I had {{to turn it off}} and hide under the covers." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And I," [...] said St. Genis, [...] "was churlish {{enough to}} refuse. I {{would not have}} come now only <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> in time to avert the most awful {{catastrophe}} that has yet fallen upon your house." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 14 February, Edwards' Vauxhall Cavalier {{received}} a parking ticket at the Severn View service station and on 17 February, the vehicle was reported as abandoned. Police discovered the battery to be flat, with {{evidence that the}} car had been lived in. Due to the service station's proximity to the Severn Bridge (which has been a renowned suicide location in the past) it was widely believed that he {{took his own life}} by jumping from the bridge. Many people who knew him, however, have said that he was never the type to contemplate suicide and he himself was quoted in 1994 as saying [...] "In terms of the 'S' word, that does not enter my mind. And it never has done, in terms of an attempt. Because I am stronger than <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a weak person, but I can take pain." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Princeton, Ward {{spent a year}} as a teacher in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. [...] He also {{returned}} to Princeton during the fall of 1895 as an assistant coach for the Princeton football team. [...] While at Lawrenceville, he sought [...] "to impart into growing youth the mathematical idea, also the rudiments of foot-ball, and the truth of truths that there is no University in the country like Princeton." [...] He later wrote, [...] "Teaching, somehow, did not satisfy me: in fact, even before I left college I had an idea <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a doctor some day." [...] In another piece, he noted that he [...] "tried for a year to instill Princeton ideas, along with a little knowledge into the heads of the younger generation. [...] The work was pleasant and I was associated with some fine men; but medicine is to be my vocation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eat {{as much as}} you want," [...] {{said the}} Barmecide. [...] "I bought the woman who makes it for five hundred pieces of gold, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> never <b>be</b> without it." ...|$|R

2500|$|.....my {{ears were}} saluted with the {{agreeable}} {{sound of a}} fall of water and advancing a little further I saw the spray arrise above the plain like a collumn of smoke which would frequently dispear again in an instant caused I presume by the wind which blew pretty hard from the S. W. I did not however loose my direction to this point which soon began to make a roaring too tremendious to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri. ... I hurryed down the hill which was about 200 feet high and difficult of access, to gaze on this sublimely grand specticle. ... immediately at the cascade the river is about 300 yds. wide; about ninety or a hundred yards of this next the Lard. bluff is a smoth even sheet of water falling over a precipice of at least eighty feet, the remaining part of about 200 yards on my right formes the grandest sight I ever beheld, the hight of the fall is the same of the other but the irregular and somewhat projecting rocks below receives the water in it's passage down and brakes it into a perfect white foam which assumes a thousand forms in a moment sometimes flying up in jets of sparkling foam to the hight of fifteen or twenty feet and are scarcely formed before large roling bodies of the same beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals them. in short the rocks seem to be most happily fixed to present a sheet of the whitest beaten froath for 200 yards in length and about 80 feet perpendicular. the water after descending strikes against the butment before mentioned or that on which I stand and seems to reverberate and being met by the more impetuous courant they role and swell into half formed billows of great hight which rise and again disappear in an instant. this butment of rock defends a handsom little bottom of about three acres which is deversified and agreeably shaded with some cottonwood trees; in the lower extremity of the bottom {{there is a very}} thick grove of the same kind of trees which are small, in this wood there are several Indian lodges formed of sticks. ... from the reflection of the sun on the spray or mist which arrises from these falls there is a beatifull rainbow produced which adds not a little to the beauty of this majestically grand senery. after wrighting this imperfect discription I again viewed the falls and was so much disgusted with the imperfect idea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to draw my pen across it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps succeed better than pening the first impressions of the mind; I wished for the pencil of Salvator Rosa or the pen of Thompson, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> enabled to give to the enlightened world some just idea of this truly magnifficent and sublimely grand object, which has from the commencement of time been concealed from the view of civilized man; but this was fruitless and vain. I most sincerely regreted that I had not brought a crimee obscura with me by the assistance of which even I could have hoped to have done better but alas this was also out of my reach; I therefore with the assistance of my pen only indeavoured to traces some of the stronger features of this seen by the assistance of which and my recollection aided by some able pencil I hope still to give to the world some faint idea of an object which at this moment fills me with such pleasure and astonishment, and which of its kind I will venture to ascert is second to but one in the known world. ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Guy," [...] she cried, [...] "forgive me, but I {{could not}} help it. I have made a mummy of myself, and I have walked along those awful sands <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> seen; {{but there is a}} question--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "O Bianca! Forgive me!" [...] I cried. [...] "I did not know! I did not know! I {{was a poor}} fool {{reared in}} {{seclusion}} and ripened thus for the first temptation that should touch me. That is what on Monte Orsaro I sought to expiate, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> worthy of the shrine I guarded then.

6000|$|... "Then," [...] Dredlinton promised, [...] "I shall {{endeavour}} {{to forget}} the incident of last night. Further than <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> indeed <b>be</b> tempted, if it were made worth my while, to provide my wife with a more honourable mode of escape." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Quite sure. If I {{were really}} {{in love with}} her I {{certainly}} should not change. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> bullied out of it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It {{would have}} been useless,' said Miss Aldclyffe. 'All was over by that time.' She {{addressed}} herself as much as Cytherea when she continued, 'Is it a Providence who sent you here at this juncture <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> left entirely alone?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And yet," [...] I mused, [...] "there must be preliminaries; {{some form}} of trial, for instance, with witnesses. It is even {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> found innocent." ...|$|E
