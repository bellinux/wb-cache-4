5|$|Another serious effect {{created by}} the oil-related {{industries}} has been <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> around the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay. By the 1970s, these waterways {{were among the most}} polluted waters in the United States. Though industrial sources were major sources of pollution, urbanization around the bay also contributed significantly to pollution levels. In recent decades, most of <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> in the bay is the result of storm run-off from various smaller commercial, agricultural, and residential sources, as opposed to the major industrial complexes. Conservation efforts in the mid to late 20th century by area industries and municipalities have helped to dramatically improve water quality in the bay reversing {{at least some of the}} earlier damage to the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Excessive ozone {{levels can}} occur due to {{industrial}} activities; nearby Houston is {{ranked among the}} most ozone-polluted cities in the United States. The industries located along the ship channel and the bay are {{a major cause of}} <b>the</b> <b>pollution.</b>|$|E

30|$|Another {{possible}} confounder is <b>the</b> current <b>pollution</b> level. If {{certain areas}} of the country are more predisposed to pollution, it is possible that <b>the</b> past <b>pollution</b> from 1997 is correlated with <b>the</b> current <b>pollution.</b> Since current pollution has already been shown to affect labor supply, omitting this variable could create a bias in our estimates, and furthermore, we might wrongly attribute the effect of current <b>pollution</b> to <b>the</b> past <b>pollution.</b> In that respect, our results would no longer represent long-term effects of pollution, but short-term effects.|$|R
5|$|A major dilemma {{faced by}} Morales' {{administration}} {{was between the}} desire to expand extractive industries in order to fund social programs and provide employment, {{and to protect the}} country's environment from <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> caused by those industries. Although his government professed an environmentalist ethos, expanding environmental monitoring and becoming a leader in the voluntary Forest Stewardship Council, Bolivia continued to witness rapid deforestation for agriculture and illegal logging.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{tests have}} been carried out on fish we put in the river and we are {{satisfied}} that the water will support fish life.

It will be a long job, but we are sure there is a future for angling in the river.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested {{that there may have been}} only a small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. <b>The</b> <b>pollution</b> led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
3000|$|In {{order to}} verify the role of geogenic and {{anthropogenic}} origins as sources of dissolved salts on the aquifer system, {{it is imperative to}} consider the difference in the values of Ow between <b>the</b> insignificant <b>pollution</b> zone and <b>the</b> low <b>pollution</b> zone. From Table  4, it is significant to note that there is no much difference in the values of Ow in the cases of pH, Ca 2 +, K+, HCO_ 3 ^ - [...] and F^ - [...] between <b>the</b> insignificant <b>pollution</b> zone and <b>the</b> low <b>pollution</b> zone. Further, it is also observed that the Ow values of Na+ (0.04), HCO_ 3 ^ - [...] (0.03) and Cl^ - [...] (0.04) are {{more or less the same}} in <b>the</b> insignificant <b>pollution</b> zone, whereas <b>the</b> HCO_ 3 ^ - [...] (0.04) is less than Cl^ - [...] (0.11) and the Na+ (0.15) is more than Cl^ - [...] (0.11) in <b>the</b> low <b>pollution</b> zone. This difference could be due to variation in <b>the</b> source of <b>pollution</b> in <b>the</b> groundwater system.|$|R

5|$|Like the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Guangzhou also {{attempted}} {{to raise the}} air quality of the city. The authority had pledged ￥600 million to fight the problem, and had ordered around 32 chemical plants to stop production {{by the end of}} 2009. A report shown on July 13, 2010 indicates that the air quality was rated at 95.07% in 2009, an increase of 12.01% since 2004; this improvement eventually cost authorities ￥24 billion. Later action from organisers to curb <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> included decreasing the movement of vehicles up to 40 percent and banning barbecue stalls in 11 cities.|$|E
5|$|Many cyclists {{expected}} tropical conditions {{during the}} race and adjusted their training to compensate. For example, Marianne Vos prepared in El Salvador. Cyclists had also anticipated a problem {{with high levels of}} pollution in Beijing, but these did not appear to affect the results of the men's road race. Although <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> levels in Beijing on 10 August far exceeded the World Health Organisation's safety level, the rain during the women's race decreased the smog level.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the {{organizing}} body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E

5|$|Actual {{purification}} of {{the waste}} water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about {{one third of the}} polluted water, and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> of the Scheldt river.|$|E

40|$|Noise, {{which is}} a factor of sound pollution, is {{investigated}} in this study because it has negative effects on the people health. It is easily possible to plan the cities according to the necessity of the future, to investigate {{the sources of the}} noise, to determine the noise areas and to learn what precautions should be taken by means of <b>the</b> noise <b>pollution</b> maps. In this study done for this reason; the noise maps in Giresun city centre during mornings, afternoons and evenings are prepared by combining the measured noise values with the coordinates that are determined by Geographical Information System (GIS) receivers on the measurement points on Netcad 4. 0 computer programme. Thanks to <b>the</b> noise <b>pollution</b> maps prepared, it is evidently carried out that <b>the</b> noise <b>pollution</b> level on <b>the</b> coastal motorway regarded as an international road is highly over the value which is declared in the instructions and it is almost at a level that threatens people` health. Reducing on <b>the</b> noise <b>pollution</b> level is remarkably seen because of decreasing of both the residential areas and commercial shops, getting away from the coastal line as going away from the city centre to {{the southern part of the}} city. Increasing on <b>the</b> noise <b>pollution</b> level is unfortunately observed in the regions since there are plenty of commercial shops, a lot of vehicles and people activities.

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering in her ear.|$|E
5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} creek have also created another problem. Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the creek, excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the creek. The creek is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes physical damage to creek banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E
