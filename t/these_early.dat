5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} <b>these</b> <b>early</b> {{works is}} Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} on this theme were oil-lamp clocks. <b>These</b> <b>early</b> timekeeping devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|All known fossil {{material}} of A. longicervia originates from the Jianshangou Formation in Beipiao, western Liaoning, China. <b>These</b> <b>Early</b> Cretaceous beds constitute {{the lower part}} of the Yixian Formation, which is dated at 124.6 million years old. Nine specimens of A. longicervia have been found, including holotype CBO0220 and paratype CBO0754.|$|E

A ditch of unknown date in that {{vicinity}} may represent a fragment of the medieval defences.|$|E
5|$|As the Byzantine Empire {{continued}} {{the conquest of}} Latin territory, the Turks under Osman I began their raids into Byzantine Anatolia; Söğüt and Eskişehir were taken in 1265 and 1289 respectively. Michael Palaeologus was unable to deal with <b>these</b> <b>early</b> setbacks due {{to the need to}} transfer troops to the West.|$|E
5|$|During <b>these</b> <b>early</b> years, student {{life was}} molded by the Corps of Cadets. The Corps {{was divided into}} a {{battalion}} of three companies, and rivalry among the companies was strong, giving birth to the Aggie spirit and future traditions. No bonfires, yell practices, or athletics teams existed as yet, and social clubs and fraternities were discouraged.|$|E

5|$|The {{main title}} music, a tense, hurtling piece, {{sets the tone}} of {{impending}} violence, and returns three times on the soundtrack. Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15–20 minutes of the film, the title music remains in the audience's mind, lending tension to <b>these</b> <b>early</b> scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film {{through the use of}} ostinato.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. <b>These</b> <b>early</b> phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E

5000|$|As {{modern humans}} spread out from Africa, they {{encountered}} other hominins such as Homo neanderthalensis {{and the so-called}} Denisovans, who may have evolved from populations of Homo erectus that had left Africa around [...] The nature of interaction between <b>early</b> humans and <b>these</b> sister species has been a long-standing source of controversy, the question being whether humans replaced <b>these</b> <b>earlier</b> species or whether they were in fact similar enough to interbreed, in which case <b>these</b> <b>earlier</b> populations may have contributed genetic material to modern humans.|$|R
5|$|A solar cell, or {{photovoltaic}} cell (PV), is {{a device that}} converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens {{was among those who}} recognized the importance of this discovery. In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide, although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. <b>These</b> <b>early</b> solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Belgium in September 1944, there was a boom of new {{magazines}} for the youth, both in French and Dutch. Many of those tried to mix American comics with local artists. Vandersteen worked in <b>these</b> <b>early</b> years for countless publications. He continued publishing in Bravo, with the medieval gags of Lancelot. Having moved to the suburbs of Brussels to avoid the bombardments of Antwerp, he {{came into contact with}} some French language editors. French language magazines he contributed to included Franc Jeu, Perce-Neige, and Le Petit Monde. Two of the comics he created for Franc Jeu were also published in albums. By 1947, all these magazines had disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought {{protection from}} the European missionaries, who had started arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought {{protection from the}} oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of <b>these</b> <b>early</b> congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E

5|$|Although many of <b>these</b> <b>early</b> {{schools were}} open {{for only a}} short time, efforts persisted. The Mohawk Institute Residential School, the oldest, {{continuously}} operated residential school in Canada, opened in 1834 on Six Nations of the Grand River near Brantford, Ontario. Administered by the Anglican Church, the facility opened as the Mechanics' Institute, a day school for boys, in 1828 and became a boarding school four years later when it accepted its first boarders and began admitting female students. It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} {{industries}} to arrive was the Manchester Patent Fuel Company, in 1898. The Trafford Brick Company arrived soon after, followed by J.W. Southern & Co. (timber merchants), James Gresham (engineers), and W. T. Glovers & Co. (electric cable manufacturers). Glovers also built a power {{station in the}} park, {{on the banks of}} the Bridgewater Canal. Most of <b>these</b> <b>early</b> developments were built on the eastern side of the park, while the rest of it remained largely undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. <b>These</b> <b>early</b> attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
