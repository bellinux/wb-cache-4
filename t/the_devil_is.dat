5|$|Josef von Sternberg was {{directing}} in Hollywood at {{the same}} time. Films of his such as Shanghai Express (1932) and <b>The</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>Is</b> a Woman (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style, anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent Underworld (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films. Successful films in that genre such as Little Caesar (1931), The Public Enemy (1931) and Scarface (1932) demonstrated {{that there was an}} audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists. An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes. The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), a forerunner of noir. Among films not considered films noir, perhaps none had a greater effect {{on the development of the}} genre than Citizen Kane (1941), directed by Orson Welles. Its visual intricacy and complex, voiceover narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic films noir.|$|E

25|$|Liberal Christianity often {{views the}} devil metaphorically. This {{is true of}} some Conservative Christian groups too, such as the Christadelphians and the Church of the Blessed Hope. Much of the popular lore of <b>the</b> <b>devil</b> <b>is</b> not biblical; instead, it is a post-medieval Christian reading of the scriptures {{influenced}} by medieval and pre-medieval Christian popular mythology.|$|E
25|$|Easter (påsk) {{is celebrated}} in Sweden. The belief in witches {{travelling}} to Blåkulla on Maundy Thursday (originally for a Sabbath with <b>the</b> <b>Devil)</b> <b>is</b> honoured by children dressing up as witches (påskkärring), {{knocking on the}} doors in the neighbourhood requesting treats (much like trick or treating during Halloween). Good Friday {{used to be an}} extraordinarily calm day when all businesses were closed to commemorate the passion of Christ, but today it is an ordinary holiday.|$|E
25|$|In {{mainstream}} Christianity, the Devil (or Satan) is {{a fallen}} angel who rebelled against God. Satan {{was expelled from}} Heaven and sent to Earth. <b>The</b> <b>devil</b> <b>is</b> often identified as the serpent in the Garden of Eden, whose persuasions led to the two corresponding Christian doctrines: the Original Sin and its cure, the Redemption of Jesus Christ. He is also identified as the accuser of Job, the tempter of the Gospels, Leviathan and the dragon in the Book of Revelation.|$|E

He later lets Jude into the asylum through the kitchen entrance and she tells him she must speak to Mary Eunice alone in the office.|$|E
25|$|Christianity holds several {{different}} views on Christ's role in defeating Satan. Some emphasize Christ's {{death and resurrection}} as sealing Satan's fate, so that <b>the</b> <b>devil</b> <b>is</b> already defeated though not banished. Others emphasize the devil's final judgment when Christ returns, at which time the terror and deceit of Satan will have no more effect on the world. This is because mankind will face final judgment and the earth will be purged or cleansed with fire. Satan will be bound to the lake of fire (Rev 20) with the Beast, the false prophet and all those whose names {{are not in the}} Book of Life.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>Is</b> a Part-Timer! is 2013 fantasy, comedy Japanese anime series {{based on}} the light novels written by Satoshi Wagahara.

Satan and his Demon general Alciel are forced to flee through a portal which drops them off in modern day Japan. With their magic slowly depleting in an unfamiliar world, {{they are forced to}} assume the lives of normal human beings in order to survive. The Hero Emilia Justina follows them through the portal and she too is met with the same circumstances. Although Emilia still harbors negative feelings towards Satan for his past acts of evil, they become unlikely allies in order to survive.|$|E

25|$|Queen Anne's Men {{stayed at}} the theatre until 1617. They {{employed}} prominent playwrights: most of Thomas Heywood's tremendous output was staged there, as were John Webster's The White Devil and The Devil's Law-case, Thomas Dekker's If This Be Not A Good Play, <b>the</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>Is</b> in It, and John Cooke's well-known Greene's Tu Quoque. It also came into possession of some older plays, including Christopher Marlowe's Edward II, and as the period progressed, the Red Bull companies, along with those at the Fortune were associated with old-fashioned plays performed for noisy, ignorant audiences. The audience appears to have booed The White Devil in 1611, and in later years it was the cause of, or scene of, numerous brawls violent enough to result in court cases.|$|E

500|$|The final aria [...] "" [...] (He who sins is of <b>the</b> <b>devil)</b> <b>is</b> again a da capo aria, but shows {{elements}} of a four-part fugue for the voice, the violins in unison, the violas in unison and the continuo. Gardiner describes the theme as [...] "insinuating chromatic" [...] and the [...] "contorted counter-subject to portray the wily shackles of the devil.|$|E
500|$|After the solo, Francis sings [...] "If man is five" [...] several times. There is no backing, {{apart from}} the lead guitar, for several seconds, but then the song's chord {{progression}} is heard again.

At {{the end of the}} second chord progression, the song's main backing restarts again, with Francis screaming [...] "Then God is seven" [...] as the chorus approaches. The final repeated chorus of [...] "This monkey's gone to heaven" [...] ends the song as the string section becomes more prominent.|$|E
500|$|Goya {{had used}} {{witchcraft}} imagery in his 1797–98 Caprichos print series, {{and in his}} similarly titled 1789 painting Witches' Sabbath. In both the 1789 and 1822 Sabbath pictures, <b>the</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>is</b> presented as a goat surrounded by a ring of terrified women. The earlier painting uses witchcraft imagery {{in a manner that}} inverts the order of traditional Christian iconography. The goat extends his left rather than right hoof towards the child, the quarter moon faces out at the left hand corner of the canvas. These inversions may be metaphor for the irrational undermining of the liberals who argued for scientific, religious and social progress. [...] Many of the scientific bodies then active were condemned as subversive and their members accused as [...] "agents of the devil".|$|E
