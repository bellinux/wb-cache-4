China is fielding the DF-21D ASBM, which threatens U.S. and allied surface warships in the Western Pacific. While the Missile Defense Agency has exo-atmospheric targets in development, no program currently exists for an endo-atmospheric target. The endo-atmospheric ASBM target is the Navy’s responsibility, {{but it is not}} currently budgeted. The Missile Defense Agency estimates the non-recurring expense to develop the exo-atmospheric target was $30 million with each <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> an additional $30 million; the endo-atmospheric target will be more expensive to produce according to missile defense analysts. Numerous Navy acquisition programs will require an ASBM surrogate in the coming years, although a limited number of targets (3-5) may be sufficient to validate analytical models ...|$|E
50|$|Following the {{completion}} of market-driven costing, the next task of the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> process is product-level <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> Product-level <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> concentrates on designing products that satisfy the company's customers at the allowable cost.

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{automatically}} learn a PERCEPTUALLY-optimal <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> function for a unit selection speech synthesiser. The approach we take here is to train a classifier on human perceptual judgements of synthetic speech. The output of the classifier is {{used to make a}} simple three-way distinction rather than to estimate a continuously-valued cost. In order to collect the necessary perceptual data, we synthesised 145, 137 short sentences with the usual <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> switched off, so that the search was driven by the join cost only. We then selected the 7200 sentences with the best joins and asked 60 listeners to judge them, providing their ratings for each syllable. From this, we derived a rating for each demiphone. Using as input the same context features employed in our conventional <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> function, we trained a classifier on these human perceptual ratings. We synthesised two sets of test sentences with both our standard <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> and the new <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> based on the classifier. A/B preference tests showed that the classifier-based <b>target</b> <b>cost,</b> which was learned completely automatically from modest amounts of perceptual data, is almost as good as our carefully- and expertly-tuned standard <b>target</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> was {{developed}} independently in both USA and Japan in different time periods. <b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> was adopted earlier by American companies to reduce cost and improve productivity, such as Ford Motor from 1900s, American Motors from 1950s-1960s. Although {{the ideas of}} <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> were also applied {{by a number of}} other American companies including Boeing, Caterpillar, Northern Telecom, few of them apply <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> as comprehensively and intensively as top Japanese companies such as Nissan, Toyota, Nippondenso. <b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> emerged from Japan from 1960s to early 1970s with the particular effort of Japanese automobile industry, including Toyota and Nissan. It did not receive global attention until late 1980s to 1990s when some authors such as Monden (1992), Sakurai (1989), Tanaka (1993), and Cooper (1992) described the way that Japanese companies applied <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> to thrive in their business (IMA 1994). With superior implementation system, Japanese manufacturers is more successful than the American companies in developing <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> Traditional cost-plus pricing strategy has been impeding the productivity and profitability for a long time. As a new strategy, <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> is replacing traditional cost-plus pricing strategy by maximizing customer satisfaction by accepted level of quality and functionality while minimizing costs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> is an {{approach}} to determine a product’s life-cycle cost which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while ensuring its desired profit. It involves setting a target cost by subtracting a desired profit margin from a competitive market price. A target cost is {{the maximum amount of}} cost that can be incurred on a product, however, the firm can still earn the required profit margin from that product at a particular selling price. <b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> decomposes the target cost from product level to component level. Through this decomposition, <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> spread the competitive pressure faced by the company to product’s designers and suppliers. <b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> consists of cost planning in the design phase of production as well as cost control throughout the resulting product life cycle. The cardinal rule of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> is to never exceed the target cost. However, the focus of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> is not to minimize costs, but to achieve a desired level of cost reduction determined by <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> process.|$|E
50|$|Product {{strategy}} and product characteristics affect product-level <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> Characteristics of product strategy such as number of products in line, rate of redesign operations {{and level of}} innovation are shown to have an effect. Higher number of products has a direct correlation with the benefits of <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> Frequent redesigns lead {{to the introduction of}} new products that have created better benefits to <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> It has to be noted that the value of historical information reduces with greater innovation, thereby, reducing the benefits of product level <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b>|$|E

50|$|Supplier-Base {{strategy}} {{is the main}} factor that determines component-level <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> because it is known to {{play a key role}} in the details a firm has about its supplier capabilities. There are three characteristics that make up the supplier-base strategy, including the degree of horizontal integration, power over suppliers and nature of supplier relations. Horizontal integration captures the fraction of product costs sourced externally. Cost pressures on suppliers can drive <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> if the buying power of firms is high enough.

The outcome of this highly cross-functional and cooperative process is a series of initiatives to create more value for the customer and to bring the product costs into line with the company’s need for short and long term financial stability. These improvement initiatives encompass sales and marketing, product design, operations, logistics, and administrative processes within the company.|$|E

We train context-dependent HMMs {{to characterize the}} contextual attributes of units, and calculate Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the corresponding models. We demonstrate that the KLD measure provides a statistically meaningful way to analyze the underlining relations among elements of attributes. With the aid of multidimensional scaling, a set of attributes, including phonetic, prosodic and numerical contexts, are examined by graphically representing elements of the attribute as points on a low dimensional space, where the distances among points agree with the KLDs among the elements. The KLD between multi-space probability distribution HMMs is derived. A perceptual experiment shows that the TTT system defined with the KLD-based <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> sounds slightly better than one with the manuallytuned.
