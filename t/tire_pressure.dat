5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|Traction control, {{rollover}} sensing, optional trailer sway control, <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitors, and {{an optional}} rear backup camera.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{maintenance}} of a vehicle such as engine s, oil changes, and maintaining proper <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> can also help.|$|E
50|$|Engineering has {{recommended}} use of <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> below maximum allowable inflation levels for all UN46 tires. As described previously, the reduced <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> increase understeer and reduce maximum cornering capacity (both 'stabilising' influences). This practice {{has been used}} routinely in heavy duty pick-up truck and car station wagon applications to assure adequate understeer under all loading conditions. Nissan (Pathfinder), Toyota, Chevrolet, and Dodge also reduce <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> for selected applications. While we cannot be sure of their reasons, similarities in vehicle loading suggest that maintaining a minimal level of understeer under rear-loaded conditions may be the compelling factor.|$|R
50|$|BTR-152B (1952) - Artillery command {{version with}} a {{front-mounted}} winch and external <b>tires</b> <b>pressure</b> regulation system.|$|R
50|$|Indicaps: Replaces {{valve stem}} caps. Preset to <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> 18, 20, 26, 28, or 30 lb.|$|R
25|$|Rolling {{resistance}} {{can vary}} {{by a factor}} of 10 or more depending on type and dimensions of tire and the <b>tire</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
25|$|The speed sensors of ABS are {{sometimes}} used in indirect <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring system (TPMS), which can detect under-inflation of tire(s) by difference in rotational speed of wheels.|$|E
25|$|An {{attendant}} (gas jockey) {{operates the}} pumps, often wipes the windshield, and sometimes checks the vehicle's oil level and <b>tire</b> <b>pressure,</b> then collects payment (and perhaps a small tip).|$|E
50|$|BTR-152V1 (1957) - Received {{night vision}} equipment, winch, open top and {{improved}} external <b>tires</b> <b>pressure</b> regulation system.|$|R
50|$|For example, simple {{events can}} be created by a sensor {{detecting}} changes in <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> or ambient temperature.|$|R
50|$|Either {{procedure}} {{may be used}} {{to investigate}} the effects of different vehicle loads (weight), <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> and vehicle speeds.|$|R
25|$|US Aveo safety {{features}} include available four-channel, four-sensor ABS system with electronic {{brake force distribution}} (EBD), and front (dual-stage) and side air bags for front row occupants with a passenger-sensing system. Beginning with 2008, Aveo standard equipment includes a <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring system.|$|E
25|$|The Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds an uprated suspension, 4-wheel {{anti-lock}} brakes, a locking rear differential, beadlock tires, a <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> {{monitoring system}} and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units {{have been sold}} to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 TL {{features}} an improved new immobilizer system, {{and a separate}} <b>Tire</b> <b>Pressure</b> Monitoring System (TPMS) warning lamp. The navigation system has been updated to work in Hawaii, and the AcuraLink satellite capability has been expanded to incorporate 76 markets (up from 38 markets for the 2007 model).|$|E
5000|$|The H1 {{models are}} {{inherently}} stable {{due to their}} wide track. They can ford 30 inches (76 cm) of water and climb a 22-inch (56 cm) step. Their stock ground clearance of 16 inches (41 cm) is made possible by tucking driveline components inside a channel in the central space between {{the left and right}} seats. They have high approach/departure angles of 72/37.5 degrees. Most H1s are equipped with a Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS), which enables the driver to increase or decrease the <b>tire</b> air <b>pressure</b> at the push of a button, since lower <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> are more suited for off road, and higher <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> are desirable on-road.|$|R
50|$|BTR-152V (1955) - Variant {{based on}} ZIL-157 truck with {{external}} <b>tires</b> <b>pressure</b> regulation system, a front-mounted winch and night vision devices for the driver.|$|R
50|$|This {{model is}} newer than SAE J1269 and {{provides}} more accuracy over {{a range of}} different vehicle loads (weight), <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> and vehicle speeds.|$|R
25|$|Additional vehicle-specific {{diagnostic}} and control circuits {{are also available}} on this connector. For instance, on the Corvette there are interfaces for the Class 2 serial data stream from the PCM, the CCM diagnostic terminal, the radio data stream, the airbag system, the selective ride control system, the low <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> warning system, and the passive keyless entry system.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Chieftain touring {{motorcycle}} is {{the first}} Indian model with front fairing and hard saddlebags. It has a stereo with speakers in the fairing, Bluetooth media players, <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors, air-adjustable rear shock, and motorized windshield adjustment. Initial reports from the press were favorable for styling, performance, and handling. The Chieftain was named 2013 Motorcycle of the Year by RoadRunner Motorcycle Touring & Travel magazine.|$|E
25|$|The vehicle has {{an inner}} {{capacity}} of 12 cubic meters, and {{can carry a}} load of 7,000kg. An air conditioning system can be added optionally. The commander {{has the ability to}} carry out all-round surveillance and can take full control of the weapons from the gunner. An onboard information control system (OICS) enables automatic control over the transmission, engine and other important parts of the BTR-90, and it is the first armoured personnel carrier to have such a system. A centralized <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> control system is also available, and allows the vehicle to move even if four of its wheels are destroyed.|$|E
50|$|The {{simulator}} has {{the opportunity}} to engage electronic systems such as Bosch ESP and experience the influence on the driving. Moreover, different <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>tire</b> temperatures can be adjusted on the simulator.|$|R
50|$|NASCAR Racing {{also gave}} players {{the ability to}} set up their car in a {{realistic}} manner, be it adjusting the airdam height, rear spoiler angle, gear ratios, shocks, <b>tire</b> <b>pressures,</b> cambers and more. The original game manual explains {{the effect of these}} parameters.|$|R
50|$|BTR-152U - Command vehicle {{based on}} BTR-152V1 {{equipped}} with external <b>tires</b> <b>pressure</b> regulation system. This command vehicle has {{a significantly higher}} full cover roof and additional radios and antennas. It has equipment for staff operations. This vehicle normally tows a trailer carrying additional equipment.|$|R
25|$|The EV1 was {{not only}} used to {{showcase}} the electric powertrain, but also premiered a number of features and technologies that would later find their way onto more common GM models and other manufacturers' cars. The EV1 {{was among the first}} production vehicles to utilize aluminum {{in the construction of the}} frame. The car's body panels were made of plastic rather than metal, making the car lightweight and dent resistant. The vehicle was fitted with Anti-lock brakes and a traction control system. Comfort improvements included a keyless entry and ignition system, a special one-way thermal glass for better heat rejection on sunny days, an automated <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> loss warning system, electric power steering, and a time-programmable HVAC system.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles can be {{customized}} by the player, both visually and performance-wise. In {{addition to}} adding body parts such as hood scoops and body kits, players can add {{multiple layers of}} decals to the vehicles. Upgrades are separated into three categories: engine/power, appearance/aerodynamics and chassis/drivetrain. There is {{a wide range of}} tuning available including <b>tire</b> <b>pressure,</b> which changes during races due to temperature, downforce, gear ratios and limited slip differential. Vehicles can be realistically damaged, from both a cosmetic and a performance standpoint. This changes the way the game is played, as collisions with barriers and other cars will alter the car's handling, top speed and acceleration. More noticeably, spoilers can be knocked off cars, bumpers dangle from their supports, paint can be scraped off and windows can be smashed completely.|$|E
25|$|For 2010, {{the last}} year of {{production}} for the PT Cruiser, there was only one trim level available: the PT Cruiser Classic. It included a 2.4L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine producing 150 horsepower, a standard four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack and six speakers, a rear-mounted spoiler, standard air conditioning, standard cruise control, standard <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring system (TPMS), standard front and front and rear side SRS airbags, standard keyless entry with two remotes and panic alarm, standard ABS anti-lock brakes, standard sixteen-inch alloy wheels, and more. Optional features included leather seating surfaces, a power front driver's bucket seat, an engine block heater, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and heated dual front bucket seats. Pricing for the 2010 Chrysler PT Cruiser Classic, in MSRP, started at $18,275.00. Exterior color options were Bright Silver Metallic, Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat, Deep Water Blue Pearl Coat, Inferno Red Crystal Tinted Pearl Coat, Silver Steel Metallic, and Stone White Clear Coat. The only interior color option was Pastel Slate Gray.|$|E
50|$|Aeon progressive-rate {{auxiliary}} {{rubber spring}} bumpers: These {{mounted on the}} spring rebound pad in the rear and on the shock absorber stem in the front. Improves the cars handling. Indicaps: Replaces valve stem caps. Preset to <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> 18, 20, 26, 28, or 30 lb.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>pressures</b> and {{lubricants}} {{have to be}} {{as recommended}} by the manufacturer (Higher <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> are required on a particular dynamometer type, but this is to compensate for the different rolling resistance of the dynamometer, not to produce an unrealistic load on the vehicle). Normally the quoted figures a manufacturer publishes have to be proved by the relevant authority witnessing vehicle/engine tests. Some jurisdictions independently test emissions of vehicles in service, and as a final measure can force a recall of all of a particular type of vehicle if the customer vehicles do not fulfill manufacturers' claims within reasonable limits. The expense and bad publicity from such a recall encourages manufacturers to publish realistic figures. The US Federal government retests 10-15% of models), {{to make sure that the}} manufacturer's tests are accurate.|$|R
25|$|The A1 model {{features}} uprated AxleTech 5000 Series axles, an {{anti-lock braking system}} with traction control and a Dana central tire inflation system. Armor mode increases <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> {{to compensate for the}} added weight of the B-kit armor. The operator can manually increase or decrease differential locking based on conditions.|$|R
500|$|Honda {{recommended}} daily checks of the lights, horn, <b>tire</b> <b>pressure,</b> brakes, fuel and oil level, and a weekly {{check of the}} battery electrolyte level. The new engine break-in maintenance was done at , requiring adjustment of the valve tappets and contact breaker points, and an oil change, and the rider was advised to stay under [...] for the first [...] Every [...] the spark plug needed cleaning, and the chain adjustment checked, and every [...] an oil change, breaker point check, and valve adjustment was due. At , major maintenance was due, requiring the removal and cleaning of the carburetor, drive chain, exhaust silencer, and wheel bearings. The rider closed a manual choke to aid in starting at cold temperatures. By {{the standards of the}} day, this was a simple motorcycle, with minimal maintenance demands, and it earned a reputation for high reliability.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>pressure</b> differential: As {{with the}} Renault Dauphine and pre-1968 Volkswagen Beetle, Corvair {{engineers}} {{relied on a}} cost-free <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> differential to eliminate oversteer characteristics [...] low front and high rear tire pressurea strategy which induced understeer (increasing front slip angles faster than the rear). Nonetheless, the strategy offered a significant disadvantage: owners and mechanics could inadvertently but easily re-introduce oversteer characteristics by over-inflating the front tires (e.g., to typical pressures for other cars with other, more prevalent suspension systems). [...] The recommended low front <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> also compromised the tire load capacity.|$|E
2500|$|The 2006 TL {{received}} the <b>Tire</b> <b>Pressure</b> Monitoring System (TPMS) {{and a new}} engine management system to help reduce torque steer. The new horsepower rating of [...] {{is due to a}} change in testing procedures, despite the engine remaining the same since 2004.|$|E
50|$|BTR-152K (1959) - Received {{an armored}} roof with three big hatches {{on top of}} it, two of which opened to the right over the troop compartment, an {{internal}} <b>tires</b> <b>pressure</b> regulation system and a filtering/ventilating system. The weight of the vehicle has increased, the crew went down from 2+18 to 2+13.|$|R

40|$|Evaluation {{of recent}} {{advances}} in tire technologies such as advanced deflection agricultural tires (Firestone IF and VF) and precision tire inflation technologies on soil compaction, traction, fuel economy and crop yield responses are important. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the effects of field and transport (road) <b>tire</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> settings of row-crop agricultural tractor and planter tires on soil compaction. A randomized complete block design experiment was conducted at the Iowa State University farm at Boone, Iowa for two <b>tire</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> levels on Dual Front (Firestone IF 420 / 85 R 34) and Dual Rear (Firestone IF 480 / 80 R 50) tires on a John Deere 8310 R MFWD tractor, and transport tires (Super single 445 / 50 R 22. 5) on a John Deere DB 60 planter. Soil compaction was measured using Stress State Transducers (SSTs) buried at 15 -cm and 30 -cm depths beneath the untrafficked soil surface. The soil cone index depth profile was measured at tire-centerline, tire-edge and 20 cm laterally outboard of the tire edge before and after tractor-planter tire passes. Peak Octahedral Normal Stress (ONS) and the corresponding Octahedral Shear Stress (OSS) values in soil were calculated from the SST data. The peak ONS and corresponding OSS values from the road <b>tire</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> settings were statistically higher (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) than the field <b>tire</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> settings. The maximum ONS was observed at 15 cm soil depth from the road <b>tire</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> setting of the rear tractor tires (179 kPa <b>tire</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> and 33 kN load per tire). The ONS from the front tractor tires (138 kPa <b>tire</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> and 17 kN load per tire) and planter transportation tires (620 kPa <b>tire</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> and 16. 5 kN load per tire) were similar. Cone index data also showed significant differences, comparing before and after tires passes, at the tire-centerline. The peak cone index values for the 0 to 100 mm soil depth range were 1. 3 MPa and 1. 2 MPa from the road and field <b>tire</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> settings, respectively...|$|R
