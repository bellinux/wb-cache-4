This qualitative single-case study of a high-poverty, high-performing middle school focused on the cultural norms, practices, and programs that were perceived to be contributing <b>to</b> <b>narrowing</b> the achievement gap. Through interviews, observations, a survey of certificated staff, and review of school documents, the factors that were perceived to increase academic performance of Hispanic, low-income, and English Learner students were explored.; The cultural norms of a compelling mission of inclusion, equity and access, high expectations, shared leadership, and collaboration were perceived <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>narrowing</b> the gap. The practices of data analyses, standards alignment of curriculum, instruction, assessment and grading, school-wide instructional strategies, consistently enforced discipline practices, and strong student/staff relationships were perceived <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>narrowing</b> the gap. Programs at the selected school were perceived as only moderately contributing <b>to</b> <b>narrowing</b> the achievement gap. A significant percentage of school staff, united by a compelling mission and provided with access to current accurate student achievement data, collaborate to develop solutions that address learning needs of students. Sustaining practices included intentional acculturation of new staff members to believe in a compelling mission, district office support and goal alignment, and time reserved for collaborative data analysis...|$|R

5|$|Another {{prominent}} early anthropologist, Thomas Wingate Todd, {{was primarily}} responsible {{for the creation of}} the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912. In total, Todd acquired 3,300 human skulls and skeletons, 600 anthropoid skulls and skeletons, and 3,000 mammalian skulls and skeletons. Todd's contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding suture closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the mandible. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the pubic symphysis. Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists <b>to</b> <b>narrow</b> down an age range of skeletonized remains. These early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology, {{but it was not until}} the 1940s, with the help of Todd's student, Wilton M.
