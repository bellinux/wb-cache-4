5|$|From the 21st Dynasty onward, more {{copies of}} the Book of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>are</b> found in hieratic script. The {{calligraphy}} {{is similar to that}} of other hieratic manuscripts of the New Kingdom; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns (often the column size corresponds to the size of the papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up). Occasionally a hieratic Book of the Dead contains captions in hieroglyphic.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have noted}} that Brooks uses World War Z as a {{platform}} to criticize government ineptitude, corporate corruption, and human short-sightedness. At {{one point in the}} book, a Palestinian refugee living in Kuwait refuses to believe <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> rising, fearing it is a trick by Israel. Many U.S. characters blame the United States' inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in their government due to conflicts in the Middle East.|$|E

50|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, the Absoute (or {{absolution}} of <b>the</b> <b>dead)</b> <b>is</b> {{a symbolic}} ablution of the deceased's body following the Requiem Mass. While specific prayers are said, the coffin is incensed and sprinkled with holy water. The absolution of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>is</b> only performed in {{context of the}} Tridentine Mass. Following the Second Vatican Council, the absolution of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>was</b> removed from <b>the</b> funeral liturgy of the Mass of Paul VI.|$|R
2500|$|Offerings for <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>were</b> {{known to}} ancient Jewish {{practice}}, {{and it has}} been speculated that Christianity may have taken its similar practice from its Jewish heritage. [...] In Christianity, prayer for <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>is</b> attested since at least the 2nd century, evidenced in part by the tomb inscription of Abercius, Bishop of Hierapolis in Phrygia (d. c. 200). [...] Celebration of the Eucharist for <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>is</b> attested to since at least the 3rd century.|$|R
5|$|Above the course, zones {{four and}} five, as {{identified}} by Cockerell, contain figures which represent the Christian Church in Britain, with the spiritual lords such as bishops, abbots, abbesses and saintly founders of monasteries on the south, while kings, queens and princes occupy the north. Many {{of the figures}} survive and many {{have been identified in}} the light of their various attributes. There is a hierarchy of size, with the more significant figures larger and enthroned in their niches rather than standing. Immediately beneath the upper course are a series of small niches containing dynamic sculptures of the dead coming forth from their tombs on the Day of Judgement. Although naked, some of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> defined as royalty by their crowns and others as bishops by their mitres. Some emerge from their graves with joy and hope, and others with despair.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{compounds}} built within the rova by successive Merina rulers bears distinct architectural styles that reflect the dramatic changes experienced in Imerina over {{the reign of the}} 19th century Kingdom of Madagascar, which saw the arrival and rapid expansion of European influence at the royal court. The site contains a blend of traditional Merina and European styles and construction methods. The predominant architectural features and layout of the royal city follow the traditional model of rova construction that predominated in the Highlands from the 15th century. Following tradition, the homes of the living are constructed of wood and vegetation (living materials), while the tombs of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> built in stone (cold, inert material). The selection of specific wood and plant materials used in construction, each of which were imbued with distinct symbolic meaning, reflected traditional social norms and spiritual beliefs. Since 1996, many of the buildings have undergone restoration using traditional materials and construction practices appropriate to the era in which the buildings were first erected.|$|E
5|$|Zombiepowder. {{is set in}} a western-themed {{environment}} with inconsistent levels of technology, similar to that found in Yasuhiro Nightow's manga series, Trigun. The most prominent characters in the series are powder hunters, individuals who seek the titular zombie powder. The zombie powder is a life-giving substance that can imbue an individual with limitless life force, grant them immortality, and even raise people from the dead. Zombie powder can only be obtained from the Rings of the Dead. These rings are dangerous magical artifacts that, individually, devour the life force of anyone they touch, rendering them comatose. This stolen life energy is converted into the zombie powder, which can only be extracted if twelve Rings of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>are</b> brought together.|$|E

25|$|Other Christians {{understand}} the soul as the life, {{and believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> sleeping (Christian conditionalism).

Believers will inherit eternal life either in Heaven, or in a Kingdom of God on earth, and enjoy eternal fellowship with God.|$|E
25|$|More than 200 U.S. Marshals, deputy marshals, {{and special}} deputy marshals {{have been killed}} in the line of duty since Marshal Robert Forsyth was shot dead by an {{intended}} recipient of court papers in Augusta, Georgia, on January 11, 1794.

25|$|Between thirty-two and forty-three of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> {{estimated}} to have belonged to the crew of Saumarez. The Saumarez was damaged beyond repair while the damage to Volage was repairable. The Albanian coastal batteries did not fire during this incident and an Albanian Navy vessel approached the scene flying the Albanian flag and a white flag. Since Albania had no appropriate vessels at that time, the mines were probably laid by Yugoslavian minelayers Mljet and Meljine on Albanian request, around 20 October 1946.|$|E

25|$|Among the Tanala it is {{traditional}} {{to keep the}} body of a deceased individual for a month or more; <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> then buried in the forest in coffins carved from large logs, with sacrifices to mark the cutting of the log and indications carved into a tree to indicate the location of the burial. In certain Tanala communities, bodies are buried in a tomb, while among others, they are placed inside huts in a designated part of the forest, which is thereafter considered sacred and forbidden to visit.|$|E

25|$|In Gujarat, Kunbi {{communities}} {{are found in}} the Dangs, Surat and Valsad districts. In 2003, Singh and Lal described the Kunbi of Gujarat as being non-vegetarian and consumers of alcoholic drinks such as mohua. That particular community believes itself to be of a higher status than some other local groups due to the type of meat which they consume (for example, they believe that the Warlis eat rats, and other groups eat beef). The community practices monogamous endogamy; marriage of cross cousins is acceptable, as is remarriage by widows. Divorce is permitted and the practice of marriage around the age of 10–12 years has been abandoned. <b>The</b> <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> cremated.|$|E

25|$|At sunset Ra {{passes through}} the akhet, the horizon, in the west. At times the horizon is {{described}} as a gate or door that leads to the Duat. At others, the sky goddess Nut is said to swallow the sun god, so that his journey through the Duat is likened to a journey through her body. In funerary texts, the Duat and the deities in it are portrayed in elaborate, detailed, and widely varying imagery. These images are symbolic of the awesome and enigmatic nature of the Duat, where both the gods and <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> renewed by contact with the original powers of creation. Indeed, although Egyptian texts avoid saying it explicitly, Ra's entry into the Duat is seen as his death.|$|E
25|$|Events {{related to}} Day of the Dead in Cholula extend over five days, and {{are based on}} rites from the pre-Hispanic period. The first day is 28 October, when a flower-covered cross is placed on homes to welcome {{deceased}} loved ones. The souls that arrive on this date are those who died in accidents. On the 29th, those who died from drowning or suffocation arrive. On the 30th, it is the souls of deceased children in limbo, and on the 31st other children. The first and second are for adults. As {{in other parts of}} Mexico, <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> received through large altars placed in homes, filled with the food and drink they enjoyed in life as well as flowers and other decorations.|$|E
25|$|The Last Judgement {{was painted}} by Michelangelo from 1535 to 1541, between two {{important}} historic events, the Sack of Rome by mercenary {{forces of the}} Holy Roman Empire in 1527 and the Council of Trent which commenced in 1545. The work was designed on a grand scale, and spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel. The painting depicts {{the second coming of}} Christ on the Day of Judgment as described in the Revelation of John, Chapter 20. High on the wall is the heroic figure of Christ, with the saints clustered in groups around him. At the bottom left of the painting <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>are</b> raised from their graves and ascend to be judged.
