25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 7 September, El Mundo suggested that during the flight preparation and takeoff attempts, the aircraft had some of its systems in flight mode rather than ground mode. If true, this might explain why de-icing of the Total Air <b>Temperature</b> <b>probe</b> activated on the ground, causing overheating, since in flight the heater would activate only {{when there was no}} air flow in the probe, a sign of icing. This might also explain why the flaps and slats alarm had not sounded, since this alarm is disabled in flight mode.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air <b>temperature</b> <b>probe</b> (the total air temperature sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|E
2500|$|El Mundo, {{citing a}} {{source in the}} {{investigation}} team, reported that the cockpit voice recorder showed that the pilot had said [...] "Flaps OK, Slats OK" [...] to the co-pilot. The article confirmed that the flaps had not been extended and that the alarm for that condition had not sounded. The final report concluded that the failure to deploy flaps {{was the cause of}} the accident. The warning signal that the flaps were not set failed to sound due to it sharing a common power source with the malfunctioning <b>temperature</b> <b>probe</b> that had its circuit breaker turned off.|$|E

The correct use of cold treatment during the shipment {{is used to}} satisfy this requirement. This paper reports {{the results of a}} simulated refrigerated transport of citrus fruits (14600 kg of ‘Tarocco’ oranges) in a 40 ft refrigerated container. Temperatures have been monitored inside the refrigerated container in different positions of the load (in the air, in the pallet and in the fruits) using 40 innovative direct-to-digital <b>temperature</b> <b>probes.</b> Moreover, an innovative package (with an increased vented surface) was compared to the standard boxes.
