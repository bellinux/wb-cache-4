40|$|While {{realizing that}} technologies, knowledge, and {{competencies}} are the technology supplier’s {{main source of}} competitive advantage, the current inter-firm technology transfer (TT) issue in international joint ventures (IJVs) revolves around the extent of degree of technologies that are transferred by the suppliers to recipient partners in terms of tacit and explicit knowledge. Previous studies on intra-firm knowledge transfer have acknowledged the significant influence of technology actors and facilitators/barriers such as the knowledge transferred, source, recipient and contextual/relational characteristics in the knowledge transfer process. Although previous studies have established the significant relationships between technology transfer determinants and technology transfer, however, these relationships could possibly {{have been influenced by}} the MNCs’ country of origin (MNCCOO). Based on the underlying knowledge-based view (KBV) and organizational learning (OL) perspectives, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} empirically examine the moderating effects of the MNCs’ country of origin in the relationships between <b>technology</b> <b>recipient</b> characteristics: absorptive capacity (ACAP) and recipient collaborativeness (RCOL) and two distinct dimensions of degrees of technology transfer: degrees of tacit and explicit knowledge within IJVs. Using the moderated multiple regression (MMR), the theoretical models and hypotheses in this study were tested based on empirical data Moderating Effects of MNCs’ Country of Origin in the Relationship between <b>Technology</b> <b>Recipient</b> Characteristics and Degree of Inter-Firm Technology Transfer 338 gathered from 128 joint venture companies registered with the Registrar of Companies of Malaysia (ROC). The results revealed that the MNCs’ country of origin has significantly affected the relationships between <b>technology</b> <b>recipient</b> characteristics (absorptive capacity and recipient collaborativeness) and degree of explicit knowledge; where the relationship was found stronger for Asian MNCs than Western MNCs.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to empirically examine the effects of four critical technology transfer characteristics: knowledge, <b>technology</b> <b>recipient,</b> technology supplier, and relationship characteristics on two distinct dimensions of degree of technology transfer, namely, degree of tacit and explicit knowledge. Using the quantitative analytical approach, the theoretical model and hypotheses in this study were tested based on empirical data gathered from 128 joint venture companies registered with the Registrar of Companies of Malaysia (ROC). Data obtained from the survey questionnaires were analyzed using the correlation coefficients and multiple linear regression analyses. The results revealed that relationship characteristics have the strongest significant effects on both degrees of tacit and explicit knowledge followed by technology supplier and recipient characteristics. Contrary to the study’s prediction, but still consistent with the recent development in literature, knowledge characteristics have only significantly affected degree of explicit knowledge not degree of tacit knowledge. The study has bridged the literature gaps by providing empirical evidence on the effects of four critical technology transfer characteristics: knowledge, <b>technology</b> <b>recipient,</b> technology supplier, and relationship characteristics on two distinct dimensions of degree of inter-firm technology transfer: degree of tacit and explicit knowledge in IJVs in a single model...|$|E

40|$|The inter-firm {{technology}} transfers within collaborative {{joint ventures}} (JVs) have often involved close tradeoffs between {{the willingness of}} technology supplier to transfer {{a considerable amount of}} their technologies to <b>technology</b> <b>recipient,</b> degree of protection of the proprietary technology, knowledge and competencies as the source of the supplier’s competitive advantage, and motivation to transfer. While technology transfers through JVs, have been acknowledged by many studies as the most efficient formal mechanism in internalizing the partner’s technologies, knowledge and skills, the transfer process has frequently involved various facilitators, actors and complex relationship between partners which cause direct impact on degree of technology transfer. Based on the underlying knowledge-based view (KBV) and organizational learning (OL) perspectives, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} empirically examine the effects of two critical elements of technology supplier characteristics: partner protectiveness and transfer capacity on two dimensions of degree of technology transfer: degree of tacit and explicit knowledge. Using the quantitative analytical approach, the theoretical model and hypotheses in this study were tested based on empirical data gathered from 128 joint venture companies registered with the Registrar of Companies of Malaysia (ROC). Data obtained from the survey questionnaires were analyzed using the correlation coefficients and multiple linear regressions. The results revealed that partner protectiveness, as the critical element of <b>technology</b> <b>recipient</b> characteristics, had 1) a low significant effect on degree of tacit knowledge, and 2) no significant effect on degree of explicit knowledge. Nonetheless, transfer capacity showed strong significant effects on both degrees of tacit and explicit knowledge; where the effect on degree of explicit knowledge is slightly stronger than its effect on degree of tacit knowledge. The study has bridged the literature gaps in such that it offers empirical evidence on the effects of two generic technology supplier attributes: partner protectiveness and transfer capacity on degree of inter-firm technology transfer: degree of tacit and explicit knowledge in IJVs. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{accentuate}} on the relationships between knowledge, <b>technology</b> <b>recipient,</b> technology supplier and relationship characteristics and degree of inter-firm technology transfer. A conceptual framework was developed and a review of relevant literature was conducted. Building on the integrated knowledge-based view and organizational learning perspectives, and previous technology transfers models, this study proposes a model in providing explanations on the relationships between technology transfer characteristics and degree of technology transfer. This model also conceptualizes the relationship between the degree of technology transfer and local firms’ performance, specifically at corporate and human resource performance. Building on intra and inter-firm KT literature this paper extends the literature by conceptualizing the relationships between four critical dimensions of TTCHARS (KCHAR, TRCHAR, TSCHAR, and RCHAR) and TTDEG in a single holistic model to explain the relationships between each group of TTCHARS and degree of inter-firm TT in IJVs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to propose a holistic model of inter-firm technology transfer (TT) based on an integrated knowledge-based-view (KBV) and organizational learning (OL) perspectives in conceptualizing the critical links between technology transfer characteristics: knowledge, <b>technology</b> <b>recipient,</b> technology supplier and relationship characteristics (TTCHARS) and degree of technology transfer (TTDEG) in international joint ventures (IJVs). Since the current TT issue now is centered on efficiency and effectiveness of technology transfer as an efficient formal vehicle to internalize foreign technologies as compared to direct import of goods, licensing and foreign direct investment, the advancement of the holistic model is to provide a complete view on the significant effect of technology transfer characteristics and their dimensions on degree of technology transfer in IJV which eventually could contribute to the increase of local companies’ competitiveness, indigenous technical capabilities, technological development, and potential for local innovation. In the study’s model, hypotheses are developed to describe the relationships between TTCHARS and TTDEG based on the underlying KBV and OL perspectives...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the recent phenomenon of private/public partnerships (PPPs) in the ICT {{sector of the}} developing world. The partners may come to these projects with divergent motivations: profit {{on the one hand}} and the provision of public services on the other, but at the end of the day, the interests of the partners that are symbiotic can—and indeed should—be aligned to ensure successful long-term projects. To investigate what can be done to promote successful PPPs, this paper extends the traditional two-actor analysis to include both a third-party non-profit-oriented facilitating organization and the <b>technology</b> <b>recipients</b> that are the targets of these projects. Following an overview of the current state of PPPs in the developing world, the paper provides two case studies, based in Vietnam, where all four of the above-mentioned stakeholders were involved. The cases reveal important success factors that can be applied to future PPPs in the ICT sector. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of how intellectual property rights (IPRs) affect international technology transfer is a critical issue in global innovation. This paper examines empirically how IPRs in a <b>technology</b> <b>recipient</b> country affect international licensing, based on licensing contracts by Japanese firms. Major findings from their licensing-out contracts are the following: (1) Japanese firms report significantly more international contracts than domestic ones as commercially important contracts in each of five categories of industries, suggesting a global nature of technology licensing. (2) The probability that a firm engages in a licensing contract covering only patents is significantly low when the licensee ’ county protects IPRs weakly, and significantly high when it is domestic or when the licensor belongs to a R&D intensive sector or is R&D intensive. (3) The probability of ownership control over a licensee increases significantly when the licensee’s country protects IPRs weakly and when the licensed technology is comprehensive. Thus, weak protection of IPRs looks to constrain an efficient allocation of ownership right between a licensor and a licensee...|$|E

40|$|AbstractProcess of {{technology}} transfer {{is the most}} challenging and critical {{in the development and}} diffusion {{of technology}}. The ultimate aim of this research is to contribute towards a viable theoretical framework of agro-based technology transfer. This study uses case study methodology involving an agro-based government research institution and six private firms in Malaysia. This research reveals that the development of new technology did not lead to technology transfer until business opportunity is properly recognised. The business opportunity must be recognised first; then, the process of technology transfer will follow. The accomplishment of technology transfer from government research institution to private firms requires a well planned and comprehensive, structured process, and the support of the following factors: (a) business opportunity is recognised; (b) the technology generator shared his/her knowledge and know-how fully; (c) both the technology generator and <b>technology</b> <b>recipient</b> are passionate about technology transfer; and (d) both of them are totally involved and committed throughout the technology transfer process. As a conclusion, the accomplishment of technology transfer is explained by cognitive and affective theories in that, the entrepreneur's mental judgment links the process of technology transfer through the recognition of opportunity, while emotions and feeling complement this process...|$|E
