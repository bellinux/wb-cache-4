5|$|The {{idea for}} Qapital was {{conceived}} by ex-bankers in Sweden. The software {{was designed by}} twin brothers Daniel and Andreas Källbom of Studio Källbom and released in Sweden in December 2013.

5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all {{the doors and windows}} to the house were shut, except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor.

Coppola also showed Dorff Paper Moon (1973) during production.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the active duty {{squadron}} early in their careers, and participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12. They {{took part in the}} Italian offensives in North Africa and the island of Rhodes, but did not see combat with the Ottoman fleet. They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I, and <b>they</b> <b>spent</b> the war in Venice. The ships were discarded shortly {{after the end of the}} war, both having been stricken in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} in the Second Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet at the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914. They participated in the Battle of Antivari in mid-August and unsuccessfully attempted to lure out the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet. <b>They</b> <b>spent</b> {{the early part of}} the war based at Corfu, Navarino and Malta, to keep the Austro-Hungarians bottled up in the Adriatic Sea. In 1916 the ships supported Allied operations in Salonica and also detached landing parties to support the Allied attempt to force Greek acquiescence for those operations in Athens on 1 December. <b>They</b> <b>spent</b> the rest of the war at Salonica and Athens. Patrie became flagship of the French squadron at Salonica in 1918. After the end of the war, both ships were placed in reserve in 1919. République was disarmed in 1920 and stricken from the naval register in 1921 and subsequently broken up for scrap. Patrie was retained longer, serving as a training ship in Toulon for mechanics and torpedomen until 1927, when she too was stricken and sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{first took}} place in a {{storeroom}} in the industrial district of Shanghai. Having difficulties scouting a cotton factory suitable for shooting, set designers decided to recreate one {{in the style of the}} 1930s. <b>They</b> <b>spent</b> weeks transforming an abandoned storeroom into the Zhen Hua Cotton Mill Factory, a 1930s cotton mill factory founded by Ip's friend Chow Ching-chuen (played in the film by Simon Yam) during the Sino-Japanese War. It was where Ip Man first taught Wing Chun openly to the public.|$|E

5|$|On 7 September 1909 two {{visitors}} were left stranded {{at the top}} of the tower as the final lift car of the night descended without them.

5|$|On {{level ground}} again, {{they began to}} make quick progress. They awoke {{on the morning of}} 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the Ninnis Glacier) far larger than the first. As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once {{at the bottom of the}} glacier <b>they</b> <b>spent</b> four days {{crossing}} fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.|$|E
