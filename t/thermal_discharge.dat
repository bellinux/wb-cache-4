5000|$|Elevated {{temperature}} typically {{decreases the}} level of dissolved oxygen of water, as gases are less soluble in hotter liquids. This can harm aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians and other aquatic organisms. Thermal pollution may also increase the metabolic rate of aquatic animals, as enzyme activity, resulting in these organisms consuming more food in a shorter time than if their environment were not changed. An increased metabolic rate may result in fewer resources; the more adapted organisms moving in may have an advantage over organisms that {{are not used to}} the warmer temperature. As a result, food chains of the old and new environments may be compromised. Some fish species will avoid stream segments or coastal areas adjacent to a <b>thermal</b> <b>discharge.</b> Biodiversity can be decreased as a result.|$|E

40|$|The Liffey Estuary and Dublin Bay, Ireland {{are of a}} great {{recreational}} and conservational value. Until recently, the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) plant at Poolbeg, Dublin, abstracted dilution water from the estuary for cooling purposes and subsequently discharged this water back to the estuary at temperatures that were sometimes 7 - 9 oC above ambient values. Prior to its discharge to the estuary, the ESB cooling water was mixed with the sewage effluent from Ringsend Treatment Works, creating a warmer and less-saline pollutant plume that remained buoyant on the water surface, adversely effecting water quality. The ESB plant has since closed {{as part of a}} competitive energy market agreement.

40|$|Due to {{the planned}} {{construction}} of Maasvlakte 2 the E. ON power {{plant on the}} Maasvlakte will not discharge its heated water into the North Sea anymore, but in the harbour basins itself. This together with a planned increase of {{the total amount of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>discharges</b> in the Maasvlakte area (power plants of EnecoGen and Electrabel, chemical industry etc.) will most probably lead to an increase of the water temperature within the harbour basins, which can lead to economical, legal and ecological consequences. In cooperation with the Port of Rotterdam and Deltares, this master thesis aimed to give an answer to the amount of increase of water temperature due to the planned <b>thermal</b> <b>discharges,</b> its consequences and measures to reduce this increase of temperature. With the use of some first estimates and a heat-balance there could be concluded that the increase of temperature is significant and that the movement of the tide together with the freshwater flux is the main mechanism for the netto heat flux out of the Maasvlakte area. Stratification has an important influence on the spreading of the heat plumes in the harbours. To give a more accurate prediction of the increase of water temperature at the mixing zone borders and at the intake locations (recirculation), the numerical hydrostatic model Delft 3 D-FLOW and the near-field model CORMIX are used. It is shown that the regulations will not be exceeded if the borders of the mixing zones are chosen close to the Beerkanaal. The predicted increase of temperature at the E. ON-intake will cause some economical losses. Replacing the intake at a greater depth or (even better) a variable intake near the water surface and bottom could be effective measures to reduce these losses. For a more drastic reduction of the increase of temperature in the harbour basins, relative expensive measures are needed. It is recommended to the Port of Rotterdam to place future <b>thermal</b> <b>discharges</b> as close as possible near the Beerkanaal or North Sea, and to study the ecological effects of the temperature rise in the Eastern Yangtzehaven.

Despite these challenges, {{it is critical that}} assessments of thermal effects from power generation do not rely solely on data collected in the plume, but also focus on fish living in the canal, particularly in regions above the zone of tempering influence. We deployed a fixed underwater videography apparatus to monitor the community composition and abundance patterns of fish in the Nanticoke thermal generating discharge canal on the north shore of Lake Erie from February 1, 1999 until July 31, 1999. We also compared the number of species observed using video to angling surveys, visual observations through the air/water interface and two modified netting procedures. Our results indicate that videography permitted the detection of the most species and the highest number of individuals. Variable visibility was the largest limitation of this approach.

However, indicator species analysis suggests certain taxa were associated with particular sites; abundances of Musculium lacustre, Simulium reptans, and Orthocladiinae were greater at the unheated control site, whereas more pollution-tolerant species such Asellus aquaticus and Erpobdella octoculata were more common in the thermally impacted reaches.
