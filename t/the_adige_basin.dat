40|$|The {{territory}} extending {{between the}} Venetian Alps and the Emilian Apennines is formed by {{a mosaic of}} environments which span from high mountains to hilly and plain areas. These present rather varied features from one extreme (Alpine watershed) to the other (Emilian Apennines watershed). In the early Holocene, the plain area included between the two mountain chains – the Venetian-Po plain – was extended some tens km to the south {{with respect to the}} present day coast. This vast territory has been the object of research since the 1970 s and 1980 s. Field activities have allowed identifying a rich set of sites that occupy different topographic and geographic locations, thus composing an articulated mosaic characterised by a much wider variability with respect to the well-known case of <b>the</b> <b>Adige</b> <b>basin,</b> located at the western limit of the examined area, which is exclusively included within a mountain territory. In this paper, we analyse {{for the first time the}} rich record from this area in its whole with the aim of investigating the territorial organisation of hunter–gatherer groups on a wide scale. This research has allowed us to set hypotheses on the mobility and occupation strategies of human groups and on the key-aspects that may have favoured the extensive and intensive occupation of this area. Besides the supposed presence of a biomass compatible with the demographic increase that has characterised this period, we also suggest that the “pragmatic” Sauveterrian technological systems played an important role in the adaptation of early Mesolithic hunter–gatherers to the varied ecosystems offered by this area...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{mobility}} {{connected to}} a scheduled resource exploitation is a recurrent topic {{in the interpretation of}} the Early Mesolithic settlement pattern of <b>the</b> <b>Adige</b> <b>Basin</b> in the South Eastern Alps. Nevertheless direct archaeological seasonality data are scarce. This work presents new results from seasonal dating on faunal remains from the Sauveterrian site of Galgenbühel/Dos de la Forca in the Adige Valley (Northern Italy) frequented between 9265 ± 70 and 8454 ± 46 BP uncal. (8699 e 7459 BC cal.) by hunter egathererefisher communities. An effort to collect and combine multifold data in order to dispose of complementary evidence for the interpretation, was made. Analyses are based on the incremental bone growth structures of the fish remains, tooth eruption/shedding and bone fusion of juvenile macromammals {{as well as on the}} presence of migrating birds. Results highlight a general preponderance of data referring to spring and summer throughout the stratigraphic sequence, whilst autumnewinter evidence is sporadic. The reasons for a marked springesummer occupation of the site, best documented by the fish sample, partly the result of targeted catches, are most likely related to the predominant wetland economy. Seen in a regional perspective, the results break up with the dichotomy of “winter-valley bottom” and “summer-mountain territories” used to explain the relationship between low- and highland sites. A first comparative analysis between neighboring valley bottom rock-shelters based on macrofaunal ecology and economy as well as shelter exposition, suggests a higher variability in site function, and maybe also occupation season, as prospected so far...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{provides}} a comprehensive evaluation of eight high spatial resolution gridded precipitation products in Adige Basin located in Italy within 45 – 47. 1 °N. <b>The</b> <b>Adige</b> <b>Basin</b> {{is characterized by}} a complex topography, and independent ground data are available from a network of 101 rain gauges during 2000 – 2010. The eight products include the Version 7 TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3 B 42 product, three products from CMORPH (the Climate Prediction Center MORPHing technique), i. e., CMORPH_RAW, CMORPH_CRT and CMORPH_BLD, PCDR (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record), PGF (Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset for land surface modelling developed by Princeton University), CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) and GSMaP_MVK (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation project Moving Vector with Kalman-filter product). All eight products are evaluated against interpolated rain gauge data at the common 0. 25 ° spatial resolution, and additional evaluations at native finer spatial resolution are conducted for CHIRPS (0. 05 °) and GSMaP_MVK (0. 10 °). Evaluation is performed at multiple temporal (daily, monthly and annual) and spatial scales (grid and watershed). Evaluation results show that in terms of overall statistical metrics the CHIRPS, TRMM and CMORPH_BLD comparably rank as the top three best performing products, while the PGF performs worst. All eight products underestimate and overestimate the occurrence frequency of daily precipitation for some intensity ranges. All products tend to show higher error in the winter months (December–February) when precipitation is low. Very slight difference can be observed in the evaluation metrics and aspects between at the aggregated 0. 25 ° spatial resolution and at the native finer resolutions (0. 05 °) for CHIRPS and (0. 10 °) for GSMaP_MVK products. This study has implications for precipitation product development and the global view of the performance of various precipitation products, and provides valuable guidance when choosing alternative precipitation data for local community...|$|E

50|$|The central pit of the Verona amphitheatre was {{deeper than}} the rooms {{normally}} found underneath the arena, {{and served as a}} basin. It was connected to two axial conduits. One, circulating under the West gallery of the arena, was not connected to the drainage system and had to be connected to an aqueduct in order to fill the basin. The East conduit was deeper and designed to drain water into <b>the</b> <b>Adige</b> River. <b>The</b> <b>basin</b> at the Mérida amphitheatre, at only 1.5 meters, was shallower than that at Verona. Because it is so shallow—less than the height of a standing man—it cannot be confused with an underground service room. This basin was equipped with access stairs and covered with material similar to that used for swimming pools and Roman baths. It was also served by two conduits, the western one of which connected to the nearby San Lazaro aqueduct.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that geochemistry {{is useful for}} the identification of sediment origin and provenance in alluvial plains characterised by a complex hydrographic evolution. The study {{is focused on the}} northeastern Padanian plain (Italy), an area primarily characterised by sedimentary contributions from the two largest Italian river systems (Po and Adige), which intimately interacted during the last millennia. X-ray fluorescence analyses of 120 soils and alluvial sediments define three diverse geochemical affinities that have distinctive siderophile/chalcophile elemental ratios. The sample group characterised by high Ni/Zn and Cr/Pb values conforms to modern Po River sediments, whereas a second group showing low Ni/Zn and Cr/Pb values conforms to the geochemical signature of modern Adige River sediments. A third sample group defines a “transitional” affinity that represents a geochemical mixture of Po (70 %) and Adige (30 %) sedimentary end-members. Based on these geochemical features, it is possible to distinguish alluvial sediments of the Po River basin (Ni/Zn > 1. 0 and Cr/Pb > 4. 2) from those of <b>the</b> <b>Adige</b> River <b>basin</b> (Ni/Zn < 0. 6 and Cr/Pb < 1. 9) and to provide evidence of the migration of these rivers during the evolution of the Padanian plain. The interpretation of transitional samples is less constrained and could imply an ancient connection between the two fluvial systems, possibly due to the development of wetlands where both <b>the</b> Po and <b>Adige</b> rivers variably delivered their sedimentary contributions. This study approach, therefore, provides important implications for palaeohydrographic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions in a complex area that is characterised by significant geomorphological modifications during the last millennia...|$|R

40|$|Three storm events, {{occurred}} in 2006, 2007 and 2009 in <b>the</b> upper <b>Adige</b> River <b>basin</b> (Eastern Alps, northern Italy) have been analyzed. The first storm system (4 October 2006) generated a flash flood {{with almost no}} debris flows and landslides, the second (21 June 2007) triggered {{a large number of}} debris flows and was characterized by a relatively minor runoff response, and the third (4 September 2009) resulted in both a relevant flash flood response and debris flows in minor streams. A strong interest both for civil protection and research purposes has been devoted by local authorities and researchers to such events. The study methods include radar rainfall analysis, hydrological modeling and {GIS} processing of spatial rainfall data and debris-flow locations. Precise information on debris-flow location and related volumes were derived from a geo-spatial database of instability phenomena implemented and managed by the Autonomous Province of Bolzano. Patterns of rainfall distribution and relations between the main hydrological variables (cumulative rainfall, intensity and antecedent moisture) have been analyzed to explain differences in catchments responses between the three studied events. Radar rainfall data have permitted to analyze rainfall fields with high spatial resolution, taking into account also the elevation variability of rainfall rates. The striking responses' contrast among the three events is related to differences in antecedent moisture, space-time structure of the rainstorms, cumulative rainfall and intensity distributions and temperature regime. The frequency analysis of the main hydrological variables revealed to be a powerful tool capable of distinguishing, within a synoptic framework, the space-time-magnitude variability of the events, so as to highlight the differences in flood and debris-flow response...|$|R
