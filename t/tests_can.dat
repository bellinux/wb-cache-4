5|$|Diagnosis {{is based}} on a person's {{symptoms}} and history of medication use. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, and meningitis should be ruled out. No laboratory <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|If a {{cylinder}} passes the listed procedures, but the condition remains doubtful, further <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> {{be applied to}} ensure that the cylinder is fit for use. Cylinders that fail the tests or inspection and cannot be fixed should be rendered unserviceable after notifying the owner of the reason for failure.|$|E
5|$|Other imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, {{computed}} tomography (CT), and magnetic imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis. Blood <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> also help identify {{the presence of}} infection: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and chlamydial and gonococcal DNA probes.|$|E

5|$|Several {{chemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> be used {{to confirm}} the identify of the mushroom. A drop of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) on the flesh turns it greenish, while potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns it brown. The cap cuticle turns yellow with nitric acid (HNO3), and yellow with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH).|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> be used {{to distinguish}} I.torosus from other similar boletes, such as I.rhodopurpureus. I.torosus displays the following characteristic colour changes with tests performed on cut flesh less than 12 hours old: ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH)–yellow centre bordered by a blue circular outer ring; potassium hydroxide (KOH)– deep buff (instantly); ferrous sulphate (FeS04)–no change; Melzer's reagent–dark blue; phenol–blue green (very slow); formalin–mid blue (slow).|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} help {{confirm the}} identify of the mushroom: a drop of dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution will turn the tubes pale red whereas nitric acid (HNO3) on the tubes produces orange-yellow; a solution of Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) applied to the flesh results in a pale grey color.|$|E

5|$|Several {{chemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} {{help identify}} the mushroom. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a greenish to bluish colour. Application of iron(II) sulphate solution causes the flesh to stain a dull bluish-green, while the pores turn golden brown with a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> {{used to help}} confirm {{identification of}} the mushroom. The cap cuticle turns grayish with {{the application of a}} drop of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4), and dark brown to amber with a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). The flesh turns pale brown with KOH, and pale yellow with ammonia (NH4OH).|$|E
5|$|Some {{chemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} {{help identify}} the mushroom. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on the cap cuticle will stain dark red to blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while ferrous sulphate solution turns the cuticle yellow and then greenish-yellow. Melzer's reagent will turn the flesh dark blue, after the natural bluing reaction to injury has faded.|$|E

50|$|Bienfang’s <b>test</b> <b>can</b> help {{differentiate}} OMG {{from other}} causes of ptosis. For example, although most cases of acquired ptosis in older adults {{are due to}} dehiscence of the levator aponeurosis, OMG, which can affect the elderly, cannot be entirely ruled out. In such cases, Bienfang’s <b>test</b> <b>can</b> be useful.|$|R
5|$|Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) {{can be used}} to biopsy bone lesions, {{once found}} on an X-ray or other scan. Such <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> be vital in diagnosis and can also prevent unnecessary treatment and invasive surgery. Conversely, FNA biopsy of tumors of the parathyroid gland is not recommended for diagnosing parathyroid carcinoma and may in fact be harmful, as the needle can puncture the tumor, leading to dissemination and the possible spread of cancerous cells.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{function}} <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> show {{a combination}} of results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> {{be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E

5|$|Several {{chemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} help verify {{an identification}} of L.holopus. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a pinkish color, but has no reaction with the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) has no reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction or a brownish reaction with the flesh. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution does not have a reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction to slightly olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} help verify {{an identification}} of L.rugosiceps. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a reddish color or is unreactive, and yellow or unreactive on the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution produces a gray color on the cap surface, and greenish-gray to olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|Supplemental testing {{provides}} extra {{information on}} some {{features of the}} disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses. Blood <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> identify other causes for dementia than AD—causes which may, in rare cases, be reversible. It is common to perform thyroid function tests, assess B12, rule out syphilis, rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anaemia. (It is also necessary to rule out delirium).|$|E

5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E
5|$|Various {{chemical}} color <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} {{help identify}} fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) will turn the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the cap cuticle red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on the flesh, and brown on the cap. Iron sulphate (FeSO4) produces either no change to a pale grey color with both the flesh and the cuticle. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes the flesh to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the <b>tests</b> <b>can</b> be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E
50|$|The sign <b>test</b> <b>can</b> also <b>test</b> if {{the median}} of a {{collection}} of numbers is significantly greater than or less than a specified value.
