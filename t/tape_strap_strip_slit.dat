40|$|Fact sheet {{written for}} the Inventions and Innovation Program about a new method for making steel <b>strapping</b> and <b>strip</b> from rod stock {{produced}} from scrap steel. There is a large movement in the American steel industry to utilize more recycled steel. Recycled steel melted in the electric arc furnaces of mini-mills is being used {{as the source of}} raw materials for an increasing number of products, largely due to its lower price. However, conventional processes for producing steel <b>strapping</b> and cold-rolled <b>strip</b> steel restrict manufacturers from using more than 50 % recycled steel. In addition, steel <b>strapping</b> and cold-rolled <b>strip</b> steel traditionally require many production steps. They are produced from primary steel that has been cast into slab, heated, rolled to achieve the desired thickness, and slit to the desired width. The slitting process produces microcracks {{along the edge of the}} <b>strapping</b> or <b>strip,</b> which reduce tensile strength. A new continuous process produces steel strapping and 1 / 2 inch to 6 inch strip steel from the rod and strip stock made from scrap steel in mini-mills. The new process creates steel <b>strapping</b> and <b>strip</b> with improved strength and quality due to the absence of microcracks caused by the conventional slitting process. The finished product is cheaper because of the lower cost associated with using rod ad lower conversion costs. In addition, the higher tensile strength of the product allows for thinner strapping. The process represents a new approach to producing any steel strapping used for bundling and packaging items for storage or transport. In addition, this innovative new process can be used to produce cold-rolled strip steel, a basic raw material for automobile parts, hardware, office equipment, and many other products...|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} magnetic-field and current distributions for coplanar superconducting <b>strips</b> with <b>slits</b> in an {{applied magnetic field}} H_a. We consider ideal strips with no bulk pinning and calculate the hysteretic behavior of the magnetic moment m_y {{as a function of}} H_a due solely to geometrical edge barriers. We find that the m_y-H_a curves are strongly affected by the slits. In an ascending field, the m_y-H_a curves exhibit kink or peak structures, because the slits prevent penetration of magnetic flux. In a descending field, m_y becomes positive, because magnetic flux is trapped in the slits, in contrast to the behavior of a single <b>strip</b> without <b>slits,</b> for which m_y = 0.

50|$|A {{detachable}} box {{magazine is}} a self-contained mechanism {{capable of being}} loaded or unloaded while detached from the host firearm. They are attached via a slot in the firearm receiver, usually below the action but occasionally to the side (Sten, FG 42, Johnson LMG) or on top (Madsen machine gun, Bren gun, FN P90). When necessary, the magazine can easily be detached from the firearm and replaced by another. This significantly speeds the process of reloading, allowing the operator quick access to ammunition. This type of magazine may be straight or curved, the curve being necessary if the rifle uses rimmed ammunition or ammunition with a tapered case. Detachable box magazines may be metal or plastic. The plastic magazines are sometimes partially transparent so the operator can easily check the remaining ammunition. Box magazines are often affixed to each other with clamps, clips, <b>tape,</b> <b>straps,</b> or built-in studs to facilitate faster reloading: see jungle style.|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} a number of {{boundary}} value problems in diffraction theory and wing lifting surface theory with special reference to circular disks and apertures and to slits. The problems of the diffraction of an incident wave (scalar or electromagnetic) by a circular disk, circular aperture, <b>strip</b> or <b>slit</b> have received considerable attention during the last decades. For a survey of the various methods of solution the reader is referred to the review articles of Bouwkamp [g] and of Hönl, Maue and Westpfahl [19]. In this paper we are especially interested in low-frequency expansions for the field quantities, valid when ka or kb is small, where k is the wave number, a is the radius of the disk or aperture, 2 b is the width of the <b>strip</b> or <b>slit.</b> These expansions wil 1 be obtained from Fredholm integral equations of the second kind, the kernels of these integral equations being small when ka or kb is small.

This project involves background work on butt-welding of injection moulded polypropylene ASTM bars followed by a programme on the welding of extruded polypropylene <b>strapping</b> <b>tape.</b> In the butt-welding study, the effects of processing conditions of the bars, welding variables, and annealing treatments, on the morphology and strength of the welds, were investigated. Light and scanning electron microscopy {{have been used for}} the analysis of morphological structure and fracture surface texture. Tensile tests have been used to assess the weld strength either at room temperature and at sub-zero temperature. In the <b>strapping</b> <b>tape</b> programme the influence of the tape orientation and the welding temperature on weld efficiency was analysed. The orientation of the tapes, obtained by means of five different draw ratios in the manufacturing plant, was assessed by doing shrinkage and optical measurements. Shear and peeling tests have been used to study the weld efficiency. From the butt-welding study was concluded that the microstructure of the injection moulded bars affected the weld zone morphology. The annealing at l 52 degrees C before and after welding caused a reduction in weld strength. However the oriented zones were apparently unaffected by these thermal treatments. In that the <b>strapping</b> <b>tape</b> welding is concerned, an optimum welding tool temperature could be identified. The draw ratio of the tapes seems not to affect the optimum weld temperature, but it influences the efficiency of the welds...|$|R

50|$|After {{inserting}} {{the winding}}, rework on the stator or the winding ends {{needs to be}} performed. Usually, the multitude of connecting lines is separated manually and bundled according to the different phases. Both winding ends are tied up with an adhesive <b>tape</b> or <b>strap</b> in the further course of the finishing. When using a high operating voltage, the partial winding of each phase must be insulated against the respective adjacent phase with foil or insulation paper. To ensure that the winding heads are positioned exclusively {{at the back of}} the stator, both of them must be molded. This is either executed by using an enameled wire receiving a bonding electric current during molding or by cold forming which is followed by impregnation. The creation of a certain winding head shape allows a rotor to be installed or a stator to be inserted into the housing afterwards.|$|R

The photographic technique known as the <b>strip</b> or <b>slit</b> technique seems to lead to a different reading of the photographic still. Rather than seeing the image as a framed, cut-out of reality, it invites us to look through it, read it and feel the different changes within one image.
