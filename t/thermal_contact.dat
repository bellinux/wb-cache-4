5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in <b>thermal</b> <b>contact.</b> If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E
25|$|In physics, <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> {{conductance}} is {{the study}} of heat conduction between solid bodies in <b>thermal</b> <b>contact.</b> The <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> conductance coefficient, , is a property indicating the thermal conductivity, or ability to conduct heat, between two bodies in contact. The inverse of this property is termed <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> resistance.|$|E
25|$|For each {{interface}} between two objects {{in contact with}} each other, {{there will be a}} temperature drop across the interface. For such composite systems, the temperature drop across the interface may be appreciable. This temperature change may be attributed to {{what is known as the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> resistance. Thermal interface materials (TIM) decrease the <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> resistance.|$|E
40|$|Complex {{cryogenics}} {{is still}} a strong limitation {{to the spread of}} quantum voltage standards and cryogen-free operation is then particularly interesting for Josephson standards. The main difficulties in He-free refrigeration are related to chip thermalization. We tested different solutions and interface materials between the chip and the cooling surface, to improve thermal conduction. Some junctions were chosen as elements to dissipate electrical power, while some others were operated as on-chip temperature sensors. Indium foil between chip and Cu support was demonstrated to provide a good thermal interface suitable for programmable voltage standard operation. However, thermal conduction can be further increased by <b>thermal</b> <b>contacting</b> the chip at the top. Finally, general physical constraints in vacuum <b>thermal</b> <b>contacts</b> are analyzed in terms of known properties of thermal interfaces at cryogenics temperatures.

A movable thermally-conductive second member has a second <b>thermal</b> <b>contacting</b> surface. A thermally conductive coupler is interposed {{between the first}} member and the second member for thermally coupling the first member to the second member. At least one control spring is coupled between the first member and the second member.

30|$|The mold insert, the {{aluminum}} plates, and the platens were considered as rigid bodies. The polymer substrate {{was considered an}} elasto-plastic body. Heat exchange boundaries were included to the mold insert, aluminum plates, and polymer substrate to allow heat transfer between <b>thermal</b> <b>contacts</b> and the environment. It was assumed that the polymer flows identically in any cross-sectional area on the X- and Y-planes. A non-slip condition was applied on the bottom surface of the polymer substrate.|$|R
25|$|When two solid bodies come in contact, such as A and B in Figure 1, heat {{flows from}} the hotter body to the colder body. From experience, the {{temperature}} profile along the two bodies varies, approximately, {{as shown in the}} figure. A temperature drop is observed at the interface between the two surfaces in contact. This phenomenon {{is said to be a}} result of a <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> resistance existing between the contacting surfaces. <b>Thermal</b> <b>contact</b> resistance is defined as the ratio between this temperature drop and the average heat flow across the interface.|$|E

25|$|When {{two systems}} in <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> {{are at the}} same {{temperature}} no heat transfers between them. When a temperature difference does exist heat flows spontaneously from the warmer system to the colder system until they are in thermal equilibrium.

The theoretical model of a two-layer structure at rear-surface illumination in the high frequency limit is considered. It is shown that the effective thermal diffusivity presents ``resonance'' while the effective thermal conductivity sharply changes its magnitude and sign. Such ``resonant'' behavior strongly depends on the surface thermal conductivities associated with the interface <b>thermal</b> <b>contacts.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

In vacuum, the well-known result of a length independent conductance is recovered; its precise value, however, is found to depend sensitively on the overlap between the vibrational spectrum of the junction and the density of states of the nanoparticles that act as <b>thermal</b> <b>contacts.</b> In a liquid environment, the conductance is constant up to a crossover length, above which a standard Fourier regime is recovered...|$|R
25|$|Consider a {{heat engine}} working between two {{temperatures}} TH and Ta. With Ta we have ambient temperature in mind, but, in principle {{it may also}} be some other low temperature. The heat engine is in <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> with two heat reservoirs which are supposed to have a very large heat capacity so that their temperatures do not change significantly if heat QH is removed from the hot reservoir and Qa is added to the lower reservoir. Under normal operation TH > Ta and QH, Qa, and W are all positive.|$|E
25|$|A strong {{magnetic}} field {{is applied to}} the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered entropy. A heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. <b>Thermal</b> <b>contact</b> with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the {{magnetic field}} is switched off. This increases the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink.|$|E
25|$|As power {{dissipation}} of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal {{as well as}} its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> with its heat sink with reasonable shock and vibration. The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy, wire-form z clips, flat spring clips, standoff spacers, and push pins with ends that expand after installing.|$|E

Using the photoacoustic method the values of thermal conductivity of porous silicon and composite systems with liquid have been obtained. It is shown {{that the value of}} thermal conductivity «PS-liquid» substantially exceeds the value determined by the model of «parallel structures». The increase of thermal conductivity is due to the improvement of <b>thermal</b> <b>contacts</b> among the crystallites when introducing liquid into the pores.

25|$|Ice cream {{was made}} by hand {{in a large bowl}} placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle {{attached}} to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.|$|E
