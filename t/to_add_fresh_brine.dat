40|$|Abstract. Dynamic nets are an {{extension}} of Petri nets where the net topology may change dynamically. This is achieved by allowing (i) tokens to be coloured with place names (carried on as data), (ii) transitions to designate places where to spawn new tokens {{on the basis of}} the colours in the fetched tokens, and (iii) firings <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>fresh</b> places and transitions to the net. Dynamic nets have been given step or interleaving semantics but, to the best of our knowledge, their non-sequential truly concurrent semantics has not been addressed in the literature. To fill this gap, we extend the ordinary notions of processes and unfolding to dynamic nets, providing two different constructions: (i) a specific process and unfolding for a particular initial marking, and (ii) processes and unfolding patterns that abstract away from the colours of the token initially available. ...|$|R

5000|$|Based {{on field}} observations, Joseph Grinnell {{formulated}} {{the principle of}} competitive exclusion in 1904: [...] "Two species of approximately the same food habits {{are not likely to}} remain long evenly balanced in numbers in the same region. One will crowd out the other". Russian ecologist Georgy Gause formulated the law of competitive exclusion based on laboratory competition experiments using two species of Paramecium, P. aurelia and P. caudatum. The conditions were <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>fresh</b> water every day and input a constant flow of food. Although P. caudatum initially dominated, P. aurelia recovered and subsequently drove P. caudatum extinct via exploitative resource competition. However, Gause was able to let the P. caudatum survive by differing the environmental parameters (food, water). Thus, the Gause law is valid only if the ecological factors are constant.Gause also studied competition between two species of yeast, finding that Saccharomyces cerevisiae consistently outcompeted Schizosaccharomyces kefir by producing a higher concentration of ethyl alcohol.|$|R

A sum was voted for a public monument which was erected over a new grave in Westminster Abbey. In the Guildhall Edmund Burke's inscription summed up what he had meant to the City: he was 'the minister by whom commerce was united with and made to flourish by war'. Soon after the funeral a bill was passed bestowing a pension of £4,000 a year on his successors in the earldom.

40|$|Rhetoric is classically {{divided into}} three notions: ethos, pathos, and logos. Taking a discursive {{approach}} {{to the construction of}} identity as a turn-by-turn members’ achievement, we hope <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>fresh</b> insights <b>to</b> the rhetorical notion of ethos. More specifically, using a transcript of one of President Kennedy's meetings about the space race, we examine how Kennedy and his advisors ‘do’ identity to strategic effect. Findings indicate how Kennedy initiates the topic of geo-politics which (1) makes relevant his identity as president and evokes a domain of practice in which his voice counts and (2) evokes the ‘them and us’ polarity of the Soviet threat which allows Kennedy to speak as ‘us’, and thus with the authority of the American people. Conversely, his main advisor orients to Kennedy's identity as president, but he subverts the predicates linked with this identity to his own ends. He refers to another predicate of president, namely political vulnerability and argues that Kennedy should therefore not stake everything on getting {{a man on the moon}} before the Soviets. To increase his ‘good sense’ and counter Kennedy's deployment of political responsibilities linked to the identity of president, his advisor evokes an expert identity based on superior access to scientific knowledge. status: publishe...|$|R
