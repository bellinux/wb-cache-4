25|$|A forest f {{consists}} of a list of trees, while a tree t {{consists of}} a pair of a value v and a forest f (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> the value, and another <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> the children.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} there are cases where two things can be {{rendered}} impure in succession by a corpse, {{one of those things}} being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the other thing being rendered impure with an impurity lasting until the evening. There are cases where three things can be rendered impure in succession by a corpse, two of those things being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the remaining <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> an impurity lasting until the evening. And there are cases where four things can be rendered impure in succession by a corpse, three of those things being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the remaining <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> an impurity lasting until the evening.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} few years, {{various aspects of the}} All-Star Game came under scrutiny, {{including}} the format of the game. To make things worse, the All-Star Game itself was viewed in some circles as a bad <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> players opting out of the game in favour of the rest and prospective hosts repeatedly declining to host the event.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Drs. Takezaki and Hanaoka {{first used}} {{carbamazepine}} to control mania in patients refractory to antipsychotics (lithium {{was not available}} in Japan at that time). Dr. Okuma, working independently, did the same <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> success. As they were also epileptologists, they had some familiarity with the antiaggression effects of this drug. Carbamazepine was studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E
25|$|After {{attempting}} to leave Spring Heeled Jack, Karcich temporarily filled in on drums for Mephiskapheles. He {{went on to}} audition for several other bands, including 2 Skinnee J's, before {{he was invited to}} join Pilfers who were looking to replace their rhythm section. Karcich performed as part of the second Pilfers lineup until they too disbanded. Afterward, he was a founding member of Cenzo with Pellegrino and former Pilfers bandmates, Vinny Nobile and Carl Barc. At the time of his death, {{he was a member of}} Avoid One <b>Thing</b> <b>with</b> Bosstones bass player, Joe Gittleman, Amy Griffin of Raging Teens and Paul Delano of Darkbuster. Although featured in the artwork for their self-titled debut, Karcich does not actually perform on the album.|$|E

25|$|Staff {{training}} was uneven and neglected. Systematic training of formation leaders was not begun until after 1943. It created {{a lack of}} trained and experienced flight leaders in 1943–1945. This was far too late {{to help in the}} Defence of the Reich campaign. The trained and experienced leaders that did exist were replaced in 1940 by younger and less experienced leaders too quickly (owing to Göring's frustration with them during the Battle of Britain). Later, Göring did the same <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> Fighter Division, the Jafu Jagdfliegerführer and Jagddivision commanders. The high turnover in the division made gaining experience impossible. Making matters worse, there were no fighter command organisations {{at the start of the}} war and there were never enough good officers to staff those that were set up. The Luftwaffe had very few General Staff Officers.|$|E
25|$|As {{that year}} began, Another World was {{expanded}} to 60 minutes, {{with their first}} hour-long episode airing on January 6, 1975. Although this did not directly affect As the World Turns, as the two shows were not in competition for {{anything other than the}} overall ratings win, CBS' afternoon lineup suffered some ratings damage as the popular soap put a dent in the ratings of both of CBS' popular afternoon game shows, The Price Is Right and Match Game. NBC, pleased by the success that the expansion of Another World had brought to the network, elected to do the same <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> Days of Our Lives beginning on April 21, 1975; this put Days of Our Lives and As the World Turns in direct competition for ratings. Incidentally, the expansions were occurring seven years after the last two 15-minute serials, Search for Tomorrow and The Guiding Light, expanded to 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} secure his power, Díaz engaged in various forms of {{co-optation}} and coercion. He played his people like a board game – catering to the private desires of different interest groups and playing off one interest against another. In order to satisfy any competing forces, such as the Mestizos and wealthier indigenous people, he gave them political positions of power {{that they could not}} refuse. He did the same <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> the elite Creole society by not interfering with their wealth and haciendas. Covering both pro and anti-clerical elements, Díaz was both the head of the Freemasons in Mexico and an important advisor to the Catholic bishops. Díaz proved to be a different kind of liberal than those of the past. He neither assaulted the Church (like most liberals) nor protected the Church. As for the Native American population, who were historically repressed, they were almost completely depoliticized; neither put on a pedestal as the core of Mexican society nor suppressed, and were largely left to advance by their own means. In giving different groups with potential power a taste of what they wanted, Díaz created the illusion of democracy and quelled almost all competing forces.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Kath {{joined a}} cover band called the Missing Links, taking Parazaider and Seraphine with him, and started playing clubs and ballrooms in Chicago {{on a regular}} basis. Parazaider's friend at De Paul University, trumpeter Lee Loughnane, also sat in with the band from time to time. Kath's compatriot, James William Guercio (who later became Chicago's producer) was lead guitarist {{in one of two}} road bands {{performing}} on The Dick Clark Show with the Missing Links. Kath received an offer from Guercio to play bass for the Illinois Speed Press and move to Los Angeles, but declined as he considered the guitar his main instrument and wanted to sing lead. He stayed with Parazaider, Seraphine, and Loughnane instead, who quickly recruited trombonist James Pankow from De Paul and vocalist/keyboardist Robert Lamm. Kath sang the lower range of lead vocals in the group in a style reminiscent of Ray Charles. The group practiced at Parazaider's parents' basement and changed its name to The Big <b>Thing.</b> <b>With</b> the addition of singer and bassist Peter Cetera of The Exceptions, they moved to Los Angeles and signed with Columbia Records, renaming the band Chicago Transit Authority. In mid-1969, the name was shortened to Chicago.|$|E

500|$|Here's the <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> {{me and the}} {{religious}} thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else.
