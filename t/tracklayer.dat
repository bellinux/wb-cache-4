After a specified time, depending on the difficulty of the track and the requirements of the rules of the organization, the dog and handler are directed to the track and find the <b>tracklayer</b> and articles as required. The dog is usually worked on a 10-metre or (30-foot) lead, but the length of lead actually used depends on the terrain.|$|E

50|$|In {{the face}} of the declining mineral {{production}} in the Castle area, Harlow realized that his railroad needed a larger and more diversified traffic base. He therefore announced plans to extend his railroad still farther, and in 1899 railway construction crews began working eastward down the Musselshell River valley. The Montana Railroad was completed to the new town of Harlowton (named after Harlow) in 1900. The line's <b>tracklayers</b> then turned northward, finally reaching Lewistown in 1903.|$|R
2500|$|In 1919 the {{streetcar}} unions petitioned the National War Labor Board again for union recognition and were denied a second time, resulting in violent resistance. [...] The Mexican <b>tracklayers</b> walked out in solidarity, strikers greased streetcar wheels, trolleys were overturned from their tracks, and a riot broke out on August 20 in downtown Los Angeles. Ultimately, railway workers {{walked away with}} a pay increase and the Los Angeles Railway management continued their open shop policies. War time politics would greatly halt organized labor in the coming years.|$|R
50|$|A Tracking {{trial is}} an event to {{encourage}} dogs {{to make use of}} their strongest facility, the ability to follow a scent trail. The competition emulates the finding of a lost person or article in a situation where the performance of the dog can be fairly assessed. Because of this, the tracks laid are straightforward, not the wanderings that may characterize a lost person, nor do they include deliberate attempts by the <b>tracklayer</b> to deceive the dog.|$|E
50|$|In general, a dog {{must work}} {{continually}} as if genuinely {{looking for a}} lost person without assistance from the handler, and find the required number of lost articles and the <b>tracklayer</b> {{at the end of}} the track, for the dog to be awarded a pass. This pass can also be graded on the quality of the work. After the required passes have been awarded, the dog may apply for a tracking title according to the rules of the organization the trials have been run under.|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War Brown's new heavier tractor, the VAK1, was produced, {{with over}} 7,700 units {{eventually}} sold, making Brown a wealthy man. It is said the David Brown Tractor {{is the only}} one to be built onto a sturdy cast iron chassis where other makers bolt components together to form a chassis-less construction which is weaker, Brown also built aircraft tugs (VIG) for the Royal Air Force and for pulling the bomb trolleys used to re-arm aircraft. These tugs are distinctive, with truck like tyres, wrap round body work and HD bumpers front and rear, some being fitted with winches. In 1942 Brown started building a <b>tracklayer</b> version, the DB4. The DB4 was built for the army engineers and solved some of the problems found with the VTK, and got round an embargo on imported machines for military use. It was powered by a 38 h.p. Dorman diesel and a five speed gearbox. The DB4 was replaced in 1950 by the Trackmaster 30.|$|E

40|$|The dinosaur {{tracks of}} the Glen Rose Formation in the Paluxy River at Dinosaur Valley State Park {{are among the}} best {{preserved}} and most abundant in the world. While many track sites are easily correlated to the Main Tracksite, others, especially those at the extreme ends of the park, are differently preserved and not obviously correlated. To count track horizons, several stratigraphic sections were measured along the river from upstream at the McFall Ledge Site to 7. 6 km downstream at the County Road 1001 crossing (3. 1 km linear distance). These reveal 6 meters of strata separating two track-bearing horizons exposed in the river. Seven distinctive beds can be correlated: 1) the lowest, the Main <b>Tracklayer,</b> a dolomitic mud with Arenicolites burrows and finely preserved footprints, 2) a hardground with oyster-encrusted bored cobbles, 3) the “Steinkern Marl”, a fining upward shaly –concretionary unit containing a diverse fauna including clams and serpulid mounds in life position, 4) the “Corbula bed”, a few cm of grainstone consisting almost exclusively of mm-size diagenetically-altered articulated clams steinkerns, 5) a fine-grained packstone riddled with Thallassinoides burrows and occupied by sparsely-scattered meter-sized serpulid mounds, 6) the Taylor <b>Tracklayer,</b> containing poorly-preserved footprints and mudcracks, and 7) the highest, a wackestone ledge characterized by Diplocraterion. The Main <b>Tracklayer</b> is underlain by a sparsely- exposed meter of silt, suggesting high-stand or forced regression, and the <b>tracklayer</b> itself suggests initial transgression above the sequence boundary {{at the base of the}} bed. The encrusted, bored cobbles followed by a fining-upward succession of concretionary fossil-rich beds suggest episodic deposition and low sedimentation rates of the transgressive systems tract, culminating in the condensed, diagenetically altered Corbula accumulation. Subsequent deposits, with the exception of the serpulid mounds are increasingly silty, suggesting highstand deposits culminating in another sequence boundary at the base of the Taylor <b>Tracklayer.</b> Local structural relief exposes the Main <b>Tracklayer</b> in the northern/central park area, and exposes the higher Tayler <b>Tracklayer</b> at the eastern and western/southern part of the park.

40|$|In 1940 R. T. Bird of the American Museum of Natural History {{collected}} {{segments of}} a sauropod and a theropod trackway from {{a site in}} the bed (Glen Rose Formation; Lower Cretaceous) of the Paluxy River, {{in what is now}} Dinosaur Valley State Park (Glen Rose, Texas, USA). However, Bird left undocumented thousands of other dinosaur footprints from this and other Paluxy tracksites. In 2008 and 2009 our international team carried out fieldwork to create detailed photomosaics of extant Paluxy tracksites, using GIS technology to combine these with historic maps and photographs. We also made photographs, tracings, LiDAR images, and measurements of individual footprints and trackways. Paluxy dinosaur tracksites occur in more than one <b>tracklayer,</b> but the largest and most spectacular footprints occur in the Main <b>Tracklayer,</b> a 20 - 30 cm thick, homogeneous dolomudstone that is thickly riddled with vertical invertebrate burrows (Skolithos). There are two dinosaur footprint morphotypes in the Main Tracklayer: spectacular sauropod trackways (Brontopodus) and the far more numerous tridactyl footprints, most or all of which were made by large theropods (possible ornithopod prints occur in a <b>tracklayer</b> stratigraphically higher than the Main <b>Tracklayer).</b> Tridactyl footprints are highly variable in quality; Paluxy tracksites collectively constitute a natural laboratory for investigating how trackmaker-substrate interactions create extensive extramorphological variability from a single foot morphology. Trackways of bipedal dinosaurs show a “mirror-image” distribution, suggesting movement of animals back and forth along a shoreline. In contrast, most sauropod trackways head in roughly the same direction, suggesting passage of a group of dinosaurs. The trackways collected by R. T. Bird suggest that at least one theropod was following a sauropod...|$|E
40|$|Diplocraterion, a U-shaped burrow {{attributed}} to infaunal invertebrates, is normally a shallow-marine trace fossil and {{not part of}} a continental vertebrate ichnoassemblage. Hence, the Glen Rose Formation (Aptian–Albian) of Texas (USA) presents an opportunity to study Diplocraterion associated with a world-class dinosaur tracksite. Most Diplocraterion are in a bioclastic wackestone–packstone bed just above the Taylor <b>Tracklayer,</b> a significant dinosaur track horizon. Diplocraterion are consistently sized, but with variable depths; most have protrusive spreiten and northeast–southwest trends. Smaller Arenicolites co-occur with Diplocraterion, and other trace fossils include Rhizocorallium and a large theropod trackway. Based on our analysis, a sea-level rise buried the Taylor <b>Tracklayer,</b> with a shallow-marine carbonate mud colonised by Diplocraterion and Arenicolites tracemakers. Protrusive Diplocraterion, eroded burrow tops, Rhizocorallium, and other criteria point towards firming and net erosion of the bed caused by a stillstand. The depositional environment of the Diplocraterion bed was possibly a subtidal lagoon that covered shoreward sediments impacted by large theropods. Burrow orientations suggest bidirectional currents consistent with trends of theropod trackways, implying each were controlled by a shoreline. The results of our study demonstrate how marine invertebrate and continental vertebrate trace fossils can be used together to define fine-scale changes in former carbonate shorelines...|$|E

40|$|As {{the second}} task of this thesis, we shall propose some {{mathematical}} model {{to simulate the}} movement of a floating bridge under some moving loadings. The floating bridge system consists of three parts, i. e. river (fluid), floating bridge (multibody system) and vehicles (load) which pass the bridge. Our objective {{is to find the}} motion and dynamical responses of the floating bridge with a truck or <b>tracklayer</b> passing on it. The floating bridge is a system of steel rectangular boxes which can be seen as rigid bodies connected by some kinematic joints. In fact, such system is a fluid-structure coupled system and one must treat the governing equations for the floating bridge and fluid, i. e. Euler-Lagrange equations and Navier-Stokes equations, simultaneously. In our work, we apply the one-leg method and operator splitting arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method to solve the coupled system. When performing dynamical analysis of a constrained mechanical system, a set of index- 3 differential algebraic equations, i. e. Euler-Lagrange equations, are often needed to describe the time evolution of the mechanical system. In this thesis, we apply one-leg multi-step methods to integrate the DAEs directly. To overcome some difficulties leading to certain numerical instabilities, a velocity elimination technique is applied to generate a framework that the position and velocity profiles can be obtained in two separate stages: only the position variables and Lagrange multipliers take part in the convergent nonlinear iterations at each time step while the velocity is calculated by the multi-step formula directly without any iteration. The framework is constructed in a manner such that it satisfies all the constraints at the position level and involves variables as few as possible during the iteration. Some convergence analysis are presented and good stability and high efficiency can be seen through the experiments of some benchmark problems. Zhao Yubo. "July 2005. "Adviser: Zou Jun.
