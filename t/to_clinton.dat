5|$|In 1850, Cleveland's father moved <b>to</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Oneida County, New York, {{to work as}} {{district}} {{secretary for}} the American Home Missionary Society. Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned <b>to</b> <b>Clinton</b> and his schooling {{at the completion of}} the apprentice contract. In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again. Shortly after, he died from a gastric ulcer, with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.|$|E

5|$|Paul Newman as Ben Quick. Newman met {{director}} Martin Ritt as {{a student}} at the Actors Studio, where Ritt was a teacher-assistant for Elia Kazan. Newman, who was under a contract with Warner Brothers, was loaned to 20th Century Fox for a fee of US$75,000. Meanwhile, his contract earned him US$17,500 for each ten-week shot. He travelled <b>to</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Louisiana, before the start of filming to study the mannerisms, accent and speech of the Southern men {{in order to create a}} proper characterization.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Barkley went to Emory College (now part of Emory University) in Oxford, Georgia, the {{alma mater}} of several administrators {{and faculty members}} at Marvin. During the 1897–1898 {{academic}} year, he {{was active in the}} debating society and the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, but he could not afford to continue his education and returned <b>to</b> <b>Clinton</b> after the spring semester. He took a job teaching at Marvin College but did not make enough money to meet his basic living expenses. He resigned in December 1898 to move with his parents to Paducah, Kentucky, the county seat of McCracken County, where his father found employment at a cordage mill.|$|E

5|$|Benedict Arnold next wrote {{a series}} of letters <b>to</b> <b>Clinton,</b> even before he might have {{expected}} {{a response to the}} July 7 letter. In a July 11 letter, he complained that the British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made. On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to £20,000 (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a £1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette Square is one {{of three}} squares laid out in Joseph Ellicott's city plan. The square is located three blocks east of Niagara Square and is the second most {{important}} space in downtown Buffalo. The block is surrounded by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Metro Rail light rail rapid transit to the west, which runs above-ground along Main Street in what is called the Free Fare Zone, Washington Street to the east, Lafayette Square to the north (a one-way westbound continuation of Broadway) and Lafayette Square to the south (a one-way eastbound connection <b>to</b> <b>Clinton</b> Street).|$|E
5|$|M-100 {{starts at}} exit66 on I-69 in Potterville. The highway runs north along Hartel Road, {{intersecting}} Lansing Road, the former route of US Highway 27 (US27) south of downtown. Hartel Road runs due north from Potterville to Grand Ledge. North of M-43 (Saginaw Highway), M-100 follows Clinton Street, jogging northwest along Jefferson Street north of Willow Highway. Crossing the Grand River on Bridge Street, M-100 returns <b>to</b> <b>Clinton</b> Street {{north of the}} river. North of town, the roadway is once again known as Hartel Road before changing to Wright Road near the Abrams Municipal Airport. North of Grand River Highway, which is the former route of US16, M-100 meets I-96 and ends; Wright Road continues {{to the north of}} the interchange.|$|E

5|$|The {{segment of}} NY22 north of US11, named Hemmingford Road, was state-maintained until September1, 1988, when {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} {{that part of the}} route was transferred <b>to</b> <b>Clinton</b> County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the county and the state of New York. Following the swap, it was co-designated as CR34 by Clinton County. In 2008, the signed northern terminus of NY22 was moved to the east end of its overlap with US11 in Mooers. The official alignment of NY22 was not changed, however, as the New York State Department of Transportation still considered the Canadian border to be NY22's northern terminus until ca. July 2014.|$|E
5|$|Branford is {{the first}} {{previously}} rebuilt station to be further renovated with a second platform. A $60 million bond in February 2011 included $16.5 million for a second platform and pedestrian bridge at Branford, $7.3 million for platform extensions at Guilford, and $11 million to add catenary wires to currently unwired sidings along the line. Construction on the new platform at Branford began in September 2013, and the Guilford work is under way as well. After delays, the enlarged Branford station opened on September 30, 2016, although the north platform was not immediately served by trains. Bidding on a second platform and three-level parking garage at Madison, planned since 2009, was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur. Per the agreement with Amtrak, a second platform is planned to be added <b>to</b> <b>Clinton</b> station. The project was originally planned to start in early 2012, but has since been indefinitely delayed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways without a posted route number {{were given a}} signed designation for the first time. The Altona–Chazy Landing state highway was designated as NY191. At its east end, the route connected to Vermont RouteF-2 on Isle La Motte {{by way of a}} ferry across part of Lake Champlain. The ferry was discontinued in 1937; however, the endpoints of NY191 remained unchanged. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of all of NY191 was transferred from the state of New York <b>to</b> <b>Clinton</b> County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The entirety of the highway was designated as CR23 by Clinton County and NY191 was truncated to consist only of the portion of the route between Sciota and Chazy. The route was decommissioned on March 18, 2015.|$|E

5|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back <b>to</b> <b>Clinton</b> as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E
5|$|M-52 {{was first}} {{designated}} by July 1, 1919. The original routing {{started at the}} Ohio state line and ran north through Adrian to M-50 much as it does today. It turned east along M-50 into Tecumseh and then turned north <b>to</b> <b>Clinton</b> where it terminated. The remainder of the modern highway routing is either {{not part of the}} state trunkline system, or it is parts of other highways at this time, M-92 or M-47. In 1954, M-92 was extended southward to end in Clinton at the same intersection with US112 where M-52 terminated. By July 1, 1960, M-92's southern end was shifted westward, terminating west of Clinton at US112 on a new roadway south of Manchester. M-52 was extended around 1962 north between M-50 and US12 (the former US112) west of Tecumseh and Clinton. This extension ended at M-92's terminus with US12. M-52 was then extended north supplanting the M-92 designation in its entirety. M-52 at this time runs north from the Ohio state line to Millville in southwestern Ingham County. In the late 1960s, Stockbridge Road between Webberville and Stockbridge was upgraded to state highway standards and uploaded from the county to the state. This construction was shown on the 1969 state map. When it was completed later that year, M-52 was extended northward a second time, to I-96 outside of Webberville. Where Stockbridge Road crossed I-96, M-52 was continued north, supplanting M-47 through Webberville and north to the junction with M-46 west of Saginaw. This designation change shortened M-47 to its current southern terminus in Saginaw Township.|$|E
