25|$|From April 2006 {{through to}} October 2008, Russell Brand {{presented}} the weekly BBC radio show The Russell Brand Show. In most episodes Brand {{was joined by}} his co-host Matt Morgan who would often steer him in certain directions regarding what to talk about. Brand sometimes called {{in a variety of}} his celebrity friends as well, including Noel Gallagher, Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show each week.|$|E
25|$|At 11:54, Kalmi {{left the}} {{school with the}} {{education}} welfare officer and stopped between the building and a nearby pond <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telephone. The education welfare officer went on ahead to the car park to guide rescue vehicles into the area. Auvinen emerged from the school, cursing, and encountered Kalmi, who tried to convince him to surrender. At 11:57, he shot her seven times in view {{of a group of}} students in the schoolyard, fatally wounding her.|$|E
5000|$|Lack {{of sound}} depth: any {{background}} noise (in the room, in the car) is flat and wrongly {{interpreted by the}} brain. The effect is similar to what happens when trying to hear someone speaking in a noisy crowd on a mono TV. The effect is also similar <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone <b>to</b> someone {{who is in a}} noisy environment (see also: King-Kopetzky syndrome) ...|$|R

5000|$|The Carterfone is {{a device}} invented by Thomas Carter. It {{manually}} connects a two-way radio {{system to the}} telephone system, allowing someone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> someone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone. This makes it a direct predecessor to today's autopatch.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s, Chomsky embraced {{political}} activism {{to a greater}} degree than before. Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue {{at the behest of the}} East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance. The lectures that he gave on the subject would be published as Powers and Prospects in 1996. As a result of the international publicity generated by Chomsky, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist John Pilger. After East Timor's independence from Indonesia was achieved in 1999, the Australian-led International Force for East Timor arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing that it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the Timor Gap Treaty.|$|E
60|$|Basil Grant and I {{were talking}} {{one day in}} what {{is perhaps the most}} perfect place for talking on earth--the top of a tolerably deserted tramcar. <b>To</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of a hill is superb, but <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of a flying hill is a fairy tale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing whatever. I {{have made}} {{inquiries}} in all directions--for I {{had a great}} liking for the poor fellow. I went also to see his parents, but they seemed too much cut up <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject at all, and knew nothing of his whereabouts." ...|$|E

5000|$|Because {{there is}} no {{prescribed}} treatment, the first starting place is to reassure the CBS sufferer of their sanity, and some charities provide specialist hallucination counselling [...] "buddies" [...] (people who have had CBS, or have CBS and are no longer fazed by it) <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telephone. Sometimes it is carers and/or physicians that need advice and guidance.|$|R

6000|$|Supper over, {{the young}} folks all {{returned}} to the house across the way, leaving the men of elderly blood <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Grange and the uselessness of the middlemen. Sport began again in the Dudley farm-house by a dozen or so of the young people [...] "forming on" [...] for [...] "Weevily Wheat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, my boy," [...] Mr. Porson said, [...] "try and {{eat some}} lunch. I have just ordered a post chaise to be round {{at the door}} in half an hour. The sooner we start the better. The fresh air and the change will do you good, and we shall {{have plenty of time}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{we might}} have guessed, it was a girl. He had had a quarrel with Angela West, the girl he was engaged to, and she had broken off the engagement. What the row had been about he didn't say, but {{apparently}} she was pretty well fed up. She wouldn't let him come near her, refused <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone, and sent back his letters unopened.|$|E
60|$|During {{the earlier}} {{part of the}} evening, since we had left the hotel, my {{companion}} had shown no disposition <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary, his silence amounted almost to moroseness, and he had not always answered my questions. But immediately we had started on this new expedition his manner underwent a complete change. He seemed to lay himself out with feverish eagerness to entertain me and to absorb my attention.|$|E
60|$|They {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject; and Middleton {{learned that}} the present possessor of the estates was a gentleman nowise distinguished from hundreds of other English gentlemen; a country squire modified {{in accordance with the}} type of to-day, a frank, free, friendly sort of a person enough, who had travelled on the Continent, who employed himself much in field-sports, who was unmarried, and had a sister who was reckoned among the beauties of the county.|$|E

40|$|Listening <b>to</b> {{music or}} <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone while cycling {{as well as}} the growing number of quiet (electric) cars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road can make the use of {{auditory}} cues challenging for cyclists. The present study examined to what extent and in which traffic situations traffic sounds are important for safe cycling. Furthermore, the study investigated the potential safety implications of limited auditory information caused by quiet (electric) cars and by cyclists listening <b>to</b> music or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone. An Internet survey among 2249 cyclists in three age groups (16 – 18, 30 – 40 and 65 – 70  year old) was carried out to collect information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following aspects: 1) the auditory perception of traffic sounds, including the sounds of quiet (electric) cars; 2) the possible compensatory behaviours of cyclists who listen <b>to</b> music or <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> their mobile phones; 3) the possible contribution of listening <b>to</b> music and <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone <b>to</b> cycling crashes and incidents. Age differences with respect to those three aspects were analysed. Results show that listening <b>to</b> music and <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone negatively affects perception of sounds crucial for safe cycling. However, taking into account the influence of confounding variables, no relationship was found between the frequency of listening <b>to</b> music or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone and the frequency of incidents among teenage cyclists. This may be due to cyclists’ compensating for the use of portable devices. Listening <b>to</b> music or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone whilst cycling may still pose a risk in the absence of compensatory behaviour or in a traffic environment with less extensive and less safe cycling infrastructure than the Dutch setting. With the increasing number of quiet (electric) cars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road, cyclists in the future may also need to compensate for the limited auditory input of these cars...|$|R
50|$|In contrast, some {{scholars}} not only didn’t consider shariati as theorizing man but they removed such a character of him. Berque {{said that we}} are not able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thought of shariati as a system.|$|R
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth, {{he did not}} care two straws about corn. He cared only for law--for that and what was to be got by it. It was {{necessary}} that he should assume some care for corn--learn a good deal about it, perhaps, so as to be able, if called on, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject by the hour at a stretch; {{but it was not a}} matter on which he was personally solicitous a fortnight or so before he began his canvass.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{was fine}} moonlight, and we stayed on ever so long, while Jackman and Clem {{and two more}} danced a quadrille on the ice; {{and when it was}} over {{everybody}} was horribly cold, and Captain Collis said we must all come in and have something hot; and Jackman {{said he was going to}} drive home to dinner at eight, and would take us, but every one got talking, and it was half-past eight before we started. It was all in such a scramble, that I had no notion there was anything amiss till Clem began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way home.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} {{one afternoon}} {{that they were}} thrown together so closely {{for nearly an hour}} that neither could avoid the other. They were both at the old palace in which the Italian parliament is held, and were kept waiting during some long delay in the ceremonies of the place. They were seated next to each other, and during such delay there was nothing for them but <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other side of each of them was a stranger, and not to talk in such circumstances would be to quarrel. Mr. Glascock began by asking after the ladies.|$|E
5000|$|... On 10 March, Portuguese daily Publico {{reported}} that Gaddafi would agree <b>to</b> <b>talks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transition of power, quoting a diplomatic source talking about Foreign Minister Luis Amado's meeting with Gaddafi's envoy in Lisbon. Media also reported Portugal had switched its diplomatic recognition from Gaddafi's {{government to the}} National Transitional Council in Benghazi, following France's earlier decision to do so, though {{the government has not}} issued an official statement and these reports have not been confirmed as of late April. Portugal voted {{for the creation of a}} no-fly zone in Libya in its capacity as a nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council on 17 March.|$|R

6000|$|She led him <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> about <b>the</b> future. She {{loved to}} hear his clear, {{confident}} voice with its touch of boyish boastfulness. What was there to stop him? Why should he not climb from power to power till he had reached the end! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It has {{not gone}} far yet, but I think it will soon--yes, I know it will," [...] he said, in an {{impulsive}} whisper. [...] "I have pressed her upon the subject, and she inclines to be kind to me, and to {{think of me as}} a husband at a long future time, and that's enough for me. How can I expect more? She has a notion that a woman should not marry within seven years of her husband's disappearance--that her own self shouldn't, I mean--because his body was not found. It may be merely this legal reason which influences her, or it may be a religious one, but she is reluctant <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> point. Yet she has promised--implied--that she will ratify an engagement to-night." ...|$|E
60|$|After this Phineas {{found it}} very {{difficult}} to extract any sympathy from the Earl on behalf of the men who had been locked up. He was moody and cross, and could not be induced <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> great subject of the day. Violet Effingham declared that she did not care how many Bunces were locked up; nor for how long,--adding, however, a wish that Mr. Turnbull himself had been among the number of the prisoners. Lady Laura was somewhat softer than this, and consented to express pity in the case of Mr. Bunce himself; but Phineas perceived that the pity was awarded to him and not to the sufferer. The feeling against Mr. Turnbull was at the present moment so strong among all the upper classes, that Mr. Bunce and his brethren might have been kept in durance for a week without commiseration from them.|$|E
6000|$|While Lucy {{indulged in}} these dreams, she made {{frequent}} visits to old blind Alice, {{hoping it would}} be easy to lead her <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject which at present she had so imprudently admitted to occupy so large a portion of her thoughts. But Alice did not in this particular gratify her wishes and expectations. She spoke readily, and with pathetic feeling, concerning the family in general, but seemed to observe an especial and cautious silence on the subject of the present representative. The little she said of him was not altogether so favourable as Lucy had anticipated. She hinted that he was of a stern and unforgiving character, more ready to resent than to pardon injuries; and Lucy combined, with great alarm, the hints which she now dropped of these dangerous qualities with Alice's advice to her father, so emphatically given, [...] "to beware of Ravenswood." ...|$|E
60|$|The small {{domestic}} {{also made}} a discovery or two. She found that a kitchen {{with a view of}} the open sea from its window, and a reasonable as well as motherly companion <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> was, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole, superior to a kitchen with a window opening up a near prospect of bricks, and the companionship of black pots and beetles.|$|R
