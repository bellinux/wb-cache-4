40|$|The {{problem of}} {{resonant}} generation of nonground-state condensates is addressed aiming at resolving the seeming paradox that arises when one resorts to the adiabatic representation. In this picture, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii Hamiltonian are also functions of time. Since the level energies vary in time, no definite transition frequency can be introduced. Hence no external modulation with a fixed frequency {{can be made}} resonant. Thus, the resonant generation of adiabatic <b>coherent</b> <b>modes</b> is impossible. However, this paradox occurs only {{in the frame of}} the adiabatic picture. It is shown that no paradox exists in the properly formulated diabatic representation. The resonant generation of diabatic <b>coherent</b> <b>modes</b> is a well defined phenomenon.
