25|$|Until 1924, {{municipal}} {{public transportation}} actions originated primarily from state-controlled agencies, including the 1891 and 1894 rapid transit boards, the PSC, {{and most recently}} the New York State Transit Commission which was created in March 1921. Following the creating of the State Transit Commission and the reelection of Al Smith as Governor of New York in 1922, then-mayor John Francis Hylan and future mayors Jimmy Walker (then a state senator) and John P. O'Brien (the city's corporation council) sought to establish a city-controlled transit commission. Hylan had been both an opponent of private <b>transit</b> <b>operation,</b> particularly that of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT; the successor to the BRT), and a political opponent of Smith. Hylan also had his own plans for a city-operated subway system.|$|E
500|$|Physical {{construction}} {{work on the}} Delhi Metro started on 1 October 1998. After the previous problems experienced by the Kolkata Metro, which was badly delayed and 12 times over budget due to [...] "political meddling, technical problems and bureaucratic delays", DMRC is a special purpose organisation vested with great autonomy and powers to execute this gigantic project involving many technical complexities, under a difficult urban environment and within a very limited time frame. DMRC was given full powers to hire people, decide on tenders and control funds. The DMRC then consulted the Hong Kong MTRC on rapid <b>transit</b> <b>operation</b> and construction techniques. As a result, construction proceeded smoothly, except for one major disagreement in 2000, where the Ministry of Railways forced the system to use broad gauge despite the DMRC's preference for standard gauge.|$|E
