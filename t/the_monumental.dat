5|$|Takalik Abaj is {{representative}} of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.|$|E

5|$|The monuments of William II Canynges (c. 1399–1474) and his {{grandfather}} William I Canynges both have effigies on them, as do those of Robert de Berkeley and of Philip Mede (c.1415-1475), a Member of Parliament and thrice Mayor of Bristol. Multiple mural monuments also exist in the church. Amongst <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> brasses is one to Richard Mede (d. circa 1488), son of Philip Mede.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this did}} not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> {{topography}} of the centre and of the Campus Martius, with the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.|$|E
5|$|As for hobbies, Vargas Llosa is {{very fond}} of {{association}} football, and is a renowned supporter of Universitario de Deportes. The writer himself has confessed in his book A Fish in the Water since childhood {{he has been a}} fan of the 'cream colored' team from Peru, which was first seen in the field one day in 1946 when he was only 10 years old. In February 2011, Vargas Llosa was awarded with an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in <b>the</b> <b>Monumental</b> Stadium of Lima.|$|E

5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as severe enough to warrant a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of the Gothic Revival and saw the renovation as a chance to return St.Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier Gothic design.|$|E
5|$|The flat {{backs of}} many of the colossal heads {{represented}} the flat bases of <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros, {{literally}} The City and the Dogs, 1963/1966), The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversación en la catedral, 1969/1975). He writes prolifically {{across an}} array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (1973/1978) and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.|$|E

5|$|Antoni Gaudí {{started his}} {{professional}} career while still at university. To {{pay for his}} studies, {{he worked as a}} draughtsman for some of the most outstanding Barcelona architects of the time, such as Joan Martorell, Josep Fontserè, Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, Leandre Serrallach and Emili Sala Cortés. Gaudí had a long-standing relationship with Josep Fontserè, since his family was also from Riudoms and they had known each other for some time. Despite not having an architecture degree, Fontserè received the commission from the city council for the Parc de la Ciutadella development, carried out between 1873 and 1882. For this project, Gaudí {{was in charge of the}} design of the Park's entrance gate, the bandstand's balustrade and the water project for <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> fountain, where he designed an artificial cave that showed his liking for nature and the organic touch he would give his architecture.|$|E
5|$|At age 11, {{he came to}} the {{attention}} to the prefect of Grenoble, Joseph Fourier, who had accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on the Egyptian expedition which had discovered the Rosetta Stone. An accomplished scholar in addition to a well known mathematical physicist, Fourier had been entrusted by Napoleon with the publication {{of the results of the}} expedition in <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> series of publications titled Description de l'Égypte. One biographer has stated that Fourier invited the 11-year-old Champollion to his home and showed him his collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts and documents. Champollion was enthralled, and upon seeing the hieroglyphs and hearing that they were unintelligible, he declared that he would be the one to succeed in reading them. Whether or not the report of this visit is true, Fourier did go on to become one of Champollion's most important allies and supporters, and surely had an important role in instilling his interest in Ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|During World War I {{the track}} and rolling stock {{received}} little maintenance, {{and by the end}} of the war they were in a piteous state, while expenses had increased dramatically. The problem became a crisis after the serious fire at the Trianon depot on 30 November 1921, which destroyed 70 of the 155 trams of the CTR. Successive fare rises provided a stopgap, but with the new convention of 29 December 1923 the company announced a reorganisation of the network. A competitor had also arrived: the bus. Trams had always attracted criticism over their limited capacity, slowness and discomfort, and their encumbrance to motor cars in the city centre. Another accident on <b>the</b> <b>Monumental</b> line on 5 October 1925 hastened the inevitable: the trams lost their first route.|$|E

5|$|In 1850, Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester, {{called in}} the {{architect}} William Burn to build new stables {{to the east of}} the house, in collaboration with W. A. Nesfield, who had designed the parterres. Work started at the same time on the terraces surrounding the house. This work continued until 1857 and included, to the south and on axis with the house, <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> fountain of Saint George and the Dragon dated c. 184957 sculpted by Charles Raymond Smith. To the east of the house and overlooking the terrace, Burn designed the large stone orangery, with a three-bay pedimented centre and three-bay flanking wings. The orangery is now roofless and windowless.|$|E
5|$|None of the shake-ups helped Jennings retake {{the nightly}} ratings crown, but World News Tonight still offered stiff {{competition}} at second place. As the millennium approached, Jennings {{and the network}} started preparing for extensive retrospectives of the 20th century. The anchor teamed with former Life magazine journalist Todd Brewster to pen The Century, a 606-page book on 20th-century America. Designed as a companion book for ABC's upcoming documentary series of the same name, the book topped The New York Times Best Seller list in December 1998, a month after it debuted. On March 29, 1999, Jennings anchored the first installment of ABC's 12-hour miniseries, The Century; production on <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> project started in 1990, {{and by the time}} it aired, it had cost the network $25 million. Jennings also anchored a longer, 15-hour version, , on the History Channel in April 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Metro {{has been}} {{promoted}} {{as an integral part}} of community infrastructure, and community artwork depicting the local way of life has been put on display at stations. Students of local art colleges have also designed decorative murals at Metro stations, while pillars of the viaduct on some elevated sections have been decorated with mosaic murals created by local schoolchildren. The Metro station at INA Colony has a gallery showcasing artwork and handicrafts from across India, while all stations on the Central Secretariat– Qutub Minar section of the Yellow Line have panels installed on <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> architectural heritage of Delhi. The Nobel Memorial Wall at Rajiv Chowk has portraits of the seven Nobel Laureates from India: Rabindranath Tagore, CV Raman, Hargobind Khorana, Mother Teresa, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Amartya Sen and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and provide details about their contribution to society and a panel each on Alfred Nobel and the Nobel Prizes.|$|E

5|$|The cantata BWV 39 is in two parts, {{conforming}} {{to the structure}} of the Meiningen series. The first part begins with a long choral movement for four-part chorus and full orchestra. It is followed by a recitative for bass and an aria for alto, with obbligato violin and oboe. The second part begins with the central movement based on the New Testament text, a solo for bass, as vox Christi, accompanied by an obbligato violoncello. It is followed by an aria for soprano with obbligato recorders in unison. The second recitative for alto and strings leads into the concluding four-part chorale in which the choir doubled by the full orchestra. The complex scoring of <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> opening movement, employing full orchestra and chorus, contrasts with that of the succeeding non-choral movements, which are accompanied by smaller more intimate groups of instruments.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} of <b>the</b> <b>monumental</b> {{statue of the}} authoritarian leader Enver Hohxa in Gjirokastër {{by members of the}} local Greek community in August 1991 marked the end of the one-party state. Gjirokastër suffered severe economic problems following the end of communist rule in 1991. In the spring of 1993, the region of Gjirokastër became a center of open conflict between Greek minority members and the Albanian police. The city was particularly affected by the 1997 collapse of a massive pyramid scheme which destabilised the entire Albanian economy. The city became the focus of a rebellion against the government of Sali Berisha; violent anti-government protests took place which eventually forced Berisha's resignation. On 16 December 1997, Hoxha's house was damaged by unknown attackers, but subsequently restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} these new routes offered a more {{efficient}} way {{to get into the}} lower town than the cramped streets of rue du Midi/Zuidstraat, rue des Fripiers/Kleerkopersstraat and rue Neuve and helped revitalize the lower quarters of the town. In order to accomplish this revitalization and attract investment, public buildings were constructed as part of the Léon Suys project including the Brussels Stock Exchange. The vast Halles Centrales/Centrale Hallen, a good example of metallic architecture, replaced unhygienic open-air markets, though it was torn down in 1958. <b>The</b> <b>monumental</b> fountain that was to break the monotony of the boulevards at Fontainas Square was abandoned for budgetary reasons.|$|E
