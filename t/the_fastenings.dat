25|$|Rome's {{governing}} elite produced laws {{designed to}} limit {{public displays of}} personal wealth and luxury. None were particularly successful; the same wealthy elite had an appetite for luxurious clothing. Exotic fabrics were available, at a price; silk damasks, translucent gauzes, cloth of gold, and intricate embroideries; and vivid, expensive dyes such as saffron yellow or Tyrian purple. Not all dyes were costly, however, and most Romans wore colourful clothing. Clean, bright clothing was a mark of respectability and status among all social classes. <b>The</b> <b>fastenings</b> and brooches used to secure garments such as cloaks provided further opportunities for personal embellishment and display.|$|E
500|$|The {{monument}} is {{endangered by}} the climate (which has caused damage by frost and rain) and by air pollution. Although in 1990 {{the area around}} the monument was pedestrianized, there are still three streets carrying traffic around it. High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide have been recorded near the monument, which in combination with water cause corrosion of the fabric of the monument. In addition, water has caused cracking of the reinforced concrete core and rusting of its steel reinforcements and <b>the</b> <b>fastenings</b> of the monument, which also have been worn out by constant vibrations caused by traffic. [...] The porous travertine has gradually crumbled over time and its pores have filled with soot and particles of sand, causing it to blacken and providing a habitat for small organisms, such as moss and lichens. Irregular maintenance and the unskillful performance of restoration work have also contributed to the weathering of the monument. To prevent its further decay some of <b>the</b> <b>fastenings</b> were replaced with polyurethane filler and water repellent was applied to the monument during the restoration in 2001. It was also determined that maintenance should be carried out every 2 years.|$|E

It is made with 14 wooden keys of an African hardwood called liga attached to a wooden frame, below which hang calabash gourds.

50|$|The sijou plant Euphorbia milii var. splendens (syn. Euphorbia splendens) is {{considered}} the living embodiment of Bathoubwrai. Families that follow Bathouism plant a sijou shrub at {{the northeast corner of}} their courtyard, in an altar called sijousali. Bodo communities that follow Bathouism generally plant a sijou shrub at a community land, fenced with eighteen pairs of bamboo strips with five fastenings. Each pair symbolizes a pair of minor god-goddess. <b>The</b> five <b>fastenings</b> signify, from bottom: birth, pain, death, marriage and peace/pleasure. <b>The</b> bottom three <b>fastenings,</b> called bando, are those that one cannot escape in life; whereas the top two one could.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{principle}} of <b>the</b> thread <b>fastenings</b> {{have been known}} and used for decades. Its long applications become to a common manufacturing {{with the purpose of}} joining one component to another. Recently, <b>the</b> thread <b>fastenings</b> are a common assembly method, which is widely used and popularly applied. Because of <b>the</b> thread <b>fastenings</b> can be permitted easy to reassembly and disassembly for maintenance, repair, relocation, and recycling. Screw insertions are typically carried out manually with having the purpose of joining one component to another. Its is more complex to automate, and hence has admitted relatively very small research attention on automating threaded fastenings, and most automated assembly research is focused on the peg-in-hole assembly problem. This paper investigates the problem of an intelligence control strategy for automated Threaded Fastening process based on an analytical model and on-line parameter estimation. The monitoring problem deals with predicting the integrity of the self-tapping Threaded Fastening process, based on the torque vs. insertion angle curves generated during the insertions. A technique for estimating three unknown parameters during a general self-tapping Threaded Fastening is presented. It is shown that these parameters, required by the mathematical model, can be reliably estimated on-line. Test results are presented to validate procedure. batch production. The approach adopted in this study is to use an analytical model developed by the authors [1 - 4] to predict ideal insertion signals. However, this model requires various fixed process parameters as input, and it is not always possible to know these parameters in advance with sufficient accuracy. Hence the focus of this paper is the on-line parameter estimation during threaded assembly. II. <b>THE</b> THREADED <b>FASTENING</b> PROCESS A. Self-tapping Screw Insertions In [1 - 4] the Threaded Fastening process is described by a torque signature signal. The insertion signal is a two dimensional curve of axial torque Vs insertion depth. The axial torque is necessary to drive the screw through the hole as the insertion develops...|$|R
