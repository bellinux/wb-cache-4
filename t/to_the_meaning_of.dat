5|$|If no ethnographic nor {{historical}} data are found which can support this assertion then {{acceptance of the}} idea relies upon {{whether or not there}} are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance.

5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{of the different}} groups of bats {{have been the subject}} of much debate. The traditional subdivision between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflected the view that these groups of bats had evolved independently of each other for a long time, from a common ancestor already capable of flight. This hypothesis recognized differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has only evolved once in mammals. Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or monophyletic group. In the 1980s, a hypothesis based on morphological evidence was offered that stated the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera. The so-called flying primate hypothesis proposed that, when adaptations to flight are removed, the Megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features not shared with Microchiroptera. For example, the brains of megabats have advanced characteristics that link them to primates. Although recent genetic studies strongly support the monophyly of bats, debate continues as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> available genetic and morphological evidence.|$|E

25|$|Hurrian uses both {{enclitic}} {{and independent}} personal pronouns. The independent pronouns {{can occur in}} any case, whereas the enclitic ones represent only the absolutive. It is irrelevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the sentence to which word in the sentence the enclitic pronoun is attached, so it is often attached either to the first phrase or to the verb.

25|$|Georgian is an agglutinative language. There {{are certain}} prefixes and suffixes that are joined {{together}} {{in order to}} build a verb. In some cases, there can be up to eight different morphemes in one verb at the same time. An example can be ageshenebinat ("you (pl) had built"). The verb can be broken down to parts: a-g-e-shen-eb-in-a-t. Each morpheme here contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the verb tense or the person who has performed the verb. The verb conjugation also exhibits polypersonalism; a verb may potentially include morphemes representing both the subject and the object.|$|E
25|$|However, {{controversy}} {{has been raised}} over a few cultural differences in these rates of 'global' attachment classification distributions.

25|$|The {{literal sense}} {{pertains}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the words themselves, including any figurative meanings. The spiritual senses {{pertain to the}} significance of the things (persons, places, objects or events) denoted by the words. Of the three spiritual senses, the allegorical sense is foundational. It relates persons, events, and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants, and especially to the New Covenant. Building on the allegorical sense, the moral sense instructs in regard to action, and the anagogical sense points to man's final destiny. The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the recent pursuit of covenantal theology, an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants.|$|E

ICESCR goes into some detail of what the right to education entails. It states all primary education should be free and compulsory. Secondary education should be generally available and accessible to all, as should any higher education. It then goes on to say there needs to be development in school systems that are free from discrimination, with set minimum standards and a high level of quality.|$|E
25|$|Wolf {{was famous}} for his use of {{tonality}} to reinforce meaning. Concentrating on two tonal areas to musically depict ambiguity and conflict in the text became a hallmark of his style, resolving only when appropriate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the song. His chosen texts were often full of anguish and inability to find resolution, and thus so too was the tonality wandering, unable {{to return to the}} home key. Use of deceptive cadences, chromaticism, dissonance, and chromatic mediants obscure the harmonic destination {{for as long as the}} psychological tension is sustained. His formal structure as well reflected the texts being set, and he wrote almost none of the straightforward strophic songs favoured by his contemporaries, instead building the form around the nature of the work.|$|E
