5|$|A valley exit jet is a strong, down-valley, {{elevated}} {{air current}} <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> above {{the intersection of}} the valley and its adjacent plain. These winds frequently reach a maximum of 20m/s (45mph or 72km/h) at a height of 40–200 m above the ground. Surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation, but are significantly weaker.|$|E
5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom <b>that</b> <b>emerges.</b> Shown in figure 9, this process has only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E
40|$|Differences in {{activity}} between infective juveniles (IJ) of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> directly from cadavers onto either a sand or agar substrate {{compared with those}} emerging from a cadaver into water and then being placed on the same substrate are known to occur. Differences between S. carpocapsae IJ <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> directly from a cadaver vs. those <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> from a cadaver and held in water were further elucidated. Dispersed and non-dispersed IJ from a cadaver were compared with those held in water between two time periods designated as early- (first two days) or late-emerging IJ (seventh day). A significantly greater proportion of early-emerging IJ from the cadaver treatment dispersed, compared with late-emerging IJ from a cadaver or either group of emerging IJ held in aqueous suspension. Moreover, IJ from cadavers were more infectious than those from the aqueous suspensions, and IJ that dispersed were less infectious than those that did not disperse. IJ <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> early were mostly males, whereas those <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> late were mostly females. For the non-dispersed IJ, most <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> early were males, and those <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> later were females, but among dispersing IJ, {{there was no difference}} in sex ratio between early- and late-emerging nematodes...|$|R

5|$|In {{the present}} day, Dr. Archie Hopper (Sbarge) {{continues}} to evaluate Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), {{who is still}} trying to convince him that he is Jiminy. Meanwhile, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) officially makes Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) his new deputy. An explosion soon after causes the town to shake, followed by a sinkhole <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> at an abandoned mine shaft. As Emma, Henry, Archie, and the sheriff show up to see the damaged area, Regina (Lana Parrilla) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further, then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate piece of glass and puts it in her pocket. She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of the fairy tale stories.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> from the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation {{to a large}} number of organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E
5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or the placenta <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

25|$|The first type of {{organism}} to {{take advantage}} of this deep-sea energy source is bacteria.

This process of obtaining energy from chemicals is known as chemosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|Even though conversations occur between, and are {{influenced}} by, others, the roles Dasein takes up, the behaviors he comports, and the choices he makes are still his own. For example, self-as-student {{is just one}} role, or voice, <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> toward the foreground within Dasein when he is learning in an environment such as school, while self-as-teacher is a diametrically opposed role, or voice, <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> into the foreground when he is teaching (causing the self-as-student role, or voice, to recede into the background); but, Dasein still chooses to take up these roles or not, and if so, how to carry them out. These roles are termed voices {{because they are the}} voices Dasein take up when dialoguing with others: e.g. a student dialogues with his teacher with the voice of being a student.|$|E
25|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of insects}} {{that live in}} colonies, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, {{has always been a}} source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to do their own thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner. Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely self-organized. The group coordination <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> in this way is sometimes called swarm intelligence.|$|E

Not surprisingly, since males are generally smaller than females, the males of many species mature faster and do not undergo ecdysis as many times as the females before maturing.|$|E

25|$|We are, therefore, neither free {{to treat}} § 9(h) {{as if it}} merely withdraws a {{privilege}} gratuitously granted by the Government, nor able to consider it a licensing statute prohibiting those persons who do not sign the affidavit from holding union office.

25|$|In {{artificial}} selection {{the new breed}} or variety <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> is the one with random mutations attractive to humans, while in natural selection the surviving species is the one with random mutations useful to it in its non-human environment. In both natural and {{artificial selection}} the variations {{are a result of}} random mutations, and the underlying genetic processes are essentially the same. Darwin carefully observed the outcomes of artificial selection in animals and plants to form many of his arguments in support of natural selection. Much of his book On the Origin of Species was based on these observations of the many varieties of domestic pigeons arising from artificial selection. Darwin proposed that if humans could achieve dramatic changes in domestic animals in short periods, then natural selection, given millions of years, could produce the differences seen in living things today.|$|E
