5|$|An {{alternative}} video surfaced {{online in}} late May 2010, explaining why Beyoncé's character was remembering her love interest in <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>version.</b> It {{begins with a}} view of the night sky and many trees, as Beyoncé drives a car and Ealy's character is chased by the police through a forest. As the video progresses, she parks her car on the side of the road and scenes from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>version</b> are shown. Police dogs eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely. An open bag reveals stolen money, which is dispersed by the wind. At the end of the video, in the forest, Beyoncé finds Ealy lying lifelessly on the ground.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of a television in <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>version</b> would have surprised many readers. The BBC had only introduced television to Britain in the late 1930s (suspended entirely until 1946) and Belgium would not have television until 1955.|$|E

5|$|After leaving TSR in 1985 {{over issues}} {{with its new}} {{majority}} owner, Gygax continued to create role-playing game titles independently, beginning with the multi-genre Dangerous Journeys in 1992. He designed another gaming system called Lejendary Adventure, released in 1999. In 2005, Gygax {{was involved in the}} Castles & Crusades role-playing game, which was conceived as a hybrid between the third edition of D and <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>version</b> of the game conceived by Gygax.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and {{approached}} Dilip Kumar. After watching the film, Kumar was hesitant to play the lead role as he felt he would not match Ganesan's performance in <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>version.</b> K.

5|$|Another {{narrative}} on the constellations, three paragraphs long, {{is from a}} Latin writer whose brief notes {{have come}} down to us {{under the name of}} Hyginus. It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to Callimachus and Aristomachus, and sets the location at Thebes or Chios. Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon; a modern critic suggests this is <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>version.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1982, a very {{different}} version of the film was released; much of the live-action sequences were replaced by animation, and dialogue was heavily rewritten and reedited.
