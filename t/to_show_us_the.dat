[...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] ranked number 74 in an Entertainment Weekly list of the 100 greatest television moments, and number 15 among the top television moments from the 1990s. It was also identified by The Baltimore Sun as one of the ten best episodes of the series. Sun writer David Zurawik said Fontana's playwriting background was deeply infused in the episode, which he called a [...] "landmark hour" [...] that it [...] "put (three men) and a few sticks of battle-scarred, municipal-green furniture and somehow managed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> human soul and the heart of darkness". Additionally, [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] was among a 1999 Court TV marathon of the top 15 Homicide episodes, as voted on by 20,000 visitors to the channels website. David Bianculli of the New York Daily News said the episode [...] "remains one of TV's best drama hours ever", and he ranked it the second-best television episode ever made, behind the Taxi episode where Reverend Jim gets his driver's license. Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts said the episode was [...] "one of the most powerful prime-time hours ever" [...] and called Andre Braugher's performance a [...] "tour de police force". Alex Strachan of The Vancouver Sun described [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] as [...] "one of Homicides finest moments". He called the episode [...] "claustrophobic, cynical and ultimately painful" [...] and particularly praised the performances of Braugher and Secor, {{and the fact that it}} was not a happy ending. David P. Kalat, writer of Homicide: Life on the Street: The Unofficial Companion, described the episode as [...] "an astonishing tour de force of writing and acting that demonstrates all of Homicides best qualities". He also praised the chemistry between Braugher and Secor, particularly when they found a common voice during the interrogation.|$|E
500|$|Benedict de Spinoza in his Ethics, {{published}} {{after his}} death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise free will, make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation. The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and {{to fall in love with}} viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity. Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions sub specie aeternitatis, that is without reference to time. Hegel's obscure and mystical Philosophy of Mind held that the absolute right of freedom of conscience facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true. Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science. A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of Joseph Butler who argued that conscience is God-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the [...] "constitutional monarch" [...] and the [...] "universal moral faculty": [...] "conscience does not only offer itself <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it." [...] Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first,"self-love" [...] (seeking individual happiness) and second, [...] "benevolence" [...] (compassion and seeking good for another) in conscience (also linked to the agape of situational ethics). Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions). John Selden in his Table Talk expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained conscience could hinder resolve and practical action; it being [...] "like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the hedge".|$|E

In April 2004, Jackson poked fun {{at herself in}} an appearance on Saturday Night Live, first while playing Condoleezza Rice in a skit, nervously answering a question by exposing her right breast (which was pixelated by NBC), and again by viewing a mock home video from her childhood in which her bathing suit top came off in a wading pool, calling it a [...] "swimsuit malfunction". An NBC spokesman said Jackson was wearing a bra beneath her blouse during the skit. During a performance on ABC's Good Morning America, the network promoted Jackson's appearance as her [...] "first live performance since the Super Bowl", hinting at the chance of shock value.

2500|$|These two poets {{have often}} been {{compared}} to each other. [...] To some extent this is because they were good friends and slightly older {{than most of the}} other leading members of their generation, as well as sharing similar career-paths, but they also seemed to share a similar approach to poetry. [...] Their poems often have a rarefied quality and tend not to deal with [...] "particulars", readily identifiable people and places. [...] However, they did differ in many respects as exemplified by the titles they gave to their published lectures on Spanish poetry. [...] At Johns Hopkins, Salinas published a collection called Reality and the Poet in Spanish Poetry, whereas Guillén’s Norton lectures were called Language and Poetry. [...] Both devoted single lectures to Góngora and San Juan de la Cruz and the comparisons between them are instructive. [...] Salinas seems to want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> poetic reality behind or beyond appearances, to educate us into how to see whereas Guillén gives us an account of the thoughts and sense-impressions going through his own mind: [...] the reader is a viewer of this process not a participant in it. [...] Vicente Aleixandre recalled visiting Salinas and finding him at his desk with his daughter on one knee and his son on the other and stretching out a hand clutching a pen to shake hands with his visitor. [...] Although he was also devoted to his family, Guillén probably worked in a secluded study.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, art {{historian}} Manuel Bartolomé Cossío, who regarded El Greco's style {{as a response}} to Spanish mystics, published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works. In this book, El Greco is described as the founder of the Spanish School and as the conveyor of the Spanish soul. Julius Meier-Graefe, a scholar of French Impressionism, travelled in Spain in 1908 and wrote down his experiences in The Spanische Reise, the first book which established El Greco as a great painter of the past. In El Greco's work, Meier-Graefe found foreshadowings of modernity. To the Der Blaue Reiter group in Munich in 1912, El Greco typified that mystical inner construction that it was the task of their generation to rediscover. To the English artist and critic Roger Fry in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best [...] "with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public". Fry described El Greco as [...] "an old master who is not merely modern, but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us, turning back <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> way". At the same period, some other researchers developed certain disputed theories. Doctors August Goldschmidt and Germán Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems (possibly progressive astigmatism or strabismus) that made him see bodies longer than they were, and at an angle to the perpendicular. This theory enjoyed surprising popularity {{during the early years of}} the twentieth century and was opposed by the German psychologist David Kuntz. Whether or not El Greco had progressive astigmatism is still open to debate. Stuart Anstis, Professor at the University of California (Department of Psychology) concludes that [...] "even if El Greco were astigmatic, he would have adapted to it, and his figures, whether drawn from memory or life, would have had normal proportions. His elongations were an artistic expression, not a visual symptom." [...] According to Professor of Spanish John Armstrong Crow, [...] "astigmatism could never give quality to a canvas, nor talent to a dunce". The English writer W. Somerset Maugham attributed El Greco's personal style a [...] "latent homosexuality" [...] which he claimed the artist might have had; the doctor Arturo Perera attributed El Greco's style to the use of cannabis.|$|E

2500|$|James Cook led three {{separate}} voyages to chart unknown {{areas of the}} globe for the British Empire. It was on his third and final voyage that he encountered what is known today as the Islands of Hawaii. He first sighted the islands on 18 January 1778. [...] He anchored off {{the west coast of}} the island of Kauai near Waimea and met inhabitants to trade and obtain water and food. On 2 February 1778, Cook continued on to the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. He returned to the island chain to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and the big island and trading with locals, then making anchor in Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. Cook and his crew was initially welcomed and treated with honor. He and his men were given much food, various gifts from the islands inhabitants. They were shown traditional native performances and ceremonies, and generally treated as privileged guests, as his arrival coincided with the Makahiki, a festival celebrating the yearly harvest while worshipping the Hawaiian deity Lono. However, after he and the crews of both ships, [...] and , left the islands, the festival season had ended and the season for battle and war had begun under the worship and rituals for Kūkaʻilimoku, the god of war. Although Cook's sequential visits may have coincided with native traditional seasons, the natives had soured on Cook and his men by the time of Cook's initial departure. John Ledyard was the only american aboard Cook's ship during this time and the only citizen aboard the ship not loyal to the crown. Ledyard was present during the events leading up to and during Cook's death, and wrote a detailed, neutral account of the events in his journals [...] During Cook's initial visit, he attempted to barter and forcibly stole the wood used to border the natives sacred [...] "Morai" [...] burial ground, used for high ranking individuals and depictions of their gods. Ledyard says in his journals, Cook offered two iron hatchets for the wooden border around the Morai and when the dismayed and insulted chiefs refused, Cook proceeded to give orders to ascend the Morai, break down the fence and load the boats with it. John Ledyard quotes in his journal: [...] "The poor dismayed chief's dreading his (Cook's) displeasure, which they saw approaching followed him upon the Morai to behold the fence that enclosed the mansions of their noble ancestors, and the images of their gods torn to pieces by a handful of rude strangers without the power, or at least without the resolution of opposing their sacrilegious depredations. When Cook had ascended the Morai he once more offered the hatchets to the chiefs. It was a very unequal price if the honest chiefs would have accepted of the bribe and Cook offered it only to evade the imputation of taking their property without payment." [...] [...] John Ledyard also tells of an episode where Captain Clerke accused a native chieftain friend of stealing the Resolution's jolly boat. The boat was soon found unstolen and the native chief soured from the false accusation. After staying in the bay for 19 days, Cook and his two ships sailed out of the bay. John Ledyard goes on to say in his journal: [...] "On the evening of the (January) 15th we struck our tents, and everything was taken on board, and it was very manifestly much to the satisfaction of the natives. A little after dark an old house that stood {{on the corner of the}} Morai took fire and burned down. This we supposed was occasioned by our people carelessly leaving their fire near it, but it was not the case. The natives burnt it themselves <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> resentment they now entertained towards us, on account of our using it without their consent, and indeed manifestly against their consent. We had made a sail loft of one part of it, and a hospital for our sick for the other part, though it was evidently esteemed by the natives as holy as the rest of the Morai, and ought to have been considered by us." [...] On the 6th of February Cook's ships unmoored and left Kealakekua bay. They were met with an unexpected hard gale which wrenched the mainmast of the Resolution. On February 11th, the Resolution again entered Kealakekua bay on the night of 13 February. [...] Ledyard quotes in his journal: [...] "Our return to this bay was as disagreeable to us as it was to the inhabitants, for we were reciprocally tired of each other. They had been oppressed and were weary of our prostituted alliance.....It was also equally evident from the looks of the natives as well as every other appearance that our friendship was at an end, and that we had nothing to do but to hasten our departure to some different island where our vices were not known, and where our intrinsic virtues might gain us another short space of being wondered at..." [...] While anchored in Kealakekua Bay, one of only two long boats (lifeboats used to ferry to/from ship/shore) was stolen by the Hawaiians, testing the foreigners' reaction to see how far they could go with such a significant loss. The Hawaiians had begun openly challenging the foreigners. In retaliation, and in an attempt to force good behavior on the natives, Cook attempted to kidnap the aliʻi nui of the island of Hawaii,Kalaniʻōpuʻu. Possibly being quite sick at this point, Cook made what were later described as a series of mistakes. The idea or suggestion that the Native Hawaiians considered Cook to be the God Lono himself is considered to be inaccurate and is attributed to William Bligh. It is possible that some Hawaiians may have used the name of Lono as a metaphor when describing Cook or other possible explanations other than Hawaiians mistaking the explorer for their own deity.|$|E
