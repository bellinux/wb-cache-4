That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979, but they refusal to endorse it until the Maine legislature had approved it. Governor Langley, in turn, refused to accept any deal that would limit the state's jurisdiction over the tribes.|$|E

5|$|On February 22, 1972, the {{governors}} of the Passamaquoddy tribes at Indian Township and Pleasant Point {{wrote a letter to}} Louis R. Bruce, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, asking him to initiate such a lawsuit before the July 18th deadline. In early March, Bruce {{sent a letter to the}} Department of the Interior recommending that the tribes' request be granted. No reply was forthcoming before April 1. <b>Tureen</b> met with William Gershuny, the Associate Solicitor for Indian Affairs, who said more time was needed. On mid-May, <b>Tureen</b> persuaded Governor Kenneth Curtis to issue a public statement saying that the Passamaquoddy deserved their date in court. Senators Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) and Edmund S. Muskie (D-ME) and Representatives William Hathaway (D-ME) and Peter Kyros (D-ME) also issued similar statements of support.|$|E

Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still on the bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup <b>tureen</b> that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E
500|$|The Passamaquoddy tribal council fired Gellers {{and asked}} <b>Tureen</b> to take over. Fearing that his federally funded legal aid {{employer}} could not withstand the political pressure that the suit would inevitably provoke, in 1971, <b>Tureen</b> asked the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) {{to act as}} co-counsel. <b>Tureen</b> himself would eventually move to NARF {{during the course of}} the litigation. <b>Tureen</b> attempted to persuade a large law firm to join the case pro bono. Among those who turned him down were Arthur Lazarus, Jr. of Frank, Harris, Shriver & Kampelman, who had litigated many claims in front of the Indian Claims Commission. Based on the acreage involved, Lazarus pointed out that the claim would net only $300,000 before the Commission, which would be less than the cost of litigation. When <b>Tureen</b> said, [...] "Mr. Lazarus, this is not an Indian Claims Commission case, this is a Nonintercourse Act claim," [...] Lazarus shook his head and told <b>Tureen</b> he was dreaming. <b>Tureen</b> was able to recruit Barry Margolin, David Crosby, and Stuart Ross of Hogan & Hartson.

For the remainder of the year, <b>Tureen</b> assisted Passamaquoddy members in [...] "petty disputes" [...] such as divorce and bill collection. In early 1970, <b>Tureen</b> began assisting the tribe in an effort to receive federal grants. In 1971, <b>Tureen</b> co-wrote an article with Francis J. O'Toole, the editor-in-chief of the Maine Law Review, arguing that Maine's tribes should fall under federal, not state, jurisdiction. O'Toole and <b>Tureen</b> noted that: [...] "There {{is no evidence that the}} treaty was 1794 was made in compliance with the Non-Intercourse Act." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Tureen</b> was {{critical}} of Gellers' strategy because it required suing in state court (which he believed would be biased against any such claim), because it limited the claim to the [...] promised by the 1794 treaty, and because it would leave the tribes under state jurisdiction and ineligible for federal benefits. One theory that <b>Tureen</b> considered in order to overcome Maine's sovereign immunity was to rely on United States v. Lee (1882), which had permitted a land claim by the heirs of Robert E. Lee against the federal government. <b>Tureen</b> also feared that a federal court would find that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction for an ejectment action due to the well-pleaded complaint rule, although the Supreme Court held otherwise in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974)decided {{three years after the}} Passamaquoddy complaint was filed. <b>Tureen</b> also worried about the delay-related defenses of laches, adverse possession, and statute of limitations.|$|E
500|$|<b>Tureen</b> {{recommended}} that the tribe argue that the entire treaty was void and ask {{the federal government to}} seek possession of the entire [...] on their behalf. The Passamaquoddy tribal council unanimously approved Tureen's strategy. The Passamaquoddy also had grievances about the management of the tribal trust fund, tribal hunting and fishing rights, and the disfranchisement of tribal members from 1924 to 1967.

500|$|In October 1981, <b>Tureen</b> {{approached}} King (the defendants' lawyer) {{regarding a}} federally legislated settlement.

[...] As part of the deal, the state would retain civil and criminal, but not regulatory, authority of the reservation. [...] The state approved the settlement in June 1982.|$|E

50|$|The PetreÅŸti culture {{diffused}} across {{almost all}} of Transylvania, is regarded as local in origin by some specialists, and as a migration originating from the southern areas of the Balkans, by others. It is primarily known for its painted decoration - patterns painted in red, brown-red, later brown, on a brick-red background, which testifies to the high standard of civilization of the bearers of this culture. The ornamental motifs consist in bands, rhombuses, squares, spirals and windings. The typical forms are bowls, <b>tureens,</b> high stands. Plastic art is fairly scarce and so are brass items.|$|R

50|$|Originally, the {{machines}} in U.S. automats took only nickels.

The diner would insert the required number of coins in a machine and then lift a window, hinged at the top, and remove the meal, usually wrapped in waxed paper. The machines were replenished from the kitchen behind. All or most New York automats had a cafeteria-style steam table where patrons could slide a tray along rails and choose foods, which were ladled from <b>tureens.</b>|$|R

The empty spaces that are left are filled in with tiny crosshatched lines, which gives the ceramic its name. The piece is fired for the first time, then glazed and fired again. Today the traditional glazes have been replaced with lead-free versions. Most of the petatillo pieces are bowls, vases, platters, soup <b>tureens</b> and water glasses.|$|R
