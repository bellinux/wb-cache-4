50|$|<b>Telatinib,</b> an oral kinase {{inhibitor}} for the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer. It has been granted Orphan Drug status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It has reported encouraging interim {{results from a}} phase II trial.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Telatinib</b> (BAY 57 - 9352) is an orally available, small-molecule {{inhibitor}} of vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} receptors 2 and 3 (VEGFR- 2 /- 3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β tyrosine kinases. Methods In this multicenter phase I dose-escalation study including a phase II like expansion part, 39 patients with refractory colorectal cancer (CRC) were enrolled into 14 days on / 7 days off in repeating cycles of 28 days (n = 11) or continuous dosing groups (n = 28) to receive ≥ 600 mg <b>telatinib</b> twice-daily (bid). Results Hypertension (28 %) and diarrhoea (15 %) {{were the most}} frequent study drug-related adverse events of CTC grade 3. In this population, no clear relationship between <b>telatinib</b> dose and individual C max and AUC was apparent in the 600 mg bid to 1500 mg bid dose range. No partial remission according to RECIST was reached, but 41 % of the patients reached some tumour shrinkage during treatment. Tumour blood flow measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and sVEGFR- 2 plasma levels decreased with increasing <b>telatinib</b> AUC (0 - 12). Conclusion <b>Telatinib</b> treatment was well tolerated. The observed single agent antitumor activity in heavily pretreated CRC patients was limited. Pharmacodynamic results are suggestive for the biological activity of <b>telatinib</b> justifying a further evaluation of <b>telatinib</b> bid in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens in CRC patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Telatinib</b> (BAY 57 - 9352) is an orally available, small-molecule {{inhibitor}} of vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} receptors 2 and 3 (VEGFR- 2 /- 3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β tyrosine kinases. In this multicentre phase I dose escalation study, 71 patients with refractory solid tumours were enroled into 14 days on/ 7 days off (noncontinuous dosing) or continuous dosing groups to receive <b>telatinib</b> two times daily (BID). Hypertension (23 %) and diarrhoea (7 %) {{were the most}} frequent study drug-related adverse events of CTC grade 3. The maximum-tolerated dose was not reached up to a dose of 1500 [*]mg BID continuous dosing. <b>Telatinib</b> was rapidly absorbed with median tmax of 3 hours or less. Geometric mean Cmax and AUC 0 − 12 increased in a less than dose-proportional manner and plateaued in the 900 – 1500 [*]mg BID dose range. Two renal cell carcinoma patients reached a partial response. Tumour blood flow measured by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and sVEGFR- 2 plasma levels decreased with increasing AUC 0 − 12 of <b>telatinib.</b> <b>Telatinib</b> is safe and well tolerated up to a dose of 1500 [*]mg BID continuous dosing. Based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic criteria, 900 [*]mg <b>telatinib</b> BID continuously administered {{was selected as the}} recommended phase II dose...|$|E
40|$|Purpose <b>Telatinib</b> is an orally active small-molecule {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitor of kinase insert domain receptor (KDR; VEGFR- 2) and fms-related {{tyrosine kinase}} 4 (FLT 4; VEGFR- 3). This study aims at {{the identification of}} relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding for transporter proteins and pharmacokinetic parameters in order to clarify the significant interpatient variability in drug exposure. In addition, the potential relationship between target receptor polymorphisms and toxicity of <b>telatinib</b> is explored. Methods Blood samples from 33 patients enrolled in a phase I dose-escalation study of <b>telatinib</b> were analyzed. For correlation with dose normalized AUC(0 – 12), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) B 1 (ABCB 1), ABCC 1, and ABCG 2 were the genes selected. For correlation with <b>telatinib</b> toxicity, selected genes were the drug target genes KDR and FLT 4. Results No association between dose normalized AUC(0 – 12) and drug transporter protein polymorphisms was observed. In addition, no association between toxicity and KDR or FLT 4 genotype or haplotype was seen. Conclusions Our pharmacogenetic analysis could not reveal a correlation between relevant gene polymorphisms and clinical and pharmacokinetic observations of <b>telatinib...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of multidrug resistance (MDR) has attenuated {{the efficacy of}} anticancer drugs {{and the possibility of}} successful cancer chemotherapy. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play an essential role in mediating MDR in cancer cells by increasing efflux of drugs from cancer cells, hence reducing the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs. Interestingly, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as AST 1306, lapatinib, linsitinib, masitinib, motesanib, nilotinib, <b>telatinib</b> and WHI-P 154, have been found to have the capability to overcome anticancer drug resistance by inhibiting ABC transporters in recent years. This review will focus on some of the latest and clinical developments with ABC transporters, TKIs and anticancer drug resistance...|$|E
