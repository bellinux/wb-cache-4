5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>videotape</b> {{there is a special}} fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. <b>The</b> <b>videotape</b> can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E
5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met to review <b>the</b> <b>videotape.</b> They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after {{many of his}} spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he {{knew he was going to}} get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E
5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on <b>the</b> <b>videotape.</b> In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E
2500|$|City {{leaders and}} the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) refused to release <b>the</b> <b>videotapes,</b> citing <b>the</b> ongoing investigation. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton was allowed to view them and {{reported}} that they were [...] "inconclusive." [...] In February 2016, the NAACP and ACLU sued the DOJ to release <b>the</b> <b>videotapes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In December 2001, Canadian {{authorities}} {{determined that}} there was no possible future use of <b>the</b> <b>videotapes.</b> <b>The</b> six <b>videotapes</b> depicting <b>the</b> torture and rape of Bernardo's and Homolka's victims were destroyed. The disposition of the tapes of Homolka watching and commenting on the tapes remains sealed.|$|R
50|$|APTN {{sought a}} court {{injunction}} {{to prevent the}} RCMP from using <b>the</b> <b>videotapes</b> as evidence.|$|R
5|$|An {{estate agent}} {{receives}} a video {{recording of the}} murders in the post, leaving Black puzzled. That same day, the killer hides in another open house, later murdering {{a woman with a}} shotgun before calling the police to the scene. Black finds an X drawn in blood under the house's welcome mat; Patricia has begun drawing red Xs in her crayon pictures, which Catherine takes notice of. Black reviews <b>the</b> <b>videotape,</b> finding a reflection of the killer in a glass pane. Extracting a picture from this, he requests to show it to Patricia, but stops himself, realizing that the killer let Patricia live so that she could relive the events when questioned.|$|E
5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes. Here they find <b>the</b> <b>videotape</b> setup and tapes dating {{all the way back to}} the '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre. The man who runs the park is promptly arrested, and Mulder finds graves of children all over his ranch.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Alison and Diana Gordon {{are being}} held captive in their home by Zep, who is {{watching}} Adam and Lawrence through a camera behind a two-way mirror in the bathroom. The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged from the force. Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after hearing Amanda's testimony, and eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using <b>the</b> <b>videotape</b> from her game. He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after non-fatally slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing {{was killed by a}} quadruple shotgun walkway while pursuing him. Convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp began stalking him after his discharge.|$|E
50|$|The {{series is}} also {{distributed}} through the Mathematical Association of America and NASA's Central Operation of Resources for Educators (CORE). In addition, {{over half of}} the states in the US have received master copies of <b>the</b> <b>videotapes</b> so they can produce and distribute copies to their various educational institutions. <b>The</b> <b>videotapes</b> may be freely copied for educational purposes with a few restrictions, but the DVD version is not freely reproducible.|$|R
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>videotapes</b> were erased and reused after {{broadcast}} and consequently less than 100 episodes survive today {{out of the}} thousands made.|$|R
50|$|Virtually all of {{the series}} is {{believed}} to have been destroyed due to network practices of the era, with <b>the</b> <b>videotapes</b> wiped and re-used.|$|R
5|$|Clark, Chloe, and Pete {{arrive at}} the dance, and say their goodbyes to Whitney before he leaves for training. The weather begins to deteriorate, and a storm picks up, as Lana takes Whitney to the bus stop. Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha (Annette O'Toole) decide {{to head to the}} storm cellar to seek cover from the storm, and they {{discover}} Nixon just as the octagonal disk activates the ship. Nixon attempts to escape with <b>the</b> <b>videotape,</b> and Jonathan chases out into the storm after him. The ship levitates off the ground and flies out of the storm cellar. Lana says goodbye to Whitney and drives home. On her way, storm winds force her off the road, right next to three tornadoes that have touched down. The students at the dance are alerted to the tornados that have been sighted, and Clark races off to make sure Lana is all right. The three tornadoes merge into one large tornado and move in Lana's direction. Clark arrives just as Lana, in the truck, is sucked into the tornado's vortex; Clark speeds into the tornado to rescue her.|$|E
25|$|Sheridan then {{suggested}} that MI5, someone within the SSP and Rupert Murdoch had conspired to concoct <b>the</b> <b>videotape</b> to undermine {{his campaign for}} an independent socialist Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{offered by}} the {{prosecution}} for the officers' acquittal is that the jurors may have become desensitized to {{the violence of the}} beating, as the defense played <b>the</b> <b>videotape</b> repeatedly in slow motion, breaking it down until its emotional impact was lost.|$|E
40|$|The Management Profile is an {{appraisal}} {{measure that}} examines the actual job {{performance of a}} manager to ascertain relative strength in six management functions and three leadership roles. The management functions examined are administration, technical competence, influence/control, persuasion, training/development, aad forecasting/planning. The leadership roles examined are: evaluator, director, and motivator. This study examined relationships between tuo measures: the Perceived Performance Inventory (PPI) and <b>the</b> <b>videotaped</b> interview. The?PI looked at perceptions of six skill areas that were largely parallel to the six functions examined by <b>the</b> <b>videotaped</b> interview. <b>The</b> PPI identified the perceptions that different audiences have of an administrator's summarized performance. <b>The</b> <b>videotaped</b> assessment examined specific performances in specified areas and assigned ratings to them. Appended are (1) 10 references; (2) a management profile; and (3) eight data tables. (SI) *******************************************************************x*** r.

25|$|The entire {{incident}} {{was captured by}} the dashboard camera in Lunsford's cruiser. This videotape enabled the police to arrest the three killers. The video is now used when training new officers. <b>The</b> <b>videotape</b> teaches {{them what to do}} if they ever get into a difficult situation like this.|$|E
25|$|Each episode {{should run}} for 27 minutes and 15 seconds, however, if any episode runs over or under {{then it is}} the job of {{post-production}} to cut or add scenes where appropriate. As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, EastEnders: The First 10 Years, after filming, tapes were sent to <b>the</b> <b>videotape</b> editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. <b>The</b> <b>videotape</b> editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made. The episode was then copied onto D3 video. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the BBC's technical standard for broadcasting.|$|E
50|$|Murray said <b>the</b> <b>videotapes</b> showed Homolka sexually assaulting four female victims, {{having sex}} with a female prostitute in Atlantic City, and at another point, drugging an {{unconscious}} victim.|$|R
50|$|Homolka's {{plea bargain}} {{had been offered}} before the {{contents}} of <b>the</b> <b>videotapes</b> were available for review. Anne McGillivray, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Manitoba, explained the continuing public antagonism against Homolka: There was widespread belief that she had known where <b>the</b> <b>videotapes</b> were hidden, that she wilfully concealed the Jane Doe incidents and, most centrally, that her claims of being under Bernardo's control - a central tenet of the plea bargain - were dubious. Speculation was fed by a publicity ban on the plea bargain which stood until Bernardo's trial.|$|R

Baldemar Villarreal was captured and arrested two days later and Jesus Zambrano was captured a week later. All three suspects were then tried and convicted of Lunsford's murder.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 1992, {{the seventh}} day of jury deliberations, the jury acquitted all four {{officers}} of assault and acquitted {{three of the four}} of using excessive force. The jury could not agree on a verdict for the fourth officer charged with using excessive force. The verdicts were based in part on the first three seconds of a blurry, 13-second segment of <b>the</b> <b>videotape</b> that, according to journalist Lou Cannon, was edited out by television news stations in their broadcasts.|$|E
