5|$|Film {{director}} Barry Levinson {{sought to}} create a police drama television series based on , a 1991 non-fiction book by David Simon based on one year he spent with Baltimore Police Department homicide detectives. In addition to the book's being set in Levinson's home city of Baltimore, the director was attracted to the realistic way Simon portrayed police work and <b>the</b> <b>detectives.</b> The book contradicted many popular myths that had been built into past police dramas: it portrayed <b>the</b> <b>detectives</b> as not always getting along {{with each other and}} told stories of criminals who were not always caught or punished. It also portrayed detectives as solving cases primarily through physical evidence, witnesses and confessions, not by investigating motives like on many other police shows. Simon also sought to dispel the popular television perception that all detectives take their cases very personally and identify with their victims: in Simon's experience, homicide cases were primarily a job to <b>the</b> <b>detectives,</b> not personal. Levinson and Tom Fontana, who had past television experience as executive producer on the drama series St. Elsewhere, hired screenwriter Paul Attanasio to adapt elements of the book into the teleplay for the first episode. It was the first television script Attanasio ever wrote.|$|E

5|$|Thomson and Thompson (Dupont et Dupond in Hergé's {{original}} version) are two incompetent detectives {{who look}} like identical twins, their only discernible difference being the shape of their moustaches. First introduced in Cigars of the Pharaoh, they provide much of the comic relief throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic spoonerisms. They are extremely clumsy, thoroughly incompetent, and usually bent on arresting the wrong character. <b>The</b> <b>detectives</b> usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks except when sent abroad; during those missions they attempt the national costume of the locality they are visiting, but instead dress in conspicuously stereotypical folkloric attire. <b>The</b> <b>detectives</b> were in part based on Hergé's father Alexis and uncle Léon, identical twins who often took walks together, wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Dashiell Hammett's {{fiction and}} detective pulps generally, offered the reader {{a chance to}} {{participate}} in vicarious power, by giving {{them a sense of}} the profession of detection, {{both in and out of}} the stories. It was the realism of <b>the</b> <b>detective</b> figure that allowed the audience to relate to him. What <b>the</b> <b>detective</b> offers <b>the</b> reader is an intensely powerful performance of masculinity that is at once ordinary in physicality and intelligence and extraordinary in the power it affords him. This power comes from his professional abilities, which allow him to transcend physical and class limitations. <b>The</b> <b>detective</b> story allows <b>the</b> reader to identify with <b>the</b> <b>detective,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>detective</b> pulps both in the stories and in their other sections offer the reader lessons in the profession of detection. Through this identification and education there is a kind of transference of <b>the</b> <b>detective's</b> power to <b>the</b> reader. <b>The</b> <b>detective</b> story offers <b>the</b> reader a chance to be powerful in a corrupt world, but since <b>the</b> <b>detective</b> is never able to fully rid the world of corruption, the story also offers the reader an opportunity to escape the corrupt world by putting the story down (essentially locating the corruption of the world within the pulp itself). In this escape, the reader inevitably feels happiness and contentment because his real world (though not as exciting or powerful as <b>the</b> <b>detective's)</b> is safe...|$|R

40|$|Both Miller and Daniel arise {{out of a}} Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) decoy program {{designed}} to combat an increase in street-level robberies occurring in downtown Las Vegas. In Miller, a <b>detective</b> with <b>the</b> LVMPD disguised himself as an intoxicated vagrant and carried exposed cash in his pocket. <b>The</b> <b>detective</b> then positioned himself across from a bus station and leaned against a chain link fence. Richard Miller, an individual walking down the street, approached <b>the</b> <b>detective</b> and asked him for money.

Miller and Daniel argued that police officers entrapped them by improperly tempting them with exposed money and a helpless victim. The court held that both Miller and Daniel were not entrapped because they were predisposed to commit the crime. The court reasoned that since the entrapment defense was designed to prevent police misconduct, evidence must be demonstrated that the State presented the opportunity {{to commit a crime}} and that the defendant was not otherwise predisposed to commit the crime. In both cases, the defendants were found to be predisposed to commit the crime because they initiated contact with <b>the</b> <b>detective</b> and engaged in the robbery or larceny for profit. Further, neither defendant demonstrated reluctance which was overcome by the government’s inducement. Since the defendants were predisposed to commit the crime, entrapment was not available as a defense...|$|R
