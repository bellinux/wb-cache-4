5|$|Archaeocytes (or amoebocytes) are amoeba-like {{cells that}} are <b>totipotent,</b> in other words each is capable of {{transformation}} into {{any other type of}} cell. They also have important roles in feeding and in clearing debris that block the ostia.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, <b>totipotent</b> stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, many plant cells, {{particularly}} those of the parenchyma, do not terminally differentiate, remaining <b>totipotent</b> {{with the ability to}} give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Totipotent</b> (a.k.a. omnipotent) {{stem cells}} can {{differentiate}} into embryonic and extraembryonic cell types. Such cells can construct a complete, viable organism. These cells are produced from {{the fusion of}} an egg and sperm cell. Cells produced by the first few divisions of the fertilized egg are also <b>totipotent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pluripotent {{stem cells}} are the {{descendants}} of <b>totipotent</b> cells and can differentiate into nearly all cells, i.e. cells derived {{from any of the}} three germ layers.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of {{heritable}} changes in gene function that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenesis {{in the context of the}} biology of that period referred to the differentiation of cells from their initial <b>totipotent</b> state in embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|Most {{distinct}} cell types {{arise from}} a single <b>totipotent</b> cell, called a zygote, that differentiates into hundreds of different cell types {{during the course of}} development. Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cell–cell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of molecules during division).|$|E
25|$|Potency: the {{capacity}} to differentiate into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either <b>totipotent</b> or pluripotent—to {{be able to give}} rise to any mature cell type, although multipotent or unipotent progenitor cells are sometimes referred to as stem cells. Apart from this it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feed back mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} primate chimeras are the rhesus monkey twins, Roku and Hex, with each having six genomes. They {{were created by}} mixing cells from <b>totipotent</b> four cell blastocysts; {{although}} the cells never fused they worked together to form organs. It was discovered {{that one of these}} primates, Roku, was a sexual chimera; as four percent of Roku's blood cells contained two x chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Sponge {{aquaculture}} for spongin or metabolite production capitalises on {{the high}} regenerative abilities of the <b>totipotent</b> sponge cells by using explants (cut pieces of a parent sponge, which will then regrow into a full sponge) {{as a means of}} culturing sponges. Sponges have indeterminate growth, with maximum growth determined through environmental constraints rather than genetics. During the initial establishment of a farm, sponge explants will be chosen by their phenotypic characteristics of fast growth and high quality spongin or metabolites.|$|E
25|$|Of all cleavage-stages, it is {{generally}} agreed that the optimal moment for biopsy is at the eight-cell stage. It is diagnostically safer than the PB biopsy and, unlike blastocyst biopsy, it allows for the diagnosis of the embryos before day 5. In this stage, the cells are still <b>totipotent</b> and the embryos are not yet compacting. Although {{it has been shown}} that up to a quarter of a human embryo can be removed without disrupting its development, it still remains to be studied whether the biopsy of one or two cells correlates with the ability of the embryo to further develop, implant and grow into a full term pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the age of}} the colony, castes {{are almost}} always indistinguishable. Caste {{totipotency}} exists where all individual wasps are <b>totipotent.</b> Totipotency is the ability of a single cell to produce all of the differentiated cells in an organism. Therefore, one young wasp {{could turn out to be}} a queen or a worker. So, caste determination is dictated post-imaginally (pre-adult determination). In Parachartergus fraternus, the reproductive females resemble non reproductive females: there are not many physical differences. Based on morphology alone it is difficult to distinguish between castes. There is evidence for caste flexibility in Parachartergus fraternus. Intermediates may be potential queens but also perform some worker activities early on in their lives.|$|E
25|$|Parachartergus colobopterus is an epiponine social wasp {{belonging}} to the subfamily Polistinae. This species can be found through Central and South America and is unique because its colonies contain multiple queens. However, relatedness among nest mates remains relatively high {{as a result of}} cyclical oligogyny, which is a system where the number of queens varies over time. Because workers and queens do not demonstrate any significant morphological differentiation, individuals of this species are <b>totipotent,</b> capable of differentiation into any caste, because caste is not genetically determined. Relatedness and conflict therefore {{play a major role in}} determining the dominance hierarchy and behavioral patterns of this wasp species, especially the behavior of worker policing. Another unique characteristic of this wasp is that it is generally a docile species: when the nest is continuously provoked, the colony members will leave the nest instead of mounting an attack.|$|E
25|$|Regeneration {{research}} using Planarians {{began in the}} late 1800s and was popularized by T.H. Morgan {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado and Philip Newmark transformed planarians into a model genetic organism in the beginning of the 20th century to study the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in these animals. Planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals. In one experiment, T.H. Morgan found that a piece corresponding to 1/279th of a planarian or a fragment with as few as 10,000 cells can successfully regenerate into a new worm within one to two weeks. After amputation, stump cells form a blastema formed from neoblasts, pluripotent cells found throughout the planarian body. New tissue grows from neoblasts with neoblasts comprising between 20 and 30% of all planarian cells. Recent work has confirmed that neoblasts are <b>totipotent</b> since one single neoblast can regenerate an entire irradiated animal that has been rendered incapable of regeneration. In order to prevent starvation a planarian will use their own cells for energy, this phenomenon is known as de-growth.|$|E
500|$|... 20th century {{developments}} in plant biochemistry {{have been driven}} by modern techniques of organic chemical analysis, such as spectroscopy, chromatography and electrophoresis. With {{the rise of the}} related molecular-scale biological approaches of molecular biology, genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, the relationship between the plant genome and most aspects of the biochemistry, physiology, morphology and behaviour of plants can be subjected to detailed experimental analysis. The concept originally stated by Gottlieb Haberlandt in 1902 that all plant cells are <b>totipotent</b> and can be grown in vitro ultimately enabled the use of genetic engineering experimentally to knock out a gene or genes responsible for a specific trait, or to add genes such as GFP that report when a gene of interest is being expressed. These technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in bioreactors to synthesise pesticides, antibiotics or other pharmaceuticals, as well as the practical application of genetically modified crops designed for traits such as improved yield.|$|E
2500|$|At first, it {{probably}} resembled today's sponges, which have <b>totipotent</b> cells that allow a disrupted organism to reassemble itself. [...] As {{the division of}} labor was completed in all lines of multicellular organisms, cells became more specialized and more dependent on each other; isolated cells would die.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scientists}} from the University of Newcastle have also reported successful freezing and thawing (cryopreservation) of <b>totipotent</b> amphibian embryonic cells, which along with sperm cryopreservation [...] provides the essential [...] "proof of concept" [...] {{for the use of}} cryostorage as a genome bank for threatened amphibians and also other animals.|$|E
2500|$|Stem {{cells are}} {{undifferentiated}} cells {{with the ability}} to divide in culture and give rise to different forms of specialized cells. According to their source stem cells are divided into [...] "adult" [...] and [...] "embryonic" [...] stem cells, the first class being multipotent and the latter mostly pluripotent; some cells are <b>totipotent,</b> in the earliest stages of the embryo. While there is still a large ethical debate related with the use of embryonic stem cells, it is thought that another alternative source - induced stem cells may be useful for the repair of diseased or damaged tissues, or may be used to grow new organs.|$|E
2500|$|Somatic {{epigenetic}} inheritance, particularly through DNA and histone covalent modifications and nucleosome repositioning, is {{very important}} in the development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling. Thus, as individuals develop, morphogens activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a memory. In mammals, most cells terminally differentiate, with only stem cells retaining the ability to differentiate into several cell types ("totipotency" [...] and [...] "multipotency"). In mammals, some stem cells continue producing new differentiated cells throughout life, such as in neurogenesis, but mammals are not able to respond to loss of some tissues, for example, the inability to regenerate limbs, which some other animals are capable of. Epigenetic modifications regulate the transition from neural stem cells to glial progenitor cells (for example, differentiation into oligodendrocytes is regulated by the deacetylation and methylation of histones. Unlike animals, plant cells do not terminally differentiate, remaining <b>totipotent</b> with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant. While plants do utilise many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodeling, it has been hypothesised that some kinds of plant cells do not use or require [...] "cellular memories", resetting their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their fate.|$|E
50|$|The human {{development}} model is one {{which can be}} used to describe how <b>totipotent</b> cells arise. Human development begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg and the resulting fertilized egg creates a single <b>totipotent</b> cell, a zygote. In the first hours after fertilization, this zygote divides into identical <b>totipotent</b> cells, which can later develop into any of the three germ layers of a human (endoderm, mesoderm, or ectoderm), into cells of the cytotrophoblast layer or syncytiotrophoblast layer of the placenta. After reaching a 16-cell stage, the <b>totipotent</b> cells of the morula differentiate into cells that will eventually become either the blastocyst's Inner cell mass or the outer trophoblasts. Approximately four days after fertilization and after several cycles of cell division, these <b>totipotent</b> cells begin to specialize. The inner cell mass, the source of embryonic stem cells, becomes pluripotent.|$|E

50|$|Cells {{resembling}} 2-cell-stage mouse embryos (<b>totipotent</b> cells) can {{be induced}} in vitro through downregulation of the chromatin-assembly activity of CAF-1 in embryonic stem cells.|$|E
50|$|Pluripotent {{stem cells}} are the {{descendants}} of <b>totipotent</b> cells and can differentiate into nearly all cells, i.e. cells derived {{from any of the}} three germ layers.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} for a fully differentiated cell {{to return to a}} state of totipotency. This conversion to totipotency is complex, not fully understood and the subject of recent research. Research in 2011 has shown that cells may differentiate not into a fully <b>totipotent</b> cell, but instead into a [...] "complex cellular variation" [...] of totipotency. Stem cells resembling <b>totipotent</b> blastomeres from 2-cell stage embryos can arise spontaneously in the embryonic stem cell cultures and also can be induced to arise more frequently in vitro through down-regulation of the chromatin assembly activity of CAF-1.|$|E
5000|$|Archaeocytes (from Greek archaios [...] "beginning" [...] and kytos [...] "hollow vessel") or amoebocytes are amoeboid cells {{found in}} sponges. They are <b>totipotent</b> and have varied {{functions}} {{depending on the}} species.|$|E
50|$|Recently some {{researchers}} succeeded {{to get the}} <b>totipotent</b> cells {{without the aid of}} SCNT. <b>Totipotent</b> cells were obtained using the epigenetic factors such as oocyte germinal isoform of histone.Reprogramming in vivo, by transitory induction of the four factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc in mice, confers totipotency features. Intraperitoneal injection of such in vivo iPS cells generates embryo-like structures that express embryonic and extraembryonic (trophectodermal) markers.The developmental potential of mouse pluripotent stem cells to yield both embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages also can be expanded by microRNA miR-34a deficiency leading to strong induction of endogenous retroviruses MuERV-L (MERVL).|$|E
5000|$|Callus, or dedifferentiated cells, are {{somatic cells}} that undergo {{dedifferentiation}} to {{give rise to}} <b>totipotent</b> embryogenic cells, which temporarily gains the ability to proliferate and/or regenerate an embryo. Since embryogenic cells were considered <b>totipotent</b> cells based {{on their ability to}} regenerate or develop into an embryo under given conditions, dedifferentiated cells were generally regarded as stem cells of plant: [...] "…we propose to extend the concept of stem cells to include embryogenic stem cells that arise from plant somatic cells. We examine the cellular, physiological and molecular similarities and differences between plant meristematic stem cells and embryogenic stem cells originating directly from single somatic cells." ...|$|E

50|$|Previously, human eggs {{had only}} been {{produced}} in vitro from <b>totipotent,</b> blastomeric embryonic stem cells. This experiment demonstrated viable human egg cells can easily be produced from an adult cell that already has some degree of specialization. Furthermore, it lessens the implications associated {{with the fact that}} women are born with all of the egg cells they will ever have throughout their lives. While this breakthrough was not without controversy, it provides hope for infertile women wishing to undergo in vitro fertilization, and hints at the possibility of new options for postmenopausal women, as well. It also suggests the future of stem cell research may not have to rely as heavily on human embryos as a source of unspecialized, <b>totipotent</b> cells for research.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of cell potency, the cell's {{ability to differentiate}} into other cell types. A greater potency indicates {{a larger number of}} cells that can be derived. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types, including the placental tissue, is known as <b>totipotent.</b> In mammals, only the zygote and subsequent blastomeres are <b>totipotent,</b> while in plants many differentiated cells can become <b>totipotent</b> with simple laboratory techniques. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types of the adult organism is known as pluripotent. Such cells are called meristematic cells in higher plants and embryonic stem cells in animals, though some groups report the presence of adult pluripotent cells. Virally induced expression of four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Kfl4 (Yamanaka factors) is sufficient to create pluripotent (iPS) cells from adult fibroblasts. A multipotent cell is one that can differentiate into multiple different, but closely related cell types. Oligopotent cells are more restricted than multipotent, but can still differentiate into a few closely related cell types. Finally, unipotent cells can differentiate into only one cell type, but are capable of self-renewal. [...] In cytopathology, the level of cellular differentiation is used as a measure of cancer progression. [...] "Grade" [...] is a marker of how differentiated a cell in a tumor is.|$|E
