5000|$|Stasi {{officers}} {{were instructed to}} destroy files, starting with the most incriminating-those naming westerners who spied for them, and those that concerned deaths. They shredded the files until the shredders collapsed. Among other shortages in the East, there was a shredder shortage, so they had <b>to</b> <b>send</b> agents out <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> West Berlin to buy more. In Building 8 alone, the citizens' movement found over a hundred burnt out shredders.|$|R

500|$|Admiral Shuldham, {{commander}} of the British fleet, declared that the fleet was in danger unless the position on the heights was taken. [...] Howe and his staff then determined to contest the occupation of the heights, and made plans for an assault, preparing <b>to</b> <b>send</b> 2,400 men <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> of darkness to attack the position. [...] Washington, notified of British movements, increased the forces on the heights until there were nearly 6,000 men on the Dorchester lines. However, a snow storm began late on March 5 and halted any chance of a battle for several days. [...] By the time the storm subsided, Howe reconsidered launching an attack, reasoning that preserving the army for battle elsewhere was of higher value than attempting to hold Boston.|$|R

5000|$|The USA Women's team {{announced}} an intention <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a squad <b>to</b> play against Australia and possibly Papua New Guinea. Additionally Canada and England announced their intentions <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>Under</b> 17s squads. [...] As a result, there was speculation over an inaugural women's and under 17 divisions. However the AFL denied these divisions {{in favour of}} a senior men's competition only. In response, and with the Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament being cancelled, British and Canadian junior teams had to organise their own tours and matches against Australian schools. Despite both international teams being in Australia at the same time, they did not play against each other. [...] The US women's team announced a 2009 tour instead.|$|R

50|$|The Zamorin's advisors kept concocting more plots - an {{uprising}} in Cochin, then a plan <b>to</b> <b>send</b> in boats <b>under</b> the <b>cover</b> of night to Cochin {{and set the}} city on fire, then to sneak baskets of venomous cobras aboard the Portuguese ships, etc. But all these plots were quickly foiled by leaked intelligence.|$|R
50|$|Thor {{stopped her}} first victim on 1 July, the 9290-ton Dutch cargo ship Kertosono, which was {{carrying}} a cargo of petrol, timber, asphalt, and agricultural machinery.

60|$|Poor Gunrig, however, did {{not from}} that day show much {{evidence}} of getting well. His case was far beyond the skill of his amateur doctor. It was, therefore, resolved, {{a day or two}} later, <b>to</b> <b>send</b> him home <b>under</b> an escort led by Beniah.|$|R
5000|$|Also in 2011, {{the club}} was {{mentioned}} in Guy Ritchie's movie Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, when Watson made a deduction about Mycroft prior to the stag party.

2500|$|Both antagonists {{realized}} that the Wehrmacht relief efforts {{had come to a}} critical stage. Despite heavy Soviet propaganda inducements, very few German soldiers and no Waffen-SS men in the cauldron had surrendered. [...] Zhukov thus decided <b>to</b> <b>send</b> parlementaires <b>under</b> a white flag with surrender demands. Red Army emissaries presented letters for both Stemmermann and Lieb signed by Marshal Zhukov and Generals Konev and Vatutin. After cordial talks, refreshments and a handshake, the Soviet delegation departed without a positive answer.|$|R
50|$|The Isle of Wight Zoo is in Yaverland. The zoo {{is noted}} for its {{collection}} of rescued tigers and increasingly realistic and spacious enclosures for them. The zoo inhabits much of the converted buildings of the Granite Fort built by Lord Palmerston as a defense against the French in 1860. The grounds were used by the military during World War II {{as part of the}} Pluto pipeline <b>to</b> <b>send</b> oil <b>under</b> the English Channel to France to fuel the Allied war efforts.|$|R
50|$|The {{containment}} of the Spanish threat, and the further reinforcement of his command, enabled Jervis <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a squadron <b>under</b> Nelson {{back into the}} Mediterranean the following year.

50|$|Fernand de Langle de Cary's Fourth Army, {{originally}} intended to be the spearhead of the attack into the Ardennes, was a strong force and had made several counterattacks, but Joffre now ordered it to cease counterattacking and <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a detachment <b>under</b> Ferdinand Foch to cover the gap between Fourth and Fifth Armies; this became the new Ninth Army.|$|R

50|$|In 1916, Pancho Villa {{crossed the}} U.S. border and {{attacked}} {{the town of}} Columbus, New Mexico; this was the sole invasion by a foreign armed corps of the continental U.S. in the 20th century.

25|$|Nicias, {{exhausted}} and suffering from illness, now believed {{it would be}} impossible to capture Syracuse. He wrote a letter to Athens, not trusting messengers to give an accurate report, and suggested that they either recall the expedition or send out massive reinforcements. He hoped they would choose to recall him, if not the whole expedition, but instead they chose <b>to</b> <b>send</b> reinforcements, <b>under</b> Demosthenes and Eurymedon. Eurymedon left immediately with ten ships, and Demosthenes left sometime later with a much larger force. Meanwhile, in early 413 BC Sparta acted on Alcibiades's advice to fortify Decelea, and the Athenian force sent to relieve it was destroyed.|$|R
50|$|However, Isma'il's general Muhammad ibn Harun shortly revolted, forcing Isma'il <b>to</b> <b>send</b> an army <b>under</b> his son Ahmad Samani and cousin Abu'l-Abbas Abdullah into {{northern}} Persia in 901, including Tabaristan, forcing Muhammad {{to flee to}} Daylam. The Samanid army also managed to conquer several other cities including Ray and Qazvin, though subsequent rulers lost the territory to the Daylamites and Kurds. Isma'il then appointed his cousin Abu'l-Abbas Abdullah as the governor of Tabaristan.|$|R

50|$|In {{cooperation}} with the American Embassy, Afghan-American Tooba Mayel, from a Kabul-based NGO called Arzu which hires Afghan women to make carpets and market them throughout the world, visited Slovakia on December 6, 2007. In return for higher wages earned for carpet weaving, families of more than 700 women working for Arzu must agree <b>to</b> <b>send</b> children <b>under</b> age 15 to school full-time and to attend literacy classes. During her visit in Slovakia, Ms. Mayel visited many places including Forel International School, where she spoke to a classroom of about 30 engaged students {{between the ages of}} 11 and 14. The children became particularly interested in the idea of designing a carpet that the Afghan weavers could then make.|$|R

25|$|Sheridan {{returned}} from the Valley and was tasked with flanking the Confederate army, which forced Lee <b>to</b> <b>send</b> forces <b>under</b> Maj. Gen. George Pickett and Maj. Gen.

Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee attacked first on March 31 at Dinwiddie Court House, and succeeded in pushing back the Union forces but did not gain a decisive advantage. They withdrew their forces to Five Forks that night. On April 1, Sheridan launched another attack, flanking Pickett's forces and destroying the Confederate left wing, capturing over two thousand Confederates. This victory meant that Sheridan could capture the South Side Railroad the next day.|$|R
