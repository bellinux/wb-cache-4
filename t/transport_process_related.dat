We extend our on-going research effort, by looking into the flows and tracer dispersion over hypothetical urban areas, to develop a fundamental understanding of the <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> using concurrently wind-tunnel experiments and large-eddy simulation (LES). Utilizing the theoretical solution and data archive, we attempt to parameterize the functional form of dispersion coefficients over (hypothetical) urban areas. The conventional Gaussian-plume framework is used because of its solid theoretical basis. We simply use the aerodynamic resistance to model the turbulent <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> rather than simulate the flows over complicated urban morphology in refined scales. Unlike computational fluid dynamics (CFD), dispersion parameterizations possess the benefit of quick and reasonably reliable solution at affordable costs. This paper records our development and verification of dispersion coefficients for urban setting. The first section introduces the problem background and reviews the available literature.

In this respect, it has been recognised that drainage waters from the northern opencast-worked polymetallic sulphide deposits constitute a chronic input of heavy metals into the park. Waste waters from olive-oil manufacturing mills in the area may also contribute to the mobilisation of metals towards the park. However, the resulting relative distributions of Zn, Cu and Pb within the park differ from those of mine effluents, indicating a differential transport of these metals through the water systems. Zinc seems to be the best indicator of input from the mining area. Petroleum hydrocarbons enter the park from the SE via the main rivers and tidal sea movements, whereas PAHs, PCBs and DDTs are uniformly distributed at very low levels in surface sediments, indicating a contribution by aeolian transport.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} computer simulations, using classical molecular dynamics, of <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> <b>related</b> to TiN(001) growth. It {{is motivated}} from {{the challenge to}} understand <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> at the atomic scale responsible for crystal and film growth and their different growth modes. Not even the most advanced experimental techniques are capable of resolving the sub ps time and sub-Ångström length-scales required. TiN belongs to an important class of transition metal nitrides, and is chosen here as a model system for such fundamental studies of surface transport. The simulations show that on terraces, Ti adatoms exhibit much higher migration rates than N adatoms. For TiNx complexes, as x increases from 1 to 3, rotation becomes increasingly more prevalent than translation. This leads to surprisingly high mobilities of TiN 2 trimers, {{higher than that of}} N adatoms. On islands, Ti adatoms experience a significant funneling effect, resulting in short residence times. TiN dimers and TiN 2 trimers exhibit surprisingly high diffusivities and residence times even shorter than Ti adatoms. TiN 3 trimers, however, are essentially stationary on both terraces and islands and serve as nucleation clusters. Overall, Ti adatoms and TiN 2 trimers are the most efficient carriers of Ti and N atoms with and between TiN(001) surface layers. These results indicate that Ti/N flux ratios close to one promote layer-by-layer TiN(001) growth, whereas lower ratios result in surface roughening. Understanding of these phenomena enables experimentalists to tune  the growth processes to optimize material properties. In this thesis I also carry out theoretical calculations to investigate the role of configurational order on the metallic sublattice in relation to toughness enhancement. My studies set out from the recent understanding that the toughness of transition metal nitrides can be enhanced by tuning the valence electron concentration. My results show that ordered alloys exhibit lower resistance to shear deformations than disordered alloys, and higher resistance to tensile deformation. The lower resistance to shear deformations is explained by the formation of fully bonding electronic states perpendicular to the applied stress. Using the Pugh-Pettifor criterion, it is shown that while configurational order has an effect on the ductility of the material, this is primarily governed by the valence electron concentration...|$|R

However, the late Pleistocene oceanographic history of the Arctic is still poorly understood. In the present study we show sedimentary records of total organic carbon (TOC), C/N and CaCO 3 from a piston core recovered from the northern Northwind Ridge in the far western Arctic Ocean, a region potentially sensitively responding to past variability in surface current regimes and sedimentary processes such as coastal erosion. An age model based on correlation of our CaCO 3 record with the benthic &delta; 18 O stack, supplemented by lithological constraints, suggests that the piston core records paleoenvironmental changes of the last 155 kyr. According to this age model, TOC and C/N show orbital-scale increases and decreases that can be respectively correlated to the waxing and waning of large ice sheets dominating the Eurasian Arctic, suggesting advection of fine suspended matter derived from glacial erosion to the Northwind Ridge by eastward flowing intermediate water and/or surface water and sea ice during cold episodes {{of the last two}} glacial-interglacial cycles. At millennial scales, increases in TOC and C/N appear to correlate to a suite of Dansgaard-Oeschger Stadials between 120 and 40 ka before present (BP) and thus seem to respond to abrupt northern hemispheric temperature changes. Between 65 and 40 ka BP, closures and openings of the Bering Strait could have additionally influenced TOC and C/N variability. CaCO 3 content tends to anti-correlate with TOC and C/N on both orbital and millennial time scales, which we interpret as enhanced sediment advection from the carbonate-rich Canadian Arctic via an extended Beaufort Gyre during warm periods of the last two glacial-interglacial cycles and increased terrestrial organic carbon advection from the Siberian Arctic during cold periods when the Beaufort Gyre contracted. We propose that this pattern may be related to orbital- and millennial-scale variations of dominant atmospheric surface pressure systems expressed in mode shifts of the Arctic Oscillation...|$|R

In this study a relatively simple turbulence model was first further investigated to predict the complex three-dimensional flow structure in a flume with vegetation. The main purpose of this part {{of the study was to}} try and acquire accurate velocity profiles of complex flows without the need for a more advanced two-equation turbulence model, requiring values for a number of unknown coefficients and extra computing cost. The results showed that the simple two layer mixing length model was capable of giving more accurate complex velocity profile predictions, with the advantage of requiring limited coefficient data. Formulations developed through earlier studies for dynamic decay rates were then refined and included in the numerical model. The model predictions were tested against field data, with good agreement being obtained. Further refinements to the representation of the transport of bacteria through the flow field were included in the model by the novel addition of the interaction of bacteria with the sediments by partitioning the total bacteria into their free-living and attached phases using a dynamic partitioning ratio. This ratio was related to the suspended sediment concentrations. The novel method used in this study was to include the re-suspension and deposition of the absorbed bacteria with the sediments and this approach has been tested against analytical solutions for steady uniform flow conditions, and published field and experimental data. The model was then applied to the Severn Estuary. After calibration against available data sets the model was then run for different scenarios to investigate the effects of different hydro-environmental conditions on the bacteria distributions in the Severn Estuary. The model was finally used to investigate the impact of the proposed Cardiff-Weston tidal barrage on the hydrodynamic, the sediment <b>transport</b> and bacterial <b>processes</b> within the Severn Estuary.

40|$|AbstractThe {{prediction}} of thermo-mechanical behaviour of heterogeneous {{materials such as}} heat and moisture transport is strongly influenced by the uncertainty in parameters. Such materials occur e. g., in historic buildings, and the durability assessment of these therefore needs a reliable and probabilistic simulation of <b>transport</b> <b>processes,</b> which is <b>related</b> to the suitable identification of material parameters. In order to include expert knowledge as well as experimental results, one can employ an updating procedure such as Bayesian inference. The classical probabilistic setting of the identification process in Bayes’ form requires the solution of a stochastic forward problem via computationally expensive sampling techniques, which makes the method almost impractical. In this paper novel stochastic computational techniques such as the stochastic Galerkin method are applied in order to accelerate the updating procedure. The idea is to replace the computationally expensive forward simulation via the conventional finite element (FE) method by the evaluation of a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). Such an approximation of the FE model for the forward simulation perfectly suits the Bayesian updating. The presented uncertainty updating techniques are applied to the numerical model of coupled heat and moisture transport in heterogeneous materials with spatially varying coefficients defined by random fields...|$|R

The spontaneous asymmetries in the transport of the weak electrolytes were not dependent {{on the presence of}} either bicarbonate or chloride in the incubation medium. Net transport of the weak electrolytes was abolished when choline was substituted for sodium in the fluid bathing the mucosal surface of the tissue, but weak electrolyte transport was independent of the presence of sodium on the serosal side. Weak electrolyte transport was inhibited by ouabain and by orthovanadate. The effect of ouabain was abolished when potassium was substituted for sodium in the serosal fluid, and the effect of orthovanadate was potentiated in this condition. It was shown that the ability of the intestinal epithelium to discriminate between the ionized and non-ionized forms of weak electrolytes was not altered when choline was substituted for sodium in the incubation medium, indicating that the effect of sodium was associated with the driving force for weak electrolyte transport. Weak electrolyte transport was not abolished by raising the serosal potassium concentration, suggesting that the <b>transport</b> <b>process</b> was directly <b>related</b> with the function of the sodium pump, rather than correlated with gradients of electrical or chemical potential established as a consequence of pump activity...|$|R

Such analysis permits an operational definition of several transport systems having different affinities for their substrates. The identification of these transport systems was made possible by experiments on specific mutants whose isolation and characterization is described elsewhere. The <b>transport</b> <b>process</b> with highest affinity was called the “very-high-affinity”process. Isoleucine, leucine, and valine are substrates of this <b>transport</b> <b>process</b> and their apparent Km values are either 10 − 8, 2 × 10 − 8, or 10 − 7 M, respectively. Methionine, threonine, and alanine inhibit this <b>transport</b> <b>process,</b> probably because they are also substrates. The very-high-affinity <b>transport</b> <b>process</b> is absent when bacteria are grown in the presence of methionine, and this is due to a specific repression. Methionine and alanine were also found to affect the pool size of isoleucine and valine. Another <b>transport</b> <b>process</b> is the “high-affinity” process. Isoleucine, leucine, and valine are substrates of this <b>transport</b> <b>process,</b> and their apparent Km value is 2 × 10 − 6 M for all three.

Several structural analogues of the branched-chain amino acids inhibit the very-high-affinity or the high-affinity <b>transport</b> <b>process</b> in a specific way, and this confirms their existence as two separate entities. Three different “low-affinity” <b>transport</b> <b>processes,</b> each specific for either isoleucine or leucine or valine, show apparent Km values of 0. 5 × 10 − 4 M. These <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> show a very high substrate specificity since no inhibitor was found among other amino acids or among many branched-chain amino acid precursors or analogues tried. The evolutionary significance of the observed redundancy of transport systems is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In Alpine regions, floods {{are often}} {{associated}} with erosion, transport and deposition of coarse sediment along the streams. These <b>processes</b> are <b>related</b> to bedload transport and pose a hazard {{in addition to the}} elevated water discharge. However, it is unclear to what extent they contribute to total damage caused by natural hazards. Using the Swiss flood and landslide damage database – which collects financial damage data of naturally triggered floods, debris flows and landslides – we estimated the contribution of fluvial bedload <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> to total damage costs in Switzerland. For each database entry an upper and lower limit of financial losses caused by or <b>related</b> to bedload <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> was estimated, {{and the quality of the}} estimate was judged. When compared to total damage, the fraction of bedload transport damage in the 40 yr study period lies between 0. 32 and 0. 37. However, this value is highly variable for individual years (from 0. 02 to 0. 72). Bedload <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> have induced cumulative financial losses between CHF 4. 3 and 5. 1 billion. Spatial analysis revealed a considerable heterogeneous distribution with largest damage for mountainous regions. The analysis of the seasonal distribution shows that more than 75 % of the bedload damage costs occurs in summer (June–August), and ~ 23 % in autumn (September– November). With roughly 56 %, by far most of the damage has been registered in August. Bedload <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> are presently still inadequately understood, and the predictive quality of common bedload equations is often poor. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of bedload transport as a natural hazard and financial source of risk, and thus the need for future structured research on <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> in steep streams...|$|R
30|$|After a route {{has been}} reserved, the <b>transport</b> <b>process</b> starts. Since the {{reservation}} of a route only guarantees that a packet can be conveyed without a collision, possible deadlock situations {{have to be}} identified and prevented during the <b>transport</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of solid phase {{reactions}} heat and gas <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> play a dominant role. Therefore, {{it would be necessary}} to standardize the experimental conditions which suc-ceeded only in part with the elaboration of the simultaneous techniques. Likewise the two <b>transport</b> <b>processes</b> are responsible for the fact that on the basis of non-isothermal curves one cannot calculate kinetic parameters of the reactions. The quasi static-methods seem to be suitable for the elimination of the pernicious effect of these <b>transport</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
