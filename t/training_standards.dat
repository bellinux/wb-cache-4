25|$|A {{significant}} amount of harmonization of <b>training</b> <b>standards</b> and standard and emergency procedures has developed over the years, largely due to organisations like World Recreational Scuba Training Council. This allows divers trained by the various certifying organisations to dive together {{with a minimum of}} confusion, which enhances safety. Diver communications is a particular aspect where most of the basic hand signals are common to most recreational diver training agencies.|$|E
25|$|Recreational diving {{instructors}} and divemasters, {{on the other}} hand, are {{to a greater or}} lesser extent responsible for the safety of divers under their guidance, and therefore are generally required to be trained and certified to some level of rescue and first aid competence, as defined in the relevant <b>training</b> <b>standards</b> of the certifying body. In many cases this includes certification in Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and Oxygen administration for diving accidents.|$|E

The INEEL Safety Analyst <b>Training</b> <b>Standard</b> (STD- 1107) was developed directly from EFCOG Training Subgroup draft safety analyst training plan template, but has been adapted to the needs and requirements of the INEEL safety analysis community. The implementation of this Safety Analyst <b>Training</b> <b>Standard</b> is part of the Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) Phase II Implementation currently underway at the INEEL. The objective of this paper is to discuss (1) the INEEL Safety Analyst <b>Training</b> <b>Standard,</b> (2) the development of the safety analyst individual training plans, (3) the implementation issues encountered during this initial phase of implementation, (4) the solutions developed, and (5) the implementation activities remaining to be completed...|$|R

Areas of TTT expertise include combatives; weapons; communications; calling for and adjusting indirect fire; combat lifesaver techniques; air assault operations; military operations on urban terrain; IED defeat techniques; operations in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments; and all leader tasks.|$|E
25|$|Each diver {{certification}} {{agency has}} {{its own set of}} diver <b>training</b> <b>standards</b> for each level of certification that they issue. Although these standards are usually available on request or on the organisation's website, the assessment criteria are often not available to the public, making a direct comparison of standards difficult. Most agencies comply with the minimum requirements of the World Recreational Scuba Training Council (WRSTC) or ISO for the relevant certification (ISO 24801-2 Autonomous diver, and ISO 24801-3 Dive leader), but most certification levels are not defined by the international standards.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control, {{while attempting to}} switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined there were other key factors {{that led to the}} accident. Foremost among these was Denver's inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft, and the builder's decision to locate the fuel selector handle in a difficult-to-reach location. The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory <b>training</b> <b>standards</b> for pilots operating experimental aircraft. It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{training}} for open water certification {{for a person}} who is medically fit to dive and a reasonably competent swimmer is relatively short. The minimum number of open-water dives required for certification is usually four, but instructors are generally required by <b>training</b> <b>standards</b> to ensure that the diver is sufficiently skilled before certification is issued, and this may require further training and experience beyond the required minimum. Many dive shops in popular holiday locations offer courses intended to teach a novice to dive in a few days, which can be combined with diving on the vacation. Other instructors and dive schools will provide more thorough training, which generally takes longer.|$|E
25|$|A {{diminishing}} U.S. fleet {{contrasted with}} the burgeoning of international sea trade. For example, worldwide demand for natural gas led {{to the growth of}} the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker fleet, which reached 370 vessels as of 2007. In 2007 the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) set uniform LNG <b>training</b> <b>standards</b> at U.S. maritime training facilities. While short-term imports are declining, longer term projections signal an eightfold increase in U.S. imported LNG by 2025, the worldwide LNG fleet does not include a single U.S. flagged vessel. Moreover, only five U.S. deepwater LNG ports were operational in 2007, although permits have been issued for four additional ports, according to MARAD.|$|E
