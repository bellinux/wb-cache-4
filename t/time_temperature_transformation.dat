5000|$|Metal {{quenching}} is {{a transient}} heat transfer process {{in terms of}} the <b>Time</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Transformation</b> (TTT). It is possible to manipulate the cooling process to adjust the phase of a suitable material. For example, appropriate quenching of steel can convert a desirable proportion of its content of austenite to martensite, creating a very tough product. To achieve this, it is necessary to quench at the [...] "nose" [...] (or eutectic) of the TTT diagram. Since materials differ in their Biot numbers, the time it takes for the material to quench, or the Fourier number, varies in practice. In steel, the quenching temperature range is generally from 600 °C to 200 °C. To control the quenching time and to select suitable quenching media, it is necessary to determine the Fourier number from the desired quenching time, the relative temperature drop, and the relevant Biot number. Usually, the correct figures are read from a standard nomogram. By calculating the heat transfer coefficient from this Biot number, one can find a liquid medium suitable for the application.|$|E

40|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC) {{was used}} to characterize the phase transformation behaviour of porous Ni 50 Ti 50 alloys fabricated by capsule-free hot isostatic pressing (CF-HIP) with different cold compaction pressures. Experimental results reveal that a multi-stage martensitic transformation (MST) exists in the sintered porous NiTi alloys on cooling while the reverse transformation upon heating is either a single or two-stage phase transformation. The DSC thermal analysis indicates that the cold compaction pressure has great effect on the subsequent <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Generally, the phase <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures</b> of porous NiTi alloys with lower cold compaction pressure are higher than those compacted with higher pressure.

To gain an accurate understanding of the processes in the sample, a coupled thermo-electrical, thermo-metallurgical, thermo-mechanical finite element model of the experiments is set up. To map the temperature control circuit of the machine, a PID controller is implemented, which controls the voltage of the conductive sample heating between the simulation steps.

40|$|The {{shape memory}} {{behavior}} in NiTi alloys can be exploited {{for a wide}} variety of applications that require active materials. The application dictates the <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures</b> and hysteresis of the alloy. NiTi alloys with high Ni contents can be precipitation heat treated to produce large changes in the <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures,</b> as well as increases in strength and dimensional stability. The effect of aging on the Ms temperature has been previously studied in the literature; however, few studies have investigated long duration aging, and little attention has been paid to the effect of precipitate formation on the thermal hysteresis. In the current work, a systematic study of heat treatments was performed to study the effect of aging <b>time,</b> aging <b>temperature,</b> and initial Ni composition on the <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the thermal hysteresis under zero stress conditions using differential scanning calorimetry.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the formation of}} martensite in Ni-based super-alloys in both an alloy-coating system and in the bulk alloy, NiPtAl. The alloy-coating {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that an extra layer of Ni could favourably alter diffusion gradients within the alloy-coating system in order to preferentially promote martensite(ß ’) formation. Such martensite formation would have the advantage of delaying the development of y’-Ni 3 Al, and reducing precipitation of the brittle topologically close packed phases, on subsequent heat-treatment. The work was a success in that deposition of a layer of Ni on the alloy, prior to aluminising did alter the diffusion profile of the coating-alloy system. During the aluminising process, a layer of very Ni-rich y’ formed at the coating/alloy interface. As the diffusivity of elements through this phase is notably lower than that of elements diffusing through the Al-rich ß -NiAl phase, the coating produced was thinner and had a higher Al content. These effects resulted in a coating that retained a ß +ß ’ majority composition {{for a longer period of}} oxidation, than its un-plated equivalent. As the molar volume change of the ß - ß ’ transformation is less than that of ß - y’, this successful promotion of ß ’ over y’ may also aid in minimising phase transformations misfit, and any subsequent rumpling leading to delamination. Although the TCP needles were still formed on oxidation, the altered diffusion gradient permitted back diffusion of elements such as Ta, into the alloy, therefore enabling Ta to offer the strengthening properties for which it was added, and preventing it from succumbing to undesirable oxidation. The martensite investigated in the NiPtAl bulk alloys was shown to have a crystallographic structure that was tetragonal, with L 1 o 3 R ordering. The alloys were very sensitive to Pt content, with a 5 at. % increase, from 5 to 10 at. % causing a 440 C rise in the Ms temperature, and more than doubling the required activation energy from 35 to 87 kJ/mol. The level to which Pt could diffuse influenced whether thermal or coherent phonon activity would dominate for the transformation. Tempering of martensite was also sensitive to Pt content, specifically at 360 C which is suggestive that the nose of the martensite <b>Time</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Transformation</b> curve is close to this temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermoplastic}} formability (TPF) of {{metallic glasses}} {{was found to}} be related to the calorimetrically measured crystallization temperature minus the glass transition temperature, Tg - Tx = ΔT. Alloy development in the ZrTiBe system identified a composition with ΔT = 120 °C. Many alloys with ΔT > 150 °C and one alloy, Zr 35 Ti 30 Be 27. 5 Cu 7. 5, with ΔT = 165 °C were discovered by substituting Be with small amounts of fourth alloying elements. The viscosity as a function of temperature, η(T), and <b>time</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>transformation</b> (TTT) measurements for the new alloy are presented and combined to create ηTT plots (viscosity time transformation) that are useful in determining what viscosities are available for a required processing time. ηTT plots are created for many alloys used in TPF in the literature and it is found that for processes requiring 60 - 300 s, Zr 35 Ti 30 Be 27. 5 Cu 7. 5 provides an order of magnitude lower viscosity for processing than the other metallic glasses. Injection molding is demonstrated with Zr 35 Ti 30 Be 27. 5 Cu 7. 5 and the part shows improved mechanical properties over die cast specimens of the same geometry. Changes of slope in η(T) measurements were observed and investigated in some quaternary compositions and found to be present in ternary compositions as well. Traditionally metallic glasses show a single discontinuity in heat capacity at the glass transition temperature. Alloys with the changes in slope of η(T) were found to show two discontinuities in heat capacity with the changes in slope of η(T) roughly correlating with the observed Tg values. These two Tg values were assumed to arise from two glassy phases present in the alloy. Further heat capacity analysis found systematic trends in the magnitude of the heat capacity discontinuities with composition and the single phase compositions of a metastable miscibility gap were discovered. Microscopic evidence of the two phases is lacking so we must limit our claims to evidence of two relaxation phenomena existing and can’t definitively claim two phases. The alloy development led to the discovery of alloys with densities near Ti that are among the highest strength to weight ratio materials known.

40|$|The first {{metallic}} glass {{was discovered by}} Pol Duwez {{and his colleagues at}} Caltech in 1960. Shortly after that, Turnbull pointed out that a high ratio of melting temperature over glass transition temperature favors glass formation based on classical nucleation theory. Using Turnbull's theory as a guideline, many alloy systems were found forming glasses. As a new state of metallic alloys, {{metallic glass}} is of scientific interest by itself as well as attractive for practical applications due to unique properties. However, since the critical cooling rates for glass formation of conventional alloys are relatively high, at least one dimension of the metallic glass is limited to a few tenths of milimeter. This severely limited the application of metallic glasses. Recently, several multicomponent alloy systems were discovered that form bulk metallic glasses with the smallest dimension of several mm up to several cm. Two of these alloy systems are the Ti-Zr-Cu-Ni and the Zr-Ti-(Nb) -Cu-Ni-Al alloys, which were discovered during this thesis research. In this thesis homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation theories and their influence on glass formation are reviewed. Experimental methods for metallic glass processing are introduced. The formation of Ti-Zr-Cu-Ni and Zr-Ti-(Nb) -Cu-Ni-Al bulk metallic alloys are reported. The glass transition, crystallization behavior, and mechanical properties of these glassy alloys are presented. The optimized combinations of four or five elements in these alloys leads to very deep eutetic multicomponent alloys, in which nucleation of crystals upon undercooling becomes increasingly improbable. Thermodynamic, kinetic and topological factors are discussed that contribute the exceptional glass forming ability of these alloys. The very high stability of the undercooled liquids of bulk glass forming alloys makes it possible to perform studies on undercooled liquids in a time and temperature window that was not accessible thus far. In this thesis the <b>time</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>transformation</b> diagrams were measured for the crystallization of undercooled Zr-Ti-(Nb) -Cu-Ni-Al liquids. It has been discovered that the crystallization of the undercooled liquid is caused by heterogeneous nucleation induced by oxide particles, even when the oxygen concentration is as low as 250 atomic ppm. Overheating the melts above the liquidus temperature of the oxide particle results in maximum undercooling. Strong oxygen concentration dependence of the overheating, undercooling, and TTT diagrams was found. These results suggest that impurities {{play a key role in}} the crystallization of undercooled liquid. This first systematic study of impurity effect on crystallization of undercooled liquid will have many important implications on making bulk glasses and any study of undercooled liquids. To summarize this thesis, important factors which affect the crystallization are revealed and discussed. Strategies on how to find new bulk metallic glasses are suggested...|$|E

40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringLaser {{transformation}} hardening (or {{known as}} laser heat treatment) {{is an important}} technique to increase surface hardness by utilizing a high intensity laser beam and a material’s self-quenching capability. Compared to other traditional heat treatment techniques, laser heat treatment is especially useful when the target material needs to be heat treated selectively without affecting unnecessary regions because the laser beam is relatively small and has a high power density. Until now, {{there have been a}} lot of researches regarding laser heat treatment but to the best of our knowledge, the process map from bulk type to sheet type has not been reported so far. In this thesis, we have studied how to optimize the laser transformation hardening of carbon steel sheet. In the first chapter, we investigated a process map for diode laser heat treatment of carbon steels that gives an overall perspective of the laser heat treatment of carbon steels. Using a heat treatable region map, we conducted laser heat treatments on AISI 1020 and 1035 steel specimens using a 3 kW diode laser and measured their surface hardness and hardening depths. The experimental results are in agreement with the carbon contents and carbon diffusion time in austenite and cooling time. In the second chapter, we investigated the effect of specimen thickness on hardening performance in the laser heat treatment of carbon steel using the process map considering thickness of plate. We conducted laser heat treatment on AISI 1020 steel specimens using the same 3 kW diode laser system from the previous chapter and constructed surface hardness map. The hardness decreases as thickness decreases and we conjectured which one would be the most dominant factor in terms of enhancement of hardness. In the third chapter, based on the results from previous chapter, we investigated how to enhance surface hardness of carbon steel with four different types of heat sink: stainless steel, steel, copper and no heat sink. The primary factors of the process are the thermal conductivity and the thermal contact resistance of the heat sink. For experiment, we used 2 mm thick DP 590 and boron steel sheets. In this chapter, we found effective ways to enhance the hardenability of steel sheets and how large the effect of this enhancement is proportional to thermal conductivity of the heat sink. In the fourth chapter, we simulated 3 D model using AbaqusTM commercial software and Fortran user subroutine to know the influence of thermal contact resistance and thermal conductivity using heat sink. From the simulation, we realized the phase mole fraction using TTT (<b>Time</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Transformation)</b> diagram and the deformation using the parameter of the thermal expansion coefficient and phase change expansion coefficient, transformation plasticity coefficient.
