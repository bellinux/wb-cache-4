500|$|Leafs {{co-owner}} Stafford Smythe rejected {{accusations that}} he opposed expansion to Vancouver, {{pointing out that}} he had offered to build and operate an $8million facility in the city's downtown area, a proposal that he contended made little sense unless Vancouver had an NHL team. However, Smythe's proposal was contingent on him acquiring the parcel of land required from the city, then valued at $2.5 million, for $1. The proposed transaction was defeated in a municipal referendum. [...] Smythe therefore placed the blame for Vancouver's failed bid on the city: [...] "Vancouver lost its chance the day it turned down the referendum on our arena proposal", Smythe said. [...] "That proved to me that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> there aren't interested in going major league." ...|$|E

Roberts explained the concept of the track, noting [...] "What it is with Sticks + Stones is I wanted all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> there who hurt like that to know that they’re not the only ones in that position.
