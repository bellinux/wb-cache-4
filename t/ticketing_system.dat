5|$|Along {{with the}} {{establishment}} of the light rail service, the public transport in Bergen underwent other changes. Skyss was established in 2007 to administer the public transport system, manage routes and market public transport, which would be operated by private companies based on public service obligations. At the same time, a new electronic <b>ticketing</b> <b>system</b> was introduced.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's <b>ticketing</b> <b>system</b> with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus <b>ticketing</b> <b>system</b> when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of my diploma {{work is to}} introduce trouble <b>ticket</b> <b>systems</b> operated inside telecommunication company. The whole work is conceived as a project to set up trouble <b>ticket</b> <b>system</b> into big telecommunication company. Trouble <b>ticket</b> <b>system</b> showed in this work is based on products of ORACLE, SUN and Hewlett-Packard companies. In following chapters there are described project requirements, detail function analysis, hardware and software resources. After that follows practically part showing print screens of trouble <b>ticket</b> <b>system</b> and parts of program code...|$|R
50|$|Most event correlators {{can receive}} events from trouble <b>ticket</b> <b>systems.</b> However, {{only some of}} them are able to notify trouble <b>ticket</b> <b>systems</b> when a problem is solved, which partly {{explains}} the difficulty for Service Desks to keep updated with the latest news. In theory, the integration of management in organizations requires the communication between the event correlator and the trouble <b>ticket</b> <b>system</b> to work both ways.|$|R
50|$|Most German S-Bahn {{networks}} {{have a unique}} <b>ticket</b> <b>system,</b> separated from the Deutsche Bahn rates, instead connected to the city <b>ticket</b> <b>system.</b> The S-Bahn of Hanover, however, operates under five different rates due to its large expanse.|$|R
5|$|The <b>ticketing</b> <b>system</b> {{uses the}} EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay {{contactless}} smart cards {{based upon the}} Symphony for e-Payment (SeP) system for public transit built on the Singapore Standard for Contactless ePurse Application (CEPAS) system. This system allows for up to 4 card issuers in the market. The EZ-Link card was introduced on 13 April 2002 {{as a replacement for}} the original TransitLink farecard, while its competitor the NETS FlashPay card entered the smartcard market on 9 October 2009.|$|E
5|$|London's {{first and}} only cable car, known as the Emirates Air Line, opened in June 2012. Crossing the River Thames, linking Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in {{the east of the}} city, the cable car is {{integrated}} with London's Oyster Card <b>ticketing</b> <b>system,</b> although special fares are charged. Costing £60 million to build, it carries over 3,500 passengers every day, although this is very much lower than its capacity. Similar to the Santander Cycles bike hire scheme, the cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline Emirates.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{opens to}} ticket holders {{two hours before}} kick-off. The main club shop, named 'The Armoury', and ticket offices are located near the West Stand, with other an {{additional}} store {{at the base of}} the North Bank Bridge, named 'All Arsenal' and the 'Arsenal Store' next to Finsbury Park station. Arsenal operates an electronic <b>ticketing</b> <b>system</b> where members of 'The Arsenal' (the club's fan membership scheme) use their membership cards to enter the stadium, thus removing the need for turnstile operators. Non-members are issued with one-off paper tickets embedded with an RFID tag allowing them to enter the stadium.|$|E

50|$|Most of the {{expressway}} {{maintains a}} <b>ticket</b> <b>system</b> (closed system) of tolling. The expressway however also has two toll plazas using the barrier toll system (open system) at the Bukit Kayu Hitam checkpoint and at Jitra. The <b>ticket</b> <b>system</b> from Juru southwards uses an integrated system of tolling that {{also applies to}} the New Klang Valley Expressway, North-South Expressway Central Link and North-South Expressway Southern Route (e.g. {{it is possible to}} travel from Juru on this expressway to Skudai, Johor on the North-South Expressway Southern Route without leaving the toll <b>system).</b> A separate <b>ticket</b> <b>system</b> is in place between Hutan Kampung and Sungai Dua, due to the toll-free section in Penang. The toll rate for the <b>ticket</b> <b>system</b> for passenger cars excluding taxis as of 2011 is 13.6 sen per kilometre.|$|R

Ruter makes use of a zone system, including a single-zone fare within Oslo. From 2010, the contactless ticket system Flexus is being introduced. In Oslo, there is transfer to the Oslo Metro at OsloS (to Jernbanetorget), at Nationaltheatret and at Grefsen (to Storo). Transfer to the Oslo Tramway is possible from OsloS, Nationaltheatret, Skøyen and Grefsen. At Moss, there is transfer to the Moss–Horten Ferry. Line 450 provides connection to Norway's main international airport, Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade has an {{extensive}} public transport {{system based on}} buses (118 urban lines and more than 300 suburban lines), trams (12 lines), and trolleybuses (8 lines). It is run by GSP Beograd and SP Lasta, in cooperation with private companies on various bus routes. The BusPlus <b>ticketing</b> <b>system</b> based on contactless smart cards began operating in February 2012. Belgrade also has a S-train network, BG Voz, now run by the city government (previous commuter railway network, Beovoz, was abolished around 2013). The main railway station connects Belgrade with other European capitals and many towns in Serbia. Travel by coach is also popular, and the capital is well-served with daily connections to every town in Serbia and to many other European destinations through the central bus station.|$|E
5|$|Ludvig G. Braathen died on 27 December 1976 {{while he}} was still CEO. He was succeeded by his son Bjørn G. Braathen, who had {{returned}} to the company a few years earlier. In 1977, Braathens SAFE made NOK10 million in profit on the Trondheim route and NOK4 million on the routes from Oslo to Kristiansand and Stavanger. At the same time, the airline lost NOK6 million on the routes to from Oslo to Ålesund, Molde and Kristiansund, and NOK18 million on the coastal routes between Stavanger and Tromsø. From 1 October 1978, the company also introduced 50% youth discount for people under 26 years. From 1 May 1978, there was introduced a NOK100 tax on international charter flights. The same year, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of Bergenske Dampskibsselskab, that owned 51% of the travel agency Bennett Reisebureau. This was to try to secure influence over the chain, that was also owned 31% by SAS. A new, neutral <b>ticketing</b> <b>system,</b> SMART, was introduced in 1980 for all travel agents in Norway and Sweden. Following this, Braathens SAFE sold its stake in Bergenske with a profit.|$|E
