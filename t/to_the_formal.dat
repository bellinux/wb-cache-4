5|$|Although the Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—had {{achieved}} several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, in Italy the Coalition's achievements {{were more}} limited. In northern Italy, {{despite the presence}} of the most experienced of the Austrian generals—Dagobert Wurmser—the Austrians could not lift the siege at Mantua, and the efforts of Napoleon in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> peace treaty, the Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797.|$|E

5|$|In November 1998, Al Snow, Bob Holly and Scorpio {{united and}} formed The J.O.B. Squad. During that same month on an edition of Raw, they helped Mankind defeat Ken Shamrock and The Big Boss Man in a triple threat match. In February 1999, Scorpio was {{released}} by the WWF while Gillberg was later phased out of storylines and The Blue Meanie allied with Goldust. After dwindling down to only two members, Snow wrestled against himself on an edition of Raw before Holly {{came down to the}} ring to prevent Snow from hurting himself, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> breakup of the J.O.B. Squad. Later that month at , Bob Holly, now renamed Hardcore Holly, defeated Snow for the WWF Hardcore Championship to permanently end the J.O.B. Squad.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> {{theories of}} the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
5|$|Political {{conflict}} {{broke out}} across the Empire shortly after the marriage, triggered when Henry arrested his Chancellor Adalbert and various other German princes. Rebellions followed, accompanied by opposition from within the Church, which played {{an important part in}} administering the Empire, and this led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> excommunication of the Emperor by Pope Paschal II. Henry and Matilda marched over the Alps into Italy in early 1116, intent on settling matters permanently with the Pope. Matilda was now playing a full part in the imperial government, sponsoring royal grants, dealing with petitioners and taking part in ceremonial occasions. The rest of the year was spent establishing control of northern Italy, and in early 1117 the pair advanced on Rome itself.|$|E

5|$|The Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—achieved several {{victories}} at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, but {{in northern}} Italy, they could neither lift nor escape the siege at Mantua. The efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian {{forces to the}} border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797. Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought so hard to acquire, including the strategic river crossings at Hüningen and Kehl, as well as key cities further north.|$|E
5|$|The {{war ended}} in the Treaty of Raciąż on 22 May 1404. Władysław acceded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> cession of Samogitia and agreed to support the Order's designs on Pskov; in return, Konrad von Jungingen {{undertook}} to sell Poland the disputed Dobrzyń Land {{and the town of}} Złotoryja, once pawned to the Order by Władysław Opolski, and to support Vytautas in a revived attempt on Novgorod. Both sides had practical reasons for signing the treaty at that point: the Order needed time to fortify its newly acquired lands, the Poles and Lithuanians to deal with territorial challenges in the east and in Silesia.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Pat's passage, the Government of the Cook Islands declared Aitutaki {{a disaster}} zone. In {{accordance with the}} FRANZ agreement, the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ$350,000 for recovery efforts prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> request for assistance on February13. Following said request, New Zealand prepped a C-130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February15. The aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island. The NZDF priority was repair of schools and hospitals, though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris, restoring power, and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents. The {{lack of access to}} clean water prompted significant concern, and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February12 to assist with restoration efforts. Immediate provisions of 600water bottles were sent to the island on February16. The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water, using a truck to distribute it to the island's villages. Through September24, they provided over 100,000litres of clean water. Distribution of 2,050collapsible containers and 200hygiene kits lessened dependency on the Red Cross's water pump.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{with the}} thawing of Sino-Indian relations, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to China {{led to the}} {{resumption}} of talks on opening the border. Later in 2004, the Indian Defence Minister's visit to China led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> opening of the pass. The opening, originally scheduled for 2 October 2005, was postponed due to last-minute infrastructure problems on the Chinese side. Finally, {{after a decade of}} talks, Nathu La was opened on 6 July 2006. The date of the reopening, which also formally recognised Tibet as part of China by India and Sikkim's accession to India, coincided with the birthday of the reigning Dalai Lama. In the years before the reopening, the only person permitted to cross the barbed-wire frontier had been a Chinese postman with an Indian military escort, who would hand over mail to his Indian counterpart in a building at the border.|$|E
