5|$|The {{following}} evening Djorgovski again {{observed the}} region. He compared the images from both nights but the error box contained no objects that had decreased in luminosity between May8 and May9. Metzger noticed one object that had increased in luminosity, but he {{assumed it was}} a variable star rather than the GRB afterglow. Titus Galama and Paul Groot, members of a research team in Amsterdam led by Jan van Paradijs, compared images taken by the WIYN <b>Telescope</b> <b>on</b> May8 and the William Herschel <b>Telescope</b> <b>on</b> May9. They were also unable to find any light sources which had faded during that time.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the Hubble Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>on</b> the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to {{the plane of the}} sky; but innermost b and e are inclined at 85°.

5|$|Use of the Fibre-fed Echelle Spectrograph (FIES) at the Nordic Optical <b>Telescope</b> <b>on</b> the Canary Islands on June 4, 2009 {{provided}} {{data that}} was used to determine the star's stellar classification. The W.M. Keck Observatory's High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES), which was used on June 3–6, 2009, and July 2–4, 2009, determined radial velocity measurements for the star, which helped to further define stellar parameters.|$|E
5|$|Attached to {{the dome}} is a three-storey {{rectangular}} building which houses the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human presence is required inside the dome, {{which means the}} environmental conditions can be kept very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel {{large enough to accommodate}} the mirrors from any other <b>telescope</b> <b>on</b> the mountain. As a result, all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E

5|$|Data {{processing}} led to {{the acquisition}} of 24,943 data points that suggested that some body transited, or crossed in front of (and briefly dimmed), WASP-15 every 3.7520 days. Approximately eleven transits, full and partial, were observed. Use of the EulerCAM photometer at the La Silla Observatory's 1.2 m Leonhard Euler <b>Telescope</b> <b>on</b> March 29, 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit's curve. Later, the CORALIE spectrograph (also on the Euler telescope) between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements. Analysis confirmed {{the presence of a}} planet that was later designated WASP-15b.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{was able}} to develop a method of {{determining}} longitude based on {{the timing of the}} orbits of the Galilean moons. The times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance, and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence longitude. The main problem with the technique was that it was difficult to observe the Galilean moons through a <b>telescope</b> <b>on</b> a moving ship; a problem that Galileo tried to solve with the invention of the celatone. The method was used by Cassini and Picard to re-map France.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden {{offered a}} £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a {{magazine}} advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in {{a body of water}} such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a <b>telescope</b> <b>on</b> a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.|$|E

5|$|At {{least four}} of the fifteen stars visible to the unaided eye are orange giants of {{spectral}} class K. The second brightest star in the constellation—at apparent magnitude 4.1—is Zeta Telescopii, an orange subgiant of spectral type K1III-IV. Around 1.53 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 512 times its luminosity. Located 127 light years away from Earth, it {{has been described as}} yellow or reddish in appearance. Epsilon Telescopii is a binary star system: the brighter component, Epsilon Telescopii A, is an orange giant of spectral type K0III with an apparent magnitude of +4.52, while the 13th magnitude companion, Epsilon Telescopii B, is 21 arcseconds away from the primary, and just visible with a 15cm aperture <b>telescope</b> <b>on</b> a dark night. The system is 417 light-years away. Iota Telescopii and HD 169405—magnitude 5 orange giants of spectral types K0III and K0.5III respectively—make up the quartet. They are around 370 and 497 light-years away from the Sun respectively. Another ageing star, Kappa Telescopii is a yellow giant with a spectral type G9III and apparent magnitude of 5.18. Around 1.87 billion years old, this star of around 1.6 solar masses has swollen to 11 times the Sun's diameter. It is approximately 293 light-years from Earth, and is another optical double.|$|E
5|$|Neptune is {{not visible}} to the unaided eye {{and is the only}} planet in the Solar System found by {{mathematical}} prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a <b>telescope</b> <b>on</b> 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.|$|E

25|$|Sagan was {{a proponent}} {{of the search for}} {{extraterrestrial}} life. He urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms. Sagan was so persuasive that by 1982 he was able to get a petition advocating SETI published in the journal Science and signed by 70 scientists, including seven Nobel Prize winners. This signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a then-controversial field.
