5|$|The JCR runs three balls {{every year}} for its students, with one held during each term. The largest {{is the end of}} year June Ball, which is the social {{highlight}} of the academic year. Tradition dictates that its theme remains closely hidden until <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Castle open.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} from a manhole in the showers of the guard living quarters, Riddick uses a guard uniform to blend in {{as he makes his}} way to the space port and his chance at escape. Realizing he requires a guard to get through the retinal scanner that locks <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> space port, Riddick decides to go after Abbott and take his eyes. He gains access to Abbott's apartment by telling him there is a delivery for him. A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott bleeds out on the floor, Riddick moves in for the kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E
5|$|The {{center of}} the {{building}} is occupied by the , 150 seat Great Hall, where the National Assembly convenes. Formerly rectangular, it was renovated into an amphitheater in 2000. Each seat has a microphone, an automatic voting system, plug socket {{and access to the}} National Assembly's computer network. The chair facing <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall is for the President of the National Assembly. Behind it, a bronze relief of the coat of arms of Slovenia is positioned on the marble wall. The sculptor Marko Pogačnik created the work in 1991 to celebrate independence. There is also a 106-seat gallery for the public and guests to view the Great Hall.|$|E

5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky filled the capital. On the morning of January 30, 1900, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, shots were fired, and Goebel fell wounded. After being denied entrance to the state capitol by armed men, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall and, by a strict party-line vote, adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices. When Democratic legislators attempted to convene to approve the committee's report, they found <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state capitol and other public locations in Frankfort blocked by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify {{the findings of the}} contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Still lying on his sick bed, Goebel took the oath of office.|$|E
5|$|Several props {{and effects}} {{seen in the}} episode were {{reproduced}} from the Star Trek movies, including the shots of Earth and Spacedock One and the painting used of Starfleet Command. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room where dinner is served were later reused from season 2 onwards on the set for Ten-Forward. The episode also features two first appearances; the Ambassador class starship was mentioned {{for the first time}} (the Horatio was a member of this class, as was the Enterprise-C) and it also marks {{the first time that a}} Bolian had been seen on Star Trek, the species having been named after the episode's director. Although the parasites never appeared again on screen in any Star Trek series, they reappear in the Deep Space Nine relaunch novels, where they are revealed to be mutated Trill symbiotes.|$|E
5|$|The Norman invaders of the 11th century {{took the}} city without resistance, {{and by the}} 12th century the walls were ill-maintained and of little {{military}} value. Fears of a French invasion during the Hundred Years' War led to an enquiry into Canterbury's defences in 1363. The decision was taken to restore the city walls and for around the next thirty years the old Roman defences were freshly rebuilt in stone, incorporating the older walls where they still remained. 24 towers were constructed around the circuit, and over the coming years many of the gatehouses were rebuilt in stone and brick, defended {{by some of the}} first batteries of guns in England. Parts of the wall were deliberately damaged by Parliament during the English Civil War of the 17th century and <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's gates burnt; with the restoration of Charles II in 1660, new doors were reinstalled.|$|E

25|$|After two {{previous}} failures, {{voters in the}} city passed a ballot measure in 2000 authorizing a bond measure for {{construction of a new}} library to replace the city's Carnegie library, damaged during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

25|$|Stories tell of a ghost, speculated {{to be that}} of Mary Schenley, that is said to {{roam the}} Ballroom and Nationality Rooms. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rooms are locked every night, but {{furniture}} is sometimes said to be found rearranged by daylight staff. The swinging of the chandelier has been said to indicate her presence.|$|E
25|$|Amid the {{continuing}} {{expansion of the}} school system, the board gave serious consideration to adding a high school. The initial proposal encompassed a spacious building designed for 1,200 students and included an athletic facility with a swimming pool. However, the cost of more than $6.2 million did not appeal to the public. In response, a modified design was submitted, and construction began in June 1965. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new high school opened to students in September 1966.|$|E

25|$|His Sabine {{successor}} Numa was pious and peaceable, and {{credited with}} numerous {{political and religious}} foundations, including the first Roman calendar; the priesthoods of the Salii, flamines, and Vestals; the cults of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus; and the Temple of Janus, whose doors stayed open {{in times of war}} but in Numa's time remained closed. After Numa's death, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Temple of Janus were supposed to have remained open until the reign of Augustus.|$|E
25|$|The {{third floor}} balcony is reached through French doors (framed with slit windows) as well. It {{features}} a low balustrade of turned granite interrupted by pedestals, which {{are decorated with}} variegated marble panels. The placement of the pedestals mimics the pillars and pilasters below. The two bay windows {{on either side of}} the balcony feature the same torches, swag, putti, panels, and molding similar to the rest of the third floor. Above the French doors is a large oval estucheon with fruit-and-drapery swag which mimics the estucheon over <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> loggia. A standing putto over each slit window supports the swag.|$|E
25|$|Three union members—Héctor Escudero Aponte, José Rivera López, and Arnaldo Jiménez Rivera—planned to set several fires {{with the}} {{intention}} of scaring tourists who wanted to stay at the hotel. At around 3:30pm, they placed opened cans of a flammable liquid used in chafing dishes in a storage room filled with newly purchased furniture, adjacent to the ballroom {{on the ground floor of}} the hotel. While some of the labor organizers created a distraction by staging a fight just outside <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ballroom, three men set the fuel alight. The fire ignited the furniture and quickly burned out of control, growing to massive proportions and flashing over.|$|E

25|$|John and Juan hide in {{the animal}} coach of a train. It stops {{to pick up the}} tyrannical Governor Don Jaime, who is fleeing (with a small fortune) from the revolutionary forces {{belonging}} to Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. As the train is ambushed, John, as a test of Juan's loyalty, lets him choose between shooting the Governor and accepting a bribe from him. Juan kills Jaime, also stealing the Governor's spoils. As <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coach open, Juan is greeted by a large crowd and again unexpectedly hailed as a great hero of the revolution, the money taken away by revolutionary General Santerna.|$|E
25|$|In 29 BC, the Roman Senate {{ordered the}} closure of <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Temple of Janus in the Roman Forum {{for the first time}} in over 200 years. Signifying that the Roman state was no longer at war, this act {{reportedly}} pleased Augustus, then in his 5th Consulship, more than all the other honours showered on him. But the closure could not have been less appropriate. As Dio himself points out, there were ongoing major operations against the Treveri in Gaul, and the Cantabri and Astures in Spain. Furthermore, the closure inaugurated nearly half a century of virtually incessant warfare, as a result of which the Roman Empire assumed the borders it would hold, with a few modifications, for its entire history.|$|E
25|$|Porto {{entered the}} 2013–14 {{season with a}} new head coach– Paulo Fonseca, signed from 2012–13 Primeira Liga third-placed Paços de Ferreira– but {{continued}} the trend of the previous four seasons by winning the Supertaça. This title would be {{the highlight of the}} season, as the club underperformed in every other competition it was involved. In the league, Porto led with five points over its pursuers, but a series of compromising results pushed the club down to third place, resulting in the sacking of Fonseca. Failing to overcome the Champions League group stage, Porto reached the Europa League quarter-finals, where they lost 4–1 to the eventual winners Sevilla. In the following weeks, two semi-final losses against Benfica closed <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finals of the Taça de Portugal and Taça da Liga, the latter at home on penalties.|$|E
