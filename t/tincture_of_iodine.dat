5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, {{and direct}} contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as <b>tincture</b> <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{chlorine}} and bromine {{which have}} one significant main use dwarfing all others, iodine {{is used in}} many applications of varying importance. About half of all produced iodine goes into various organoiodine compounds; another 15% remains as the pure element, another 15% is used to form potassium iodide, and another 15% for other inorganic iodine compounds. The remaining 5% is for minor uses. Among the major uses of iodine compounds are catalysts, animal feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation (from <b>tincture</b> <b>of</b> <b>iodine),</b> and photography; minor uses include smog inhibition, cloud seeding, and various uses in analytical chemistry.|$|E

500|$|Some people {{develop a}} {{hypersensitivity}} to products and foods containing iodine. Applications of <b>tincture</b> <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> or Betadine can cause rashes, sometimes severe. [...] use of iodine-based contrast agents (see above) can cause reactions {{ranging from a}} mild rash to fatal anaphylaxis. Such reactions {{have led to the}} misconception (widely held, even among physicians) that some people are allergic to iodine itself; even allergies to iodine-rich seafood have been so construed. In fact, {{there has never been a}} confirmed report of a true iodine allergy, and an allergy to elemental iodine or simple iodide salts is theoretically impossible. Hypersensitivity reactions to products and foods containing iodine are apparently related to their other molecular components; thus, a person who has demonstrated an allergy to one food or product containing iodine may not be have an allergic reaction to another. Patients with various food allergies (shellfish, egg, milk, etc.) or asthma are more likely to suffer reactions to contrast media containing iodine. [...] As with all medications, the patient's allergy history should be questioned and consulted before any containing iodine are administered.|$|E

[...] Appearing after repairs in yellow varnish, it was named The Antiseptic by Handley Page's new test pilot, Edward Petre, after the <b>tincture</b> <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> commonly used on cuts in those days. [...] In the Handley Page factory at Barking, north east London it was often called the Yellow Peril after the current nickname for Gold Flake cigarettes. [...] It flew several times from a rented part of a sports field at Fairlop, six miles north of Barking, before Handley Page decided to concentrate on two-seaters with better sales prospects. [...] Nonetheless, the Type D was the first HandleyPage designed aircraft to fly successfully. [...] In the retrospective redesignations of 1924 the Type D became the H.P.4.|$|E

2500|$|The {{differences}} between <b>Tincture</b> <b>of</b> Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated <b>Tincture</b> <b>of</b> Opium (Paregoric) {{are important and}} {{should be kept in}} mind when administering either of these drugs. Care and caution should always be taken in administering doses <b>of</b> <b>Tincture</b> <b>of</b> Opium, {{such as the use of}} a dosage syringe or other suitable measurement device, and by pharmacists in preparing Paregoric from Laudanum, and to note that the dosages in this article refer to Apothecaries weight and fluid measure. In particular, [...] "the difference between a minim and a drop should be borne in mind when figuring doses. A minim is always a sixtieth part of a fluidrachm regardless of the character of the substance, while a drop varies from a forty-fifth to a two-hundred-and-fiftieth part, according to the surface tension of the fluid." [...] <b>Tincture</b> <b>of</b> Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated <b>Tincture</b> <b>of</b> Opium (Paregoric) each have 50.9 drops per gram; 50.0 drops per cc; 185.0 drops per fluid drachm; and 3.10 drops per minim." [...] The importance of these distinctions is evident in view of the dangers of erroneously relying upon more general descriptions of Apothecaries' fluid measures, which typically list 60 minims per fluid dram, and 8 fluid drams per fluid ounce (480 minims).|$|R
