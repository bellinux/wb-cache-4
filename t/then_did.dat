As the majority of 'Winton's Children' (as they came to be known) were Jewish, it is believed this saved them from certain death had they stayed in Czechoslovakia. As of 2009, the direct descendants of Winton's Children numbered over 5000 people.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast with a closed circulation on August 3. It tracked westward across the tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean and broke into two distinct parts, the northern portion eventually became Hurricane Alberto. The southern portion continued to track westward into the Caribbean Sea, while producing little or no deep convection. The wave reached Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 12, and only <b>then</b> <b>did</b> deep convection redevelop, mostly due to diurnal heating. The wave emerged over the Bay of Campeche early on August 13 as a large area of low pressure. The wave was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five later that day, based on satellite intensity estimates and an observation from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft. Six hours after developing, the depression was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane early on August 16 due to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and little wind shear to inhibit development.|$|E

5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined the tight schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a dimple, something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor <b>then</b> <b>did</b> so.|$|E

On 9 August he encountered the merchantman Wellesley, which {{was on her way}} to the Cape, but after an engagement of about an hour, the British ship succeeded in driving off her attacker.

5|$|Octavius was {{studying}} and undergoing military training in Apollonia, Illyria, when Julius Caesar {{was killed on}} the Ides of March (15 March) 44BC. He rejected the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia and sailed to Italy to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security. Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman law, and so had adopted Octavius, his grand-nephew, making him his primary heir. Mark Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours, though Suetonius describes Antony's accusation as political slander. After landing at Lupiae near Brundisium, Octavius learned the contents of Caesar's will, and only <b>then</b> <b>did</b> he decide to become Caesar's political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May, Paulus, {{on orders}} from Bock, began a general {{offensive}} {{from the area}} of Merefa {{in the north of}} the bulge in an attempt to encircle the remaining Soviet forces in the Izium salient. Only <b>then</b> <b>did</b> Stalin authorize Zhukov to stop the offensive and fend off German flanking forces. However, it was already too late. Quickly, the Germans achieved considerable success against Soviet defensive positions. The 20 May saw more of the same, with the German forces closing in from the rear. More German divisions were committed to the battle that day, shattering several Soviet counterparts, allowing the Germans to press forward. The Luftwaffe also intensified operations over the Donets River to prevent Soviet forces escaping. Ju 87s from StG 77 destroyed five of the main bridges and damaged four more while Ju 88 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3) inflicted heavy losses on retreating motorised and armoured columns.|$|E

5|$|On 22 November Soviet forces {{began to}} cross the Don River and {{continued}} their advance towards the town of Kalach. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, {{were not aware of}} the Soviet offensive until 21 November, and even <b>then</b> <b>did</b> not know in what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach was given to the Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle to approach it and fire on the guards. Soviet forces broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing themselves and the 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army's 4th Mechanized Corps approaching from the south. The encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps.|$|E

Later in the first half, a shot by Emlyn Hughes from outside the penalty area hit the Leeds crossbar. The match was notorious for the fistfight between Bremner and Keegan, who were jointly {{dismissed}} by referee Bob Matthewson after sixty minutes' play. Keegan, who was angry with the decision because he claimed provocation, took off his shirt as he left the field and threw it away. Bremner, several yards behind him, <b>then</b> <b>did</b> the same.

5|$|The {{capture and}} flight tests of Koga's Zero is usually {{described}} as a tremendous coup for the Allies as it revealed the secrets of that mysterious aircraft and led directly to its downfall. According to this viewpoint, only <b>then</b> <b>did</b> Allied pilots learn {{how to deal with}} their nimble opponents. The Japanese could not agree more... Yet those naval pilots who fought the Zero at Coral Sea, Midway, and Guadalcanal without the benefit of test reports would beg to differ with the contention that it took dissection of Koga's Zero to create tactics that beat the fabled airplane. To them the Zero did not long remain a mystery plane. Word quickly circulated among the combat pilots as to its particular attributes. Indeed on 6 October while testing the Zero, Akutan Zero test pilot Frederick M. Trapnell made a highly revealing statement: 'The general impression of the airplane is exactly as originally created by intelligence—including the performance'.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{began her}} service in 1936.

She participated in naval exercises in the Caribbean Sea, and was then reassigned to duty between the West Coast and Hawaii. After a goodwill tour to New Zealand, the ship returned to Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7December 1941, Tucker was berthed at the East Loch in Pearl Harbor undergoing overhaul but sustained no damage. Afterward, Tucker escorted convoys between the West Coast and Hawaii. She <b>then</b> <b>did</b> escort work to American Samoa, the Fiji Islands, New Caledonia, and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides.|$|E
