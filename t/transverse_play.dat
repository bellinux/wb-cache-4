40|$|Abstract. The {{determination}} {{of the structure of}} membrane rafts is a challenging issue in biology. The selection of membrane components both in the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> directions <b>plays</b> a major role as it determines the creation of stable or tunable platforms that host interactions with components of the outer environment. We focus here on the possibility to apply neutron scattering to the study of raft mimics. With this aim, we realized two extreme experimental models for the same complex membrane system (phospholipid: cholesterol: ganglioside GM 1), involving two of the characteristic components of glycolipid-enriched rafts. One consists of a thick stack of tightly packed membranes, mixed and symmetric in composition, deposited on a silicon wafer and analyzed by neutron diffraction. The other consists of a free floating individual membrane, mixed and asymmetric in composition in the two layers, studied by neutron reflection. We present here results on the ganglioside-cholesterol coupling. Ganglioside GM 1 is found to force the redistribution of cholesterol between the two layers of the model membranes. This causes cholesterol exclusion from compositionally symmetric ganglioside-containing membranes, or, alternatively, asymmetric cholesterol enrichment in raft-mimics, where gangliosides reside into the opposite layer. 1...|$|R

When the tilt angle is nonzero, the wave transmission and absorption show an asymmetry under the sign change of the incident angle in a range of the tilt angle, while the reflection is always symmetric. We calculate the reflectance, the transmittance and the absorptance for several configurations of the permittivity tensor and find that resonant absorption is greatly enhanced when the medium from the incident surface to the resonance region is hyperbolic than when it is elliptic.
