40|$|The enzymatic <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>hides</b> in tannery {{processes}} is {{a promising}} technology.

This work describes the study of five proteases, used commercially in tanneries, to assess their ability to act upon collagen and keratin and to determine their unhairing. Results showed that all commercial enzymes tested had more activity on collagen than on keratin. Unhairing was also tested and four out of the five enzymes tested showed some unhairing activity.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to test the potential of a combined water wash and cetylpyridiniumchloride (CPC) treatment as a hide intervention applied to cattle in the holding pens of a processing plant immediately before stunning. Over 2 processing days, 149 control and 139 treated cattle were tested. Control cattle were processed in the normal manner. The treatment group was prewashed with water the day before harvest. Immediately before stunning, these cattle were sprayed twice with 1 % CPC, rst for 3 min, then for 1 min. Hides and preevisceration carcasses were sampled to determine aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts (EBC), and Escherichia coli O 157 prevalence. The treatment reduced the prevalence of E. coli O 157 on hides from 56 % to 34 % and the prevalence on preevisceration carcasses from 23 % to 3 %. The treatment decreased aerobic plate counts from 4. 9 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 to 3. 4 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 and EBC from 3. 1 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 to 2. 0 log CFU/ 100 cm 2 on preevisceration carcasses. The <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>hides</b> {{did not result in}} any detectable CPC contamination of the chilled carcasses. These data indicated that a 1 % CPC treatment preceded by a water wash was capable of reducing hide prevalence of E. coli O 157 from as high as 80 % to less than 50 %, resulting in preevisceration carcass prevalence of 5 % or less. We conclude that water washing followed by an antimicrobial treatment, such as CPC, has great potential as an effective hide intervention step and should be further evaluated for implementation as a processing step after stunning and before hide removal...|$|E

40|$|Tannery {{and timber}} {{treatment}} effluents {{are considered to}} be the major source of Copper (Cu), Chromium (Cr) and Arsenic (As) heavy metal contamination into the environment. Chromium is used in tanneries for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>hides</b> and skins whereas, copper, chromium, and arsenic (CCA) solution is used as the timber treatment chemical. Chromium is used as Cr (III) in tannery industry and as Cr (VI) in timber treatment industry. Arsenic and Cr (VI) which are present in the timber treatment effluent are highly toxic and carcinogenic. An initial survey has indicated that some tannery industries in New Zealand have not developed pre-treatment practices to reduce the heavy metal concentration before discharging the effluent into soil or waterways. The heavy metal pollution due to timber treatment industries may occur from the drips, leaks and spills due to poor handling of CCA solution while treating timber. In this project, the potential value of industrial waste materials, such as Pinus radiata bark, fluidised bed boiler ash (FBA), flue gas desulphurisation gypsum (FGDG) and natural resources, such as zeolite, peat soil, and two soils (Tokomaru and Egmont soils) to reduce heavy metal concentration in tannery and timber treatment effluents was examined. The value of these materials in the remediation of soil contaminated with Cr was examined using a growth experiment. The effect of pre-treatment of Pinus bark with acid, alkali of formaldehyde/acid on the retention of Cr was examined. Pre-treatment of Pinus bark increased the heavy metal retention only at low heavy metal concentration and did not significantly improve the heavy metal retention at high concentration. The extent of adsorption increased with an increase in surface area of Pinus bark material. Speciation of Cr indicated that Cr (VI) is reduced to Cr (III) and adsorbed onto the Pinus bark. FBA was found to be most efficient in reducing the Cr (III) concentration from tannery effluent and As and Cu concentrations in the timber treatment effluent. In the case of Cr (VI), the highest retention was shown by the Pinus bark and the peat soil. The increased retention of Cr (III), Cu and As by FBA was due to the precipitation of Cr (III) as chromium hydroxide, Cu as cupric hydroxide and As as calcium arsenate. A combination of FBA + Pinus bark or FBA + peat soil was efficient in reducing all the three heavy metal (Cu, Cr (VI) and As) concentration from the timber treatment effluent. The effluents contaminated with Cu, Cr and As can be passed through a column containing FBA and Pinus bark or peat soil. A growth experiment using sun flower (Helianthus annus) was set-up to examine the effectiveness of FBA, lime and Pinus bark to immobilise Cr in contaminated soil. FBA and lime amended soils were effective in establishing a normal plant growth of sun flower in Cr (III) contaminated soil even at high Cr (III) levels (3200 mg/kg soil). Incorporation of lime or FBA in Cr (III) contaminated soils causes precipitation of Cr (III) and thereby reduces the bioavailabilty of Cr for plants uptake. Only Pinus bark amended soil was found to be effective in remediating Cr (VI) contaminated soil even at 3200 mg/kg soil. Pinus bark material effectively retained the Cr (VI) present in the soil solution and thus reducing the toxicity and bioavailability of Cr (VI) to plants...|$|E

Despite {{being one of}} the most well-studied model systems for transcriptional regulation, the number of possible loops, and their structures, are unclear.

The method, called vbTPM, is based on a variational Bayes <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> Markov models.

Studying short (about 100 bp) LacI-mediated loops, we are able to resolve states and interconversion patterns that are best explained in terms of at least three distinct loop structures. These results indicate that changes in Lac conformation and DNA binding orientation both contribute to the repertoire of LacI-mediated loops, and provides new input for quantitative models of looping and transcriptional regulation...|$|R

Despite {{being one of}} the best-studied model systems for transcriptional regulation, the number and conformations of loop structures accessible to LacI remain unclear, though the importance of multiple coexisting loops has been implicated in interactions between LacI and other cellular regulators of gene expression. To probe this issue, we have developed a new analysis method for tethered particle motion (TPM), a versatile and commonly-used in vitro single-molecule technique.

Moreover, our results confirm that changes in LacI conformation and DNA binding topology both contribute to the repertoire of LacI-mediated loops formed in vitro, and provide qualitati vely new input for models of looping and transcriptional regulation. We expect vbTPM to be broadly useful for probing complex protein-nucleic acid interactions...|$|R

40|$|Abstracl: Atherosclerotic {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD), primarily manifested as heart anacks and strokes, remains {{the main cause}} of death in the developed counlries and is rapidly increasing in the developing world. Early detection and aggressive <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> (asymptomatic) atherosclerotic plaques that cause heart attack or stroke are most needed. However, existing clinical tools are not sufficient to address this need. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a catheter·based medical imaging tool that is capable of providing cross-sectional images of aneries. It {{is by far the most}} powerful clinical tool available for characterization of atherosclerotic plaques. However, existing IVUS is unable to detect plaque inflammation which is a key factor in complications of atherosclerotic plaques. Contrast enhanced IVUS (CE-IVUS) for detection of Vasa Vasorum (VV), microvessles that feed the vessel wall, can indirecdy image plaque inflammation and thereby significantly increase the diagnostic power of IVUS. Several studies have shown that the density of VV in the atherosclerotic plaques is strongly correlated with the intensity of plaque inflammation and related processes which lead to plaque destabilization and rupture (the Vulnerable Plaque). Therefore the detection and measurement of VV in plaque, and leakage of blood from VV into plaques using CE-IVUS, can enable the development of an index for plaque vulnerability. In this paper, we present a review of our original work on coronary VV imaging, discuss subsequent repons by others, and also present the latest on the detection o...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSynchronous {{programming}} (Berry, 1989) is {{a powerful}} approach to programming reactive systems. Following the idea that “processes are relations extended over time” (Abramsky, 1993), we propose a simple but powerful model for timed, determinate computation, extending the closure-operator model for untimed concurrent constraint programming (CCP). In Saraswatet al. (1994 a) we had proposed a model for this called tcc—here we extend the model of tcc to express strong time-outs: if an eventAdoes not happen through timet, cause eventBto happen at timet. Such constructs arise naturally in practice (e. g. in modeling transistors) and are supported in synchronous programming languages. The fundamental conceptual difficulty posed by these operations {{is that they are}} non-monotonic. We provide compositional semantics to the non-monotonic version of concurrent constraint programming (Default cc) obtained by changing the underlying logic from intuitionistic logic to Reiter's default logic. This allows us to use the same construction (uniform extension through time) to develop Default cc as we had used to develop tcc from cc. Indeed the smooth embedding of cc processes into Default cc processes lifts to a smooth embedding of tcc processes into Default cc processes. We identify a basic set of combinators (that constitute the Default cc programming framework), and provide constructive operational semantics (implemented by us as an interpreter) for which the model is fully abstract. We show that the model is expressive by defining combinators from the synchronous languages. We show that Default cc is compositional and supports the properties of multiform time, orthogonal pre-emption and executable specifications. In addition, Default cc programs can be read as logical formulae (in an intuitionistic temporal logic) —we show that this logic is sound and complete for reasoning about (in) equivalence of Default cc programs. Like the synchronous languages, Default cc programs can be compiled into finite state automata. In addition, the translation can be specified compositionally. This enables separate compilation of Default cc programs and run-time tradeoffs between partial compilation and interpretation. A preliminary version of this paper was published as Saraswatet al. (1995). Here we present a complete <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>hiding,</b> along with a detailed <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the model...|$|R

40|$|The {{leather tanning}} {{industry}} {{is characterized by}} the production of different kinds of effluents, generated in each step of leather processing. These effluents have various chemical compounds which may cause toxicity and endocrine disruption and are thus known as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC).

Currently most high quality leather is "chrome-tanned," produced by <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hide</b> with salts <b>of</b> the mineral chromium.

The highest accuracy rate of PA_DBN for grassland discrimination was 97.41, and the accuracy of PA_DBN decreased when the number <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> layers was more than four layers. Therefore, the accuracy of DBN does not increase as the number <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> layers increases indefinitely.|$|R

This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the tanning <b>of</b> <b>hides</b> and skins industry covers the following activities specified in Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU, namely: -	activities specified in Section 6. 3 : tanning <b>of</b> <b>hides</b> and skins where the treatment capacity exceeds 12 tonnes of finished products per day -	activities specified in Section 6. 11 : independently operated <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> waste water not covered by Directive 91 / 271 /EEC and discharged by an installation undertaking activities covered under Section 6. 3 above. In particular, this document covers the core processes in the tanning <b>of</b> <b>hides</b> and skins and the associated activities; this includes all or any part of the process starting from a raw hide or skin and ending with leather. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the tanning <b>of</b> <b>hides</b> and skins industry are the reduction of emissions to water; efficient usage of energy and water; minimisation, recovery and recycling of process residues; as well as an effective implementation of environmental and energy management systems. The BREF document contains seven chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the tanning <b>of</b> <b>hides</b> and skins industry and on the industrial processes and techniques used within this sector. Chapter 3 provides data and information concerning the environmental performance of installations in terms of current emissions, consumptions of raw materials, water and energy, generation of waste. Chapter 4 describes the techniques to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of installations in the sector. In Chapter 5 the BAT conclusions, as defined in Article 3 (12) of the Directive, are presented for the tanning <b>of</b> <b>hides</b> and skins industry. Chapter 6 and 7 are dedicated to emerging techniques and concluding remarks and recommendations for future work in the sector, respectively. JRC. J. 5 -Sustainable Production and Consumptio...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we apply}} Bayesian neural {{networks}} (BNNs) to time series analysis, and propose a Monte Carlo algorithm for BNN training. In addition, we go {{a step further}} in BNN model selection by putting a prior on network connections instead <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> units as done by other authors. This allows us to treat the selection <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> units and the selection of input variables uniformly. The BNN model is compared to a number of competitors, such as the Box-Jenkins model, bilinear model, threshold autoregressive model, and traditional neural network model, on a number of popular and challenging data sets. Numerical results show that the BNN model has achieved a consistent improvement over the competitors in forecasting future values. Insights on how to improve the generalization ability of BNNs are revealed in many respects of our implementation, such as the selection of input variables, the specification of prior distributions, and the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> outliers...|$|R
