40|$|BACKGROUND: Both {{positive}} smoking outcome expectancies and metacognitions about smoking have <b>been</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> cigarette use and nicotine dependence. The goal of {{this study}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> test a model including nicotine dependence and number of daily cigarettes as dependent variables, anxiety and depression as independent variables, and smoking outcome expectancies and metacognitions about smoking as mediators between the independents and dependents. METHODS: The sample consisted of 524 self-declared smokers who scored 3 or above on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND: Uysal et al., 2004). RESULTS: Anxiety <b>was</b> not <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> either cigarette use or nicotine dependence but <b>was</b> positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all mediators {{with the exception of}} stimulation state enhancement and social facilitation. Depression, on the other hand, <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> nicotine dependence (and very weakly to cigarette use) but <b>was</b> not <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> either smoking outcome expectancies or metacognitions about smoking. Only one smoking outcome expectancy (negative affect reduction) <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> nicotine dependence but not cigarette use. Furthermore one smoking outcome expectancy (negative social impression) <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> cigarette use (but not to nicotine dependence). All metacognitions about smoking <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> nicotine dependence. Moreover, negative metacognitions about uncontrollability <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS: Metacognitions about smoking appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a stronger mediator than smoking outcome expectancies in the relationship between negative affect and cigarette use/nicotine dependence. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Circinus is {{the radiant}} of an annual meteor shower, the Alpha Circinids (ACI).

In 2011, Peter Jenniskens proposed that the debris trail of comet C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth's orbit and generate a meteor outburst coming from a radiant close to Beta Circini.

5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills. The {{average annual}} sunshine totals around 1,600hours. Rainfall tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, {{and a large}} proportion of rain falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 35–60inch (900–1500mm). About 10–20days of snowfall is typical. From November to March, mean wind speeds are highest; winds are lightest from June to August. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.|$|E

Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases have been reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced {{to any of these}} causes.|$|E
