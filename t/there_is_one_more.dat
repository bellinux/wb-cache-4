5|$|I-75 {{continues}} northward through Cheboygan County, {{passing the}} community of Indian River and spanning the river of the same name. North of town, the freeway traverses the area between Burt and Mullett lakes before intersecting {{the southern end of}} M-27; that highway provides access to Topinabee and Cheboygan. I-75 continues northward through tree farms and other agricultural properties in rural Cheboygan County. Cheboygan is accessible by way of interchanges for C-64 and C-66, a pair of county-designated highways in this area. North of C-66, I-75 turns northwesterly. The freeway meets the northern end of US31 and picks up the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) designation before entering Emmet County {{on the south side of}} Mackinaw City. I-75 then parallels the county line on the west side of the village, meeting the northern end of US23. After that interchange, the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT) merges in from the south. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> interchange along the freeway before I-75 ascends the approaches to the Mackinac Bridge.|$|E
5|$|South of the four-level stack {{interchange}} with I-69, I-475 crosses over {{a line of}} the Canadian National Railway. North of this interchange, {{the freeway}} runs more northwesterly as it skirts {{the eastern edge of}} downtown Flint. Near the campus of the University of Michigan-Flint, I-475 curves to run parallel to the Flint River before crossing it next to an industrial area. There is an interchange complex on the northwest side of the river that provides access to Stewart Avenue and M-54 (Dort Highway). I-475 then runs north and northwesterly parallel to a rail line operated by CSX Transportation. North of Carpenter Road, the freeway exits the city of Flint and enters Genesee Township. The Interstate turns to the east to cross into Mount Morris Township before meeting an interchange for Saginaw Street. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> interchange for Clio Road before I-475 terminates at a full interchange with I-75's exit125.|$|E
25|$|Performance Appraisal of IAS {{officers}} {{is measured}} through Performance Appraisal Report (PAR). PAR reports of an officer are reviewed to judge his/her suitability before any posting and/or promotion in the Union and State Governments. The report is an annual one, it is {{initiated by the}} officer himself (designated as the Reporting Officer), who lists out his achievements and completion of activities and targets assigned to him for the year. The report is then modified and commented by the Reviewing Officer, who is the next immediate officer in the hierarchy than the Reporting Officer. For All India Services, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> authority (Accepting Authority) who accepts and reviews the PAR filed by the Reporting Officer, after suggestions from the Reviewing Officers.|$|E

Most of these {{turn out to}} be equivalent either to injectivity or to surjectivity of the transition function of the automaton; however, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> alternative that does not match either of these two definitions. It applies to automata such as the Game of Life that have a quiescent or dead state. In such an automaton, one can define a configuration to be [...] "finite" [...] if it has only finitely many non-quiescent cells, and one can consider the class of automata for which every finite configuration has at least one finite predecessor. This class turns out to be distinct from both the surjective and injective automata, and in some subsequent research, automata with this property have been called invertible finite automata.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} episode, Ash Ketchum, {{a young boy}} from Pallet Town, turns 10 years old and is ready to acquire his first Pokémon. Hopeful to become a Pokémon Master, {{the night before he}} {{receives}} his starter Pokémon (either Squirtle, Charmander or Bulbasaur) he has a dream where he is catching a Pokémon and actually, while sleeping, physically breaks his alarm clock. Ash quickly runs to Professor Oak's lab, where he finds out all the starter Pokémon have been given away. Professor Oak tells Ash <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> Pokémon, a Pikachu. At first, Pikachu largely ignores Ash's requests, shocking him frequently and refusing to be confined to the conventional method of Pokémon transportation, a Poké Ball. However, Ash puts himself in danger to defend Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, then rushes the electric mouse to a Pokémon Center. Through these demonstrations of respect and unconditional commitment to Pokémon, Pikachu warms up to Ash, and their friendship is formed. However, it still refuses to go into its Poké Ball. Soon after, Pikachu shows great power that sets it apart from Pokémon, and other Pikachu, which causes Team Rocket to constantly attempt to capture it in order to win favor from their boss, Giovanni. Only once had Ash almost released Pikachu, and that was in the episode [...] "Pikachu's Goodbye", because Ash thought Pikachu would be happier living in a colony of wild Pikachu, but Pikachu chose him instead. Pikachu also has his very own segment in the first two seasons called [...] "Pikachu's Jukebox", which included songs from 2.B.A. Master.|$|E

2500|$|This proof {{depends on}} a trick known as André's {{reflection}} method, which was originally used in connection with Bertrand's ballot theorem. (The reflection principle has been widely attributed to Désiré André, but his method did not actually use reflections; and the reflection method is a variation due to Aebly and Mirimanoff.) We count the paths which start and end on the diagonal of the n × n grid. All such paths have [...] n rightward and n upward steps. Since we can choose which of the 2n steps are upward (or, equivalently, rightward) ones, there are [...] total monotonic paths of this type. A bad path will cross the main diagonal and touch the next higher (fatal) diagonal (depicted red in the illustration). We flip {{the portion of the}} path occurring after that touch about that fatal diagonal, as illustrated; this geometric operation amounts to interchanging all the rightward and upward steps after that touch. In the section of the path that is not reflected, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> upward step than rightward steps, so the remaining section of the bad path has one more rightward than upward step (because it ends on the main diagonal). When this portion of the path is reflected, it will also have one more upward step than rightward steps. Since there are still 2n steps, there must now be n + 1 upward steps and n - 1 rightward steps. So, instead of reaching the target (n,n), all bad paths (after the portion of the path is reflected) will end in location (n - 1, n + 1). As any monotonic path in the n - 1 × n + 1 grid must meet the fatal diagonal, this reflection process sets up a bijection between the bad paths of the original grid and the monotonic paths of this new grid because the reflection process is reversible. The number of bad paths is therefore, ...|$|E
