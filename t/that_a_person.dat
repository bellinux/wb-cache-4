5|$|Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca {{state in}} Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a {{different}} orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E

Nolad is the Hebrew word for [...] "future," [...] {{but also the}} Hebrew word for birth, so one rabbinic {{interpretation}} of the teaching is <b>that</b> <b>a</b> wise <b>person</b> is one who can foresee the consequences of his/her choices (i.e. can [...] "see the future" [...] that he/she [...] "gives birth" [...] to).|$|R

5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The High Court stated <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who is asserting an infringement {{of a constitutional}} liberty must establish {{that he or she}} has not merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, he or she must be alleging a violation of a fundamental liberty. The Court did not discuss the issue of standing in the context of administrative law.|$|E
5|$|In the case, the Court {{examined}} {{whether it}} could review the executive's discretionary power under sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act ("ISA"). Section 8 empowers the Minister for Home Affairs {{to make an}} order directing <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> be detained without trial if the President is satisfied that detention is necessary to prevent the person from endangering, among other things, the security or public order of Singapore, while section 10 allows the Minister to suspend detention orders and to revoke suspensions {{as he or she}} thinks fit.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> lacks standing, {{there is a}} {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Non-citizens {{detained}} {{under the}} ISA {{do not have}} a right to make representations to an advisory board. They may, within two months from the date of the detention order, make written representations to the Minister. The Minister may, but is not bound to, refer the representations to an advisory board. Any decision on such representations by the Minister is final and cannot be called into question in any court. The burden of proving <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> is a citizen lies on the person claiming to be one, and again the Minister's decision on the matter is final.|$|E
5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be counter-intuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> is experiencing a painful headache.|$|E

5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{is the use}} {{of executive}} power to detain individuals on the basis that they are predicted to commit future crimes that will threaten national interest. Among other things, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act empowers the Minister for Home Affairs, if satisfied <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, to order that he or she be detained for a period not exceeding 12 months if the Minister is of the view that the detention is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E

Susanna wants to be lucky in love the second time; she tries to wean him from his addiction, but he continues in secret. She gives up, disposing of him with a heroin overdose.

5|$|The fact <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> {{prepares a}} weapon in order to defend {{themselves}} against expected attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place.
