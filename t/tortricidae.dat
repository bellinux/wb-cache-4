2500|$|The {{light brown}} apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana, often {{abbreviated}} to LBAM) is a leafroller moth {{belonging to the}} lepidopteran family <b>Tortricidae.</b> [...] The moth was confirmed {{to be present in}} mainland United States in 2007, principally along the West Coast. The State of California and the US Department of Agriculture quickly imposed quarantine measures and decided to use aerial spraying of cities with pesticides to try to eradicate the moth. [...] This led to substantial public controversy and claims of adverse health effects. [...] Aerial spraying was discontinued in 2008. [...] Trapping, monitoring, and inspection efforts were reduced or eliminated in 2012 due to budget problems.|$|E
