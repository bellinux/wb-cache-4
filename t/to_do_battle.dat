5|$|Muhammad's first {{interaction}} {{with the people of}} Bahrain was the Al Kudr Invasion. Muhammad ordered a surprise attack on the Banu Salim tribe for allegedly plotting to attack Medina. He had received news that some tribes were assembling an army on Bahrain and preparing to attack the mainland. But the tribesmen retreated when they learned Muhammad was leading an army <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle</b> with them.|$|E
5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, behind their lines. Theoretically the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of supply and communication was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation was compounded by bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick turned back and prepared <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game's plot – {{minimally}} expounded in {{the manual}} – concerns soldiers partaking in a Middle Eastern conflict (which forms the game's early levels) abducted by aliens <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle</b> on an alien world (which forms the later levels). During {{the process of}} space travel, the aliens send the soldiers to various times and places, resulting in the intervening medieval and Chicago settings.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle</b> with {{an enemy}} {{expected}} to muster {{four or five}} carriers, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, needed every available U.S. flight deck. He already had Vice Admiral William Halsey's two-carrier (Enterprise and Hornet) task force at hand, though Halsey was stricken with severe dermatitis {{and had to be}} replaced by Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Halsey's escort commander. Nimitz also hurriedly recalled Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's task force, including the carrier Yorktown, from the South West Pacific Area.|$|E
5|$|Missions are tasks {{undertaken}} by a clan. There are {{four types of}} missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular missions, Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle.</b> Many of these missions are used to advance the story. In encounter missions, Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In dispatch missions, which do not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area missions are usually a dispatch mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.|$|E
5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players would have been able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle,</b> like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E
50|$|Kerry 3-19 : 2-7 Cork (August 25, 2002 at Croke Park) - An {{historic}} {{game in a}} rivalry {{that has}} been littered with historic games. While Cork and Kerry had been used <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>battle</b> in Cork or Killarney, {{this was the first}} time that the sides had met in Croke Park, the headquarters of the GAA. Cork had earlier defeated Kerry after a replay before taking the Munster title after a replay as well. This game, in spite of all its promise, was a rout. Kerry trounced Cork by fifteen points.|$|R

5|$|Lord Howe's fleet {{was delayed}} departing New York by {{contrary}} winds, and he arrived off Point Judith on 9 August. Since d'Estaing's fleet outnumbered Howe's, the French admiral, fearful that Howe would be further reinforced and eventually gain a numerical advantage, reboarded the French troops, and sailed out <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle</b> with Howe on 10 August. As the two fleets prepared to battle and manoeuvreered for position, the weather deteriorated, {{and a major}} storm broke out. Raging for two days, the storm scattered both fleets, severely damaging the French flagship. It also frustrated plans by Sullivan to attack Newport without French support on 11 August. While Sullivan awaited {{the return of the}} French fleet, he began siege operations, moving closer to the British lines on 15 August and opening trenches to the northeast of the fortified British line north of Newport the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Messians {{instruct}} the hero {{to use the}} Seven Pillars of Solomon, collected during his travels, at ground zero of the missile attacks in order to open a gateway to the demon world of Atziluth and defeat the demons once and for all. Once in the demon world, the heroes travel through several areas and defeat the ruling demon overlords. If the heroes are carrying Bael with them, they can choose to restore him into his true form, the god Baal. The god Izanagi also asks the heroes to rescue the goddess Izanami, who has been killed by the demons. After defeating all the overlords and managing to revive Izanami, the gods help the heroes travel to Lucifer's castle. If Bael has been restored into Baal, Lucifer explains that the demons are actually ancient gods cast into hell by the One True God, who is using the party to defeat his enemies, destroy both worlds and create a paradise where mankind will be under his rule forever. Lucifer offers to help the player prevent God's plans, and claims that Satan, {{who was responsible for}} the nuclear war, must be dealt with. The heroes then travel back to the human world to confront Satan. If they did not accept Lucifer's help and killed him instead, they defeat Satan and are then transported before God, who turns them into new deities and creates the Millennial Kingdom. If Lucifer is in their party, they have the chance <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle</b> with God. After defeating the god, he warns them that he will revive in time, and that without his help they have chosen a difficult path. Lucifer then returns to Atziluth with all the demons, sealing the rift between worlds and leaving humans to rebuild and recover from the war on their own.|$|E

25|$|In 1683 {{the pirate}} Lorencillo with 800 men {{attacked}} Veracruz. Insufficiently garrisoned, the port fell.

25|$|Don Alejandro de la Vega (portrayed by George J. Lewis) is a hot-tempered cattle baron (or ranchero) with {{a strong}} sense of {{morality}} and fair play. His cattle and land holdings are said to be among the richest in California, which helps to make Don Alejandro an influential community leader. His impetuous nature often gets him into trouble, however, as he seeks <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle</b> himself, sometimes getting fooled and manipulated along the way. Don Alejandro eventually learns of his son's identity, and is strongly in favor of Zorro's work continuing.|$|E
25|$|He {{claimed they}} were warriors who went down into hell <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle</b> with witches and demons.

Thiess was ultimately sentenced to ten lashes for Idolatry and superstitious belief.|$|E

50|$|The series {{received}} negative reviews by {{the critics}} and fans. It holds a 5.2/10 rating at the Internet Movie Database. It was heavily criticized for its complimentary toy line. Each {{member of the}} Avengers wore special battle armors that weren't used in the show. This was due because producers of the show wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> different <b>battle</b> armors rather than using the Avengers' regular battle armors. However, TV.com was more positive, with a 7.3/10 rating.|$|R
25|$|In 426 BC, Athens sent {{an army of}} 2,000 men led by Nicias to raid the Melian countryside, but the Melians refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle</b> and the Athenians {{were not}} willing to mount a siege. In 425 or 424 BC, Athens {{formally}} demanded of Melos a tribute of fifteen talents of silver (roughly 390kg). This sum could have paid the wages of a trireme crew for 15 months, or bought 540 metric tons of wheat, enough to feed 2,160 men for a year. Only the islands of Paros and Thasos were assessed for more at 30 and 60 talents respectively.|$|E

25|$|Although {{he replied}} to Hulagu's demands {{in a manner}} that the Mongol {{commander}} found menacing and offensive enough to break off further negotiation, Al-Musta'sim neglected to summon armies to reinforce the troops at his disposal in Baghdad.

Al-Musta'sim finally decided <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>battle</b> with them and sent out a force of 20,000 cavalry to attack the Mongols. The cavalry were decisively defeated by the Mongols, whose sappers breached dikes along the Tigris River and flooded the ground behind the Abbasid forces, trapping them.|$|E
