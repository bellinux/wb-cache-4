40|$|Introduction: A gene {{tree for}} a gene family is often {{discordant}} with the containing <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> {{because of its}} complex evolutionary course during which gene duplication, gene loss and incomplete lineage sorting events might occur. Hence, it is of great challenge to infer the containing <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> from a set of gene trees. One common approach to this inference problem is through gene <b>tree</b> and <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> reconciliation. Results: In this paper, we generalize the traditional least common ancestor (LCA) reconciliation to define a reconciliation between a gene <b>tree</b> and <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> under the tree homomorphism framework. We then study the structural properties of the space of all reconciliations between a gene <b>tree</b> and a <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> {{in terms of the}} gene duplication, gene loss or deep coalescence costs. As application, we show that the LCA reconciliation is the unique one that has the minimum deep coalescence cost, provide a novel characterization of the reconciliations with the optimal duplication cost, and present efficient algorithms for enumerating (nearly-) optimal reconciliations with respect to each cost. Conclusions: This work provides a new graph-theoretic framework for studying gene <b>tree</b> and <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> reconciliations...|$|R

Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the amber-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the mushrooms are considered edible, they are generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes.

Many ant-dispersed seeds have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food.|$|E
40|$|A labeled gene tree {{topology}} that disagrees with a labeled <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> topology {{is said to}} be anomalous if it is more probable under a coalescent model for gene lineage evolution than the labeled gene {{tree topology}} that matches the <b>species</b> <b>tree.</b> It has previously been shown that as a consequence of short internal branches of the <b>species</b> <b>tree,</b> for every labeled <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> topology with five ormore taxa, and for asymmetric four-taxon <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> topologies, an assignment of <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> branch lengths can be made which gives rise to anomalous gene trees (AGTs).

The reformulation and alternative proof of the existence result for AGTs provide the insight that it is not merely short internal branches that generate AGTs, but instead, short internal branches that are arranged consecutively.

40|$|Coalescent {{histories}} are combinatorial {{structures that}} describe {{for a given}} gene <b>tree</b> and <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> the possible lists of branches of the <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> on which the gene tree coalescences take place. Properties {{of the number of}} coalescent histories for gene <b>trees</b> and <b>species</b> <b>trees</b> affect a variety of probabilistic calculations in mathematical phylogenetics. Exact and asymptotic evaluations of the number of coalescent histories, however, are known only in a limited number of cases. Here we introduce a particular family of <b>species</b> <b>trees,</b> the lodgepole <b>species</b> <b>trees</b> (λ_n) _n≥ 0, in which tree λ_n has m= 2 n+ 1 taxa.

Further, it provides a substantial improvement on the lower bound for the ratio of the largest number of matching coalescent histories to the smallest number of matching coalescent histories for trees with m taxa, increasing a previous bound of (√(π) / 32) [(5 m- 12) /(4 m- 6) ] m √(m) to [√(m- 1) /(4 √(e)) ]^m.

40|$|This paper studies various {{properties}} of the least common ancestors mapping, the duplication and mutation costs, and the complexity of finding a <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> from gene trees. 1 Introduction Since DNA sequences have become easier to obtain, emphasis {{has been placed on}} constructing gene trees and from these, reconstructing evolutionary <b>trees</b> for <b>species</b> (called <b>species</b> <b>trees)</b> in the evolutionary biology([8, 18, 6]). The current strategy for reconstructing <b>species</b> <b>trees</b> is based on the separate consideration of distinct gene families represented by homologous sequences. The homologous sequences are assumed to evolve {{in the same way as}} species. However, because of the presence of paralogy, sorting of ancestral polymorphism and horizontal transfer, gene <b>trees</b> and <b>species</b> <b>trees</b> are often inconsistent([19, 23, 26, 28]). Hence, a major problem that arises is how to reconcile different, sometimes contradictory, gene <b>trees</b> into a <b>species</b> tree([7]).

40|$|<b>Species</b> <b>trees</b> are an {{essential}} tool in conservation and evolutionary biology. In phylogenomics, {{not only is}} data choice (e. g. using unlinked orthologs rather than paralogs) an important systematic consideration, but the choice of phylogenetic algorithm is also important. Since individual gene phylogenies can differ from the true species phylogeny, new methods have been proposed for <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> estimation using multiple unlinked genes. Improvements in genome sequencing technologies have increased the amount of data available to researchers and this has increased the utility of multi-locus <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> inference methods. The Bayesian methods BEST and *BEAST that incorporate a coalescent model to account for gene <b>tree</b> and <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> conflict offer promising advances in <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> inference directly from DNA sequences. Methods that infer <b>species</b> <b>trees</b> from gene trees rather than directly from sequence data such as STAR, STEAC, NJst and the likelihood method STEM have been recently developed as computationally efficient alternatives. Bayesian concordance analysis, which {{has been shown to}} perform well when horizontal gene transfer is the cause of gene <b>tree</b> and <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> conflict, is also discussed. Furthermore, methods for species delimitation including a non-parametric <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> inference method that does not require a priori species assignments can remove subjectivity from species delimitation. Here, I review the assumptions, required inputs, and the performance of these methods under simulation and in recent empirical studies. Researchers in many disciplines should understand the methods available for phylogenomic <b>species</b> <b>tree</b> inference in order to enhance evolutionary and conservation studies...|$|R

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal <b>tree</b> <b>species.</b> An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus.
