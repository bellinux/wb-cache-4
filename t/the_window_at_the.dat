5|$|The {{window in}} the centre north wall has two lights (sections of window {{separated}} by a mullion); there are two pairs of two-light windows in the south wall. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> east end {{had a pair of}} lights, topped by trefoils (a stonework pattern of three overlapping circles).|$|E
5|$|The royal arms of CharlesII are in {{the north}} aisle. During the 1852 {{restoration}} whitewash {{was removed from the}} walls, revealing the royal arms of HenryVII, and paintings which include one of The Blessed Virgin knighting St George. Stained glass in the west windows of both aisles dates from around 1500. Other glass comes from the Victorian era. This includes the east window from about 1858, and <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> east end of the north aisle from about 1861, both by William Warrington, and the east window in the south aisle from about 1872 by Ward and Hughes. The two westernmost windows in the south aisle are by O'Connor and dated 1871. There are later windows from 1920 in the south wall of the Lady Chapel. In the north aisle is a small part of an Anglo-Saxon circular cross-shaft carved with interlace decoration dating from the late 10th or the 11thcentury.|$|E

5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the east window, dated 1856, was made by William Wailes. The glass in a south window in the chancel of 1909 was made by Morris & Co. The east window in the north aisle, dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop. The stained glass window {{to the left of}} the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill. The stained glass in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> west end of the north aisle is to the memory of the wife of Edward John Bell, rector from 1870 to 1907, and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877. The tower holds a ring of six bells, hung for change ringing, five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1847. A seventh, unused, bell dates from 1686 and has been noted as being of {{historical}} importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England. The parish registers begin in 1629, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1612.|$|E
25|$|In Chapter 25, Lamb meets {{a little}} girl with her broken leg in a cast who spends the day looking out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> neighbours, whom she has given fanciful {{descriptive}} names. The inspiration for this plot device is possibly Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, Rear Window, a nod to a classic. In the same chapter, the little girl refers to a neighbour called Miss Bulstrode, though {{it seems unlikely that}} the character is the same Miss Bulstrode from Cat Among the Pigeons.|$|E

After watching performers through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local radio station, she asked WINC disc jockey and talent coordinator Jimmy McCoy if she could sing on his show. Her performance in 1947 was well received, and she was asked back. This led to appearances at local nightclubs, wearing fringed Western outfits her mother made from Patsy's designs.|$|E

The decoration of the narthex is subordinated to the artistic features of the main temple, which shows especially clearly in ornamental carving. The western portal has, like that of Geghard narthex, a stepped framing which includes the window above.

25|$|During {{her time}} working at Castelli Gallery, Lawler was making paintings, artist’s books, prints, and {{photographs}} of her own. But when she landed her first official gallery exhibition, in 1978 at Artists Space, she did not exhibit any of that work. Instead, she borrowed a small 1883 portrait of a horse from Aqueduct Racetrack — it had been hanging over a Xerox machine in the offices — and mounted it on an empty wall at the gallery. To highlight her appropriation, she installed two spotlights: one above the picture and another pointed out <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> building next door, hinting to sidewalk passersby {{that there was something}} of note going on upstairs.|$|E

However, Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part, so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works. Morgan was astounded by Sawa's performance in Idle Hands, and Sawa was hired.|$|E

500|$|The {{windows in}} the north and south walls are set in square frames, and are either two or three lights (sections of window {{separated}} by mullions) decorated with tracery at the top; they date from Kennedy's work in 1868. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eastern end of the south wall has three lights with tracery, set in a pointed arch frame with a plain hoodmould around it. [...] The two windows at the west end have single lights topped with tracery; the windows at the east end have three lights, tracery and hoodmoulds. Five of the windows, including the main east window, have stained glass by the London artist E. R. Suffling; the east window in the north aisle, by C. A. Gibbs (1849) depicts the Good Samaritan.|$|E

A train departing for [...] was in a side-long collision with a train arriving, across its path, from [...] and, although the collision occurred at low speed, part of the Plumstead service was derailed {{and one of its}} carriages overturned. The driver of the Plumstead service was blamed for a failure to observe, and a misreading of, signals which took his train into the path of the Hastings-bound service. An investigation found the man who died was likely leaning out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment his carriage overturned, and he might have avoided serious injury had he been seated.|$|E
500|$|Hardy's {{opinion was}} that, [...] "if only {{it had an}} open timber roof instead of the plain ceiling, {{it would be one}} of the most picturesque College Libraries".

500|$|The {{rectangular}} church, {{which has}} been described as [...] "tiny", is said by the Diocese of Bangor to be the second-smallest church in Anglesey. The nave and chancel (which are not divided) measure together 34feet 9inches by 14feet (about 10.6m by 4.3m). The church is constructed of rubble masonry, dressed with freestone and with a foundation of boulders. The roof, which has a bellcote at the west end, is made of slate; the roof timbers can be seen from inside. [...] The only bell, which is dated 1747, is decorated with a vine scroll. The door to the church is on the north side through a porch; the doorway to the porch has a rounded head and a 15th-century style doorjamb, but the porch itself is more modern. The windows in the nave (one in the north wall, one in the west wall and two in the south wall) have rounded tops. [...] <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> east end of the church, which dates from the late 16th century, is rectangular with three arched lights (vertical sections) set in a square frame. The lights are separated by mullions and there is an external hoodmould above the window.|$|E
500|$|In 1900, Gates won $600,000 on a $70,000 bet on a {{horse race}} in England, exaggerated at over $1 million, which conferred on him the {{nickname}} [...] "Bet-A-Million". The Waldorf's Oscar Tschirky recalled that Gates {{did not like the}} nickname, but did little to repudiate the claims as he would bet on practically everything. Oscar recalled a rainy afternoon in the Waldorf's Oak Room as Gates and two associates watched raindrops trickle down the windows. Gates remarked that the drops did not move down <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same speed. [...] One of Gates' associates spotted two raindrops that were moving at the same rate and pointed them out to him. [...] Gates selected a raindrop and bet his associate that it would reach the bottom of the window first. [...] His associate took him up on the bet and before Gates' raindrop had won the race, the bets had changed from hundreds of dollars to thousands. Gates believed that all life was a gamble; a farmer gambled that he would have a successful harvest when planting crops, a merchant gambled that customers would buy items when ordering stock and a traveler gambled on arriving safely when setting out on a journey.|$|E
