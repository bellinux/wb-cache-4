5|$|A {{ghost in}} the form of a lady in white is said <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the Julian staircase, located in the Victorian part of the house.

Sir Julian died in 1896, and Somerhill passed to Sir Osmond d'Avigdor-Goldsmid.|$|E
5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E

5|$|Frederick of Prussia's {{invasion}} of Saxony in August 1756 began a Third Silesian War and sparked the wider Seven Years' War.

5|$|One notorious tengu {{from the}} 12th century was himself {{the ghost of}} an emperor.

According to legend he died in torment, having sworn <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the nation of Japan as a great demon, and thus became a fearsome tengu with long nails and eyes like a kite's.|$|E

5|$|A blocked {{field goal}} and extra-point attempt {{provided}} {{the margin of}} victory for the Miami Dolphins. Ex-Dolphin receiver Morris Owens came back <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> his old team with three touchdown catches. Starting quarterback Parnell Dickinson threw the first, then was replaced by recently acquired quarterback Terry Hanratty after injuring his ankle. When Hanratty proved ineffective, Steve Spurrier, who had not practiced during the week due to a swollen knee, came off the bench to throw the final two touchdowns. It took a final-minute, 55-yard Garo Yepremian field goal to clinch the game for the Dolphins, whose pass defense had been decimated by injuries. 192 of the Buccaneers’ 334 total yards came through the air. John McKay would later point to this game as {{the high point of}} the Buccaneers’ season. Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti saw it differently, calling the narrow victory “a disgrace” and “the low point in Miami Dolphins’ history”.|$|E
5|$|Bramshill {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} most haunted houses in England. According to one UK police officer who worked at the college, 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified, {{although}} another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously. They include a Grey Lady (one story suggests that her husband, a religious dissenter, was beheaded in the 17th century) and a Green Man (a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806, according to the journalist P. Lal, or threw himself off a cliff near Brighton, according to the author Penny Legg). The Green Man, dressed as his name suggests, reportedly manifests near the lake, as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there. The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace, the library, and the chapel. Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance, with a sad, tear-stained face and golden hair, and smelling of the lilies of the valley; Lal argues that she has reddish-brown hair and wears a grey, sleeveless robe. The Grey Lady's husband has been reported <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the stables and the chapel drawing room. The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room; the child has supposedly been heard crying, and attempts to hold visitors' hands. Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child's mother. A lady dressed in the style of Queen Anne, and a knight in armour, are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room. The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th-century dress, and by that of a nun. A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb, reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train, has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house. A small boy documented <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Of {{all these}} fragmentary pre-Hellenistic sources, {{the most is}} known of Sophocles Troilos. Even so, only 54 words have been {{identified}} as coming from the play. Fragment 619 refers to Troilus as an andropais, a man-boy. Fragment 621 indicates that Troilus was going to a spring with a companion to fetch water or to water his horses. A scholion to the Iliad states that Sophocles has Troilus ambushed by Achilles while exercising his horses in the Thymbra. Fragment 623 indicates that Achilles mutilated Troilus' corpse by a method known as maschalismos. This involved preventing the ghost of a murder victim from returning <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> their killer by cutting off the corpse's extremities and stringing them under its armpits. Sophocles is thought to have also referred to the maschalismos of Troilus in a fragment taken to be from an earlier play Polyxene.|$|E
50|$|The {{village is}} also rumoured <b>to</b> be <b>haunted</b> by several ghosts. The gates of Hockwold Hall, a large manor house and estate, are said <b>to</b> be <b>haunted</b> by the White Lady, {{a cause of}} {{distraction}} to many drivers on {{their way through the}} village, while the Little Ouse River that runs past the village is rumoured <b>to</b> be <b>haunted</b> by a group of nuns and a horseman.|$|R

5|$|On July 2, 1905, President Roosevelt further {{consolidated}} {{power in}} Panama by appointing Magoon Minister to Panama, to replace John Barrett. This put Magoon in the unique {{position of being}} both a governor of a U.S. territory and a diplomat to the country of which that territory was an enclave. During the tenure of Governor Davis, there had been friction between him and Minister Barrett. This double appointment would ensure that the two roles could not work at cross-purposes. Magoon would draw two salaries in the arrangement, an issue which would come up later <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> him. With influential posts in both Panama proper and the Canal Zone, Magoon was an exceptionally powerful man on the Isthmus.|$|E
5|$|The United States Capitol is {{considered}} one of the most haunted buildings in Washington. The first apparition to be seen there was in the 1860s as the Capitol was being completed. Several spirits are said <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the Capitol due to tragedies associated with its construction. One such ghost is said to be that of a worker who died after a fall during the construction of the rotunda, and who now is occasionally seen floating beneath the dome carrying a tray of woodworking tools. Another spirit is allegedly a stonemason who died (crushed to death beneath a wall which collapsed, or murdered by a co-worker) and is seen in the Old Senate chambers or passing through a wall in the basement beneath the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The usual grave for a thrall was {{probably}} {{not much more than}} a hole in the ground. He {{was probably}} buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg Ship burial, which was for a woman (probably a queen or a priestess) who lived in the 9th century.|$|E

5|$|While these {{specific}} failings came back <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the Empire in subsequent decades, {{perhaps the greatest}} weakness of the Peace of Augsburg was its failure {{to take into account}} the growing diversity of religious expression emerging in the evangelical (Lutheran) and Reformed traditions. Other confessions had acquired popular, if not legal, legitimacy in the intervening decades and by 1555, the reforms proposed by Luther were no longer the only possibilities of religious expression: Anabaptists, such as the Frisian Menno Simons (1492–1559) and his followers; the followers of John Calvin, who were particularly strong in the southwest and the northwest; and the followers of Huldrych Zwingli were excluded from considerations and protections under the Peace of Augsburg. According to the Augsburg agreement, their religious beliefs remained heretical.|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, his reputation for controversy continued <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> him when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench to warm up. Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E
5|$|Bramshill {{appears to}} have been a local {{sporting}} and social venue since the 16th century. The cricket ground at the house played host to a first-class match in 1823 when an early Hampshire team played an England XI, and it hosted three other matches in 1825–26. During the Second World War, the mansion was used as a Red Cross maternity home, before becoming the residence of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania for a number of years. It became the location of the Police Staff College in 1960, and was later home to the European Police College. As a result, many campus buildings have been added to the estate. Owing to escalating maintenance costs the property was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014. Among the 14 ghosts reputed <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the house is that of a bride who accidentally locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later.|$|E

5|$|Capitol Hill {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and most densely {{populated}} neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. It is bounded by F Street NE on the north and Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. The U.S. Capitol marks its western boundary, while the Anacostia River is its eastern limit. Although Capitol Hill has been home to many of the city's powerful, its hauntings appear to be few. One ghost, however, is said <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> First Street NE. Joseph Holt was Judge Advocate General of the United States Army from 1862 to 1875. He presided over the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators. During the trials, accused conspirators Dr. Samuel Mudd (who treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg) and Mary Surratt (at whose downtown boarding house the conspirators met) were held at the Old Capitol Prison opposite the U.S. Capitol (the modern day United States Supreme Court Building stands on the site today). After Holt retired, he allegedly became a recluse in his Capitol Hill home. Although the Holt house no longer exists, local residents have told stories of Holt's ghost walking down First Street NE in a blue suit and cape, pondering the guilt of Mudd and Surrat as he heads for the site of the Old Capitol Prison.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the invasion, the Athenians began rebuilding their city under the guidance of Themistocles. They wished to restore the fortifications of Athens, but the Spartans objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the Persians could use as a fortress. Themistocles urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to Sparta as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the Spartans. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged them to send emissaries to Athens to see for themselves. By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications. By delaying in this manner, Themistocles gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the city, and thus ward off any Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification of Athens. Furthermore, the Spartans were obliged to repatriate Themistocles in order to free their own ambassadors. However, this episode may be seen as the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of Themistocles, which would return <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Thalaba {{travels to}} the land of Aloadin, who owns a great garden paradise, and he is invited to feast with the people, but he is unwilling to imbibe alcohol or be taken in by the dancing women that seek to entice him. The temptations {{overwhelm}} him {{to the point where he}} can no longer tolerate them and he flees. Shortly after leaving, he discovers one of the women being attacked by a man wanting to have his way with her. It is revealed that the woman was Oneiza, who was captured, and that Aloadin was a sorcerer. After saving Oneiza, Thalaba is determined to stop the sorcerer and he ends up killing him. Following this, they are praised by a Sultan that Aloadin wanted to kill, and Thalaba decides to marry Oneiza. Before they can finish their marriage, she dies and Thalaba is left to mourn over her grave. While mourning, a spirit that appears to be Oneiza begins <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> Thalaba and claim that God disapproves of the young warrior. However, Moath comes and is able to recognise the spirit as a vampire. After killing the vampire, the real Oneiza comes to guide Thalaba onwards.|$|E
