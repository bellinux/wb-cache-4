5|$|Also in 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood {{directors}} and writers, the Hollywood Ten, intending <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for contempt of Congress. The ACLU supported the appeals {{of several of}} the artists, but lost on appeal. The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a blacklist which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist, but those challenges failed. The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report The Judges and the Judged, prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress Jean Muir, described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.|$|E

Later, however, Wendy and Ron break up after she announces she is moving back to Canada. Meanwhile, Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the parks department throw a party for the Pawnee police department, where they hope <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> provide security for the upcoming Harvest Festival. During the party, Ben (Adam Scott) awkwardly fails to get Chief Trumple's (Eric Pierpoint) favor. Tom, unaware of Ron and Wendy's breakup, arrives at the party with Tammy to make him jealous. After bickering loudly, Ron and Tammy both decide to leave the party together to talk and try to make amends. However, a night filled with drunken sex and mayhem ensues, ending with the two getting remarried and ending up in jail.|$|E

25|$|The left-wing faction led by Delchev, on {{the other}} hand, warned against the risks of such {{unrealistic}} plans, opposing the uprising as inappropriate as tactics and premature by time. Deltchev, who was {{under the influence of}} the leading Bulgarian anarchists as Mihail Gerdzhikov and Varban Kilifarski personally supported the tactics of terrorist attacks as the Thessaloniki bombings of 1903. Finally, he had no choice but agree to that course of action at least managing to delay its start from May to August. Delchev also convinced the SMARO leadership to transform its idea of a mass rising involving the civil population into a rising based on guerrilla warfare. Towards the end of March 1903 Gotse with his detachment destroyed the railway bridge over the Angista river, aiming to test the new guerrilla tactics. Following that he set out for Salonica to meet with Dame Gruev after his release from prison in March 1903. Dame Gruev met with Delchev in the late April and they discussed the decision of starting the uprising. Afterwards they negotiated with some of the Salonica bombers <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> give up the attacks as dangerous to the liberation movement, or at least to wait for the impending uprising. Subsequently, Delchev met also with Ivan Garvanov, who was at that time the leader of the SMARO. After this meetings Delchev headed for Mount Ali Botush where he was expected to meet with representatives from the Seres Revolutionary District detachments and to check their military preparation. But he never made it.|$|E

500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, she opened her bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> call 9-1-1.

500|$|On {{the day of}} the Japanese release, Nintendo of America sent cease and desist {{letters to}} two English {{language}} Pokémon fansites, PokéBeach and Serebii, after they published screenshots and various other media from the newly released games. Nintendo claimed the posting of the media was infringing copyright and noted their intention to shut down the websites under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act unless the media was removed. The screenshots were subsequently taken down from both websites. Luke Plunkett of video game blog Kotaku initially speculated that Nintendo of America issued the cease and desist letters over the belief that the images were illegally obtained via a ROM image; however, Jon Sahagian of PokéBeach stated the images in question had been obtained from the Japanese forum 2channel. Charlie Scibetta, Nintendo of America's senior director of corporate communications, later stated that it was the choice of images that were of concern to the company. In a statement to Kotaku, he said, [...] "Nintendo supports and appreciates the efforts that Pokémon fans go through to create fan sites.

500|$|In {{seeking to}} find who had {{set fire to}} the Farrar–Green home, {{investigators}} looked first for physical evidence of fire-setting upon those {{who had been in the}} house. They suspected that because of the use of accelerant, the fire may have flashed over at the point of ignition and singed or burned the setter. Accordingly, they tested clothing worn by both Farrar and Green that night and took samples of the hair of both. Neither Green's nor Farrar's clothing showed evidence of having been in contact with accelerant; Farrar's hair showed no singeing, but Green's—which had been cut twice between the time of the fire and the time the police took hair samples from her—showed [...] "significant singeing". Detectives recalled that Green had denied ever having been in close proximity to flames; she had reported leaving the house after seeing smoke and not coming into contact with the fire either on the deck outside her bedroom or in the process of coaxing Kate off the garage roof. Neighbors of the family reported that when Green had come to their door <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> call for help, her hair had been wet. Though their suspicions pointed to Debora Green, investigators continued to receive tips attributing the fire to any number of people and the investigation continued with no public statement about suspects.|$|E
500|$|Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, and Yeardley Smith {{all began}} voicing their {{characters}} on The Tracey Ullman Show. Nancy Cartwright {{was the only}} one of the group who had been trained to be a voice actor while Castellaneta had done some voice over work in Chicago. Castellaneta and Kavner had been part of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more actors. The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Yeardley Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled, [...] "I always sounded too much like a girl. I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'" [...] Smith was given the role of Lisa instead. On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of Lisa. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the [...] "middle child" [...] and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart who she found more fascinating because he was described as [...] "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [...] clever." [...] Matt Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, German {{paleontologist}} Friedrich von Huene new genus for Cetiosaurus leedsi and its specimens BMNH R.1984–1988 and BMNH R.3078, Cetiosauriscus, after identifying sufficient {{differences from}} the former genus. He based his new name off Cetiosaurus ("whale lizard") by adding the Latin suffix iscus, meaning [...] "like", translating fully to [...] "whale lizard like". In 1939 Huene also moved [...] "Ornithopsis" [...] greppini, a species from Switzerland, to Cetiosauriscus, creating the new combination [...] "Cetiosauriscus" [...] greppini. In 1980 Alan J. Charig concluded that {{due to lack of}} comparable bones, BMNH R.3078 could not be assigned to the same taxon as BMNH R1984–1988, and created a new species for the former: Cetiosauriscus stewarti. The specific name was chosen to honour Sir Ronald Stewart, the chairman of the London Brick Company, which owned the clay pit the fossils had been found in. Furthermore, Charig considered both C. leedsi and [...] "C." [...] greppini nomina dubia, and C. stewarti valid. In 1993, Charig decided to send a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> change the type species of Cetiosauriscus from the dubious C. leedsi, to the taxonomically stable C. stewarti. This was accepted by the ICZN in 1995, making BMNH R.3078, the holotype of C. stewarti, the basis for Cetiosauriscus. C. stewarti is senior synonym in partim of Ornithopsis leedsi (=Cetiosauriscus leedsi; Cetiosaurus leedsi), as its holotype was once referred to this taxon.|$|E

500|$|West Indies' loss of form {{continued}} in late 1997 when they lost every international match during their tour of Pakistan. Ambrose played in {{two out of}} West Indies' three matches in an ODI tournament, taking one wicket, but his performance in taking one wicket in the two Test matches he played—he missed the third match with injury—prompted Fazeer Mohammed, writing in Wisden, to describe Ambrose as [...] "a shadow of his former self". Any danger that Ambrose might have retired after this series was forestalled when Brian Lara was appointed West Indies captain and immediately spoke to Ambrose and Walsh <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> continue in the team. When England toured the West Indies between January and April 1998, he took 30 wickets at 14.26 to top the bowling averages for the series. Many of the pitches during the tour were poor for batting, but Ambrose was very effective, particularly in the second, third and fourth Tests. In addition, he dismissed Mike Atherton, the England captain, six times in the series. Scyld Berry wrote in Wisden that Ambrose was [...] "back to something near his peak form... defied every prediction that he was finished after his tour of Pakistan." [...] In the second Test, Ambrose took eight wickets; he conceded only 23 runs from 26 overs in the first innings and bowled a spell of five wickets for 16 runs from 47 deliveries in the second to complete figures of five for 52. Having won the second match, West Indies lost the third, but according to Matthew Engel, [...] "Ambrose's abiding power was the most constant feature of a fluctuating match". His eight wickets in the game, including five for 25 in the first innings, took him past fifty Test wickets in Trinidad. He followed up with six wickets in West Indies victory in the fourth Test, taking four for 38 in the final innings. Tony Cozier wrote that Ambrose [...] "thundered in, arms and knees pumping like pistons, to generate all of his old pace." [...] Following the Test series, which West Indies won 3–1, Ambrose played {{in the first three}} matches of the ODI series, and took three wickets.|$|E
