40|$|The central {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to study the role and relevance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> factor within regimes for cooperative security with special reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). <b>The</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> concept is systematically applied to an examination of their history and modalities. This thesis addresses one core question: to what extent may <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> defined in political terms, {{play a part in}} such associative security arrangements and in the calculations of the participants? Attention is therefore given to <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> factor and its co-existence with an associative dimension part of cooperative security regimes. The dissertation assesses <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> as a disposition to promote countervailing arrangements to deny hegemony within and beyond cooperative security even if devoid of direct military content. The establishment of ASEAN and the ARF are analysed within a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> perspective. Both institutions were formed with the denial of hegemony in mind but not in a conventional sense. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> remained a factor in their later developments. Its ongoing relevance is examined by discussing Brunei's motives to join the Association, ASEAN's response to the Third Indochina Conflict, the workings of the Forum, and the Association's involvement in the South China Sea dispute...|$|R

5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence.

In 1710, he was granted the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Empire, an office formerly held by the Elector Palatine—the absence of the Elector of Bavaria allowed a reshuffling of offices. The death of the Emperor in 1711 threatened to destroy <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction, so the war ended in 1713 with the ratification of the Treaty of Utrecht.

5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Moscow {{continued}} activities aimed at unifying the old Rus' lands still under Lithuanian rule. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had insufficient resources to counter Moscow's advances, already having {{to control the}} Rus' population within its borders {{and not being able}} to count on loyalty of Rus' feudal lords. As a result of the protracted war at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, Moscow acquired large tracts of territory east of the Dnieper River.

5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western Europe, which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> <b>In</b> June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and to labor unions in Western Europe in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Byzantium {{used the}} peace to focus its energy on wars against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East, where {{a series of}} campaigns under generals John Kourkouas and Nikephoros Phokas greatly {{expanded}} imperial territory. At the same time, military reforms created a much more effective and offensively-oriented army. The Byzantines did not neglect the Balkans, working steadily to improve their contacts with the peoples {{of central and eastern}} Europe, subtly altering <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the peninsula. Their Crimean outpost of Cherson maintained trade with the Pechenegs and the emerging power of the Kievan Rus'; Byzantine missionaries led the Christianization of the Magyars; and the Slavic princes of the western Balkans came to once again acknowledge the suzerainty of the Empire, particularly after Caslav Klonimirovic ended Bulgarian control over Serbia. These relationships {{on the periphery of the}} Bulgarian Empire were an important asset for Byzantine diplomacy: instigating attacks against Bulgaria by the Pechenegs and the Khazars was a time-honoured method of applying pressure on the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, Frederick the Great's prime minister, {{believed}} that any Austrian acquisition in Bavaria would shift <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the Holy Roman Empire, diminishing Prussia's influence. Prussia's recent gains had been hard-won: thirty years earlier, Frederick {{had engaged in}} protracted wars in Silesia and Bohemia, resulting in Prussia's annexation of most of Silesia, and now, with the economy and society modernizing under his direction, Prussia was emerging as a world power. In the Silesian Wars and the Seven Years' War, Frederick had earned a new, if grudging, respect for his kingdom's military and diplomatic prowess from the European powers of France, Russia, Britain and Austria. To protect Prussia's status and territory, Finck and Frederick constructed an alliance with the Electorate of Saxony, ostensibly to defend the rights of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken.|$|E

5|$|Gebhard's {{eventual}} defeat changed <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the Electoral College of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1589, Ernst of Bavaria became uncontested Prince-elector of Cologne, {{the first}} Wittelsbach {{to hold the}} position. Wittelsbach authority in northwestern German territories endured until the mid-18th century, {{with the election of}} a succession of Bavarian princes to the archbishop's throne and to the Prince-Elector's seat. This gave the family two voices in the choice of imperial candidates, which had ramifications in the 18th century. In 1740, Charles Albert, Duke of Bavaria, laid claim to the imperial title; his brother Klemens August of Bavaria, then the Archbishop and Prince-elector, cast his vote for Charles and personally crowned him at Frankfurt am Main. The shift of the emperor's orb from the House of Habsburg to the Wittelsbach family, albeit a brief event, was only resolved by the ascension of Maximilian III Joseph who, with the Treaty of Füssen, eschewed any imperial pretensions.|$|E

Whereas before, the Flanders Flotilla had been equipped with only three large torpedo boats {{and several of the}} smaller inferior A-class torpedo boats, they now possessed 23large torpedo boats capable of meeting the British Dover Patrol in combat. Due to the lack of large torpedo boats, the Flanders Flotilla had not sortied against the Dover Patrol in several months and as a result British defences were quite lax in the area.|$|E

The battle also influenced British opinion on <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the war. The success of the Napoleonchik field cannons prompted the Israeli high command to re-use two of them in attempts to capture Latrun. The flight from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, on the other hand, stirred controversy in the young state, fueled by news of the Kfar Etzion massacre just days before, and the Palmach issued a newsletter accusing them of abandoning national assets, among other things. These accusations were subsequently repeated in media and in a play by Yigal Mossensohn, and a campaign was started by the villagers to clear their name.|$|E

5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. <b>The</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved {{the effectiveness of the}} Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to take hold of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Metternich’s {{diplomacy}} and statesmanship {{became the focus}} of praise in the twentieth century from more favourably inclined historians, particularly biographer Heinrich von Srbik. For example, particularly after WWII, historians were more likely to defend Metternich’s policies as reasonable attempts to achieve his goals, chiefly <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> Europe. Sympathetic historians point out that Metternich correctly foresaw and worked to prevent Russian dominance in Europe, succeeding where his successors would fail 130 years later. As argued by Srbik, Metternich himself pursued legality, cooperation, and dialogue, and therefore helped ensure thirty years of peace, the “Age of Metternich”. Authors like Peter Viereck and Ernst B. Haas also give Metternich credit for his more liberal ideals, even if they weighed relatively little in his overall policies.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines, on {{the other}} hand, were {{weakened}} {{by a series of}} catastrophic defeats against the Bulgars, followed in 820 by the Revolt of Thomas the Slav, which attracted the support of {{a large part of the}} Byzantine armed forces, including the thematic fleets. Despite its suppression, the revolt had severely depleted the Empire's defences. As a result, Crete fell between 824 and 827 to a band of Andalusian exiles. Three successive Byzantine recovery attempts failed over the next few years, and the island became a base for Muslim piratical activity in the Aegean, radically upsetting <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the region. Despite some Byzantine successes over the Cretan corsairs, and the razing of Damietta by a Byzantine fleet of 85 ships in 853, Arab naval power in the Levant was steadily reviving under Abbasid rule. Further Byzantine attempts to recover Crete, in 843 and 866, were complete failures.|$|E

40|$|Studies in {{international}} relations frequently use fixed measurements {{over the course of}} observations that are too aggregated for appropriately testing our theories. Such is the case with testing how <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> affects conflict escalation. Although power balances have been examined as a cause of war {{perhaps more than any other}} factor {{in international}} relations, studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> all use static measurements <b>of</b> <b>power</b> which remain fixed over the course of a conflict (typically, the militarized dispute). Since we do not measure <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> we still do not understand how <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> affects dispute escalation.
