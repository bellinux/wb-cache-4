Moreover, the spatial coherence of EU Cohesion policy and Czech national regional policy is as well considered. The empirical results do not provide evidence in support of this match.

Moreover, the spatial coherence of EU Cohesion policy and Czech national regional policy is missing.

40|$|In {{the context}} of deindustrialization and desurbanization, Romanian cities are confronted with issues related to natural {{demographic}} decline and out-migration, inducing apparently opposite, but complementary phenomena: slow-burn shrinkage and urban sprawl, which create peripheralisation processes {{both inside and outside}} the cities. The current approach acknowledges urban shrinkage within {{the context of}} post-communist transformations, but also as a “natural” process in the (adaptive) life cycle of cities. In this context, the study aims to explore the interdependencies between the causes and effects of shrinkage, on the one hand, and the operating feedback mechanisms which might lead to adaptation, on the other.

Together these countries {{account for more than}} a quarter of the European population (25. 63 per cent) and almost 22 per cent of the EU 28 aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) (2014 data). They are rather diverse in terms of the territorial development challenges faced, regional policy traditions and institutional set-up. Malta and Cyprus, which joined the European Union (EU) in 2004, are small island economies with marginal regional disparities. The main goal of Cohesion policy in these countries has been to assist national growth. Greece and Portugal, with their circa 10 million inhabitants each, face challenges of <b>territorial</b> <b>balance,</b> related predominantly to the polarisation of development in the capital regions and along the Attika–Thessaloniki (in Greece) and coastland–inland (in Portugal) axes. However, rather than overcoming regional disparities, the primary concern of economic and regional policies in these countries has also been the desire to enhance national growth.

Spatial planning is an important tool that helps decision makers to achieve sustainability in the long term. This work proposes a multi-objective model for sustainable land use allocation known as MAUSS (Spanish acronym for “Modelo de Asignación de Uso Sostenible de Suelo”) The model was applied to the Plains of San Juan, Puebla, Mexico, which is currently undergoing a rapid industrialization process. The main objective of the model is to generate land use allocations that lead to a <b>territorial</b> <b>balance</b> within regions in three main ways by maximizing income, minimizing negative environmental pressure on water and air through specific evaluations of water use and CO 2 emissions, and minimizing food deficit. The non-sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is the evolutionary optimization algorithm of MAUSS. NSGA-II has been widely modified through a novel and efficient random initializing operator that enables spatial rationale from the initial solutions, a crossover operator designed to streamline the best genetic information transmission as well as diversity, and two geometric operators, geographic dispersion (GDO) and the proportion (PO), which strengthen spatial rationality.

On the other hand, it discusses the change tendency that implies to fit agriculture inside a wider socio-economic framework. Indeed, the agrarian sector must not be approached in an isolated manner but rather as an economic activity with an important weight in the development of the different European regions, that have to be favoured to attain <b>territorial</b> <b>balance</b> and economic and social cohesion; which implies the fortification of the rural policy to secure this balance as a fundamental pillar of the Common Agrarian Policy.

40|$|This article {{approaches}} {{aspects of}} spatial patterns associated with underdevelopment situations in Maramureş – Chioar Region, Romania. Based {{on the concept}} according to which <b>territorial</b> <b>balance</b> results from a harmonization between structure and function, the analysis performed considers three territorial aspects: the road network, the economic characteristics and the spatial positioning of the human settlements. The correlated analysis of these aspects allowed capturing certain recurrent spatial situations of association between settlements without business organizations, with a poor road network development. Such situations, translated in terms of space as patterns of underdevelopment, are, due to the big number of cases, a symptom of uneven regional development. We have identified three classes of spatial patterns associated with economic underdevelopment situations: the sidewise pattern, the cul-de-sac pattern, and the proximity pattern. The analysis of network indicators (α, β, γ, μ) and of a compound indicator (κ) reveals in many cases that the identified spatial patterns coincide with low values of road network connectivity. From a systemic point of view, {{the significance of these}} indicators derives from the fact that they signal dysfunctions manifested at structural and functional level. The optimization of the patterns of underdevelopment requires both a harmonious relationship between road network meshes and nodes and an efficient network flow transmission, i. e. an optimization between time, space and consumed energy factors. Under these conditions, the emergence of new structural elements and network segments that will close the non-functional network meshes can be a possible solution that might eliminate underdevelopment situations by increasing the positional value of these settlements...|$|E

In other words, recovery is a subject which solves the probable damages of a building, trying to bring it back to its original living conditions; otherwise referring to the intervention which confronts the damages provoked by the weather and, more often than not, by the absence of maintenance. In any case, technological innovation can intervene systematically basing itself on analytic and diagnostic studies, regulated and supported by new scientific instruments. The project of building recovery and heritage enhancement, therefore, mainly addresses the adjustment to new housing and urban needs, but it is obviously conditioned and/or “restricted” by the limitation of the building itself, in particular when the intrinsic characteristics must be preserved. The concept of “restriction” extends to its relation with the site, {{to the quality of the}} image, to the living conditions. Therefore any intervention of building recovery needs a philological study as a starting point, which consists of a critical interpretation of the building and its context. Such a study is the result of an inseparable relation between the construction’s “previous state” and its “current condition”, or rather, between the materials and the constructive technique, the method from which form and function originated and the preset structural state which is obsolete.

Reversibility gives the building the possibility to reinterpret or correct using possible solutions brought by technological innovations (new materials, techniques and constructing procedures). Other general criteria in the intervention on historical buildings are: durability, reliability, flexibility and maintainability. These are the parameters of “technological congruence” which must be respected when involved in a recovery intervention, supported by a historical critical and technical-scientific study.

However, in our country, for several reasons, in recent decades the mobility offer has not met expectations, causing substantial critical, that only recently have called for a new infrastructure policy. The provision of mobility should recover a significant gap in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The problems to be solved are many and made more complex by the necessity to recover a significant delay, this threatens to marginalize us from a geographic European context in which Italy is a peripheral country. Many recent studies have highlighted how the failure of the road system are estimated approximately annually 15 million euros, that impact directly on productive component of the nation, even if measured only in terms of greater travel times due to congestion of the main extra urban network. An action of <b>territorial</b> <b>balance</b> must necessarily be directed towards the solution of those nodes of traffic which doesn’t allow a real operating system of main road network. However, as a strategy dictated by the emergency can be basically forced, this may not stem entirely or put into the background those actions necessary to ensure a balance of supply, both in terms of modal and development policy. This policy could penalize further, {{from the point of view}} of infrastructures, the already marginalized economies such as South of Italy. In this respect there is no doubt that a fundamental role in the reorganization of domestic and international mobility, can be played by an effective integration of maritime transport in the framework of an offer of transport projected to other Mediterranean countries. There is nothing new to acknowledge Southern Italy as a bridge to those markets that can solve the problem of its geographical marginalization, otherwise unavoidable.

The geostatistical interpolation method indicator kriging therefore is applied for an accurate mapping of the spatial distribution of benthic communities following a categorical classification scheme at the deep-sea submarine Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano. Georeferenced video mosaics were obtained during several dives by the Remotely Operated Vehicle Victor 6000 in a water depth of 1260 m. Mud volcanoes are considered as significant source locations for methane indicated by unique chemoautotrophic communities as Beggiatoa mats and pogonophoran tube worms. For the detection and quantification of their spatial distribution 2840 georeferencedvideo mosaics were analysed by visual inspection. Polygons, digitised on the georeferenced images within a GIS, build the data basis for geostatistically interpolated mono-parametric surface maps. Indicator kriging {{is applied to the}} centroids of the polygons calculating surfacemaps. The quality assessment of the surface maps is conducted by leave-one-out cross-validation evaluating the fit of the indicator kriging variograms by using statistical mean values. Furthermore, the estimate was evaluated by a validation dataset of the visual inspection of 530 video mosaics not included within the interpolation, thus, proving the interpolated surfaces independently.

This empirical study covers 26 Brazilian states over the period 1989 - 2002.

This empirical analysis relies on dynamic growth regressions, using the system GMM estimator. The results indicate that openness is more beneficial to states {{with a high level of}} initial per capita income and therefore contributes to increased regional disparities in Brazil. In addition, trade openness favors more industrialized states, well-endowed in human capital, rather than states whose economic activity is mainly based on agriculture. These results have important policy implications since achieving <b>balanced</b> <b>territorial</b> development has become a priority for the Brazilian federal government over the last few decades...|$|R
