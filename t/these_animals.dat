5|$|C. t. cooksoni (Blaine, 1914; Cookson's wildebeest), is {{restricted}} to the Luangwa Valley in Zambia. Sometimes <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> may wander into the plateau region of central Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is {{sometimes}} facilitated by motion, {{as in the}} leafy sea dragon and some stick insects. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> complement their passive camouflage by swaying like plants, either preventing predators from detecting them, or appearing as something other than prey.|$|E
40|$|Comparative Medicine: Innovations for the Animal to Human Health Corridor PanelThe University of Missouri houses three National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) <b>animal</b> {{resource}} centers. <b>These</b> <b>animal</b> resource centers are: (1) the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (MMRRC); (2) the Rat Resource and Research Center (RRRC); and the National Swine Resource and Research Center (NSRRC). <b>These</b> <b>animal</b> centers provide {{genetically modified}} animal models of human health and disease for comparative medicine research investigators. Critser will describe the goals and functions of <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> resource centers and illustrate how investigators can access <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> models, {{as well as the}} ancillary services the resource centers provide...|$|R
50|$|Record label Fierce Panda's first release, Shagging in the Streets, was {{a tribute}} to the scene, {{featuring}} S*M*A*S*H, Done Lying Down, <b>These</b> <b>Animal</b> Men, and others. Associated bands have included Elastica, S*M*A*S*H, Menswear, Sleeper, Echobelly, Shed Seven, <b>These</b> <b>Animal</b> Men, and Compulsion.|$|R

5|$|In {{some animals}} with mobile pinnae (like the horse), each pinna can be aimed {{independently}} to better receive the sound. For <b>these</b> <b>animals,</b> the pinnae help localise {{the direction of}} the sound source.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Navajo {{acquired}} the Iberian Churra, a {{breed of sheep}} from Spanish explorers. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> were developed into a unique breed by the Navajo, today called the Navajo-Churro. These sheep were well-suited to the climate in Navajo lands, and that produced a useful long-staple wool. Hand-spun wool from <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> was {{the main source of}} yarn for Navajo blankets until the 1860s, when the United States government forced the Navajo people to relocate at Bosque Redondo and seized their livestock. The 1869 peace treaty that allowed the Navajo to return to their traditional lands included a $30,000 settlement to replace their livestock. The tribe purchased 14,000 sheep and 1,000 goats.|$|E
5|$|A large {{population}} spreads across the Hawaiian Islands every winter, {{ranging from the}} island of Hawaii {{in the south to}} Kure Atoll in the north. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E

50|$|The school's best-known alumni are {{television}} journalist Amelia Reynolds and <b>These</b> <b>Animal</b> Men vocalist {{and lead}} guitarist Alexander (previously Roger) Boag.|$|R
50|$|Weapon II experimented on animals. It was {{implied by}} Grant Morrison that <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> weapons were the animal cyborgs in the comic We3, not {{published}} by Marvel.|$|R
5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|Although Nepenthes rajah is {{most famous}} for {{trapping}} and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host {{to a large}} number of other organisms, which are thought to form a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many of <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. rajah has two such mosquito taxa named after it: Culex rajah and Toxorhynchites rajah.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{infusion}} of Arabian horses into Europe {{occurred when the}} Ottoman Turks sent 300,000 horsemen into Hungary in 1522, {{many of whom were}} mounted on pure-blooded Arabians, captured during raids into Arabia. By 1529, the Ottomans reached Vienna, where they were stopped by the Polish and Hungarian armies, who captured these horses from the defeated Ottoman cavalry. Some of <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> provided foundation bloodstock for the major studs of eastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>Animal</b> Men were an English band who {{achieved}} minor fame in the 1990s {{as part of}} the New Wave of New Wave before {{splitting up}} after releasing two albums, in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 September 2015, <b>These</b> <b>Animal</b> Men reunited {{to play a}} one-off {{sold out}} gig at Heaven in London, {{alongside}} S*M*A*S*H, {{in support of the}} documentary [...] "Flawed is Beautiful" [...] which covers the career of both bands.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>animal</b> bones show {{marks of}} butchery, marrow {{extraction}} and burning from fire. Analysis of the orientation and anatomical placements {{of the cut}} marks suggest meat and connective tissue were cut off in a planned manner from the bone.|$|R
5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top of {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, though there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of <b>these</b> <b>animals,</b> including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. <b>These</b> <b>animals,</b> {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The throat pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E
5000|$|While {{some authors}} {{make use of}} <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> {{stereotypes}} [...] "as is", others undermine reader expectations by reversing them, developing the animal character in contrasting ways to foil expectations or create amusement, like a [...] pig or cowardly lion.|$|R
50|$|The {{common name}} sea lemon {{probably}} comes from <b>these</b> <b>animal's</b> visual similarity to a lemon {{based on such}} qualities as the roughened skin, the oval form when seen from above, and the common but not inevitable orange to pale yellow coloration.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>Animal</b> Men {{formed in}} Brighton circa 1990, signing to Hut Records, an {{offshoot}} of Virgin Records in 1993. They gained some notoriety with their first few singles, which featured drug references in both the sleeve artwork and the song lyrics.|$|R
5|$|Dinosaurs diverged {{from their}} archosaur {{ancestors}} {{during the middle}} to late Triassic period, roughly 20million years after the Permianâ€“Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators. The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> were indeed small, bipedal predators. Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago, as evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period, though known fossils of <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{have been}} working animals {{since at least the}} Indus Valley Civilization and {{continue}} to be used in modern times. There were 13,000â€“16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> are typically captured from the wild when they are 10â€“20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E
5|$|In ctenophores, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the activation of calcium-activated proteins named photoproteins in cells called photocytes, which are often confined to the meridional canals that underlie the eight comb rows. In the genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode photoproteins. These genes are co-expressed with opsin genes in the developing photocytes of Mnemiopsis leidyi, raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in <b>these</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The sticks {{were once}} plain, but {{recently}} Meiji has placed pictures of various animals on them with quotes relating to that animal. The quotes are in English, but often appear unorthodox to native English speakers. Examples of <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> quotes include: ...|$|R
50|$|In England {{travelling}} menageries {{had first}} {{appeared at the}} turn of the eighteenth century. In contrast to the aristocratic menageries, <b>these</b> travelling <b>animal</b> collections were run by showmen who met the craving for sensation of the ordinary population. <b>These</b> <b>animal</b> shows ranged in size but the largest was George Wombwell's which, by 1839, totalled fifteen wagons. By 1880 Bostock and Wombwell's Royal National Menagerie had eighteen â€³huge and spacious carriagesâ€³ and over six hundred beasts to take on the annual tour.|$|R
50|$|In England {{travelling}} menageries {{had first}} appeared at around 1700. In {{contrast to the}} aristocratic menageries, <b>these</b> travelling <b>animal</b> collections were run by showmen who met the craving for sensation of the ordinary population. <b>These</b> <b>animal</b> shows ranged in size but the largest was George Wombwell's. The earliest record of a fatality at one such travelling menagerie was the death of Hannah Twynnoy in 1703 who {{was killed by a}} tiger in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.Also in North America travelling menageries became even more popular during that time.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{there was an}} {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecognized cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada. Cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures and on some occasions, spontaneously. For example, 21 out of 22 cows died after dehorning and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration. All of <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> had bled to death.|$|E
5|$|Infant {{and parent}} {{chimpanzees}} show dyadic joint attention in an affectionate manner {{by looking at}} each other's eyes Non-human animals such as Japanese monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys seldom engage in dyadic joint attention. For <b>these</b> <b>animals,</b> the eye contact involved in dyadic joint attention is deemed threatening.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} notable for their complex societies. Only {{elephants}} and higher primates, such as humans, live in comparably complex social structures. Due to orcas' complex social bonds and society, many marine experts {{have concerns about}} how humane it is to keep <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> in captive situations.|$|E
500|$|Paleontologists {{from the}} San Bernardino County Museum in Redlands, California {{uncovered}} thousands of fossils in the Diamond and Domenigoni valleys that will add immensely {{to the store}} of public knowledge about the region. [...] Collectively, <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> fossils are named the Diamond Valley Lake Local Fauna.|$|R
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) {{is a neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} the selective death of motor neurons. Although ALS is predominantly a disease of motor system degeneration, cognitive impairments have also been reported. In {{order to determine the}} pathogenic mechanisms leading to this neurodegeneration, a large number of different animal models have helped to get insights. <b>These</b> <b>animal</b> models contain mutated genes (spontaneous or induced) or (over) express (mutant) genes and recapitulate important aspect of this neurodegenerative disease. Although the exact mechanisms are not yet elucidated, animal models have been of great value to delineate potential pathogenic mechanisms that are involved in and/or are important in causing selective motor neuron degeneration. Moreover, <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> models can be used as first screening assays to select potential therapeutics to treat this fatal disease. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This review {{describes}} {{a key role}} for mononuclear phagocytes in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders. There is accumulating evidence for activation of microglia (histopathology and PET scans) and circulating monocytes (enhanced gene expression of immune genes, an overproduction of monocyte/macrophage-related cytokines) in patients with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. These data are strengthened by observations in animal models, such as the MIA models, the chronic stress models, and the NOD mouse model. In <b>these</b> <b>animal</b> models of depressive-, anxiety-, and schizophrenia-like behavior, similar activations of microglia and circulating monocytes can be found. <b>These</b> <b>animal</b> models also make in-depth pathogenic studies possible and show that microglia activation impacts neuronal development and function in brain areas congruent with the altered depressive and schizophrenia-like behaviors.
