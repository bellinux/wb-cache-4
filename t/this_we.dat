25|$|From <b>this</b> <b>we</b> {{see that}} the Möbius group is a 3-dimensional complex Lie group (or a 6-dimensional real Lie group). It is a semisimple non-compact Lie group.|$|E

25|$|If v1 is not {{adjacent}} to v3, we can merge these two vertices {{into a single}} vertex. To do <b>this,</b> <b>we</b> remove v from both circular adjacency lists, and then splice the two lists together into one list {{at the point where}} v was formerly found. Provided that v maintains a reference to its position in each list, this can be done in constant time. It's possible that this might create faces bounded by two edges at the two points where the lists are spliced together; we delete one edge from any such faces. After doing <b>this,</b> <b>we</b> push v3 onto Sd, along with a note that v1 is the vertex that it was merged with. Any vertices affected by the merge are added or removed from the stacks as appropriate.|$|E

25|$|In his {{editing room}} at ninety years old, Louis van Gasteren at last reveals the heart-breaking event that blocked him from {{completing}} {{the film in}} the ensuing decades. But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally {{found the courage to}} do it. With <b>this</b> <b>we</b> see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} <b>this,</b> <b>we</b> must have facilities {{that will enable}} our faculty to do proficient work in every line. This will require an investment in a clinical hospital and in dispensary work. But all this is absolutely necessary to give our {{young men and women}} who take the medical course a proficient training in rational methods of treatment.|$|E
25|$|As for Hermitian matrices, the {{key point}} is to prove the {{existence}} {{of at least one}} nonzero eigenvector. To prove <b>this,</b> <b>we</b> cannot rely on determinants to show existence of eigenvalues, but instead one can use a maximization argument analogous to the variational characterization of eigenvalues. The above spectral theorem holds for real or complex Hilbert spaces.|$|E
30|$|In <b>this</b> section, <b>we</b> prove Theorem  2.2 for a quasi-contraction map of {{integral}} type. To <b>this</b> end, <b>we</b> {{present the}} following definition.|$|R

25|$|Ordered {{tendencies of}} nature: A {{direction}} of actions {{to an end}} is noticed in all bodies following natural laws. Anything without awareness tends to a goal {{under the guidance of}} one who is aware. <b>This</b> <b>we</b> call God (Note that even when we guide objects, in Thomas's view, the source of all our knowledge comes from God as well).|$|E
25|$|To {{alleviate}} <b>this,</b> <b>we</b> {{can define}} operations for chaining these computations together. The bind binary operator (>>=) chains {{the results of}} one computation that could fail, into a function that chooses another computation that could fail. If the first argument is Nothing, the second argument (the function) is ignored and the entire operation simply fails. If the first argument is Just x, we pass x to the function {{to get a new}} Maybe value, {{which may or may not}} result in a Just value.|$|E
25|$|While UPN {{was still}} airing new episodes of Girlfriends, the network also began airing reruns five days per week. When the show moved to The CW network after UPN merged with The WB network, MyNetwork TV (which {{was created to}} take over UPN's former {{affiliate}} stations) picked up the rights to air reruns of Girlfriends, although they eventually discontinued <b>this.</b> <b>WE</b> tv, a network with primarily women's programming, later acquired exclusive rights to air the limited-release episodes on Sundays and exercised an option to not allow broadcast television networks re-broadcast rights to these reruns.|$|E

25|$|It {{is alleged}} by some that the Duke of Brunswick was well-inclined {{to enter into}} the views of the Pope, but that he found he could neither raise men nor money {{sufficient}} to warrant even a probability of success. <b>This</b> <b>we</b> are inclined to doubt, for had Otho been ambitious, he might have obtained the empire without much difficulty; and supported as he was by England and Denmark, it is not likely that he could have been at a loss for an army, or for the means of supporting it.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{distances}} between the colonies and {{small numbers of}} Quakers meant that Australia Friends were dependent on London until the 20th century. The Society remained unprogrammed and is named Australia Yearly Meeting, with local organizations around seven Regional Meetings: Canberra (which extends into southern New South Wales), New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia (which extends into Northern Territory), Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia. The Friends' School is found in Hobart. An annual meeting each January, is hosted by a different Regional Meeting over a seven-year cycle, with a Standing Committee each July or August. The Australia Yearly Meeting published <b>This</b> <b>We</b> Can Say: Australian Quaker Life, Faith and Thought, in 2003.|$|E
25|$|In the 2ndcentury the satirist Lucian of Samosata {{was a sharp}} {{critic of}} Neo-Pythagoreanism. After 180AD he wrote a {{pamphlet}} where he attacked Alexander of Abonoteichus, a student of one of Apollonius’ students, as a charlatan; and suggested that the whole school was based on fraud. From <b>this</b> <b>we</b> can infer that Apollonius really had students and that his school survived at least until Lucian’s time. One of Philostratus’ foremost aims was to oppose this view. Although he related various miraculous feats of Apollonius, he emphasized {{at the same time}} that his hero was not a magician, but a serious philosopher and a champion of traditional Greek values.|$|E
