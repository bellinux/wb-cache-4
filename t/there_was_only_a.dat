5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> single author who was writing either {{at the end of}} the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 the {{newspaper}} La Gazzetta dello Sport established the Giro d'Italia, {{inspired by the}} success of the Tour de France, which started in 1903. The first Giro was won by Luigi Ganna, while Carlo Galetti won the two following Giros. In 1912, there was no individual classification, instead <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> team classification, which was won by Team Atala. The 1912 Giro is the only time the competition has not had an individual classification. From 1914 onwards the scoring format was changed from a points-based system to a time-based system, in which the cyclist who had the lowest aggregate time {{at the end of the}} race would win. The Giro was suspended for four years from 1915 to 1918, due to the First World War. Costante Girardengo was the winner of the first Giro after the war in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Once {{registration}} {{had been}} completed and the deposits were made, the author was granted an exclusive right to control the copying of the book. Penalties for infringing this right were severe, with all infringing copies to be destroyed and large fines {{to be paid to}} both the copyright holder and the government; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> three-month statute of limitations on bringing a case, however. This exclusive right's length was dependent on when the book had been published. If it was published after 10 April 1710, the length of copyright was 14 years; if published before that date, 21 years. An author who survived until the copyright expired would be granted an additional 14-year term, and when that ran out, the works would enter the public domain. Copyright under the Statute applied to Scotland and England, as well as Ireland when that country joined the union in 1800.|$|E

When they arrived at the Ofotfjord, west of Narvik, on the early morning of 9 April, the three ships of the 4th Flotilla, under the command of Commander Erich Bey, were ordered to land their troops in the Herjangsfjord (a northern branch of the Ofotfjord) in order to capture a Norwegian Army armory at Elvegårdsmoen. The troops encountered little resistance, but off-loading them was slow because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> single wooden pier available.

5|$|With {{effect from}} June 12, {{a state of}} public {{emergency}} was declared {{for the whole of}} Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella. This was because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> limited amount of food available on Funafuti to cater for the whole of the island nation, while providing Niulakita with immediate relief supplies. This enabled the Tuvaluan embassy in Suva, Fiji to appeal to various overseas countries and organisations including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Development Programme to provide aid and assistance to the island nation. During June 14, the Royal New Zealand Air Force deployed a transport plane carrying some relief materials including tarpaulins and water from New Zealand. The plane subsequently stopped in Noumea, New Caledonia and Nadi, Fiji to pick up further relief supplies that had been donated by Australia, Fiji and France. The crew of the plane subsequently conducted an aerial assessment of the damage on Niulakita, and reported seeing widespread damage, before they arrived at Funafuti Airport during June 15.|$|E
