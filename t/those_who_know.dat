5|$|The Varaha, in the 83 {{verses of}} Chapter 2, {{explains}} to Ribhu {{how to achieve}} the most exalted knowledge of Brahmavidya, and then what it is. He tells Ribhu that the four means of this knowledge are to practice conduct of one's Varna (caste) and one's Ashrama (stage in life), from ascetic austerity {{and with the help}} of a Guru (spiritual teacher). The Varaha then states that the path to Brahmavidya is through the capacity to distinguish between the ephemeral and the eternal, detachment from the material world unto the spiritual world. A sincere longing for spiritual liberation and six virtuous qualities (shama) are essential in order to achieve Brahmavidya, asserts the Upanishad, these being tranquility, self-restraint, doing work without craving for rewards, endurance, faith, and meditation. Varaha states in verse 2.4 that the truly blessed are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> Brahman and Atman and have thus become one with them.|$|E

25|$|Augustana University is a private, Norwegian-heritage {{liberal arts}} college {{affiliated}} with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the school is the largest private university in the state. The institution derives {{its name from the}} Confessio Augustana, or Augsburg Confession, a foundational document of Lutheranism. Students, alumni, friends, employees, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> the college casually refer to it as “Augie.” Prior to September 2015, the university was known as Augustana College.|$|E
25|$|The {{corresponding}} percentile of each scaled score {{varies from}} test to test—for example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both {{sections of the}} SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are due {{to the content of}} the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often {{in the form of an}} AP, which is relatively more difficult), and only <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a war}} scare in May 1906 {{when the}} Turks {{occupied}} an old Egyptian fort {{at the head of}} the Gulf of Aqaba. Wilson noted that Grierson (Director of Military Operations) and Lyttelton (“absolutely incapable … positively a dangerous fool”) had approved the proposed scheme for military action, but neither the Adjutant-General nor the Quartermaster-General had been consulted. Repington wrote to Esher (19 Aug 1906) that Wilson was an “intriguing impostor” and “a low-class schemer whose sole aptitude is for worshipping rising suns – an aptitude expressed by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> him in more vulgar language”. On 12 September 1906 Army Order 233 finally set up a General Staff to supervise education and training and to draw up war plans (Wilson had drafted an Army Order late in 1905, but it had been held up by disputes over whether staff officers should be appointed by the Chief of the General Staff as Wilson preferred or by an eleven-man selection board).|$|E

25|$|Mr. Ament left us {{this morning}} after a delay here of five days. The Mark Twain article in the North American Review cut him like a knife and weighs deeply on him, but he takes it in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help to him, and I think he goes back well prepared to set things right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling exactly what he has done. It will be a story worth telling, even if there were no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> of it.|$|E
25|$|The language, or dialect, of Anagni (called Anagnino) can be {{categorized}} as Northern Ciociaro. The definite articles (the) are Ju-masculine singular (pronounced like the English word you), La-feminine singular, Ji-masculine plural (pronounced Yee), and Le-feminine plural (pronounced like the English word Lay). The indefinite articles (a, an) are nu-for masculine words and na for feminine words. The final vowel is always pronounced in the plural form and usually in the singular form (this is in comparison with Southern Ciociaro and Neapolitan where the final vowel of a word is usually slurred, unaccented). For <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> Italian, the Anagnino dialect preserves the u's found in Latin; for example instead of the Italian con (with), the people of Anagni use cu from the Latin cum. There are many other differences between the Italian and Anagnino. Some examples include the deletion of some n's, l's, and r's commonly found in Italian. For linguistic historians, the dialect {{is especially important for}} studying pre-Roman Italic languages and also the formation of Italian. Like Latin, the v's are pronounced like u's; for example vino (wine in Italian) is uino in Anagnino. Today's Standard Italian is influenced by German, French, Arabic, Greek, and Spanish, while the dialect of Anagni and the others of central Italy (south of Rome, west of the Apennines, and north of Campania) are relatively considered solely Latin and pre-Italic, due to the limited settlement of foreign people in the area.|$|E
500|$|The Varaha Upanishad asserts the non-dualistic {{premise that}} Brahman and Atman are one, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> this fear nothing, suffer nothing, and possess fortitude.

500|$|Varaha replies in verses 2.7–2.9 that {{he alone}} is Supreme Bliss, that {{apart from the}} Atman (soul) there exists no Ishvara or phenomenal world. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> their Atman (soul) have no notions of Varna (caste) or Ashrama (stage in life); they see Atman as Brahman, they become Brahman and reach [...] "Moksha" [...] {{salvation}} even without seeking.

500|$|Barney was {{notoriously}} non-monogamous, a {{fact that}} the other two women had to accept. Brooks met Barney in 1916, {{at a time when the}} writer had already been involved for about seven years with Duchess Elisabeth de Gramont, also known as Lily or Elisabeth de Clermont-Tonnerre. She was married and the mother of two daughters. After a brief dust-up that resulted in Barney's offering Gramont a marriage contract while at the same time refusing to give up Brooks, the three women formed a stable lifelong triangle in which none was a third wheel. Gramont, one of the most glamorous taste-makers and aristocrats of the period, summed up their values when she said, [...] "Civilized beings are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> how to take more from life than others." [...] Gender fluidity and sexual freedom were paramount among women of Brooks' circle. [...] Barney hosted a literary salon on Paris's Left Bank.|$|E
