They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E
5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> <b>and</b> the two make amends.|$|E

50|$|The big {{breakthrough}} George de Mestral {{made was}} {{to think about}} hook-and-eye closures on a greatly reduced scale. <b>Hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fasteners have been common for centuries, but what was new about <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> loop fasteners was the miniaturisation of <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> eyes. Shrinking <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> led to <b>the</b> two other important differences. Firstly, instead of a single-file line of hooks, touch fasteners have a two-dimensional surface. This was needed, because in decreasing the size of <b>the</b> <b>hooks,</b> <b>the</b> strength was also unavoidably lessened, thus requiring more <b>hooks</b> for <b>the</b> same strength. The other difference is that <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> loop has indeterminate match-up between <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> eyes. With larger <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fasteners, each hook has its own eye. On a scale as small as that of <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> loop fasteners, matching up each of these <b>hooks</b> with <b>the</b> corresponding eye is impractical, thus leading to the indeterminate matching.|$|R
5|$|During World War II, {{more than}} 340 of the village's 1,830 {{residents}} {{served in the}} United States Armed Forces. <b>The</b> <b>Hook</b> <b>and</b> Ladder Company waived fees and dues for those enlisted from 1941 onward. Such {{a sufficient number of}} firefighters was serving the armed forces that the village requested volunteers ages 16–18 to join the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department; at least nine served on active duty during the war and had the ability to excuse themselves from school (which was then located adjacent to Law Memorial Park) if the fire siren went off. Also during the war, in 1944, the department received a trailer-type pump unit with a 500-gallon pump, hose, nozzle, ladders, and other tools. It was loaned to the village by the Office of Civil Defense and was an auxiliary to the existing equipment. One year later, Briarcliff High School graduate and Briarcliff Fire Company lieutenant Sgt. Arthur J. Quinn, Jr. of the 45th Division was killed in action in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Samichon River (24–26 July 1953) {{was fought}} {{during the final}} days of the Korean War between United Nations (UN) forces—primarily Australian and American—and the Chinese {{communist}} People's Volunteer Army. The fighting took place on a key position on the Jamestown Line known as <b>The</b> <b>Hook</b> <b>and</b> saw the defending UN troops, including the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR) from the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade and the US 7th Marine Regiment, fight off numerous assaults by the Chinese 137th Division during two concerted night attacks, inflicting numerous casualties on the Chinese with heavy artillery and small arms fire. The action was part of a larger, divisional-sized Chinese attack against the US 1st Marine Division, with diversionary assaults mounted against the Australians. With the peace talks in Panmunjom reaching a conclusion, the Chinese had been eager to gain a last-minute victory over the UN forces and the battle was the last of the war before the official signing of the Korean Armistice.|$|E
5|$|The European Championship was Razer's next—and final—televised tournament, {{for which}} it {{qualified}} as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions Pulveriser {{to set up a}} semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries attached the anti-crusher frame used in their previous meeting in the series six grand final; the Razer team installed a revised version of the lifting hook. Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer picked it up with <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, but the result went to a judges' decision. They awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight, but in a split decision the team decided this was unfair and conceded to Tornado, who beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title.|$|E

5|$|Chartjackers was devised in 2009 by Davenport and Andy Mettam of Hat Trick Productions, and was {{commissioned}} for development by Geoffrey Goodwin and Jo Twist of BBC Switch. Alongside the programmes Off <b>the</b> <b>Hook</b> <b>and</b> The Cut, it was featured {{as part of}} a season of multi-platform content designed to appeal to teenagers. The show was also directly linked to the 2009 annual appeal for the British charity Children in Need – profits from sales of the completed pop song were donated to the charity. Chartjackers aired weekly at approximately 1:10p.m. on Saturday afternoons on BBC Two, with the first episode premiering on 12 September 2009 during the channel's two-hour long BBC Switch segment. The series garnered a viewing figures peak of almost half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers. Each episode was streamed online through BBC iPlayer to UK residents for seven days after its initial airing. The series was not broadcast outside the UK and, , is not available to buy on DVD.|$|E
25|$|Ponting {{was known}} as an {{aggressive}} right-handed batsman who played a wide repertoire of shots with confidence, most notably the pull and hook. However, he had some technical weaknesses, such as shuffling across his stumps and being trapped leg before wicket, and thrusting his bat away from his body—especially early in his innings. Despite being widely renowned as the best player of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> pull shots in the world, Ponting was equally adept on both {{the front and back}} foot. However, during the latter stages of his career, <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> pull shots have often been the cause of his dismissal.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted both <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> uppercut may be thrown with both hands, {{resulting}} in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand. Generally the analogous opposite {{is true of the}} footwork and torso movement.|$|E

25|$|In {{the lock}} back, {{as in many}} folding knives, a stop pin acting on the top (or behind) the blade {{prevents}} it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a torsion bar. To release the knife the rocker bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around the rocker pin, lifting <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> freeing the blade.|$|E
25|$|The {{last known}} {{use of the}} CG-4A {{was in the early}} 1950s by the USAF with an Arctic {{detachment}} aiding scientific research. The CG-4As were used for getting personnel down to, and up from, floating ice floes, with the glider being towed out, released for landing, and then picked up later by the same type of aircraft, using <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> line method developed during World War II. The only modification to the CG-4A was the fitting of wide skis in place of the landing gear for landing on the Arctic ice floes.|$|E

5000|$|Little {{is known}} of the life habits of Lasiognathus. William Beebe speculated in 1930 that the fishing {{apparatus}} of Lasiognathus might [...] "be cast swiftly ahead, when then <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lights would so frighten any pursued fish that they would hesitate {{long enough to be}} engulfed in the onrushing maw," [...] though Richard Ellis considered this scenario unlikely. Nolan and Rosenblatt (1975) echoed Beebe's skepticism that <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> were actually used to hook prey, though they proposed that [...] "squid tentacles could conceivably be impaled on <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prey thus secured". It has also been proposed that Lasiognathus might form its mouth into a sort of sieve for filter feeding. More likely, prey is simply attracted by the glowing esca to within range of the jaws.|$|R
40|$|We present {{our work}} in {{generating}} Karmina, an old Malay poetic form for Indonesian language. Karmina is a poem with two lines {{that consists of}} a <b>hook</b> (sampiran) on <b>the</b> first line and {{a message on the}} second line. One of the unique aspects of Karmina is in the absence of discourse relation between its <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> message. We approached the problem by generating <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> messages in separate processes using predefined schemas and a manually built knowledge base. The Karminas were produced by randomly pairing the messages with <b>the</b> <b>hooks,</b> subject to <b>the</b> constraints imposed on the rhymes and on the structure similarity. Syllabifications were performed on the cue words of <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> messages to ensure the generated pairs have matching rhymes. We were able to generate a number of positive examples while still leaving room for improvement, particularly in the generation of the messages, which currently are still limited, and in filtering the negative results. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{second class}} of cricket stroke {{comprises}} the horizontal bat shots, {{also known as}} cross bat shots: the cut, the square drive, the pull, <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> the sweep. Typically horizontal bat shots have a greater probability of failing {{to make contact with}} the ball than vertical bat shots, and therefore are restricted to deliveries that are not threatening to hit the stumps, either by dint of being too wide or too short. The bat is swung in a horizontal arc, with the batsman's head typically not being perfectly in line with the ball at point of contact.|$|E
25|$|These cup {{measurements}} are only correct for a 34-inch band because cup size is relative to band size. The volume of a brassiere cup {{is the same}} for 30D, 32C, 34B, and 36A, though the shape of each cup may be different. These related bra sizes of the same cup volume are called sister sizes. It is sometimes possible that two adjacent sister sizes will both fit a person, since the cup volume is the same, while the band size can be adjusted to a small degree by using <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fasteners in the bra clasp.|$|E
25|$|Some rods {{are joined}} through a metal bus. These add mass to the rod which helps in setting <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> help {{activating}} the rod from tip to butt when casting, {{resulting in a}} better casting experience. Some anglers experience this kind of fitting as superior to a one piece rod. They are found on specialised hand-built rods. Apart from adding the correct mass, depending {{on the kind of}} rod, this fitting also is the strongest known fitting, but also the most expensive one. For that reason they are almost never to be found on commercial fishing rods.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> base <b>and</b> ball <b>hook</b> {{system is}} an {{attachment}} {{that is designed}} to be used on the lunar surface as an improved alternative to <b>the</b> common crane <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye system. <b>The</b> design proposed uses an omni-directional ball <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> base to overcome the design problems associated with a conventional crane <b>hook.</b> <b>The</b> base <b>and</b> ball <b>hook</b> is not sensitive to cable twist which would render a robotic lunar crane useless since there is little atmospheric resistance to dampen the motion of an oscillating member. The symmetric characteristics of <b>the</b> ball <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> base eliminates manual placement of <b>the</b> ball <b>hook</b> into <b>the</b> base; commonly associated with <b>the</b> typical <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye stem. <b>The</b> major advantage of <b>the</b> base <b>and</b> ball <b>hook</b> system is it's ease of couple and uncouple modes that are advantages during unmanned robotic lunar missions...|$|R

25|$|In the 14th century Haarlem {{was a major}} city. It was {{the second}} largest city in {{historical}} Holland after Dordrecht and before Delft, Leiden, Amsterdam, Gouda and Rotterdam. In 1429 the city gained the right to collect tolls, including ships passing {{the city on the}} Spaarne river. At the end of the Middle Ages Haarlem was a flourishing city with a large textile industry, shipyards and beer breweries. Around 1428 the city was put under siege by the army of Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut.

During these wars Amsterdam loaned {{large amounts of money}} to Maximilian I. In 1489, the emperor gave Amsterdam the right to use his personal imperial crown in its coat of arms, out of gratitude for these loans. When his successor Rudolf II created a new personal crown, Amsterdam changed the crown accordingly. Even after the Reformation, the Protestant Amsterdam continued to use the crown of the Catholic emperor. In 1804, the crown of Rudolf II became the Imperial Crown of Austria. In the coat of arms of Amsterdam, the Imperial Crown is positioned on top of the escutcheon.|$|E
25|$|William's troops {{set fire}} to the {{abandoned}} villages of Laaxum and Warns and started to advance towards Stavoren. In the countryside around Warns the Hollandic count was attacked by the local inhabitants. With their heavy armour the knights were no match for the furious Frisian farmers and fishermen. As they fled they entered a swamp where they were decisively beaten. Their commander William IV of Holland was killed, and was succeeded by his sister Margaret of Holland, wife of Louis IV. When John of Beaumont heard what had happened, he ordered a retreat back to the ships. They were pursued by the Frisians and most did not make it back. Count William's death in this battle paved the way for <b>the</b> <b>Hook</b> <b>and</b> Cod wars, and 26 September, the day of the battle, remains a national holiday in Friesland today.|$|E
