The Services accounted highest among the unregistered SMEs {{because of the way}} these businesses were built up without formal registration. Services such as brokering of products, crafts work, small scale farming (Farming, 2018) and catering which do not require businesses to be formally set up constituted the most among these types of SMEs.|$|E
40|$|As {{long as one}} {{security}} is classified into AFS category, I document that banks strategically time the recognitions of gains and losses on AFS securities to smooth earnings, to meet earnings targets, to reduce regulatory costs, or to facilitate seasonal equity offering. These evidences collaborate with my previous results that banks prefer classifying credit risky securities into AFS rather than into <b>trading</b> <b>category.</b> Finally, I investigate market reactions to fair value changes on AFS securities and to trading revenues from trading assets. I show that trading revenues are more persistent, with greater value relevance, and drive more significant stock returns. This evidence indicates that artificially classifying securities which are held for trading purpose into AFS category may have negative impacts on firm values. Given the investment decisions made by the managers, the second issue studied in this thesis is the financial reporting decisions made by banks. To elaborate, banks have discretions to classify the debt securities into available-for-sale (AFS) category vs. <b>trading</b> <b>category</b> depending on {{the purpose of the}} holding, while the classification decisions have very different impacts on firms' income statement. Therefore, I study how accounting treatments of AFS and <b>trading</b> <b>category</b> and their different impacts on firms' income statements affect reporting decisions. I find banks inclined to classify credit-riskier securities into AFS rather than into <b>trading</b> <b>category,</b> when banks have weak interest revenues, have high level of income-increasing discretional accruals, have concentrated assets, or have high level of risky assets. But I do not find classification decision is related to bank's capital adequacy ratio. Keywords: Bank holding companies; debt security investments; managerial compensation; trading assets; available-for-sale; SFAS 115; gains trading. This study examines U. S. banks' investment behaviors as well as their financial reporting decisions on debt security investments. Particularly, I focus on two separate but related issues. The first issue examined is whether and how managerial incentives, influenced by the compensation contracts, affect managers' investment decisions on debt securities in the U. S. banking industry. Using a sample composed of top 1, 000 bank holding companies from 2001 to 2009, I find that managers, when their wealth is more sensitive to stock return volatility, tend to structure the firms' debt investments with a higher proportion of credit risky securities. Provided that price of credit risky debt securities slumped during the recent financial crisis, that empirical evidence is consistent with the view that managerial compensation may induce excess risk-taking in the U. S. banking industry. The finding is relevant to both researchers and practitioners when they consider restructuring bankers' compensation. Zhou, Chunquan. Advisers: Woody Y. W. Wu; Danqing Young.

40|$|Agro-food {{trade between}} the BRIC {{countries}} has increased. Brazil and China contributed to the rapid increase of agro-food trade. The Russian Federation experienced the stagnating and the most volatile agro-food trade over time. The composition of agro-food trade for the BRIC countries varies by the BEC agro-food <b>trade</b> <b>categories</b> and over time. The prevailing {{in the composition of}} agro-food trade are BEC 122 and BEC 111 for Brazil and the Russian Federation, and BEC 122 and BEC 112 for India and China. Brazil and India have strengthened their market shares in agro-food {{trade between the}} BRIC countries, while the Russian Federation has experienced the most severe deterioration. The number and the share of trading partners that have traded every year vary between the BRIC countries and the BEC agro-food <b>trade</b> <b>categories</b> over time. Agro-food trade between the BRIC countries is positively associated with the GDP size and population size in importing countries, but negatively associated with the GDP size and population size in exporting countries as well as with distance.

However, unit-value indexes have been criticized especially by Irving B. Kravis and Robert E. Lipsey (1974). To {{examine the effect of}} using unit-value indexes on estimates of disaggregated import-demand elasticities, this paper compares regression results using unit-value indexes with results using U.

40|$|The marine {{aquarium}} hobby {{is a global}} industry with trade chains on six continents. This industry is undergoing rapid changes in hob byist preferences that are in part driven by global economies and technology. In an effort to better assess the past trends and help provide insight into future growth and demand, we assessed three different trade data sources, the United States-State of Florida Marine Life Landings, CITES stony coral imports, and United States Fish and Wildlife Service’s Law Enforcement Information Systems import data for ‘live rock’. Data for the past 10 years were analyzed and a clear trend of growth followed by decline was observed with the peak and degree of decline varying for the different <b>trade</b> <b>categories.</b> While the global economic downturn decreased trade volumes across the board other forces have dramatically affected the importation of coral reef products. ‘Live Rock’ and Florida produced ‘live sand’ dramatically decreased two {{years prior to the}} global economic recession. The decline of these <b>trade</b> <b>categories</b> coincides with rapid changes in technology used to maintain captive reef aquariums which allowed for the advent of the smaller “nano” reef tanks. Importing and exporting countries, CITES and other international government bodies, concerned Non-Governmental Organizations and scientist would greatly benefit from a deeper understanding of this industry from a producer and consumer standpoint in order to better predict how the {{marine aquarium}} hobby will be shaped by external forces in the future...|$|R
