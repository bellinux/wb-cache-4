2500|$|A fuel {{dispenser}} {{is used to}} pump gasoline, diesel, or other types of fuel into vehicles or containers. As the automobile was not invented yet, <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pump</b> was used for kerosene lamps and stoves. Sylvanus F. Bowser of Fort Wayne, Indiana invented the gasoline/petrol pump on September 5, 1885. Coincidentally, the term [...] "bowser" [...] is still often used {{in countries such as}} New Zealand and Australia as a reference to the {{fuel dispenser}}.|$|E

At some point, the owner, Juanita Flannery, shut down <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pumps</b> of <b>the</b> truck stop, with the diner remaining, but the name was kept. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pumps,</b> conspicuously large in size, remained installed {{in front of the}} diner.

2500|$|For {{us to live}} in an oil-dependent {{society is}} to live in fear. [...] The fear of {{terrorism}} funded with the very dollars we spend at <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pump.</b> [...] The fear of war to defend or defeat oil-fueled regimes in the Mideast. [...] The fear of what happens to our families and our jobs when, inevitably, oil prices soar out of sight. The fear of what is happening to our planet and the legacy we are leaving to our children and grandchildren.|$|E
2500|$|The Marchant, however, has, {{for every}} one of its ten columns of keys, a nine-ratio [...] "preselector transmission" [...] with its output spur gear {{at the top of the}} machine's body; that gear engages the {{accumulator}} gearing. When one tries to work out the numbers of teeth in such a transmission, a straightforward approach leads one to consider a mechanism like that in mechanical gasoline pump registers, used to indicate the total price. However, this mechanism is seriously bulky, and utterly impractical for a calculator; 90-tooth gears are likely to be found in <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pump.</b> Practical gears in the computing parts of a calculator cannot have 90 teeth. They would be either too big, or too delicate.|$|E
2500|$|The ranger station’s Gas and Lube Building is a wood-frame {{structure}} on a concrete foundation with exposed stone veneer.

30|$|The {{challenge}} in using electrospray with an electrostatic accelerator {{stems from the}} need for differential pumping, i.e., the spray must be done at or near atmospheric pressure, and <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> <b>pumped</b> away. <b>The</b> source must reside within the high voltage ball, so gases must be exhausted or pumped through a large potential difference. At intermediate pressures (where the Paschen curve is at a minimum) discharge occurs at lower voltages.|$|R

50|$|The group devises a plan {{to escape}} using Ben's truck, which is out of fuel, by {{refueling}} at a locked gas pump {{a couple hundred yards}} away.

Judy Rose, Tom, and Ben proceed up the hill toward <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pump,</b> but their plan begins to unravel when Ben falls from the bed of the truck and is left to defend himself. To their horror, the key to <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pump</b> is not among the bunch they brought with them. When Tom shoots the lock off, the leaking gasoline is ignited by a burning piece of wood in the truck. The resulting explosion kills both Tom and Judy.|$|E

50|$|Project Gaia {{studied the}} {{acceptance}} of the CleanCook ethanol stove in different urban and rural households in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil between 2006-2007. Because LPG was too costly for low-income families, most households in the study had been using firewood for cooking. In some areas, woodfuel collection is banned. Participating families could get fuel for cooking easily and cheaply at <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pump.</b> Households found ethanol easy, safe and affordable to use. The ability to buy ethanol in small quantities, rather than being forced to purchase large canisters of LPG, was most beneficial to low-income households.|$|E
