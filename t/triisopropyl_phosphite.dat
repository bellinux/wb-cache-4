40|$|The {{reactions}} of the phosphoranyl radicals formed {{by the addition of}} tert-butoxy radicals to trimethyl, triethyl, <b>triisopropyl,</b> and tri-tert-butyl <b>phosphite</b> have been examined by epr spectroscopy. At temperatures below ca. - 1150 the t-BuO 1 ̆e 56 (OMe) 3 and t-BuO 1 ̆e 56 (OEt) 3 decay with second-order kinetics. At higher temperatures all four radicals decay with first-order kinetics to yield phosphate and a tert-butyl radical. The rates of this 3 ̆b 2 -scission reaction increase by about an order of magnitude at - 600 along the series from t-BuO 1 ̆e 56 (OMe) 3 to to (t-BuO) 4 P. Arrhenius parameters for 3 ̆b 2 -scission have been determined by kinetic epr spectroscopy and by a competitive procedure. The latter method has shown that tert-butyl radicals react with phosphoranyl radicals with rate constants that are approximately the geometric mean of the rate constants for the bimolecular self-{{reactions of}} the tert-butyl and phosphoranyl radicals. The mechanism of 3 ̆b 2 -scission is discussed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

These new complexes have been characterized by IR and elemental analysis. Ligand-substitution reactions of these complexes with <b>tri(isopropyl)</b> <b>phosphite</b> (= L) in chlorobenzene (= CB) solutions gave (CO) 5 M(P(O-i-Pr) 3) as the sole reaction product. A thermal kinetics study of these ligand-substitution reactions under pseudo-first-order conditions in CB solutions, confirmed that these reactions proceed via a mechanism which is first-order in substrate and zero-order in P(O-i-Pr) 3 concentrations. Thus, a dissociative mechanism is proposed, which involves initial M-S bond breaking, followed by fast attack of the incoming nucleophile, L, at the resulting five-coordinate intermediate. Rate constants and activation parameters for these ligand substitution reactions have been determined and are discussed...|$|E
40|$|New cis-dichloro ruthenium-based pre-catalysts for olefin {{metathesis}} reaction were synthesised. This {{work was}} inspired by the report of complex cis-Caz- 1 in 2010, a 2 nd generation-type pre-catalyst displaying latent character and acknowledged as state-of-the-art for challenging transformation in olefin metathesis. The stability and the reactivity of such species led us to investigate the possibility to perform the catalysis in air with reagent-grade solvents, so that olefin metathesis reaction can be easily carried out in synthetic laboratories avoiding restricting inert conditions (Chapter 2). Next, further modifications of the original scaffold were attempted. Pre-catalyst cis-Caz- 1 was reacted with different silver salts leading to new cis-complexes. The first examples of Ru-F species for olefin metathesis reaction are reported in Chapter 3. The phosphite ligand plays a very important role in the cis-Caz- 1 scaffold and allowed the formation of the mono and the difluoro complexes selectively. Other silver salts were then employed such as trifluoroacetate, acetate, benzoate and pivalate. In all the studies involving silver salts, the anionic exchange reactions occurring among cis-Ruspecies in solution was observed. Electronic properties rather than sterics were responsible for the selective formation of the mixed complex trifluoroacetate/acetate 55 (Chapter 4). The results obtained with 2 nd generation systems prompted us to evaluate <b>triisopropyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> as ligand in 1 st generation-type complexes. Similar synergistic effects to complex cis-Caz- 1 were observed. The mixed PCy 3 /P(OiPr) 3 complex 56 displayed cis-geometry, high thermal stability and latent character compared to the bis-phosphine analogue Ind-I (Chapter 5). Last, a catalytic and structural study of commercially available pre-catalysts M 51 TM and M 52 TM in collaboration with Umicore was carried out together with the Grela group (Chapter 6). These Hoveyda-Grubbs type pre-catalysts showed an interesting activity in ring closing metathesis, allowing the isolation of di- and tri- substituted ring-products at room temperature, as well as in cross metathesis, where some examples of biologically active compounds were obtained...|$|E

Published only in printed form, {{availability}} see BibidThe thesis {{deals with}} the methodology development {{for the purpose of}} practical synthesis of cyclic amino alcohol based natural products – amaminol and lepadin families by complying with the principles of ideal synthesis and especially step economy. In the first chapter a historical background of the conjugate reduction reaction is laid out and the development of currently one of the most selective conjugate reduction methods is described in detail. The method is based on the copper hydride chemistry employing <b>triisopropyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> as a ligand which {{is the key to the}} reduced reaction power and hence the high selectivity of the process. In the second chapter a comprehensive review of the decahydroquinoline based natural products synthesis – pumiliotoxin C and lepadin family is provided. More than forty total syntheses are categorized according to the strategy employed and analyzed in detail placing special emphasis on the construction steps. A proposal for cyclic amino alcohol natural products biosynthesis was also put forth. In the third chapter the design of two complementary approaches to lepadin alkaloids is provided dealing with both non-biogenetic and bio-inspired approaches. The studies performed resulted in the development of two new methodologies. First, the orthogonally protected amino epoxide was identified and its successful catalytic coupling with cyclic alkenyl copper reagent was discovered and developed into a scalable method. This chemistry provides the solution to two problems: the problematic reactivity of Boc-amino epoxides with organometallic reagents and the inability to orthogonally release the reactive benzylamino functionality of the products of dibenzyl-amino epoxide reaction with organometallic reagents. The second methodology – the unprecedented silica gel mediated spontaneous stereocontrolled allylic aminocyclization to form octahydroquinolines was discovered. This reaction is an example of the remote (1, 4 - from hydroxyl stereocenter, 1, 5 - from amino stereocenter) stereo induction. Such a reaction previously would only be possible to achieve using transition metal catalysis (Pd, Ir) and externally introduced chirality of the leaving group stereocenter (either by using chiral ligands or stoichiometric chiral reagents). The spontaneous nature and ease with which this reaction proceeds might also provide an implication on how lepadins are biosynthesized in the Nature...|$|E
