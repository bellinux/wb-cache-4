Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill. Reforming newspapers quickly exposed {{the law and the}} bonus was repealed in January 1874. Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government.|$|E

5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It {{was found that}} a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity {{of these types of}} seeds has been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E
5|$|Anyone {{attempting}} {{to cross the}} control strips would leave footprints, which were quickly detected by patrols. This enabled the guards to identify otherwise undetected escape attempts, recording how many individuals had crossed, where escape attempts were being made and at which times of day escapees were active. From this information, the guards were able to determine where and when patrols needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased,</b> where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was required, and which areas needed additional fortifications.|$|E

5|$|He {{opened his}} camp on 11 April 1936 (Easter Even). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson from Hull, {{who had been}} the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announcing the opening of the camp and inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board, at a cost of between 35shillings (£1.75) and £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. The advert proved successful, and over the first summer season the capacity of the camp had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> from 500 to 2,000, to cope with the demand.|$|E
5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014 Liverpool F.C. {{signed a}} legal {{agreement}} with Liverpool City Council and Your Housing Group to redevelop the surrounding Anfield area.

5|$|In the 1930s {{and early}} 1940s, the Navy divided carrier-borne bombers into two types: the torpedo bomber and the dive bomber, each with crews {{of two or}} three men. Wartime {{experience}} showed that pilots could aim bombs and torpedoes without assistance from other crewmembers as well as navigate with the aid of radio beacons and the development of more powerful engines meant that faster aircraft no longer needed a rear gunner for self-defense. Furthermore, the consolidation of the two types of bombers greatly increased the flexibility of a carrier's air group and allowed the number of fighters in an air group <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{worked on}} modifying the AH-56 design {{to address the}} {{vibration}} and other issues. As a precaution, Cheyenne #9 (s/n 66-8834) was fitted with an ejection seat for the pilot after the March accident. The downward firing ejection seat {{was placed in the}} forward seat in place of the gunner's station. This prototype would be used for all remaining envelope expansion flights. Prototype #9 also received an upgraded transmission and drivetrain, and a hinged rear canopy in place of the original sliding canopy around 1970. The new transmission allowed the T64-GE-16 turboshaft engine output <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> from a derated 3,435horsepower (2,561kW) to 3,925horsepower (2,927kW).

5|$|Long {{duration}} {{missions to}} the ISS {{are referred to}} as ISS Expeditions. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS. The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members. Crew size is expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational. The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past , having exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} changes undergone by {{the ship}} {{during the war}} are not entirely clear. Photographic evidence shows that four Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns were added, one pair to her searchlight platform and the other pair on the bridge wings, although Ottawa retained her 2-pounder guns even after the Oerlikons were added. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> to at least 60 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|This {{involved}} {{the replacement of}} 'A' gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, the removal of her director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge {{in exchange for a}} Type 271 target indication radar, exchanging her two 2-pounder AA guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform, and the removal of her 12-pounder AA gun.

5|$|Franklin Pierce won {{the presidential}} election, and in 1853 made Davis his Secretary of War. In this capacity, Davis began the Pacific Railroad Surveys {{in order to}} {{determine}} various possible routes for the proposed Transcontinental Railroad. He promoted the Gadsden Purchase of today's southern Arizona from Mexico, partly because it would provide an easier southern route for the new railroad; the Pierce administration agreed, and the land was purchased in December 1853. He saw the size of the regular army as insufficient to fulfill its mission, and maintained that salaries would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased,</b> something which had not occurred for 25 years. Congress agreed and increased the pay scale, and added four regiments which increased the army's size from about 11,000 to about 15,000. Davis also introduced general usage of the rifles that he had used successfully during the Mexican–American War. As a result, both the morale and capability of the army was improved. He became involved in public works when Pierce gave him responsibility for construction of the Washington Aqueduct and an expansion of the U.S. Capitol, both of which he managed closely. The Pierce administration ended in 1857 after Pierce's loss of the Democratic nomination to James Buchanan. Davis's term was to end with Pierce's, so he ran for the Senate, was elected, and re-entered it on March 4, 1857.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the {{concession}} for passenger transport between Voss and Granvin was transferred from NSB's bus division to HSD and Bergen–Hardanger–Voss Billag. At the same time, {{the number of}} weekly services increased from 14 to 34. This was largely {{a result of the}} 1975 declaration by Hordaland County Council to support the closure of the line. In 1980, the railway had 60,000 passengers. A halt was opened at Mala in 1981, but then all passenger traffic was terminated on 2 June 1985. Class 64 had remained in use until the end, and there existed no political desire to invest in new rolling stock. Freight transport was retained, at first using El9, and later shunting locomotives {{because of the lack of}} maintenance. From 1 March 1989, all transport on the line was terminated. NSB wanted to renovate the line and continue operations. Among the plans were to transport metal from the smelters in Hardanger via the Hardanger Line to Continental Europe. This would have required the axle load <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased.</b> Other plans were to extend some of the departures of the Bergen Commuter Rail from Voss to Granvin or operate commercially profitable tourist trains similar to the service provided on the Flåm Line.|$|E
