Soil types in <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> watershed {{can be divided}} into the Metz-San Emigdio, Sorrento-Mocho, Myford, Alo-Bosanko, Cieneba-Anaheim-Soper, and Friant-Cieneba-Exchequer associations, in order from low to high elevations.

5|$|Before Spanish {{colonization}} in the 1770s, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Creek watershed was {{inhabited by}} the Acjachemen or Juañeno Native Americans. The Juañeno were named by Spanish missionaries who built Mission San Juan Capistrano {{on the banks}} of a stream they named San Juan Creek. The watershed was used mainly for agriculture and ranching until the 1950s when residential suburban development began on a large scale. Since then, the human population has continued to encroach on floodplains of local streams. Flooding in the 20th and 21st centuries has caused considerable property damage in <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> watershed.|$|E

5|$|Historically, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> {{watershed}} supported up to 12 invertebrate species, 5 fish species, 12 amphibian species, 35 reptile species, 143 bird species, and 42 mammal species, which {{benefited from}} the diverse vegetation communities present. Some streams and ponds host federally listed endangered/threatened species such as tidewater goby, fairy shrimp, and California red-legged frog. Federally listed bird species include least Bell's vireo, California gnatcatcher, California least tern, and southwestern willow flycatcher. Other listed species include Pacific pocket mouse and Quino checkerspot butterfly. As urbanization continues to increase in <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> watershed, most sensitive species have been pushed back to the foothills, mountains, and agricultural/ranching areas of the watershed.|$|E

5|$|By 1918, the Army {{realized}} that there was a shortage of physicians specializing in anesthesia, a low salary specialty required in the military operating rooms. Therefore, the Army reluctantly began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees.

5|$|In 1996, severe floods {{caused by}} heavy rainstorms in <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> {{watershed}} caused both San Juan and Trabuco creeks to overflow, destroying long {{sections of the}} concrete river banks near their confluence. The damage was attributed to severe erosion at the base which caused the concrete to lose support and crumble. A nearby residential community was threatened, but the floods receded before the levee collapsed and no serious harm was done. The failed sections were repaired with grouted riprap.|$|E

5|$|On October 2, {{two days}} before it made {{landfall}} on southwestern Hispaniola, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Weather Bureau issued a gale warning from Barahona in the Dominican Republic to Sud-Est, Haiti. Advisories recommended small craft in the southern portions of the countries to remain at port. Later that day, the gale warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning in southwestern Haiti. On the day of when Flora made landfall, advisories recommended all citizens on beaches and in low-lying areas west of Santo Domingo to evacuate. Carmelo Di Franco, the provisional Director of Civic Defense for the Dominican Republic, organized safety procedures and the dissemination of tropical cyclone bulletins from <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Weather Bureau. Di Franco also organized for the transmission of hurricane emergency information to citizens, believed to reduce the loss of life. On the afternoon before the hurricane struck, {{the head of the}} Haitian Red Cross prohibited radio broadcasts of tropical cyclone advisories for fear of panic among citizens. As a result, many thought the hurricane would miss the country.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> {{watershed}} {{is home to}} sixteen major native plant {{communities and}} hundreds of animal species. However, the watershed is projected to be 48 percent urbanized by 2050. In addition, urban runoff has changed flow patterns in San Juan Creek and introduced pollutants to the river system. Although the main stem of San Juan Creek {{does not have any}} major water diversions or dams, some of its tributaries, including Trabuco and Oso Creeks, have been channelized or otherwise heavily modified by urbanization.|$|E
5|$|The black-on-white painted pottery {{found at}} Chaco Canyon {{originated}} from various places throughout the Four Corners region, including the Red Mesa Valley, northeastern Arizona, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> River, and the Chuska Valley, forty miles distant.

5|$|While Esther was {{becoming}} a powerful hurricane over the open Atlantic, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Weather Bureau office issued a small craft advisory for the Leeward Islands, United States Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.

The agency later issued a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia on September 18.|$|E
5|$|Before urban development, {{the damage}} caused by {{overgrazing}} during the Spanish period was still considered capable of recovery. However, the completion of Interstate 5 through the middle of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Creek watershed in the 1950s transformed the area into a bedroom community for Los Angeles and permanently erased many remaining grassland, meadow and riparian zones. The percent of urbanized land increased from 3percent in 1964 to 18percent in 1988. In the 1990s, the watershed was 32 percent urbanized. With continuing development in east San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Mission Viejo, the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E
