5|$|Although {{the door}} was unlocked, a thumb screw inside {{apparently}} {{made it difficult for}} a child to open. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>had</b> a knob on the outside, but only a small turn latch on the inside.|$|E
5|$|A bronze-covered door, {{with relief}} panels {{depicting}} figures, opens onto the entrance hall. In Burges's time <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>had</b> a letterbox, {{in the form}} of Mercury, the messenger of the gods. The letterbox is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. The porch contains a white marble seat and column, and on the floor is a mosaic of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges. Cartooned by H.W. Lonsdale, it resembles the cave canem floor at Pompei.|$|E
5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E

25|$|Victoria Hall {{was a large}} {{concert hall}} on Toward Road facing Mowbray Park. The hall {{was the scene of}} a tragedy on 16 June 1883 when 183 {{children}} died. During a variety show, children rushed towards a staircase for treats. At the bottom of the staircase, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been opened inward and bolted {{in such a way as}} to leave only a gap wide enough for one child to pass at a time. The children surged down the stairs and those at the front were trapped and crushed by the weight of the crowd behind them.|$|E
500|$|The police entered around 7:54am with a {{sledgehammer}} {{through the back}} door. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock. They found five bodies with multiple gunshot wounds, Nevill downstairs {{in the kitchen and}} the rest upstairs. Twenty-five shots had been fired, mostly at close range. In what order the family was killed is not known. A telephone was lying on one of the kitchen surfaces with its receiver off the hook, next to several [...]22 shells. The police said chairs and stools were overturned, and there was broken crockery, a broken sugar basin, and what looked like blood on the floor. A ceiling light lampshade had been broken.|$|E
2500|$|For {{most of its}} history, Number 10 was {{accessible}} to the public. Early security consisted of two police officers. [...] One stood guard outside the door. [...] The other was stationed inside to open it. Since <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>had</b> no keyhole, the inside officer depended upon the lone outside officer.|$|E

2500|$|Lawrence's {{parents died}} {{within a few}} months of each other in 1797 and he gave up his house in Picadilly, where he had moved from Old Bond Street, to set up his studio in the family home in Greek Street. By now, {{to keep up with the}} demand for replicas of his {{portrait}}s, he was making use of studio assistants, most notable of whom would be William Etty and George Henry Harlow. The early years of the nineteenth century saw Lawrence's portrait practice continue to flourish: amongst his sitters were major political figures such as Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, whose wife Lady Caroline Lamb was also painted by Lawrence. The king commissioned portraits of his daughter-in-law Caroline, the estranged wife of the Prince of Wales, and his granddaughter Charlotte. Lawrence stayed at the Montague House, the residence of the princess in Blackheath, while he was painting the portraits and thus became implicated in the [...] "delicate investigation" [...] into Caroline's morals. He swore an affidavit that although he had on occasion been alone with the princess, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>had</b> never been locked or bolted and he had [...] "not the least objection for all the world to have heard or seen what took place". Expertly defended by Spencer Perceval, he was exonerated.|$|E
2500|$|The wreck was {{examined}} and videotaped by remotely operated underwater vehicles and by divers from a Norwegian company, Rockwater A/S, contracted {{for the investigation}} work. The official report indicated that the locks on the bow door had failed from the strain of the waves and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>had</b> separated {{from the rest of}} the vessel, pulling the ramp behind it ajar. The bow visor and ramp had been torn off at points that would not trigger an [...] "open" [...] or [...] "unlatched" [...] warning on the bridge, as is the case in normal operation or failure of the latches. The bridge was also situated too far back on the ferry for the visor to be seen from there. While there was video monitoring of the inner ramp, the monitor on the bridge was not visible from the conning station. The bow visor was under-designed, as manufacturing and approval process did not consider the visor and its attachments as critical items regarding ship safety. The first metallic bang was believed to have been the sound of the visor's lower locking mechanism failing, and subsequent noises were the visor 'flapping' against the hull as the other locks failed, before tearing free and exposing the bow ramp. The subsequent failure of the bow ramp allowed water into the vehicle deck, which was identified as the main cause of the capsizing and sinking: RORO ferries with their wide vehicle decks are particularly vulnerable to capsizing if the car deck is even slightly flooded because of free surface effect: the fluid's swirling motion across such a large area hampers the boat's ability to right itself after rolling with a wave.|$|E
2500|$|Rawle {{explained}} that Silas has accepted {{he is to}} be in the secure psychiatric unit until he dies so he plans to manipulate the outside world from inside as a means of living out his murderous fantasies. Rawle revealed that Silas has a [...] "nagging feeling" [...] that he made a mistake in killing India and that he wishes he could put it right. He said that his character meant to murder Texas so he now wants to kill her as she is the [...] "one that got away". Hendrickse-Spendlove also commented that Silas initially intended to kill Texas so she is [...] "the final piece of the puzzle for him, and then his 'work' will be complete". Silas tells Texas another murder will soon occur which is an opportunity to [...] "play games". He is [...] "delighted" [...] to have an audience during the visits and begins to [...] "make lots of threats". Rawle {{explained that}} Silas sees that Texas has India's ring which is [...] "symbolic" [...] for Silas as he had previously taken it as a trophy. Texas taunts Silas with the ring and agrees to exchange it for information on Lynsey's murder. Rawle explained that Silas tells Texas that Will Savage (James Atherton) is responsible for Lynsey's murder which is because [...] "Silas knows that Texas and Will are close, so he points the finger of suspicion his way". He said that Silas would [...] "put quite a few people in the frame" [...] for the murder. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that Texas is [...] "manipulated" [...] by Silas when he makes her believe Will is responsible for Lynsey's murder. Silas escapes from hospital and goes to visit Texas. Hendrickse-Spendlove explained that Texas [...] "opens her front door, sees Silas and thinks, 'This is it - my life is over', to see him standing there with no police restraint, knowing that he murdered her sister India, is absolutely petrifying". Silas tells Texas that he now intends to complete what he began. Hendrickse-Spendlove would not reveal whether Texas survives the ordeal but said that Texas is [...] "never going to be safe again" [...] regardless of the outcome. In August 2012, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap confirmed that there were no current plans for Silas to return, but <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>had</b> been left open for him. On 20 January 2016, Silas is set to return to visit Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison after he was framed by Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) for the murders and attempted murders at Dee Valley Hospital. Silas left again after he killed Lindsey.|$|E
