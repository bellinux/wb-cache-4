40|$|This study {{proposes a}} rule of payroll tax {{adjustment}}, arguing that <b>the</b> optimal <b>payroll</b> tax adjustment rate should be set {{in such a way}} that the marginal excess burden associated with a payroll tax adjustment is kept to a minimum and that the implicit return rates for current retirees are guaranteed at certain levels. We find that <b>the</b> optimal <b>payroll</b> tax adjustment rate is a function of labor supply elasticity, the perceived marginal benefit-tax linkage, <b>the</b> pre-adjusted <b>payroll</b> tax rate, <b>the</b> population growth rate, the wage growth rate, and the guaranteed return rate. The sign of <b>the</b> optimal <b>payroll</b> tax adjustment rate is ambiguous. <b>The</b> optimal <b>payroll</b> tax adjustment rate falls in accordance with the population growth rate and the wage growth rate, but rises with the guaranteed return rate. The absolute value of <b>the</b> optimal <b>payroll</b> tax adjustment rate rises with both the pre-adjusted tax rate and the elasticity of labor supply, but falls with the perceived marginal benefit-tax linkage...|$|R

In July 2005, 9,592 people applied for unemployment services and <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> of metropolitan firms declined by 13.6% between July 2005 and July 2007, indicating an estimated loss of 70,000 jobs. The sectors most affected were service-related industries, fluctuating with the population. The only sector to truly thrive after landfall was construction, which was in high demand to make needed repairs and rebuild destroyed homes.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Ramsey was {{approached}} by Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Bacher, who asked him to join the Manhattan Project. Ramsey agreed to do so, but {{the intervention of the}} Project director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was necessary in order to prise him away from the Secretary of War's office. A compromise was agreed to, whereby Ramsey remained on <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> of the Secretary of War, and was merely seconded to the Manhattan Project. In October 1943, Group E-7 of the Ordnance Division was created at the Los Alamos Laboratory with Ramsey as group leader, with the task of integrating the design and delivery of the nuclear weapons being built by the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Nichols was {{promoted}} to brigadier general on 22 January 1946. Following the departure of Major General Thomas Farrell, Nichols became Groves' deputy, although he also continued as district engineer. Asked {{to spend more time}} on weapons production and storage, Nichols established a new underground assembly plant at the Mound Laboratories in Miamisburg, Ohio, and recommended that Sandia Base be transferred from the United States Army Air Corps to the Manhattan District. In December, Nichols recommended the closing down of the alpha tracks of the Y-12 plant, thereby cutting <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2 million a month. Henceforth, uranium enrichment would be performed by the gaseous diffusion plants, the wartime K-25 and the new K-27, which had commenced operation in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Scientific Atlanta's first {{business}} {{focus was}} antennas for military and industrial use. Finances were tight at the fledgling firm. When {{they could not}} afford an automatic antenna pattern recorder, of which there was only one such machine on the market, Robinson decided to build his own. When word in the industry spread companies began contacting Scientific Atlanta. Within six months of the development of the device, Robinson sold units to Western Electric, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, General Electric, Convair, American Machine and Foundry, and many other large corporations of the era. Within eight years of operating, the firm had captured 60% of the global market share of electronic instruments for testing and designing antennas, had broken ground on a 25 acre facility in Northeast Atlanta, and had 240 employees on <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> including 40 engineers.|$|E

Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games, and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game. Eventually, he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events and put employees on <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> of the NFL to investigate potential betting scams.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{spent much}} of early 1953 in enacting the remainder of its legislative program. St. Laurent {{did not wish to}} call an election until after Queen Elizabeth's Coronation on 2 June and eventually scheduled it for 10 August. Drew made large numbers of promises to the voters, and attempted to exploit a Defence Ministry scandal which had broken earlier in the year (at the Petawawa, Ontario army base, an investigation had found frauds which included placing horses on <b>the</b> <b>payroll),</b> but the Liberals were not seriously challenged. The Liberals lost 20 seats from their 1949 high-water mark, but still constituted almost two-thirds of the House of Commons, and no minister was defeated. Howe was again easily elected for Port Arthur.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{building}} the dam received {{an average of}} 80¢ an hour; <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> for the dam was among {{the largest in the}} nation. The workers were mainly pulled from Grant, Lincoln, Douglas, and Okanogan counties and women were allowed to work only in the dorms and the cookhouse. Around 8,000 people worked on the project, and Frank A. Banks served as the chief construction engineer. Bert A. Hall was the chief inspector who would accept the dam from the contractors. Orin G. Patch served as the chief of concrete. Construction conditions were dangerous and 77 workers died.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{warnings}} from Noseworthy to control spending, Dunderdale's first budget saw spending increase by 4.9 percent. Spending {{was focused on}} infrastructure, health care, social programs, Nalcor Energy {{as well as other}} areas. The budget included tax credits for child care, volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on home heating fuel, which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The budget raised the threshold on <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> tax exemption from $1 million to $1.2 million. Despite a $598 million surplus for the previous year and a $59 surplus forecasted for the coming year, the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities. However, on November 16, 2011, Dunderdale's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the surplus for the 2011-2012, fiscal year was now projected to be $755.8 million, with the added surplus going towards the debt. In the audited financial statements released in January 2013, the surplus for the 2011-2012 was $882.8 million, with the overall debt falling to $7.8 billion.|$|E

5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of <b>the</b> <b>payroll</b> tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
