50|$|Although rhythm {{is not a}} {{prosodic}} {{variable in}} the way that pitch or loudness are, it is usual to treat a language's characteristic rhythm as a part of its prosodic phonology. It has often been asserted that languages exhibit regularity in the timing of successive units of speech, a regularity referred to as isochrony, and that every language may be assigned one of three rhythmical types: stress-timed (where <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intervals between stressed syllables is relatively constant), syllable-timed (where <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> successive syllables are relatively constant) and mora-timed (where <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> successive morae are relatively constant). As explained in the isochrony article, this claim has not been supported by scientific evidence.|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{analysis}} and synthesis experiments {{have shown that}} duration and intonation patterns {{are the two most}} important prosodic features responsible for the quality of synthesized speech. In this paper a set of features are proposed which will influence <b>the</b> <b>duration</b> patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequence of the sound units. These features are derived from <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>duration</b> analysis. Duration analysis provides a rough estimate of features, which affect <b>the</b> <b>duration</b> patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequence of the sound units. But, <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>durations</b> from these features using either linear models or with a fixed rulebase is not accurate. From the analysis it is observed that there exists a gross trend in <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> syllables with respect to syllable position in the phrase, syllable position in the word, word position in the phrase, syllable identity and the context of the syllable (preceding and the following syllables). These features can be further used to predict <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syllables more accurately by exploring various nonlinear models. For analying <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> sound units, broadcast news data in Telugu is used as the speech corpus.
