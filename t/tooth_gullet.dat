2500|$|The {{shape of}} the <b>tooth</b> <b>gullet</b> is highly {{optimized}} and designed by the sawyer and sawfiler. It varies according to the mill, {{as well as the}} type and condition of the wood. [...] Frozen logs often require a [...] "frost notch" [...] ground into the gullet to break the chips. The {{shape of the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>gullet</b> is created when the blade is manufactured and its shape is automatically maintained with each sharpening. [...] The sawfiler will need to maintain the grinding wheel's profile with periodic dressing of the wheel.|$|E
50|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} of the <b>tooth</b> <b>gullet</b> is not {{as common}} as in band saws, as {{in the majority of}} cases it is a heavier plate gauge and is not bent around band wheels multiple thousands of times per run.|$|E
5000|$|Wider {{material}} can be flat rolled with the rolls tilting {{such that the}} [...] "short" [...] edge is lengthened, with thickness slightly reduced, to equal the [...] "long" [...] edge. The material is then straight if properly processed. Several different types of these machines are available, ranging from position controlled to pressure controlled machines. Also, machines are available with automatic self checking features. If the material has residual stress as in toothed bandsaw blades, the rolls must not uniformly apply cross strain, as the inherent strain will distort the strip. In these cases, rolls exert corrective strain in a linear narrow strip inboard of the edge each side. In the case of sawblades with teeth on, the corrective squeezed strip on the toothed edge is located along the <b>tooth</b> <b>gullet,</b> and corrective squeeze on the toothed side must be about 2.5 times the corrective force on the plain edge.|$|E
6000|$|... "An' I might knock your <b>teeth</b> {{into your}} <b>gullet</b> if you butt in again. You can answer them {{questions}} later on. Now, boys, we're decent an' law-abidin', an' {{we got to}} handle this right an' regular. How far do you reckon we've come, Pierre?" ...|$|R
60|$|The villains, though {{taken by}} surprise, were no cravens. Apparently {{they had already}} {{discharged}} their fire-arms, for only one fired at our hero with a pistol, and missed his aim. Flinging the weapon at his adversary with a yell of disappointment, he missed his aim a second time. At the same moment another of the band--one of the tallest and most ferocious-looking--sprang upon the youth with terrible fury. He knew well, apparently, how to use his weapon; and Lawrence felt that his experience at school now stood him in good stead. As the weapons of these giants flew around with rapid whirl and clash, the others stood aside to see the end. Doubtless they would have taken unfair advantage of their foe if they could, but Lawrence, turning {{his back to the}} wall, where Manuela crouched, prevented that. At last one dastardly wretch, seeing that his comrade was getting the worst of it, bethought him of his carbine, and began hurriedly to load. Our hero noted the act, and understood its fatal significance. With a bound like that of a tiger he sprang at the man, and cut him down with a back-handed blow, turning, even in the act, just in time to guard a sweeping cut dealt at his head. With a straight point he thrust his sword through <b>teeth,</b> <b>gullet,</b> and skull of his tall adversary, until it stood six inches out behind his head. Then, without a moment's pause, he leaped upon the nearest of the other bandits.|$|R
5000|$|A precise {{profile of}} the <b>tooth</b> (including <b>gullet</b> area, hook angle and top {{clearance}} angle) must be maintained for proper saw operation and wood chip removal. Ease of cutting greatly depends on this. The shape {{is determined by the}} type of wood and cutting conditions. A saw filer will maintain the gullet shape by manually shaping the grinding wheel with a dressing stone, and the set up of his grinding machine. Variations include face angle, face length, back angle, gullet width and depth, and a frost notch (if necessary). Typical bandsaw tooth dimensions are 1-3/4" [...] tooth space x 3/4" [...] gullet depth x 3/4" [...] gullet width (grinding wheel width) x 30deg face angle x 16deg back angle.|$|R
40|$|Bandsaw blades {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used tools of the wood cutting industry. Their base materials are mostly unalloyed or poorly Cr-alloyed tool steels. After the review of the handsaw blade's cyclic load characteristics, we present the typical failures, which can be, originate in it's cracking. With the use of these information an overall systematization has been set up by the bandsaw blade cracking types and its root causes. The main place of the failure is the weld and the heat-affected zone's area where the welding can failure or the lack of toughness can produce cracking. An other zone, where cracking may appear is the bandsaw blade's <b>tooth</b> <b>gullet</b> because it raises the stress intensity factor. Special material testing methods have been made to investigate the tooth gullet's notch sensitivity from the test results that a comparison of several bandsaw blade base material, are reviewed. With the use of the results a notch sensitivity rating system has been worked out, which can be used to rate different handsaw blade base material's notch sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of various factors on {{the mechanics of}} wood cutting by a spring-supported, vertically oscillating frame saw are examined. These include saw tooth pitch, <b>tooth</b> <b>gullet</b> depth and capacity, saw blade overhang, oscillation frequency and amplitude, and log feed speed. [...] The efficiency and effectiveness of the cutting process are dependent primarily on the relative path of motion taken by each tooth through the wood during sawing; thus it is the tooth traces upon which the attention {{of this study is}} focused. The factors listed above govern the shapes of these traces, and thus it is the determination of optimum values for some of these factors which is the main objective here. [...] For the purpose of tooth trace analyses, a computer program has been developed which, when coupled with plotting facilities, allows the user to view a set of simulated relative tooth paths. The program incorporates features which accommodate the other than normal kinematic characteristics of the plate spring supported sash, and combines these influences with those of the factors listed above. Most importantly it allows for the introduction of a non-constant log feed speed function, specifically one which combines a constant with a sinusoidal portion. [...] A detailed analysis of the produced plots with a view to solution to inherent sash saw problems comprises the final portion of this paper. From specific observations and assumptions with respect to the mechanics of cutting of the saw teeth, simultaneous equations are developed and solved for three system variables. Finally, conclusions are drawn and recommendations made with respect {{to the development of a}} more efficient MUN (Memorial University of Newfoundland) Sash Saw design...|$|E
