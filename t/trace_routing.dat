40|$|Despite the convenience, {{ubiquitous}} computing suffers from many threats and security risks. Security considerations in the ubiquitous network {{are required to}} create enriched and more secure ubiquitous environments. The address resolution protocol (ARP) is a protocol used to identify the IP address and the physical address of the associated network card. ARP is designed to work without problems in general environments. However, since {{it does not include}} security measures against malicious attacks, in its design, an attacker can impersonate another host using ARP spoofing or access important information. In this paper, we propose a new detection scheme for ARP spoofing attacks using a <b>routing</b> <b>trace,</b> which can be used to protect the internal network. <b>Tracing</b> <b>routing</b> can find the change of network movement path. The proposed scheme provides high constancy and compatibility because it does not alter the ARP protocol. In addition, it is simple and stable, as it does not use a complex algorithm or impose extra load on the computer system...|$|R
50|$|Another {{improvement}} {{comes from}} better on-board circuitry {{that increases the}} signal-to-noise ratio and overall signal quality compared to the frequently quite noisy AWE32 and Sound Blaster 16 boards. This improvement is most notable with the AWE64 Gold, because of its superior gold plated RCA connector outputs. The improvement also comes from increased integration of components on AWE64 compared to its predecessors. Increased integration means the board can be simpler and <b>trace</b> <b>routing</b> to components is reduced, decreasing the amount of noise-inducing signal travel. This also {{made it possible to}} reduce the size of AWE64's board noticeably, compared to AWE32.|$|E
50|$|PCI-X has {{technological}} and economical disadvantages compared to PCI Express. The 64-bit parallel interface requires difficult <b>trace</b> <b>routing,</b> because, {{as with all}} parallel interfaces, the signals from the bus must arrive simultaneously or within a very short window, and noise from adjacent slots may cause interference. The serial interface of PCIe suffers fewer such problems and therefore does not require such complex and expensive designs. PCI-X buses, like standard PCI, are half-duplex bidirectional, whereas PCIe buses are full-duplex bidirectional. PCI-X buses run only {{as fast as the}} slowest device, whereas PCIe devices are able to independently negotiate the bus speed. Also, PCI-X slots are longer than PCIe 1x through PCIe 16x, which makes it impossible to make short cards for PCI-X. PCI-X slots take quite a bit of space on motherboards, which can be a problem for ATX and smaller form factors.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{drop test}} results of 2 nd-level {{assemblies}} can {{be influenced by}} numerous impact factors. The explicit definition of drop testing conditions by the JEDEC standard JESD 22 -B 111 was intended to create a highly repeatable, and thus comparable, experimental setup. Recent developments showed, however, shifting failure modes from component to PCB side. Comprehensive drop tests were executed with 3 different memory packages. Failure analysis surprisingly found electrical fails of the assemblies on PCB side with broken copper traces next to the PCB pads. Detailed investigations showed a strong influence of the copper <b>trace</b> <b>routing</b> on their failure probability. Broken copper traces were only found when their routing direction was aligned to the dominating PCB deflection. The new experimental insights were proven by a two steps simulation approach. In the first step, an experimentally calibrated and validated 3 -D JEDEC board model has been set up. In the second step, th e copper <b>trace</b> <b>routing</b> effect was investigated by a 3 -D sub-model of a single BGA component. The direction of copper <b>trace</b> <b>routing</b> showed a clear effect on the plastic copper strain. Simulation results were able to prove the experimental observations. Using these results, reliability modeling was started for two drop test configurations: 4 -screw and 6 -screw board clamping. In both cases, the sequence of failure of the components on the board was matched by using a combined criterion of plastic strain-rate and resultant force integral. The lifetime model based on this criterion was able to predict the experimental cycles-to-failure with less than 25 % deviation...|$|E

40|$|These authors contributed {{equally to}} this work Certain types of errors, such as {{hardware}} failure, link failure or congestion {{can only be}} detected at runtime of network as these are failures that happen when the network is in operation. Today, there exist only preliminary tools to detect and pinpoint such kind of errors, typified by ping and <b>trace</b> <b>rout.</b> In this paper we introduce a formal and comprehensive way to fully test networks at runtime which enables us to pinpoint the exact rule that is causing the problem. Our test packet generation algorithm first picks {{a relatively small number}} of test packets and corresponding input ports so that these packets exercise all the rules in network. By periodically sending these packets through the network, we can constantly monitor the health of the network. Whenever an error happens, the fault localization algorithm uses the result of all test packets to find out the exact rule that is in fault. 1...|$|R

40|$|The JEDEC {{drop test}} {{has become a}} popular method for the {{assessment}} of the dynamic mechanical reliability of 2 nd level assemblies. It delivers repeatable results and is thus well suited {{for the development of a}} virtual lifetime model based on FEM simulations. Detailed experimental studies showed PCB copper trace fractures as the dominating failure mode. The virtual risk assessment applied a two steps approach (sub-modeling technique). The overall PCB motion was computed by a global model of the entire JEDEC board. In the second step, the copper trace load was investigated with a single component. The resultant plastic strain showed a clear dependency on the relation between copper <b>trace</b> <b>routing</b> and dominating PCB deformation. A strain map was derived which indicates the strain level as a pre-factor to each <b>trace</b> <b>routing</b> condition. The validity of the strain map concept was proven by comparison with experimental results. The strain map was able to precisely identify the f ailing interconnections at each component position. The combination of interconnection strain energy from the global model and the strain map was able to match the experimental sequence of failures across the JEDEC board exactly. A lifetime model was derived which is able to predict the cycles-to-failure of three different package types with less than 25 % deviation to the tests. Hence, this lifetime model sets the ground for virtual prototyping that also includes the BGA drop test endurance...|$|E

40|$|The {{dependency}} of {{the failure}} mechanisms of PCB/BGA assemblies subjected to drop impact on board designs variations is investigated in this study. Two key parameters are considered: the copper pad size and the <b>trace</b> <b>routing.</b> It is shown that the assemblies can exhibit various failure modes such as copper trace crack, pad cratering on PCB or crack at interposer on package side by varying these board design parameters, due to stress/strain redistribution in assembly, {{as well as the}} location change of the weakest link. The tradeoff between these failure modes during the design change is also investigated. With the help of finite element simulations, reliable failure indicators for each possible failure mode can be defined. With all these indicators considered, it is therefore possible to establish rules for predicting the failure behavior and the lifetime of PCB/BGA assemblies subjected to drop impacts, depending on the board layout...|$|E
40|$|The high {{variability}} in traffic demands, the advanced networking services at various layers (e. g., load- balancers), and the steady penetration of SDN technology and virtualization make the crucial network troubleshooting tasks ever more challenging over multi-tenant environments. Service degradation is first realized by the users and, {{as being the}} only one having visibility to many relevant information (e. g., connection details) required for accurate and timely problem resolution, the infrastructure layer is often forced upon continuous monitoring resulting in wasteful resource management, {{not to mention the}} long time frames. In this paper, we propose an End-host-Driven Troubleshooting architecture (EDT), where users are able to share the application-specific connection details with the infrastructure to accelerate the identification of root causes of performance degradation, and to avoid the need for always-on, resource-intensive, and network- wide monitoring. Utilizing EDT, we provide some essential tools for real end-to-end <b>trace</b> <b>routing</b> (PTR), identifying packet losses, and carry out hop-by-hop latency measurements (HEL). In contrast to existing proposals, PTR traces the practical production traffic without the need of crafted probe packets by means of careful tagging mechanisms and additional ephemeral capturing flow rules. Besides involving negligible data plane deterioration, in certain cases PTR can drastically reduce the time needed to find a traversed path compared to existing solutions. Finally, by means of individual network functions, HEL measures the latency of each link along the found path without involving the controller into the calculation, hence resulting in significant reduction of control plane overhead...|$|E

Traditional in vitro tissue models {{are restricted to}} flat, static culture plates, which allow for high-throughput experimentation but do not support physiological tissue function. Early research investigates cell response to physiological mechanical cues[1 – 3], but these devices are largely confined to materials like PDMS[4] or have too low throughput for industry use. The next generation of platforms will combine mechanical cues and integrated sensing with materials that are biologically inert and compatible with high throughput assays and large scale manufacturing, while remaining in an industry-standard footprint. This work represents the design, process development, manufacturing, and characterization of such a system. A microfluidic device manufacturing process was developed to translate the Draper PDMS bilayer microfluidic device[5 – 7] into a next generation system entirely made of hard plastic. Cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) and polycarbonate thermoplastics were characterized and chosen for their compatibility with drug development applications and large scale manufacturing processes. Hot embossing and thermal bonding procedures were developed that resulted in minimal feature deformation and a robust bond between material layers. Integrated electrical sensors were fabricated in microfluidic channels to quantify transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in real time.

40|$|Most digital {{electronic}} products {{must comply}} with the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) requirements to access the market of EMC-enforced countries. One of the EMC requirements is to control unwanted emission of electromagnetic (EM) energy. However, as the clock frequency goes higher, it is a greater challenge to design EMC-complied circuitry due {{to the problem of}} rahation in the harmonic frequencies. Consequently, it is crucial to understand the basic concepts of the emission mechanisms and the suitable mitigation techniques to ensure EMC compliance. This research was to characterise the sources of radiated emissions from a hgital circuit and investigate the effects of employing EMC design practices on the reduction of emission. The novelty of this research is athibuted to the comprehensive study on the sources of emission and mitigation techniques of digital circuits on double-sided board at 0. 125 MHz, 0. 25 MHz, 1. 25 MHz, 2. 5 MHz, 12. 5 MHz and 25 MHz. The radiated emissions are measured for various mitigation techmques such as the size of loop area, length of cable and signal currents. The measurement results are then compared with the radiated emission limits of European Norm (EN) 55022 and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Part 15 Class B. Nine Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layouts with different design are designed and fabricated by using the IsoPro software and the Quick Circuit milling machine. The peak measurements were conducted in a 3 -meter Semi Anechoic Chamber (SAC) in the frequency range from 30 MHz to 1 GHz. The results showed a reduction of emission level by an average 6. 5 dB at frequency below 800 MHz (harmonics) by keeping the loop of return current small. However, the emission level for harmonic frequencies of 25 MHz or 12. 5 MHz clock signals increase above the frequency of 300 MHz. Series resistor on each signal trace reduces the level by an average 10 dB above the frequency 175 MHz to 1 GHz. The employment of small area of ground plane for critical clock <b>trace</b> <b>routing</b> and wide power trace can reduce the emission by an average of about 9. 1 dB...|$|E

40|$|Aims: We want to {{understand}} the chemistry and physics of discs {{on the basis of}} a large unbiased and statistically relevant grid of disc models. One of the main goals is to explore the diagnostic power of various gas emission lines and line ratios for deriving main disc parameters such as the gas mass. Methods: We explored the results of the DENT grid (Disk Evolution with Neat Theory) that consists of 300 000 disc models with 11 free parameters. Through a statistical analysis, we searched for correlations and trends in an effort to find tools for disc diagnostic. Results: All calculated quantities like species masses, temperatures, continuum, and line fluxes differ by several orders of magnitude across the entire parameter space. The broad distribution of these quantities as a function of input parameters shows the limitation of using a prototype T Tauri or Herbig Ae/Be disc model. The statistical analysis of the DENT grid shows that CO gas is rarely the dominant carbon reservoir in discs. Models with large inner radii (10 times the dust condensation radius) and/or shallow surface density gradients lack massive gas-phase water reservoirs. Also, 60 % of the discs have gas temperatures averaged over the oxygen mass in the range between 15 and 70 K; the average gas temperatures for CO and O differ by less than a factor two. Our study of the observational diagnostics shows that the [C ii] 158 μm fine structure line flux is very sensitive to the stellar UV flux and presence of a UV excess, and that it traces the outer disc radius (Rout).
