Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, she developed many of her friendships far further on paper than she could have done through normal social intercourse.|$|E

25|$|Michael Jackson {{made his}} debut {{at the age}} of six with the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons), who were {{prominent}} performers during the 1970s. Jackson's early solo career that same decade included albums such as Got <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>There</b> <b>and</b> Ben. His two follow-ups, Music & Me and Forever, Michael, failed to sell well. In 1979, Jackson released Off the Wall, which became his first best-selling album. Three years later, Jackson issued his best-selling album to date, Thriller, which topped several international charts and became the best-selling album of all time. Jackson's follow-ups, Bad, Dangerous, and , also became international successes. Jackson's tenth and final studio album, Invincible, was released in 2001 and topped international charts though its sales paled in comparison to his previous albums, with total confirmed sales of 13 million copies worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruins of}} the city {{remained}} undocumented for around 3,700 years until R. D. Banerji, {{an officer of the}} Archaeological Survey of India, visited the site in 1919–20, identifying the Buddhist stupa (150–500 CE) known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> finding a flint scraper which convinced him of the site's antiquity. This led to large-scale excavations of Mohenjo-daro led by Kashinath Narayan Dikshit in 1924–25, and John Marshall in 1925–26. In the 1930s, major excavations were conducted at the site under the leadership of Marshall, D. K. Dikshitar and Ernest Mackay. Further excavations were carried out in 1945 by Ahmad Hasan Dani and Mortimer Wheeler. The last major series of excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1965 by Dr. George F. Dales. After 1965 excavations were banned due to weathering damage to the exposed structures, and the only projects allowed at the site since have been salvage excavations, surface surveys, and conservation projects. However, in the 1980s, German and Italian survey groups led by Dr. Michael Jansen and Dr. Maurizio Tosi used less invasive archeological techniques, such as architectural documentation, surface surveys, and localized probing, to gather further information about Mohenjo-daro. A dry core drilling conducted in 2015 by Pakistan's National Fund for Mohenjo-daro revealed that the site is larger than the unearthed area.|$|E

Later, Horn asks Black how he can deal with cases like this on a regular basis. [...] Black does not answer, but later comforts his daughter after another bad dream.|$|E
500|$|Anna Rosmus {{received}} the 1994 award, {{in honor of}} work related to her research on the Nazi past of her hometown in Bavaria. [...] Rosmus researched anti-Semitism, and opposed neo-Nazis and the extreme right in Germany. [...] She also located and published artwork of Jews that had once lived {{in her hometown of}} Passau, Germany. [...] As a result of her work, Rosmus endured threats against her life. In a 1996 Yom HaShoah ceremony, Rosmus recounted threats she faced after conducting her research: [...] "Once-friendly neighbors threatened me openly - on the telephone, in person, in letters ... They threatened to kill me and kidnap my children. Some even attacked me physically, a room where I was to speak in Munich was bombed just before I was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> several times I was sued. Nobody ever claimed I had said anything false or made mistakes. They just claimed all this would damage their reputations." [...] Rosmus was profiled on 60 Minutes, and her story was the subject of the 1990 West German drama film, The Nasty Girl. Rosmus was presented with the Conscience-in-Media Award in a special ceremony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.|$|E

These were {{released a}}s part of The Jackson 5 franchise, and produced successful singles such as [...] "Got to Be There", [...] "Ben" [...] and a remake of Bobby Day's [...] "Rockin' Robin". The Jackson 5's sales, however, began declining in 1973, and the band members chafed under Motown's strict refusal to allow them creative control or input. Although the group scored several top40 hits, including the top five disco single [...] "Dancing Machine" [...] and the top20 hit [...] "I Am Love", The Jackson 5 (minus Jermaine Jackson) left Motown in 1975. The Jackson 5 signed a new contract with CBS Records in June 1975, first joining the Philadelphia International Records division and then Epic Records. As a result of legal proceedings, the group was renamed The Jacksons. After the name change, the band continued to tour internationally, releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984. During that period, Michael was not just the lead singer, but also the chief songwriter for the group, writing or co-writing such hits as [...] "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)", [...] "This Place Hotel" [...] and [...] "Can You Feel It".|$|E
500|$|Part 1 {{begins as}} the group heads off to Ross's wedding in London leaving behind a heavily {{pregnant}} Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), who has declined the invitation. In London, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) go see the sights in a musical montage featuring The Clash's song [...] "London Calling", with Joey filming everything on his camcorder. Chandler becomes embarrassed by his friend's enthusiasm, and after Joey buys a large Union Flag hat from a vendor (played by guest star Richard Branson), they part company. They reunite in their hotel room and Chandler apologizes. Joey impresses him with a video recording of Sarah, Duchess of York (who played herself). Emily takes Ross to the hall where the wedding will be, but they discover it is being demolished earlier than originally scheduled. Monica later suggests Emily postpone the wedding until everything is perfect. She passes the thought on to Ross, angering him; he tells her people have flown from America <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> that it is [...] "now or never"; she chooses [...] "never". Monica berates Ross for his insensitivity and Ross apologizes to Emily, showing her the ceremony can still {{take place in the}} half-demolished hall that he has tidied up. She agrees.

500|$|She {{appeared}} as Leticia Musgrove, the troubled wife of an executed murderer (Sean Combs), in the 2001 feature film Monster's Ball.

The NAACP issued the statement: [...] "Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving us hope and making us proud. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing." [...] This role generated controversy. Her graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co-star Billy Bob Thornton was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African Americans. Many in the African-American community were critical of Berry for taking the part. Berry responded: [...] "I don't really see a reason to ever go that far again. That was a unique movie. That scene was special and pivotal and needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> it would be a really special script that would require something like that again." ...|$|E

Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E
