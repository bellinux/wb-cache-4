2500|$|In recent years, Suzuki {{has been}} a {{forceful}} spokesperson on global climate change. In February 2008, he urged McGill University students {{to speak out against}} politicians who fail to act on climate change, stating [...] "What I would challenge you to do is <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of effort into trying to see whether there's a legal way of throwing our so-called leaders into jail because what they're doing is a criminal act." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of August 2006, Mary Shapiro, the NASD Vice-Chairman and President of Regulatory Policy and Oversight, {{continued}} {{to be critical of}} First Command, calling it an [...] "unscrupulous organization" [...] with an [...] "awful" [...] product. [...] First Command's new president, Marty Durbin, responded to her criticism by stating, [...] "It’s unfortunate that settling these charges still doesn’t mean it’s behind us. But it’s a futile effort to try to fight negative press and so we decided not <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of energy that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mullen, who had mostly been {{absent from}} the {{sessions}} {{to start a family}} and nurse a worsening back injury, had major surgery on his back in November 1995. Mullen was unable to drum properly during this period, forcing U2 to abandon their usual methods of songwriting as a group but also allowing them to pursue different musical influences. Mullen admits that he was upset that the band entered the studio without him, cognizant that key decisions would be made in the early months of recording. Eno attempted to convince the other band members to wait for Mullen, but as the Edge explains, [...] "The thinking was {{that we were going to}} further experiment with the notion of what a band was all about and find new ways to write songs, accepting the influence, and aesthetics of dance music... we thought, 'Let's just start with Howie mixing drum beats and see where that gets us.'" [...] Mullen was back in the studio three weeks after his surgery, but his back prevented him from fully dedicating himself to recording. As he described, [...] "I needed a little more time to recover. But we were struggling with some of the material and for the project to move ahead, I had <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time in." [...] Sessions ceased temporarily in January 1996 to allow Mullen to rehabilitate.|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "War Pigs" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be called [...] "Walpurgis". It was then changed to [...] "War Pigs", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that {{the song of the}} same name had potential as a single. [...] Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: [...] "I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' you know, the Satanic version of Christmas write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'." [...] In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, [...] "It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis'... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song... Geezer also liked <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It was, it was!" [...] she exclaimed, {{clasping}} {{her hands}} in her earnestness, and stepping closer to the grating. [...] "When we came here yesterday, and found you were not in your room, a sudden idea struck her. 'I will stay here myself, this morning,' she said, 'and do his writing. I want to know what sort of a story this is that is being dictated to a sister of our House;' and so she simply turned me out and told me to go home. You don't know how frightened I was. I was afraid that, as we dress exactly alike, you might not at first notice that Sister Sarah was sitting at the table, and that you might begin with an awfully affectionate speech by Tomaso; for I knew that something of that kind was just on the point of breaking out, and I knew too that if you did it there would be lively times in the House of Martha, and perhaps here also. I fairly shivered the whole morning, and my only hope was that she would begin to snap at you as soon as you came in, and you would then know whom you had to deal with, and that you would have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of water into your love-making if you wanted any more help from the sisters. But if I had known that you would not find out that she was writing for you, I should certainly have died. I couldn't have stood it. But how in the world could you have kept on thinking that that woman was I? She is shorter and fatter, and not a bit like me, except in her clothes; and if you thought I was writing for you, why did you dictate that ridiculous stuff?" ...|$|E

5000|$|VandeWalle defines {{performance}} prove {{goal orientation}} as the [...] "desire to prove one's competence {{and to gain}} favorable judgments about it" [...] (p. 1000). The performance approach orientation represents a desire to achieve {{a high level of}} performance. Persons with performance approach orientation seek positive reinforcement and feedback. These individuals don't want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> forth <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of effort unless they will be positively evaluated, and tend to avoid tasks where they may make mistakes and therefore be poorly evaluated.|$|R
60|$|But when Mary came, or rather, {{when she}} was about to come, things were {{altogether}} changed at the doctor's. People had hitherto wondered--and especially Mrs Umbleby--how a gentleman like Dr Thorne could continue to live in so slovenly a manner; and how people again wondered, and again especially Mrs Umbleby, how the doctor could possibly think it necessary <b>to</b> <b>put</b> such <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of furniture into a house because a little chit of a girl of twelve years of age was coming to live with him.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} major cities, each {{known as the}} poleis (singular [...] "polis").

5000|$|The Beast Within has a {{much more}} {{involved}} plot than its predecessor, Sins of the Fathers.

5000|$|Sanders's West Virginia victory {{came from}} strong support among {{workers in the}} coal industry; fifty-five percent of West Virginia’s Democratic voters with coal workers in their {{households}} voted for Sanders, while only 29 percent voted for Clinton.

50|$|In 1998, {{director}} Nadia Tass reported she {{was still}} receiving residuals from the film because of its success in America.It was successful in a financial sense {{but not in a}} satisfying sense. It was congenial doing a Martin Short comedy, but American comedy is different from Australian comedy. It is broader. American audiences enjoyed Pure Luck, but audiences in other countries did not enjoy it so much {{with the exception of the}} Germans. I wanted to do something else with the comedy and so did Danny Glover. I would like <b>to</b> have <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more pathos and pain into it. But they wanted a comedy for America.|$|R

He told him to imitate Junior Barnard, who had been part of the band and had a bluesy style. Shamblin was instructed to play louder and bend strings.

5000|$|Cassidy's lifting {{career was}} quite short {{starting}} in 1965 and ending in 1971.

Being naturally lean and standing 5-foot-10-inches tall, {{he knew he had}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of weight to become a successful powerlifter, so he pushed his bodyweight quickly from 175 to approximately 290 pounds. At his maximum bodyweight he became a world class super heavyweight lifter in the early 1970s and got his nickname [...] "Huge" [...] for his bodyweight and appearance. Cassidy achieved his best performance at the inaugural AAU World Championships with his personal record total of 2160 lbs (800 lbs squat - 570 lbs bench press - 790 lbs deadlift). Within 6 months after his World Championship win he suffered a knee injury, which ended his lifting career.|$|R

50|$|Criticism: NITB's {{roll out}} of the e-Office suite across almost all federal {{agencies}} is not only overly ambitious but also likely to fail. It seems <b>to</b> <b>put</b> together <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of lofty organizational efficiency goals {{with a set of}} delivery or citizen-facing targets. In fact, most of the services NITB has provided have been largely conceptual and not sufficient concrete. The process outlines in the adoption process diagram seems devoid of any user-centric design or value proposition formulation. Instead of creating lots of MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and taking advantage of an iterative and validated learning the process, the e-Office Suite seems to incorporate all the features and functions that various ministries and divisions may need or use. It seems to focus more on the needs of the bureaucrats and government agencies rather than the needs of the end user (citizens of Pakistan) and what services would they need that a ministry or division can provide.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} written {{as part of}} Master’s degree of Science in Economics and Business Administration at the Norwegian School of Economics. Inspiration for this thesis came when {{attending}} a course in Outsourcing and Franchising (BUS 438) {{in the spring of}} 2010. The paper looks at a successful offshoring project in Poland by the Norwegian publishing company Fagbokforlaget. The success was a result of several factors, some are acknowledged by Fagbokforlaget such as organizational culture and some that FBF are seemingly oblivious about, such as the importance of cultural differences and hence cultural knowledge. This year however they are trying to achieve success abroad again, but this time in India. However success factors are not easily transferred and redeployed in different locations and FBF now faces challenges in India that they were unprepared for and they will have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of work to make this second sourcing project a success as well...|$|R
