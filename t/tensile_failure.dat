Based on the injection pressure, volume, and time, pressure integrity tests can be classified into three, i.e., formation integrity test (FIT), leak-off test (LOT), and extended leak-off test (XLOT).

The weight and stiffness of rifle armor is a major technical challenge. The density, hardness and impact toughness are among the materials properties that are balanced to design these systems. While ceramic materials have some outstanding properties for ballistics they have poor fracture toughness. Failure of ceramic plates by cracking must also be controlled. [...] For this reason many ceramic rifle plates are a composite. The strike face is ceramic with the backface formed of laminated fiber and resin materials.

5000|$|MICP {{treatment}} {{may be limited}} to deep soil due to limitations of bacterial growth and movement in subsoil. MICP may {{be limited to the}} soils containing limited amounts of fines due to the reduction in pore spaces in fine soils. Based on the size of microorganism, the applicability of biocementation is limited to GW, GP, SW, SP, ML, and organic soils. Bacteria are not expected to enter through pore throats smaller than approximately 0.4 µm. In general, the microbial abundance was found to increase with the increase in particle size. On the other hand, the fine particles may provide more favorable nucleation sites for calcium carbonate precipitation because the mineralogy of the grains could directly influence the thermodynamics of the precipitation reaction in the system. [...] The habitable pores and traversable pore throats were found in coarse sediments and some clayey sediments at shallow depth. In clayey soil, bacteria are capable of reorienting and moving clay particles under low confining stress (at shallow depths). However, inability to make these rearrangements under high confining stresses limits bacterial activity at larger depths. Furthermore, sediment-cell interaction may cause puncture or <b>tensile</b> <b>failure</b> of the cell membrane. Similarly, at larger depths, silt and sand particles may crush and cause a reduction in pore spaces, reducing the biological activity. Bacterial activity is also impacted by challenges such as predation, competition, pH, temperature, and nutrient availability. These factors can contribute to the population decline of bacteria. Many of these limitations can be overcome through the use of MICP through bio-stimulation - a process through which indigenous ureolytic soil bacteria are enriched in situ. This method is not always possible as not all indigenous soils have enough ureolytic bacteria to achieve successful MICP.|$|E

It is proved that the ultimate strain method is credible and feasible in the slope engineering. The result shows that the tensile strength has a great influence on the limit height of the unsupported slope, but little influence on supported slope. It also has obvious influence on the active earth pressure of supported slope when the value of tensile strength is small, and the smaller the tensile strength the larger the influence.

30|$|For {{drilling}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry and geothermal exploration and production, fracture pressure is the pressure required to fracture the formation and to cause mud losses from a wellbore into the induced fractures. Fracture gradient is obtained by dividing the true vertical depth into the fracture pressure. The fracture gradient is the upper bound of the mud weight; therefore, the fracture gradient is an important parameter for mud weight design in both stages of drilling planning and operations. If the downhole mud weight is higher than the formation fracture gradient, then the wellbore will have <b>tensile</b> <b>failures</b> (i.e., the formation will be fractured), causing losses of drilling mud or even lost circulation (total losses of the mud).

30|$|Fracture {{gradient}} {{is defined}} by the Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary as the pressure gradient required to induce fractures in the rock at a given depth. Based on this definition, the fracture gradient is the maximum mud weight that a well can hold without mud losses and without uncontrolled <b>tensile</b> <b>failures</b> (fracture growth). However, there is no consensus for a method to calculate the fracture gradient in the oil and gas industry. Some pore pressure specialists use the minimum stress gradient as the fracture gradient, but others may use the maximum leak-off pressure gradient (fracture breakdown pressure gradient) or the fracture initiation pressure gradient as the fracture gradient. In this paper, the maximum leak-off pressure gradient (the peak value in the LOT test) is used as the fracture gradient. That is, the effects of the minimum stress, tensile strength, and the wellbore stress concentrations will be considered for fracture gradient prediction.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{evaluation}} of the location of slab <b>tensile</b> <b>failure</b> represents an important concern for the {{evaluation of}} the extent of avalanche release zones and hence hazard assessment. In this study, a mechanically-based statistical model of the slab-weak layer system accounting for weak-layer spatial variability, stress redistributions by elasticity of the slab and the slab possible <b>tensile</b> <b>failure</b> is simulated using a stochastic finite element method. Two types of avalanche releases are distinguished in the simulations: (1) full slope releases, for which the entire simulated slope is released and the heterogeneity is not sufficient to trigger a <b>tensile</b> <b>failure</b> within the slab; (2) partial slope releases, for which <b>tensile</b> <b>failure</b> occurs within the slab due to the heterogeneity so that only a part of the slope is released. We present the proportion of these two release types {{as a function of the}} different model parameters obtained from finite element simulations. One of the main outcomes is that, for slab tensile strength higher than the average cohesion of the weak layer, all the releases appear to be full-slope, justifying the major influence of topographical and morphological features such as rocks, trees, slope curvature, ridge and heterogeneous snow cover often claimed in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Dry-snow slab {{avalanches}} {{are generally}} {{caused by a}} sequence of fracture processes, including failure initiation in a weak snow layer underlying a cohesive slab followed by crack propagation within the weak layer (WL) and tensile fracture through the slab. During past decades, theoretical and experimental work has gradually increased {{our knowledge of the}} fracture process in snow. However, our limited understanding of crack propagation and fracture arrest propensity prevents the evaluation of avalanche release sizes and thus impedes hazard assessment. To address this issue, slab <b>tensile</b> <b>failure</b> propensity is examined using a mechanically based statistical model of the slab–WL system based on the finite element method. This model accounts for WL heterogeneity, stress redistribution by slab elasticity and possible <b>tensile</b> <b>failure</b> of the slab. Two types of avalanche release are distinguished in the simulations: (1) full-slope release if the heterogeneity is not sufficient to stop crack propagation and trigger a <b>tensile</b> <b>failure</b> within the slab; (2) partial-slope release if fracture arrest and slab <b>tensile</b> <b>failure</b> occur due to the WL heterogeneity. The probability of these two release types is presented {{as a function of the}} characteristics of WL heterogeneity and the slab. One of the main outcomes is that, for realistic values of the parameters, the <b>tensile</b> <b>failure</b> propensity is mainly influenced by slab properties. Hard and thick snow slabs are more prone to wide-scale crack propagation and thus lead to larger avalanches (full-slope release).
