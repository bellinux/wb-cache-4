5|$|Although it {{surprised}} jazz listeners upon its release in 1977, Goin' Home was praised by music critics for its reverent tone and stylistic deviation from Shepp's previous free jazz works. Shepp and Parlan were artistically {{satisfied with the}} album and subsequently recorded another album together, <b>Trouble</b> <b>in</b> Mind, in 1980. Goin' Home was reissued on CD by SteepleChase Records on May 3, 1994.|$|E

5|$|The series {{differs from}} the {{original}} comics in that Valerian comes from the year 2417, instead of 2720, and meets Laureline in the year 912 instead of 1000. Whereas in the comics Valerian takes Laureline back to the 28th century without any <b>trouble,</b> <b>in</b> the animated series this results in Earth disappearing from the solar system.|$|E
5|$|There was mayhem {{outside the}} court {{premises}} with large crowds gathering around restively and camera crews waiting {{to capture the}} <b>trouble.</b> <b>In</b> some places, buses, taxis and autorickshaws were set on fire, in others areas public transport just stayed off the roads. The office of the state Congress spokesperson Sanjay Nirupam was also vandalised.|$|E
5|$|After {{two months}} at sea, land was sighted on November 9 {{off the coast}} of Cape Cod.

With winter approaching and provisions running dangerously low, the passengers decided to return north to Cape Cod Bay and abandon their original landing plans.|$|E

5|$|Between the 30th and the 1st, The Sun {{reported}} that the remaining strikers had declared they would not interfere, but were confident the company {{would be unable to}} find sufficient workers without them, and that by remaining united, they could yet see their terms met. Given notice to report to work on Monday, July 30 or be discharged from the company, most chose discharge, but the company had little <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> acquiring the workers needed to run the trains.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} rounds, Garcia {{steadily}} pulled ahead, outboxing Judah throughout. Judah was in serious <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> rounds 5 and 6, then finally {{went down in}} the 8th. From there, things took a surprising turn. Never known for his resolve or ability to turn the fight around late, Judah responded to the knockdown by coming on strong down the stretch. Judah took the last 3 rounds, though his deficit from earlier in the fight meant it wasn't enough and Garcia defeated Judah by unanimous decision (115-112, 114-112, 116-111).|$|E

5|$|For his {{contributions}} to football, the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) gave Warner its Amos Alonzo Stagg Award in 1948. His name is widely known for the Pop Warner Little Scholars program, which began in 1929 as the Junior Football Conference in Philadelphia to keep children busy and out of <b>trouble.</b> <b>In</b> 1934, soon after Warner joined Temple, he agreed to the program's renaming as the Pop Warner Conference. As of 2016, about 325,000 {{children between the ages}} of 5 and 16 are mentored.|$|E
5|$|Groups often {{form when}} {{individuals}} converge on a food source, whereupon {{a feeding frenzy}} may occur. This seems to be triggered not by blood in the water or by bloodlust, but by the species' highly strung and goal-directed nature (conserving energy between infrequent feeding opportunities {{when it is not}} slowly plying the open ocean). The oceanic whitetip is a competitive, opportunistic predator that exploits the resource at hand, rather than avoiding <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> favour of a possibly easier future meal.|$|E
5|$|In her car, {{she packed}} clothing, toiletries, college textbooks, and birth-control pills. When her room was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings packed in boxes and the art removed from the walls. It's not clear whether Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night and Monday morning. On top of the boxes was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E

5|$|In the Quadrigae Tyrannorum (Four tyrants: The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus), {{the author}} {{includes}} Firmus, {{said to have}} been a usurper in Egypt under Aurelian. There is no certainty that this person ever existed; however, there was a Corrector named Claudius Firmus stationed in Egypt in 274, about the time Zosimus states that Aurelian was dealing with some <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> that province. Nevertheless, the History's wealth of detail about him is considered to be completely invented. For example, he would eat an ostrich a day, he had a carriage drawn by ostriches, he would swim among crocodiles, he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, {{he started}} against the Lotte Giants. He pitched 7 innings, while {{allowing}} 3 earned runs, but no run support and poor defence {{caused him to}} take the loss. During the rest of April, Hacker had a lot of <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> dealing with runners on base, because his pitching motion was vulnerable to stolen bases. So, by the end of April, Hacker was forced to make changes his pitching delivery.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E

5|$|Preoccupied with <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> Khurasan, Harun now {{accepted}} tribute {{and made}} peace. An exchange of prisoners was also arranged and {{took place during}} the winter at the two empires' border, on the Lamos river in Cilicia; some 3,700 Muslims were exchanged for the Byzantines taken captive in the previous years. During Harun's absence in Khurasan, however, Nikephoros used the opportunity to rebuild the destroyed walls of the towns of Safsaf, Thebasa, and Ancyra. The following summer he launched the first Byzantine raid for two decades; into the Arab frontier district (thughur) in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided and took prisoners as it went, even capturing the major Abbasid stronghold of Tarsus. At the same time, another Byzantine force raided the Upper Mesopotamian thughur and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of Melitene, while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in Cyprus. Harun retaliated with a massive invasion in 806, which forced Nikephoros to come to terms, but the Byzantine ruler soon violated them and prevailed over the Abbasid expeditions sent against him in 807. Following renewed <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> Khurasan, a peace treaty was signed in 808 which left the Byzantine frontier zone intact and ended the payment of tribute to the Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|Ric {{meets with}} an old school friend, Kwame Attakora (Fred Nii Amugi), now a {{successful}} local businessman. He attempts {{to persuade him to}} invest in the clinic, but Kwame, aware of Ric's family <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> England, doubts his commitment. Ric is furious with Kumi for telling Kwame about his problems, but Kwame states that he could not deceive him, and that Ric is does not understand Ghanaian honour. Without Kwame's support, the clinic goes bankrupt and Kumi chains the doors closed.|$|E
5|$|The film {{ran into}} {{production}} <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> mid 2010 and {{was close to}} being shelved, with sources reporting that Thiagarajan sold the film to Santiago Martin to revive the project. The reports proved to be untrue, and Thiagarajan maintained {{that he was still}} the producer of the film. The film had also begun to surpass its budget, due to the casual nature of shooting and difficulties in creating historical sets. The first shots from the film and the video for three songs were unveiled publicly in March2011, with the publicity campaign initiated after this.|$|E
