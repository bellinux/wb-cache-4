5|$|In 1959, Hanoi {{established}} the 559th Transportation Group {{under the command}} of Colonel (later General) Võ Bẩm to improve and maintain a transportation system to supply the NLF uprising against the South Vietnamese government. Originally, the North Vietnamese effort concentrated on infiltration across and immediately below <b>the</b> <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone</b> that separated the two Vietnams.|$|E
5|$|North Vietnam's {{victory over}} the South led to a {{considerable}} shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its {{interests in the region}} on two occasions, once when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters and again when American military officers were killed in <b>the</b> <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone</b> (DMZ) between North and South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1962, United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara visited South Vietnam and {{was taken}} on an {{inspection}} tour of the country, accompanied by Diệm and Thảo. Perhaps because Thảo divulged the tour details to Vietcong guerrillas, each of McNamara's stopovers was punctuated by bloody attacks on nearby ARVN installations. For example, when McNamara was in Bình Dương Province, five government soldiers were killed. As he flew from Đà Lạt north to Đà Nẵng near <b>the</b> <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone,</b> he was greeted by a Vietcong bombing of a southbound troop train, which killed 27 and wounded 30 Civil Guard members.|$|E
50|$|Several <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zones</b> {{have also}} unintentionally become {{wildlife}} preserves because their land is unsafe for construction or less exposed to human disturbances (including hunting). Examples include <b>the</b> Korean <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone,</b> <b>the</b> Vietnamese <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone,</b> and <b>the</b> Green Line in Cyprus.|$|R

50|$|As to {{the third}} point, the ISMAC, with the {{co-operation}} of both parties, had by 12 February 1950 completed the removal of military installations, mines and fortifications from <b>the</b> <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zones</b> as specified in the GAA.|$|R
5|$|Primarily {{the brainchild}} of General Nguyen Chi Thanh, the {{upcoming}} offensive would be timed to provoke a popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters. Yet prudence required that the South Vietnamese maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby, while American and allied forces under General William Westmoreland—the Free World Military Forces—remained on full alert. However, despite such measures the fighting at Khe Sanh had largely succeeded in diverting American resources and attention away from Saigon and towards <b>the</b> <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone,</b> affording the communists the element of surprise.|$|E
5|$|The plateau {{camp was}} {{permanently}} manned by the US Marines during 1967, when they established an outpost {{next to the}} airstrip. This base was {{to serve as the}} western anchor of Marine Corps forces, which had tactical responsibility for the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam known as I Corps. The Marines' defensive system stretched below <b>the</b> <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone</b> (DMZ) from the coast, along Route 9, to Khe Sanh. During 1966 the regular Special Forces troops had moved off the plateau and built a smaller camp down Route 9 at Lang Vei, about half the distance to the Laotian border.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 U.S. recon {{photographs}} uncovered {{an unusual}} sight. POL barrels were spotted {{floating in the}} waters of the Kong River south of Ban Bak, Laos. Soon, PAVN was making use of the Banghiang River which flowed southwestward from <b>the</b> <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone</b> {{all the way to the}} Mekong River, for the same purposes. The watertight drums were launched en masse from tributary streams into the main channel, floated downstream, and were recovered by systems of nets and booms. The Kaman River was added to the system in 1969. By 1970 the North Vietnamese were making intense use of streams and rivers to supplement their logistical route, especially in the rainy season, when the water levels rose and the roadways became impassable mires. During one two and one-half month period during 1969, over 10,000 POL barrels were spotted in the waterways of southeastern Laos.|$|E

5|$|Plans for the station's {{construction}} {{started in}} the early 1960s and negotiations between ESRO and Norwegian authorities started in 1964, despite Norway's lack of membership in ESRO. An initial disagreement of whether to locate the facility by Ny-Ålesund or Longyearbyen was overcome, and an agreement was signed on 14 December 1964. However, it was followed up by numerous protests from the Soviet Union, which claimed the installation would violate <b>the</b> <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone</b> clause of the Svalbard Treaty, as the station {{had the potential to}} be used for military satellites and intelligence. The protests were rejected by Norwegian authorities, and construction started in May 1965. The Soviet Union attempted several inspections; one resulted in the crash of a Soviet helicopter. Operations commenced in 1967, but the facility was closed in 1974 as the facility was not suitable for new satellites with higher orbits.|$|E
5|$|Chakotay's backstory was {{explained}} {{during the course}} of Star Trek: Voyager. He was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near Cardassian space in <b>the</b> <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone.</b> While young, he was looked after by his grandfather. At the age of 15, Chakotay visited Earth with his father, who sought to find his tribe's ancestral home in Central America and the descendants of the Rubber Tree People. He was resistant to this, and instead dreamed of going into space and had heroes such as John Kelly, a pioneering astronaut in the early 21st century. He chose to enter Starfleet Academy against his father's wishes, and his entry was sponsored by Captain Sulu. He attended Starfleet Academy from 2344 to 2348, where he engaged in the sport of boxing. After graduating, he was assigned to a starship. One of his earliest away missions resulted in a diplomatic incident on Ktaria VII, and he was also on the team that made first contact with the Tarkannans.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 1941, in {{a speech}} {{designed}} to inflame Croats against the Serbs living in the NDH, Lorković lied that Serbs had beaten, mutilated and massacred {{tens of thousands of}} Croatian peasants during the inter-war period. In August, he strongly opposed an Italian request to implement civil administration in <b>the</b> <b>demilitarized</b> <b>zone</b> of the NDH. The Italians countered the following spring by accusing Lorković of being a communist to discredit him for his pro-German views. Lorković was cleared of all charges after a police investigation. However, a German police attaché in Zagreb did claim that Lorković had been in contact with some communists in the early 1930s and had helped some Croatian communists in 1941 and 1942. In May 1942, Lorković was appointed honorary member of the German Institute for Border and Foreign Studies. Lorković, along with Vladimir Košak and Stijepo Perić, strongly opposed Italian influence over the Independent State of Croatia and towards the end of 1942, wrote a note ("Spomenica") in which he described the cooperative efforts of Italy's 2nd Army with the Chetniks. This note was officially submitted on 26 January 1943 to the Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano. In response, the Italian diplomat Raffaele Casertano tried to have Lorković removed from office.|$|E
50|$|Israel argued {{this was}} {{motivated}} by security considerations linked with the situation at the borders.

5|$|The Battle of Lộc Ninh {{was a major}} battle fought {{during the}} Easter Offensive during the Vietnam War, {{which took place in}} Bình Long Province, South Vietnam between 4–7 April 1972. Towards the end of 1971, North Vietnamese leaders decided to launch a major {{offensive}} against South Vietnam, with the objective of destroying Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units and capturing as much territory as possible, in order to strengthen their bargaining position in the Paris Peace Accords. On 30 March 1972, two North Vietnamese Army divisions smashed through <b>the</b> <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone,</b> marking the commencement of the Easter Offensive. They quickly overwhelmed South Vietnamese units in the I Corps Tactical Zone. With the rapid collapse of South Vietnamese forces in the northern provinces of South Vietnam, North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng forces began preparing for their next offensive, targeting Bình Long Province in the Mekong Delta region. On 4 April, the Việt Cộng's 5th Division opened their attack on Lộc Ninh, defended by the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment. After three days of fighting, the vastly outnumbered South Vietnamese forces, though well supported by American air power, were forced to abandon their positions in Lộc Ninh.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts also arose over {{different}} {{interpretations of the}} legal status of <b>the</b> <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone.</b> Israel maintained that it had sovereign rights over the zone, allowing the civilian use of farmland. Syria and the UN maintained that no party had sovereign rights over the zone. Israel was accused by Syria of cultivating lands in <b>the</b> <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone,</b> using armored tractors backed by Israel forces. Syria claimed that the situation was the result of an Israeli aim to increase tension so as to justify large-scale aggression, and to expand its occupation of <b>the</b> <b>Demilitarized</b> <b>Zone</b> by liquidating the rights of Arab cultivators. The Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan said in a 1976 interview that Israel provoked more than 80% of the clashes with Syria.|$|E

25|$|The {{armistice}} {{also established}} the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) and the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).
