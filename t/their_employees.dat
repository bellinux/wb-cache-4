5|$|The farm {{seizures}} {{were often}} violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, {{with many of}} <b>their</b> <b>employees</b> experiencing intimidation and torture. A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of their {{lack of access to}} fertiliser.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18thcentury {{the copper}} mining {{industry}} of North Wales centred around Parys Mountain declined, and the depression in the British copper market ended. As the price rose, the Cornish mines began to reopen. By this time, the Industrial Revolution had begun, bringing with it new attitudes towards organisation and efficiency. While the mine managers of the 18thcentury generally treated bal maidens as useful only for breaking and sorting ore, the managers of these new mines sought to use all <b>their</b> <b>employees</b> as efficiently as possible.|$|E
5|$|Between 1873 and 1875, mineowners Fletcher Burrows built a small {{model village}} at Howe Bridge, {{comprising}} cottages, shops, a village club, and a bath house for <b>their</b> <b>employees.</b> This Victorian village {{on either side}} of Leigh Road, together with St Michael and All Angel's Church, is a conservation area.

5|$|Brownsea Castle was {{purchased}} by Mary Bonham-Christie in 1927. She allowed the property to fall into disrepair {{and by the time}} of her death in 1961 it was in a very poor condition.

In the 21st century it is still used by the Partnership as a corporate hotel for <b>their</b> <b>employees</b> and retired staff.|$|E
5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks to <b>their</b> <b>employees</b> and associates {{so they could}} buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans. Borrowers were then allowed to defer paying interest on the loan {{until the end of}} the period, when the whole amount plus interest accrued was due. These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.|$|E

5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for <b>their</b> <b>employees.</b> As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for <b>their</b> <b>employees</b> and families and acted {{out of a sense of}} paternalism.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} and the perceived conflict of interest faced by the baseball writers who scored games for MLB eventually led many major newspapers to end the practice for <b>their</b> <b>employees.</b> In 1958, The Washington Post prohibited their writers from scoring baseball games. Over {{the next two decades}} other major newspapers joined in the writer-scorer ban, including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, and the major daily newspapers published in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. In 1980, MLB resolved the conflict by directly hiring official scorers for each stadium.|$|E

5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare <b>their</b> <b>employees</b> for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|All this {{economic}} power was ultimately under the pharaoh's control, and temple products and property were often taxed. <b>Their</b> <b>employees,</b> even the priests, {{were subject to}} the state corvée system, which conscripted labor for royal projects. They could also be ordered to provide supplies for some specific purposes. Harkhuf's trading expedition in the Old Kingdom was allowed to procure supplies from any temple it wished, and the mortuary temples of the Theban Necropolis in the New Kingdom oversaw the provision of the royally employed tomb workers at Deir el-Medina. Kings could also exempt temples or classes of personnel from taxation and conscription.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and <b>their</b> <b>employees,</b> including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E

5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of <b>their</b> <b>employees,</b> an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Following Malvern's new-found fame as a spa {{and area}} of natural beauty, and fully {{exploiting}} its new rail connections, factories {{from as far}} as Manchester were organising day trips for <b>their</b> <b>employees,</b> often attracting as many as 5,000visitors a day. In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then twice that of other lines– that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation {{to the number of}} excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Air Norway lost 1,300 {{passengers}} {{after the}} Norwegian Air Force {{decided to not}} permit <b>their</b> <b>employees</b> to travel from Ørland, but instead have to take cheaper flights from Trondheim, located about a two-hour drive away. The reduction in ridership, along with a strengthening of the Danish krone {{in relation to the}} Norwegian, caused Air Norway to lose NOK100,000 by August 2009. The mayor of Ørland stated at that he was working to make the route receive state grants as a PSO. In February 2010, the municipality granted NOK62,500 for Air Norway to run a television commercial during the semi-final of Melodi Grand Prix.|$|E
