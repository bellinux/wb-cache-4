5|$|County went undefeated in Gannon's {{first four}} league games in charge. After three weeks, this upturn in results saw Gannon offered the job full-time, which {{allowed him to}} guide County to safety. The club won {{more than twice as}} many points in the second half of the season than they did in the first. Believing <b>that</b> <b>safety</b> would be assured on the final day of the season, he was proved correct as they managed to avoid relegation with a final day draw with champions Carlisle United. Comparisons were made to Sam Allardyce. As a {{committed}} Stockport fan, and already a legend at the club for his ten years as a player, he was loved by many County supporters. After delaying talks, he accepted a one-year rolling contract in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Cromwell's programme, {{assisted}} by Anne Boleyn's influence over episcopal appointments, {{was not merely}} against the clergy {{and the power of}} Rome. He persuaded Henry <b>that</b> <b>safety</b> from political alliances that Rome might attempt to bring together lay in negotiations with the German Lutheran princes. There also seemed to be a possibility that Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, might act to avenge his rejected aunt (Queen Catherine) and enforce the Pope's excommunication. It never came to anything but it brought to England Lutheran ideas: three sacraments only—baptism, Eucharist and penance—which Henry was prepared to countenance to maintain the possibility of an alliance.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s the authorities in Eilat have considered relocating the airport, approximately 20km north of Eilat, to the Ora Well area near Be'er Ora. There were numerous reasons behind this idea. Primarily, the fact <b>that</b> <b>safety</b> would be improved as in its current location, there is the chance of aircraft crashing into buildings in the city. Other reasons were the pure value of the land which the airport occupies, {{and the fact that the}} airport is dividing the city of Eilat into two parts with the hotels and tourist areas on one side, and the residential buildings on the other.|$|E
5|$|The project {{suffered}} a setback on 12 March 1969, when the rotor on prototype #3 (s/n 66-8828) struck the fuselage and caused the aircraft to crash, killing the pilot, David A. Beil. The accident occurred {{on a test}} flight where the pilot was to manipulate the controls to excite 0.5P oscillations (or half-P hop) in the rotor; 0.5P is a vibration that happens once per two main rotor revolutions, where P is the rotor's rotational speed. The accident investigation noted <b>that</b> <b>safety</b> mechanisms on the controls had apparently been disabled for the flight. The investigation concluded that the pilot-induced oscillations {{had set up a}} resonant vibration that exceeded the rotor system's ability to compensate. After the investigation, the rotor and control systems were modified to prevent the same problem from occurring again.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{decision}} rule, maximin <b>safety,</b> <b>that</b> seeks {{to maintain a}} large margin from the worst outcome, {{in much the same}} way minimax regret seeks to minimize distance from the best. We argue <b>that</b> maximin <b>safety</b> is valuable both descriptively and normatively. De-scriptively, maximin safety explains the well-known decoy effect, in which the introduction of a dominated option changes preferences among the other options. Normatively, we provide an axiomatization that charac-terizes preferences induced by maximin <b>safety,</b> and show <b>that</b> maximin <b>safety</b> shares much of the same behavioral basis with minimax regret. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the second}} half, Kansas City drove 67 {{yards to the}} Broncos 3-yard line, {{starting}} with Grbac's 34-yard pass to Rison on the first play. But on third and goal, rookie tight end Tony Gonzalez was unable to keep both feet in bounds while making a catch, {{so they had to}} settle for Stoyanovich's 20-yard field goal that made the score 7–3. Denver had a big opportunity to respond on their next drive when Davis ran for a 41-yard gain to the Chiefs 11-yard line. But Derek Loville ended up losing a fumble <b>that</b> <b>safety</b> Reggie Tongue recovered. Following an exchange of punts, Grbac's 50-yard completion to receiver Joe Horn advanced the ball to the Broncos 15-yard line, and Gonzalez eventually caught a 12-yard touchdown pass to give Kansas City their first lead of the game, 10–7, going into the fourth quarter.|$|E

25|$|On June 30, 1995, a 14-year-old girl {{fell from}} her seat on the coaster and died. The park owner at the time, Hunt-Midwest Entertainment Inc., and ride manufacturer, Dinn Corporation, said she was {{switching}} seats when the accident occurred. A riding companion claimed <b>that</b> <b>safety</b> restraints (a lap bar and seat belt) had come undone on a sharp turn {{at the top of}} one of the ride's hills. But, Worlds of Fun officials claimed that witnesses had seen her remove her restraints and tried to switch seats and that there had been no malfunction, though her family disputed this. The ride was temporarily closed pending an investigation of its safety features, which resulted in new lap bar installations. Hunt-Midwest Entertainment Inc. and Dinn Corporation settled with the family for $200,000. This makes the Timber Wolf the only ride so far at Worlds of Fun with a fatality.|$|E
25|$|People may be {{admitted}} voluntarily if the treating doctor considers <b>that</b> <b>safety</b> isn't compromised by this less restrictive option. Inpatient psychiatric wards may be secure (for those {{thought to have}} a particular risk of violence or self-harm) or unlocked/open. Some wards are mixed-sex whilst same-sex wards are increasingly favored to protect women inpatients. Once {{in the care of}} a hospital, people are assessed, monitored, and often given medication and care from a multidisciplinary team, which may include physicians, pharmacists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatric social workers, occupational therapists and social workers. If a person receiving treatment in a psychiatric hospital is assessed as at particular risk of harming themselves or others, they may be put on constant or intermittent one-to-one supervision, and may be physically restrained or medicated. People on inpatient wards may be allowed leave for periods of time, either accompanied or on their own.|$|E
