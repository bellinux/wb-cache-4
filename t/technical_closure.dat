40|$|Following the <b>technical</b> <b>closure</b> of {{the brown}} lignite Meirama mine (NW Spain) in April 2008, the {{reclamation}} of the mined area is being accomplished with the controlled flooding of its large pit. During the first 7 months of flooding, the sequential arrest of the ground water dewatering system led {{to the growth of}} an acidic water body of about 2 hm 3. Since October 2008, the surface waters from some local streams have been diverted towards the pit so that these have become the major water input in the flooding process. Surface water has promoted a major change in the chemical composition of the lake water so that, at present, its surface has a circum neutral pH, net alkalinity, and low conductivity. At present, the lake has slightly more than one half of its final volume, and it is expected the overflow in 3 to 3. 5 years. The lake is meromictic, with a sharp chemocline separating the acidic monimolimnion (pH??? 3. 2, acidity??? 150 mg CaCO 3 /L, ? 25 ??? 2. 4 mS/cm) from the main water body (pH??? 6. 5, alkalinity??? 15 mg CaCO 3 /L, ? 25 ??? 0. 3 mS/cm). Oxygen is being depleted {{at the bottom of the}} lake so that the monimolimnion became anoxic in January 2011. Above the chemocline, the composition of the lake is similar, but not identical, to that of the flooding stream waters. Close to the surface, some constituents (pH, metals) show strong seasonal variations in coincidence with the phytoplankton growing periods. Those parameters whose limits are legally prescribed comply with the corresponding water quality standards, and they are also consistent with the forecasting results obtained in early modeling. At present, a project considering the construction of an uptake tunnel to exploit the lake is being developed for the emergency water supply of the metropolitan area of A Coru√±a...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Laparoscopic-assisted surgery {{has been}} applied {{for a variety of}} colonie surgery. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate a possible and avoidable complication of laparoscopic colonie surgery. Case Presentation: A 47 -year-old woman underwent gasless laparoscopic-assisted sigmoid colectomy. On the 20 th postoperative day, she developed bowel obstruction. Decompression with a long tube failed to resolve the bowel obstruction. Open laparotomy was performed. Abdominal exploration revealed a loop of the small bowel incarcerated in the mesenteric defect caused by the previous operation. Adhesiolysis was performed, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Discussion: Despite <b>technical</b> difficulty, complete <b>closure</b> of the mesentery after bowel resection is strongly recommended for prevention of transmesenteric incarcerated hernia after laparoscopic surgery...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} <b>technical</b> basis for <b>closure</b> of Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) Recommendation 93 - 5 Implementation Plan milestone 5. 6. 3. 13, ''Core sample all tanks by 2002 '' (DOE-RL 1996). The milestone {{was based on}} the need for characterization data to ensure safe storage of the waste, to operate the tanks safely, and to plan and implement retrieval and processing of the waste. Sufficient tank characterization data have been obtained to ensure that existing controls are adequate for safe storage of the waste in the 177 waste tanks at the Hanford Site. In addition, a process has been developed, executed, and institutionalized to systemically identify information needs, to integrate and prioritize the needs, and to reliably obtain and analyze the associated samples. This document provides a technical case that the remaining 45 incompletely sampled tanks no longer require sampling to support the intent of the Implementation Plan milestone. Sufficient data have been obtained to close the Unreviewed Safety Questions (USQs), and to ensure that existing hazard controls are adequate and appropriately applied. However, in the future, additional characterization of tanks at the site will be required to support identified information needs. Closure of this milestone allows sampling and analytical data to be obtained {{in a manner that is}} consistent with the integrated priority process...|$|R
40|$|Open spinal dysraphism is {{a common}} and {{clinically}} challenging organo-genetic malformation. Due to the well-known multi-organ affection with significant implication {{on the lives of}} patients and their families, abortion after prenatal diagnosis became reality {{in most parts of the}} world. After publication of the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) results fetal surgery seems to be a new option and a broad discussion arose regarding advantages and risks of in utero treatment of spina bifida. This paper tries to evaluate objectively the actual state of knowledge and experience. This review article gives a historical overview as well as the experimental and pathophysiological background of fetal surgery in open spinal dysraphism. Additionally clinical follow-up experience of foetoscopically treated patients are presented and discussed. After carefully outweighing all available information on fetal surgery for spina bifida, one has to conclude, in accordance with the MOMS investigators, that in utero surgery cannot be considered a standard option at present time. But there is clear evidence of the hypothesis that early closure of the spinal canal has a positive influence on spinal cord function and severity of Chiari malformation type II, has been proven. A persisting problem is the fetal risk of prematurity and the maternal risk of uterus damage. There is also evidence that due to <b>technical</b> restrictions, fetal <b>closure</b> of the spinal canal bears unsolved problems leading to a higher postnatal incidence of complication surgery. Finally, missing long-term results make a definite evaluation impossible so far. At the moment, fetal surgery in open spinal dysraphism is not a standard of care despite promising results regarding central nervous system protection due to early spinal canal <b>closure.</b> Many <b>technical</b> problems need to be solved in the future in order to make this option a safe and standard one...|$|R

Additional schedule details are provided in Section 5. Section 6 provides a list of recommended items for consideration in association with future revisions to the E-Area LLWF Closure Plan and Performance Assessment (PA). Operation of the E-Area LLWF began with placement of the first low-level waste box within the Low Activity Waste (LAW) Vault. It is anticipated that operations will continue for at least 25 years, and that a 100 -year institutional control period will follow cessation of operations. It is further anticipated that closure will be conducted in the following three phases: operational closure, interim closure, and final closure. Operational closure will be conducted during the 25 year operational period as disposal units are filled, is specific to each type of disposal unit, and it is primarily intended to minimize infiltration, facilitate operations, promote worker safety, and prepare the facility for interim closure. Interim closure will be conducted after disposal operations have ceased, it is specific to each type of disposal unit, and it is primarily intended to minimize infiltration during the 100 -year institutional control period and prepare the facility for final closure. Final closure of the entire E-Area LLWF will occur {{at the end of the}} 100 -year institutional control period. Final closure will consist of site preparation and construction of an integrated closure system composed of one or more closure caps installed over all the disposal units and a drainage system. The final closure will thus be essentially the same for each disposal unit. Final closure is primarily intended to minimize infiltration during the post institutional control period and provide an intruder deterrent...|$|R
40|$|Statement of the Problem: Developing and {{disseminating}} {{a general}} and experimentally validated model for turbulent multiphase fluid dynamics suitable for engineering design purposes in industrial scale applications of riser reactors and pneumatic conveying, require collecting reliable data on solids trajectories, velocities ? averaged and instantaneous, solids holdup distribution and solids fluxes in the riser {{as a function}} of operating conditions. Such data are currently not available on the same system. Multiphase Fluid Dynamics Research Consortium (MFDRC) was established to address these issues on a chosen example of circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor, which is widely used in petroleum and chemical industry including coal combustion. This project addresses the problem of lacking reliable data to advance CFB technology. Project Objectives: The objective of this project is to advance the understanding of the solids flow pattern and mixing in a well-developed flow region of a gas-solid riser, operated at different gas flow rates and solids loading using the state-of-the-art non-intrusive measurements. This work creates an insight and reliable database for local solids fluid-dynamic quantities in a pilot-plant scale CFB, which can then be used to validate/develop phenomenological models for the riser. This study also attempts to provide benchmark data for validation of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) codes and their current <b>closures.</b> <b>Technical</b> Approach: Non-Invasive Computer Automated Radioactive Particle Tracking (CARPT) technique provides complete Eulerian solids flow field (time average velocity map and various turbulence parameters such as the Reynolds stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, and eddy diffusivities). It also gives directly the Lagrangian information of solids flow and yields the true solids residence time distribution (RTD). Another radiation based technique, Computed Tomography (CT) yields detailed time averaged local holdup profiles at various planes. Together, these two techniques can provide the needed local solids flow dynamic information for the same setup under identical operating conditions, and the data obtained {{can be used as a}} benchmark for development, and refinement of the appropriate riser models. For the above reasons these two techniques were implemented in this study on a fully developed section of the riser. To derive the global mixing information in the riser, accurate solids RTD is needed and was obtained by monitoring the entry and exit of a single radioactive tracer. Other global parameters such as Cycle Time Distribution (CTD), overall solids holdup in the riser, solids recycle percentage at the bottom section of the riser were evaluated from different solids travel time distributions. Besides, to measure accurately and in-situ the overall solids mass flux, a novel method was applied...|$|R
