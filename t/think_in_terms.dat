Early relations between Hawaiians and explorers were also based on barter, with nails, beads, and small pieces of iron sometimes being used as money, but as more systematic foreign trade began {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, coins of many lands came to the islands as payment for exports. The arrival of the missionaries, and the plantations and other commercial activity that soon followed, led to the first currencies generated by the islands: tokens and scrip used to pay workers because of the chronic shortage of small change. The trade ties and cultural connections with the United States led the early Hawaii business community to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the US dollar, and it became the basis for trade, with the Hawaiian royal government periodically publishing tables of the value of non-US coins in terms of the dollar. This was necessary because such coins, brought to the islands by foreign trade, circulated as a means of exchange alongside American silver and gold pieces.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} a scalar valued fitness {{function}} f(s) also corresponds to the {{concept of a}} potential or energy function in physics. The two concepts only differ in that physicists traditionally <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of minimizing the potential function, while biologists prefer the notion that fitness is being maximized. Therefore, taking the inverse of a potential function turns it into a fitness function, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|As argued by Christopher J. Date, {{business}} rules translate into data integrity constraints when one <b>thinks</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the relational model of database management.

25|$|The {{first major}} action to alter village society was the land {{reform of the}} late 1940s and early 1950s, in which the party sent work teams to every village {{to carry out its}} land reform policy. This in itself was an {{unprecedented}} display of administrative and political power. The land reform had several related goals. The work teams were to redistribute some (though not all) land from the wealthier families or land-owning trusts to the poorest segments of the population and so to effect a more equitable distribution of the basic means of production; to overthrow the village elites, who might be expected to oppose the party and its programs; to recruit new village leaders from among those who demonstrated the most commitment to the party's goals; and to teach everyone to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of class status rather than kinship group or patron-client ties.|$|E
25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon the things we experience. In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing the criterion for those things that we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of anything at all we must <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{version of}} the quantum eraser can be {{described}} as follows: Rather than splitting one photon or its probability wave between two slits, the photon is subjected to a beam splitter. If one <b>thinks</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of a stream of photons being randomly directed by such a beam splitter to go down two paths that are kept from interaction, it would seem that no photon can then interfere with any other or with itself.|$|R

For several centuries, declaring both Lithuanian and Polish identity was not self-excluding alike in case of master of Polish poetry Adam Mickiewicz. The question of Piłsudski's ethnicity and culture simply does not match contemporary templates, the more the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which Piłsudski regarded as his spiritual patria failed to reborn itself and finally ceased {{to exist in the}} wake of arising modern nationalisms. Timothy Snyder, who calls him a [...] "Polish-Lithuanian", notes that Piłsudski did not <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of 20th-century nationalisms and ethnicities; he considered himself both a Pole and a Lithuanian, and his homeland was the historic Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E
500|$|The Fairchild Family was so {{successful}} that Sherwood wrote two sequels, one in 1842 and one in 1847. These reflected her changing values {{as well as those}} of the Victorian period. Significantly, the servants in Part I, [...] "who are almost part of the family, are pushed aside in Part III by their gossiping, flattering counterparts in the fine manor-house." [...] But the most extensive thematic change in the series was the disappearance of evangelicalism. Whereas all of the lessons in Part I highlight the children's [...] "human depravity" [...] and encourage the reader to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the afterlife, in Parts II and III, other Victorian values such as [...] "respectability" [...] and filial obedience come to the fore. Dawson describes the difference in terms of parental indulgence; in Parts II and III, the Fairchild parents employ softer disciplinary tactics than in Part I.|$|E

Significantly, the servants in Part I, [...] "who are almost part of the family, are pushed aside in Part III by their gossiping, flattering counterparts in the fine manor-house." [...] The second two volumes also outline narrower roles for each sex. In Part I Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin, but in Part II, Henry's scrapes involve letting loose a bull while the girls focus intently on how to make purchases in an economical yet fair fashion. The most extensive thematic change in the series, however, was the disappearance of its strident evangelicalism.

500|$|After the Dubai World Cup, California Chrome {{was shipped}} to Rae Guest's Newmarket stables in England {{to prepare for}} Royal Ascot week in June. The {{decision}} to go to England was made by Perry Martin, against the wishes of both Coburn and Sherman. Martin explained, [...] "I was trying to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of what's best for the horse. It was my decision to send him to Newmarket. It's a beautiful place, with trees and pastures for gallops...It's good for his mind. I know Art didn't take the decision well. But he'll be okay." [...] The horse's exercise rider in England, Robbie Mills, who was acquainted with the Shermans and advised them to stable the horse with Guest, stated that California Chrome was making a good transition from the flat dirt tracks of the United States to the undulating turf gallops of England. The horse was pointed to the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, with European jockey William Buick, who rode Prince Bishop in Dubai, tapped to ride. The day before the race, the horse was scratched because of a bruised hoof that was draining pus. Guest stated, [...] "He's been X-rayed and there's no damage." [...] Martin wanted to run him in Chicago's Arlington Million in August, and the requirements of quarantine upon his return to the United States combined with the setback to his training foreclosed any other UK start. [...] Upon California Chrome's return to the US in early July, a veterinary radiograph revealed that he had bruising on his cannon bones that would require at least three months to heal, effectively ending his four-year-old season. The veterinarians at Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Kentucky explained, [...] "California Chrome's x-rays showed all of his joints to be remarkably clean. He has the early signs of bruising {{to the bottom of the}} cannon bones...The return rate for horses with this problem is very high...we found that recovery rate was 95% after giving time in the paddock to heal." ...|$|E

40|$|Capitalism {{is usually}} {{seen as the}} mode of {{production}} or the economic system in which privately owned business firms striving for profits are coordinated by the market. In this definition, the state is an outsider, a foreign body. Capitalism would only be {{the sum total of}} capitalist business enterprises coordinated by the market. This is the definition that would most commonly be given by neo-liberals. The commonplace definition of capitalism goes along these same lines. Marx, who was responsible for a more comprehensive definition and analysis of capitalism, certainly did not <b>think</b> <b>in</b> these <b>terms.</b> But the simple Marxist definition of capitalism- the mode of production in which the private ownership of the means of production prevails and in which surplus value is appropriated by the bourgeoisie in the market through the exchange of equivalent values-may lead also to the idea that the state is not essential to capitalism. In this paper, I take a view that is opposite to the neoliberal definition of capitalism, where the state is left out. Even if one <b>thinks</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of pure capitalism, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of a mode of production where only the essential characteristics of capitalism appear, {{the role of the state}} is essential.

40|$|When making {{decisions}} with multiple criteria, a decision maker often <b>thinks</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of an aspiration point or levels of achievement for the criteria. In multiple objective mathematical programming, solution methods based on aspiration points can generate nondominated solutions {{using a variety}} of scalarizing functions. These reference point solution methods commonly use a scalarizing function that reaches down from the ideal solution, in a direction specified by the aspiration point. Conversely, a similar scalarizing function can push out from the nadir point toward a specified aspiration point. In this paper we explore the structure of these two reference point approaches, examine the discrepancy between resulting solutions and consider the effect of problem framing on decision maker behaviour. ...|$|R
