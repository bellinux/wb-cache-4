Synthetic peptides containing the basic region of Tat bound selectively to TAR RNA and exhibited the same sequence requirements and similar relative affinities for mutant TAR RNA as the intact protein.

The bel 1 protein transactivates HFV {{long terminal repeat}} (LTR) -directed gene expression by recognizing a region in U 3. It also transactivates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) LTR-directed gene expression in transient transfection assays. To identify the specific region in HIV- 1 LTR responsible for bel 1 action, we examined the effect of bel 1 on chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression in transfected cells {{with a series of}} mutant HIV- 1 LTR/CAT plasmids. The region between - 158 and - 118 from the transcription initiation site, immediately upstream of the core enhancer element, was identified as responsible for the transactivation by bel 1. In addition, bel 1 transactivated a heterologous promoter when this region was positioned upstream of it in the sense and antisense orientations. Optimal transactivation of the HIV- 1 LTR by bel 1 did not require an intact <b>TAR</b> <b>sequence,</b> suggesting that the binding of tat to the <b>TAR</b> <b>sequence</b> is not a prerequisite for bel 1 function in HIV- 1 LTR-directed gene expression. In the region of the HIV- 1 LTR that is necessary for the bel 1 -mediated transactivation, we have found a sequence which is conserved between HIV- 1 and HFV.

We found that the HIV- 1 promoter is functional in S. pombe and that deletion of sequences upstream of the NF-kB binding site previously identified to contain the negative regulatory element (NRE) in mammalian cells, resulted in about thirty-fold increase in transcriptional activity. Sequences in the HIV- 1 promoter that bind NF-kB were found to be essential for transcriptional activation in S. pombe.

40|$|The TAR hairpin of {{the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA genome is essential for virus replication. TAR forms the binding site for the transcriptional trans-activator protein Tat and multiple additional TAR functions have been proposed. We previously constructed an HIV- 1 variant in which the TAR-Tat transcription control mechanism is replaced by {{the components of the}} Tet-ON regulatory system. In this context, the surprising finding was that TAR can be truncated or even deleted, but partial TAR deletions that destabilize the stem structure cause a severe replication defect. In this study, we demonstrate that the HIV- 1 RNA genome requires a stable hairpin at its 5 ’-end because unpaired <b>TAR</b> <b>sequences</b> affect the proper folding of the untranslated leader RNA.

40|$|Overexpression of {{trans-acting}} response element (<b>TAR)</b> -containing <b>sequences</b> (<b>TAR</b> decoys) in CEM SS cells renders cells {{resistant to}} human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV- 1) replication. Mutagenesis of TAR {{was used to}} investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the observed inhibition. A nucleotide change which disrupts the stem structure of <b>TAR</b> or <b>sequence</b> alterations in the loop abolish {{the ability of the}} corresponding TAR decoy RNAs to inhibit HIV replication. A compensatory mutation which restores the stem structure also restores TAR decoy RNA function. Synthesis of viral RNA is drastically reduced in cells expressing a functional TAR decoy RNA, but it is unaffected in cells expressing a mutant form of TAR decoy RNA. It is therefore concluded that overexpression of TAR-containing sequences in CEM SS cells interferes with the process of Tat-mediated transactivation of viral gene expression. However, the phenotype of several mutations suggests that TAR decoy RNA does not inhibit HIV- 1 gene expression by simply sequestering Tat but rather does so by sequestering a transactivation protein complex, implying that transactivation requires the cooperative binding of both Tat and a loop-binding cellular factor(s) to TAR. Expression of wild-type or mutant forms of TAR had no discernible effects on cell viability, thus reducing concerns about using TAR decoy RNAs as part of an intracellular immunization protocol for the treatment of AIDS...|$|R

These two models {{are examples of}} control of expression of specific genes at the translation level. It was shown {{that the presence of}} the 5 $ sp prime$ non-coding regions of the human and murine c-myc oncogenes strongly inhibits the in vitro translation of their respective mRNAs. The presence of the 5 $ sp prime$ non-coding region of the mouse c-myc gene is sufficient by itself to reduce the translational efficiencies of messages since, when it is placed at the 5 $ sp prime$ end of coding sequences, it also reduces the translational level of these messages to similar levels observed with c-myc. Secondary structure {{at the level of the}} 5 $ sp prime$ end non-coding region might be the origin of the observed inhibition since this has been shown to be a determinant in translational efficiency. There was however no correlation between the results obtained from in vitro translation systems and observations made in cells transfected with genes containing the inhibitory region at their 5 $ sp prime$ end. The presence of the HIV mRNAs <b>TAR</b> <b>sequence</b> at the 5 $ sp prime$ end of the hybrid CAT message also reduces the in vitro translational efficiency of this mRNA.

Mutagenic and structural analyses of TAR RNA indicate that a stem of at least 14 base pairs is required for this activity, whereas the loop and bulge required for transactivation by Tat are dispensable. Truncation of the RNA to 68 nucleotides results {{in the loss of}} translational rescue ability, suggesting that the short cytoplasmic TAR RNA produced by viral transcription in vivo may not have the capability to suppress activation of the kinase.

The reporter plasmid pJCTAR-CAT was constructed by inserting the HIV type 1 Tat-responsive element, TAR, between the JCV promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Cotransfection of pJCTAR-CAT and pSV-Tat, an expression vector for Tat, resulted in a 50 -fold increase in JCV promoter activity in cells nonpermissive for JCV expression. Both the 98 -bp JCV enhancer and the HIV <b>TAR</b> <b>sequences</b> were required for transactivation of pJCTAR-CAT in nonpermissive cells.

A Scatchard analysis of tat binding has shown that the purified protein forms a one-to-one complex with HIV- 1 TAR RNA with a dissociation constant of Kd = 12 nM. Deletion of the uridine residues in the bulge or substitution with guanine residues produced RNAs with a 6 - to 8 -fold lower affinity than wild-type TAR.

TAR, an unusual RNA regulatory element with a stem–bulge–loop structure at the 5 « ends of all nascent viral transcripts is critical for HIV- 1 transcription. TAR is the target for Tat, a viral transcription factor encoded early in the HIV- 1 life-cycle and essential for gene expression. Evidence demonstrating the interaction of a cellular ssDNA/RNA binding protein, YB- 1, with TAR through a region which is important for Tat interaction is presented. Interestingly, results from protein–protein interaction studies revealed that YB- 1 can also form a complex with Tat. Results from mapping experiments suggest that while the region spanning aa 125 – 203 within YB- 1 is essential for its association with TAR, a truncated YB- 1 spanning aa 1 – 125 can weakly bind to Tat. Functionally, overexpression of full-length YB- 1 enhanced Tat-induced activation of the HIV- 1 minimal promoter containing <b>TAR</b> <b>sequences,</b> whereas mutant YB- 1 with no ability to bind to Tat and TAR failed to affect Tat-mediated activation.

In this study, we analyzed {{the dynamic of}} the TAR:Tat:P-TEFb complex in living cells, by performing FRAP experiments at HIV- 1 transcription sites.

In contrast, when transcription was activated by PMA/ionomycin, in the absence of Tat, Cdk 9 turned-over rapidly and resided on the HIV- 1 promoter for only 11 s. Thus, the mechanism of trans-activation determines the residency time of P-TEFb at the HIV- 1 gene, possibly explaining why Tat is such a potent transcriptional activator. In addition, we observed that Tat occupied HIV- 1 transcription sites for 55 s, suggesting that the TAR:Tat:P-TEFb complex dissociates from the polymerase following transcription initiation, and undergoes subsequent cycles of association/dissociation. </p...|$|E

NCp 7 chaperone activity relies mainly on its two folded fingers. Since NCs with a unique zinc finger are encoded by gammaretroviruses such as the canonical Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), our objective was to characterize, by fluorescence techniques, the binding and chaperone activities of the NCp 10 protein of MoMuLV to the <b>TAR</b> <b>sequences</b> of HIV- 1.

Thus, the binding and destabilization determinants scattered on the two NCp 7 fingers are encoded by the unique finger of NCp 10 and its flanking domains. NCp 10 also activates the cTAR/TAR annealing reaction, but less efficiently than NCp 7, suggesting that the two NCp 7 fingers promote in concert the rate-limiting nucleation of the duplex.

Within this study, transient expression assays performed in the astrocytic/glial cell line, U 87 -MG, confirm that κB elements within the HIV- 1 LTR mediate TAR-independent transactivation by Tat and demonstrate additionally that distinct amino acid residues within the cysteine-rich activation domain of Tat are required for TAR-independent versus TAR-dependent transactivation. Established U 87 -MG cell lines expressing a transdominant negative mutant of IκBα, IκBαΔN, fail to support TAR-independent transactivation by Tat, suggesting that binding of NF-κB to κB enhancer elements within the HIV- 1 LTR is necessary for Tat-mediated transactivation in the absence of TAR. Ribonucleic acid protection analyses of promoter-proximal and -distal transcripts derived from TAR-deleted and TAR-containing HIV- 1 LTR reporter constructs in U 87 -MG cells indicate that the predominant effect of Tat during TAR-independent transactivation occurs at the level of transcription initiation, whereas a prominent elongation effect of Tat is observed in the presence of TAR.

The stability of cTAR and mutants where one or the two terminal bulges were replaced by base-pairs as well as the NCp 7 -mediated destabilization of these cTAR sequences were examined. Thermodynamic data indicate that the two bulges cooperatively destabilize cTAR by reducing the stacking interactions between the bases.

Time-resolved fluorescence data of doubly labelled cTAR derivatives suggest that NC-mediated melting of cTAR ends propagates up to the 10 C. A(44) mismatch or T(40) bulge. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy using two-photon excitation was also used to monitor cTAR ends fraying by NC. Results show that NC causes a very significant increase of cTAR ends fraying, probably limited to the terminal base-pair in the case of cTAR mutants. Since the TAR RNA and cTAR DNA bulges or mismatches appear well conserved among all HIV- 1 strains, the present data support the notion of a co-evolutionary relationship between TAR and NC activity. Reverse transcription of HIV- 1 genomic RNA to double-stranded DNA by reverse transcriptase (RT) is a critical step in HIV- 1 replication. This process relies on two viral proteins, the RT enzyme and nucleocapsid protein NCp 7 that has well documented nucleic acid chaperone properties.

40|$|HIV- 1 {{transcription}} is tightly regulated: {{silent in}} long-term latency and highly active in acutely-infected cells. Transcription is activated by the viral protein Tat, which recruits the elongation factor P-TEFb by binding the <b>TAR</b> <b>sequence</b> present in nascent HIV- 1 RNAs. In this study, we analyzed {{the dynamic of}} the TAR:Tat:P-TEFb complex in living cells, by performing FRAP experiments at HIV- 1 transcription sites. Our results indicate that a large fraction of Tat present at these sites is recruited by Cyclin T 1. We found that {{in the presence of}} Tat, Cdk 9 remained bound to nascent HIV- 1 RNAs for 71 s. In contrast, when transcription was activated by PMA/ionomycin, in the absence of Tat, Cdk 9 turned-over rapidly and resided on the HIV- 1 promoter for only 11 s. Thus, the mechanism of trans-activation determines the residency time of P-TEFb at the HIV- 1 gene, possibly explaining why Tat is such a potent transcriptional activator. In addition, we observed that Tat occupied HIV- 1 transcription sites for 55 s, suggesting that the TAR:Tat:P-TEFb complex dissociates from the polymerase following transcription initiation, and undergoes subsequent cycles of association/dissociation...|$|E
40|$|In this review, a quick {{presentation}} of what interfering RNA (iRNA) are [...] small RNA able to exert an inhibition on gene expression at a posttranscriptional level, based on sequence homology between the iRNA and the mRNA [...] will be given. The many {{faces of the}} interrelations between iRNA and viruses, particularly HIV, will be reviewed. Four kinds of interactions have been described: i) iRNA of viral origin blocking viral RNA, ii) iRNA of viral origin downregulating cellular mRNA, iii) iRNA of cellular origin (microRNA) targeting viral RNA, and iv) microRNA downregulating cellular mRNA encoding cell proteins used by the virus for its replication. Next, HIV strategies to manipulate these interrelations will be considered: suppression of iRNA biosynthesis by Tat, trapping by the HIV <b>TAR</b> <b>sequence</b> of a cell component, TRBP, necessary for iRNA production and action, and induction by the virus of some microRNA together with suppression of others. Then, we will discuss the putative effects of these mutual influences on viral replication {{as well as on}} viral latency, immune response, and viral cytopathogenicity. Finally, the potential consequences on the human infection of genetic polymorphisms in microRNA genes and the therapeutic potential of iRNA will be presented...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the contributory {{role of the}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) promoter and enhancers in basal and Tat-induced transcription. We found that a minimal promoter competent for basal expression is contained within sequences spanning nucleotides - 43 to + 80. Basal expression from this HIV- 1 promoter was boosted more by the additional presence of the NF-kappa B elements than by the Sp 1 elements. The minimal long terminal repeat promoter (- 43 to + 80), while having an intact <b>TAR</b> <b>sequence,</b> was not Tat inducible. However, the simple addition of short synthetic enhancer motifs (AP 1, Oct, Sp 1, and NF-kappa B) conferred Tat responsiveness. This {{ability to respond to}} Tat was in part dependent on the presence of the HIV- 1 promoter. Changing the HIV- 1 TATA to other eucaryotic TATA or non-TATA initiators minimally affected basal expression but altered Tat inducibility. Our findings suggest a specific context of functional promoter and enhancer elements that is optimal for Tat trans activation of the HIV- 1 long terminal repeat. Our results do not allow conclusions about whether Tat acts at the level of initiation or at the level of elongation to be draw...|$|E
40|$|Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is a newly {{identified}} bovine lentivirus {{which causes}} an acute and sometimes fatal disease in infected animals. In other lentiviruses, the tat gene plays {{a critical role}} in viral gene expression and virus replication. To determine whether JDV also encodes a functional Tat, and whether JDV Tat is responsible for high titer JDV expression in infected cattle, we identified and characterized the JDV tat gene, and compared its transactivation function with HIV tat. ^ We first demonstrated that the JDV Tat encoded by the exon 1 possessed strong transactivation activities, and the predicted JDV TAR region in the long terminal repeat (LTR) was important for the transactivation using a co-transfection assay. JDV Tat is a very ubiquitous and potent transactivator of other lentiviral promoters including HIV promoter. JDV Tat, like HIV Tat, transactivated the HIV LTR at least partially in a TAR-dependent manner. The chimeric HIV virus carrying the JDV tat gene replicated in human cells, suggesting that JDV Tat can functionally substitute for HIV Tat. ^ The JDV Tat is entirely encoded by one exon and differs from the HIV Tat in its TAR-recognition mechanism. The function domain swapping experiment demonstrated that JDV Tat binding domain could recognize both HIV and JDV TAR while the HIV Tat binding domain can only specifically recognize its cognate <b>TAR</b> <b>sequences.</b> A gel-shift assay also showed that JDV Tat could directly bind to the HIV TAR RNA in vitro. ^ The cellular factor cyclin T 1 may be dispensable for JDV Tat binding to JDV TAR. JDV Tat-mediated transactivation can tolerate the mutations in the loop region of TAR. It is resistant to inhibition of 5, 6 -Dichloro- 1 -beta-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), a CDK 9 inhibitor which specifically blocks the cyclin T pathway. The bovine cyclin T may be the species-determinant that prevents HIV Tat from transactivating the HIV LTR in bovine cells. Overexpression of the bovine cyclin T competitively inhibits HIV Tat function in human cells. To our surprise, the fetal bovine lung (FBL) cells transfected with proviral HIV DNA produced high levels of p 24. However, FBL cells cannot be infected by HIV productively. ...|$|R

TAR RNA forms a stable hairpin that includes a six-residue loop, a trinucleotide pyrimidine bulge, and extensive duplex structure.

40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} cellular mRNAs are degraded in CD 4 positive lymphocytes infected {{by the human}} immunodeficiency virus, HIV- 1, but not in cells infected by the simian lentivirus, SIV. To begin to define the molecular mechanisms underlying this RNA degradation, we have established anin vitroRNA degradation assay utilizing extracts from both infected and uninfected cells. We found thatin vitrotranscribed, 32 P-radiolabeled actin RNA was degraded in extracts prepared from CEM, CEMx 174, and C 8166 cells which were infected with HIV- 1. Minimal actin RNA degradation was observed in extracts prepared from uninfected cells. Similarly little degradation was observed in cell-free extracts prepared from SIV-infected cells. To determine if viral RNA sequences could impart enhanced stability to cellular RNAs in ourin vitroassay, we prepared radiolabeled RNAs that contained selected viral RNA determinants. One such RNA contained the HIV- 1 -specific <b>TAR</b> (transactivating region) <b>sequence</b> (nucleotides 1 – 111) appended to a reporter CAT RNA. Like the cellular actin RNA, these TARCAT RNAs were degraded in HIV- 1 -infected cell extracts, but not in extracts from uninfected cells or extracts prepared from SIV-infected cells. In contrast, an RNA containing only authentic HIV- 1 <b>sequences</b> comprising <b>TAR</b> and gag <b>sequences</b> was more stable than actin RNA in HIV- 1 -infected extracts. These results, taken together, suggest that thein vitroassay reproduces events that occurin vivoand provide {{a starting point for}} identifying the factors responsible for cellular RNA degradation in HIV- 1 -infected cells...|$|R
