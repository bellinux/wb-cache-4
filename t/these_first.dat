Its discovery, along with the planets Kepler-4b, Kepler-5b, Kepler-6b, and Kepler-7b, were {{announced}} to the public at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C. This conference took place on January 4, 2010. The discovery of <b>these</b> <b>first</b> five planets helped confirm Kepler's functionality.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1916, Ganz Danubius of Fiume {{received}} {{authorization to}} build two boats of the class, U-50 and U-51. <b>These</b> <b>first</b> two boats, which comprised {{one-third of the}} six ocean-going submarines under construction in 1916, were followed by orders for U-56 and U-57 in September 1918.|$|E

Among <b>these</b> <b>first</b> students was Jacob Perl (Wubong), who helped to found the Providence Zen Center with the others.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge reuses and mixes stage components, enemies, and robot masters {{from the}} first two NES games in the Mega Man series. The initial four stages and bosses (Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man) come from the {{original}} Mega Man. A password system allows the player {{to return to the}} game after any or all of <b>these</b> <b>first</b> four stages are cleared or when the player suffers a game over. Once the player completes these stages and travels through Wily's fortress, four more robot masters must be fought in order to progress. These bosses (Quick Man, Bubble Man, Flash Man, and Heat Man) are taken from Mega Man 2 for NES. Although they do not have their own stages, the player earns the special weapons of these bosses. Once all four are defeated, the player faces a new robot master created for the game, Enker.|$|E

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, Native Americans inhabited {{the region where}} the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that <b>these</b> <b>first</b> Americans lived in the region from that date. During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5km) {{from the head of}} the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.|$|E
5|$|Gold {{was also}} {{discovered}} in Southern California {{but on a}} much smaller scale. The first discovery of gold, at Rancho San Francisco in the mountains north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while California was still part of Mexico. However, <b>these</b> <b>first</b> deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.|$|E
5|$|Governor Morton and Lew Wallace, Indiana's {{adjutant}} general, established Camp Morton at {{the state}} fairgrounds in Indianapolis as the initial gathering place and training camp for the state's Union volunteers. (Camp Morton was converted to a prisoner-of-war camp in 1862.) By April 27, Indiana's first six regiments were fully organized as the First Brigade, Indiana Volunteers, {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Thomas A. Morris. Members of companies not selected for <b>these</b> <b>first</b> regiments were given the option of volunteering for three years of service or returning home until they were needed; some companies formed into regiments in the state militia and were called into federal service within a few weeks.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activity}} in the lands of modern Bulgaria {{can be traced back}} to the Paleolithic. Animal bones incised with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave are assumed to be the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture, Vinča culture and the eneolithic Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing gold working and exploitation. Some of <b>these</b> <b>first</b> gold smelters produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure, the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. This site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey. <b>These</b> <b>first</b> excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that it was indeed the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not been entirely robbed of stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E
5|$|In September 1916, Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) {{received}} {{authorization to}} build two boats of the class, U-48 and U-49, {{with the proviso}} that the boats be built in Budapest with final assembly at the Pola Navy Yard. <b>These</b> <b>first</b> two boats, which comprised one-third of the six submarines under construction in 1916, were followed by orders for U-58 and U-59 before the war's end.|$|E

5|$|Since <b>these</b> <b>first</b> {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have}} been two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{emergence}} of <b>these</b> <b>first</b> multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the Cambrian explosion. Here, the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record, as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct. Various triggers for the Cambrian explosion have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj {{was first}} {{occupied}} {{at the end}} of the Early Preclassic period. The remains of an Early Preclassic residential area have been found to the west of the Central Group, on the bank of the El Chorro stream. <b>These</b> <b>first</b> houses were built with floors made from river cobbles and reed-thatched roofs supported on timber poles. Pollen analysis has revealed that the first inhabitants entered the area when it was still thick forest, which they began to clear in order to cultivate maize and other plants. Over 150 pieces of obsidian have been recovered from this area, known as El Escondite, mostly originating from the San Martín Jilotepeque and El Chayal sources.|$|E

5|$|The Curiate Assembly (comitia curiata) was the {{principal}} assembly {{during the first two}} decades of the Roman Republic. The Curiate Assembly was organized as an Assembly, and not as a Council even though only patricians were members. During <b>these</b> <b>first</b> decades, the People of Rome were organized into thirty units called Curiae. The Curiae were ethnic in nature, and thus were organized {{on the basis of the}} early Roman family, or, more specifically, on the basis of the thirty original Patrician (aristocratic) clans. The Curiae assembled into the Curiate Assembly, for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The Curiate Assembly passed laws, elected Consuls (the only elected magistrates at the time), and tried judicial cases. Consuls always presided over the assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} to rush to the goldfields, {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 1848, were the residents of California themselves—primarily agriculturally oriented Americans and Europeans living in Northern California, along with Native Americans and some Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians). <b>These</b> <b>first</b> miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the women often brought in steady income while their husbands searched for gold.|$|E
5|$|The {{measurements}} use highly polished {{spheres of}} silicon {{with a mass}} of one kilogram. Spheres are used to simplify the measurement of the size (and hence the density) and to minimize {{the effect of the}} oxide coating that inevitably forms on the surface. The first measurements used spheres of silicon with natural isotopic composition, and had a relative uncertainty of 3.1. <b>These</b> <b>first</b> results were also inconsistent with values of the Planck constant derived from watt balance measurements, although the source of the discrepancy is now believed to be known.|$|E
