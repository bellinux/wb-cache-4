5|$|Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) of the timbers {{has enabled}} precise dating of the track, showing {{it was built}} in 3807 BC. This dating led to claims that <b>the</b> <b>Sweet</b> Track was the oldest roadway in the world, until the {{discovery}} in 2009 of a 6,000-year-old trackway built in 4100 BC, in Plumstead, near Belmarsh prison. Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>Sweet</b> Track's timbers has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged forest at Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and their relationship with the climate of the period.|$|E

5000|$|The mistake {{remained}} undetected {{even during}} manufacture of <b>the</b> <b>sweets</b> by James Appleton, an [...] "experienced sweetmaker" [...] employed by Neal, though Appleton did observe that {{the finished product}} looked different from the usual humbugs. Appleton was suffering symptoms of illness during the sweet-making process and was ill for several days afterwards with vomiting and pain {{in his hands and}} arms, but did not realise it was caused by poison. Forty pounds of lozenges were sold to Hardaker who also noticed <b>the</b> <b>sweets</b> looked unusual and used this to obtain a discount from Neal. Like Appleton, Hardaker, {{as one of the first}} to taste <b>the</b> <b>sweets,</b> also promptly became ill.Regardless, Hardaker sold 5 lb of <b>the</b> <b>sweets</b> from his market stall that night - reportedly at a price of 1½d for 2 oz. Of those who purchased and ate <b>the</b> <b>sweets,</b> 21 people died with a further 200 or so becoming severely ill with arsenic poisoning within a day or so.|$|R

5000|$|Because of his {{post-graduate}} {{training in}} France, Sweet was more educated than most white men. Ordinarily {{a young man}} of his professional status would have no trouble finding a respectable home in a respectable neighborhood, {{but he had to}} face racial discrimination. <b>The</b> <b>Sweets</b> had a difficult time finding a realtor, followed by difficulty finding a family who would sell them a house. According to Kevin Boyle's account of the Sweets' first impression of the Garland house, <b>the</b> <b>Sweets</b> were less than impressed. The area was a [...] "workingman's" [...] area filled with modest houses and two-family flats, but the location was ideal. It was close to Sweet's office and to Gladys's parents' home. The owners of the home believed they could get a higher price from <b>the</b> <b>Sweets</b> than they might have from a white family with more choices. On June 7, 1925, <b>the</b> <b>Sweets</b> bought <b>the</b> house for US$18,500, about US$6,000 more than the house's fair market value. <b>The</b> <b>Sweets</b> moved into <b>the</b> house on September 8, 1925.|$|R
