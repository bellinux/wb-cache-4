5|$|The {{purpose of}} the MSE is to obtain a {{comprehensive}} cross-sectional description of the patient's mental state, which, when combined with the biographical and historical information of the psychiatric history, allows <b>the</b> <b>clinician</b> to make an accurate diagnosis and formulation, which are required for coherent treatment planning.|$|E
5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, <b>the</b> <b>clinician</b> should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E

5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when <b>the</b> <b>clinician</b> and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E
5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by <b>the</b> <b>clinician,</b> usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E
25|$|Stage one of {{the seven}} step {{approach}} focuses on assessing lethality. <b>The</b> <b>clinician</b> is to plan and conduct a thorough biopsychosocial and lethality/imminent danger assessment; this should be done promptly at the time of arrival.

40|$|The EIRA {{system has}} proved to be {{successful}} in the detection of anomalous patient responses to treatments in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

30|$|It is {{therefore}} likely {{that more than}} one model of practice will continue, depending on the physical circumstances of the service required, but in order to be valuable to <b>the</b> <b>clinicians,</b> <b>the</b> radiologists must have sufficient insight into the clinical problems being investigated and greater skills in interpreting more complex images than <b>the</b> <b>clinicians</b> themselves. In areas where there are significant ‘turf strains’, of which there are an increasing number, subspecialty qualifications may be a requirement. Radiologists should therefore have areas of subspecialty competence, even if they still provide a broad service most of the time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Aim To {{assess the}} knowledge, attitudes and {{practices}} of primary health care providers regarding the identification and management of domestic violence in a hospital based primary health care setting. Method A survey of all clinicians and nursing staff of the outpatient, casualty and antenatal clinics in University Malaya Medical Centre using a self-administered questionnaire. Results Hundred and eight out of 188 available staff participated. Sixty-two percent of <b>the</b> <b>clinicians</b> and 66. 9 % of the nursing staff perceived the prevalence of domestic violence within their patients to be very rare or rare. Majority of <b>the</b> <b>clinicians</b> (68. 9 %) reported asking their patients regarding domestic violence 'at times' but 26. 2 % had never asked at all. Time factor, concern about offending the patient and unsure of how to ask were reported as barriers in asking for domestic violence by 66 %, 52. 5 % and 32. 8 % of <b>the</b> <b>clinicians</b> respectively. Clinicians have different practices and levels of confidence within the management of domestic violence. Victim-blaming attitude exists in 28 % of <b>the</b> <b>clinicians</b> and 51. 1 % of the nursing staff. Less {{than a third of}} the participants reported knowing of any written protocol for domestic violence management. Only 20 % of <b>the</b> <b>clinicians</b> and 6. 8 % of the nursing staff had ever attended any educational program related to domestic violence. Conclusion Lack of positive attitude and positive practices among the staff towards domestic violence identification and management might be related to inadequate knowledge and inappropriate personal values regarding domestic violence. </p...|$|R

25|$|Cephalometric {{analysis}} {{is the most}} accurate way of determining all types of prognathism, as it includes assessments of skeletal base, occlusal plane angulation, facial height, soft tissue assessment and anterior dental angulation.

25|$|The {{medical history}} is a {{longitudinal}} record {{of what has happened}} to the patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks.

40|$|Although {{some clients}} enter {{treatment}} voluntarily to seek intervention for their substance abuse problems, most enter under coercive external pressures {{that may be}} perceived by clinicians as less influenced by addressing substance abuse than by appeasing mandates from the judicial system, family, or employers. Little research has examined and compared how clinicians assess clients’ extrinsic and intrinsic motivation to change as opposed to how the clients assess themselves. A congruency between the two parties’ assessments may inform {{the quality of the}} therapeutic relationship and facilitate an effective treatment plan. Using the Circumstance, Motivation, and Readiness Scales (CMR) and availability sampling methods, we surveyed both <b>the</b> <b>clinicians</b> and their clients (N = 31 clients and 11 clinicians). Results showed that there is a statistically significant difference between the ratings of <b>the</b> <b>clinicians</b> and their clients. <b>The</b> <b>clinicians</b> tended to rate the clients as having lower motivation and being less ready to change than the clients rated themselves.

25|$|A {{positive}} example {{may be a}} clinician who uses an interview technique {{as well as a}} specific questionnaire to determine if a patient has mental illness and has better success at determining mental illness than a clinician who uses the interview technique alone.

25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{behavioral}} tests have been devised {{for the assessment of}} impulsivity in both clinical and experimental settings. While no single test is a perfect predictor or a sufficient replacement for an actual clinical diagnosis, when used in conjunction with parent/teacher reports, behavioral surveys, and other diagnostic criteria, the utility of behavioral paradigms lies in their ability to narrow in on specific, discrete aspects of the impulsivity umbrella. Quantifying specific deficits is of use to <b>the</b> <b>clinician</b> and the experimenter, both of whom are generally concerned with obtaining objectively measurable treatment effects.|$|E
25|$|Understanding and {{accepting}} the psychological state {{an individual is}} in is paramount. There are many mis-conceptions {{of what it means}} for a traumatized individual to be in crisis or 'psychosis'. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and cannot comfort themselves, if treated humanely and respectfully they will not get to a state in which they are a danger. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance they will be taken seriously and not just as a sick, delusional individual. It is vital for the assessor to understand that {{what is going on in}} the traumatized persons head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., posttraumatic symptoms, dissociation, substance abuse, somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established rapport and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. <b>The</b> <b>clinician</b> may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, abandonment issues, and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, <b>the</b> <b>clinician</b> is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.|$|E
25|$|Women who miscarry {{early in}} their {{pregnancy}} usually do not need any subsequent medical treatment. They can benefit from support and counselling.

While bed rest has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this has not been found to be of benefit. Those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language. Significant distress can often be managed by the ability of <b>the</b> <b>clinician</b> to clearly explain terms without suggesting that the woman or couple are somehow to blame.|$|E
