2500|$|On the {{specific}} issue of his mathematical education, Darwin came to regret {{his lack of}} ability and application: [...] "I attempted mathematics, and even went {{during the summer of}} 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth, but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense".|$|E
2500|$|This poem is {{directly}} related to the theme of “whiteshamanism” (discussed above) and based in Rose’s personal indignation toward non-Native Americans who claim to understand the Native American experience. Rose takes the firm stance that it is not possible <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> that one is not a part of. She uses powerful images associated with native traditions and mentions them in a flippant matter, practically throwing each image out (painted faces, doeskin, etc.) and [...] reflecting the way in which white Americans believe they can simply put on moccasins, walk in them for a time, and completely understand what it means to be an Indian. She uses sarcasm and irony in the poem.|$|E
2500|$|Asked how she {{can write}} so believably about a man's inner life, Flynn says, [...] "I'm kind of part guy myself." [...] When she needs <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> about how men think, she asks her husband or a male friend. [...] Flynn's autobiographical essay [...] "I Was Not a Nice Little Girl..." [...] invites readers {{to believe she}} took {{inspiration}} for Amy Dunne from her own interior monologue. In that essay, Flynn confesses to sadistic childhood impulses like [...] "stunning ants and feeding them to spiders." [...] A favourite indoor game called [...] "Mean Aunt Rosie" [...] allowed Flynn to cast herself as a [...] "witchy caregiver" [...] who exercised malevolent influence over her cousins. The same essay argues that women fail to acknowledge their own violent impulses and incorporate them into their personal narratives, though men tend to cherish stories of their childhood meanness.|$|E

60|$|Instead of {{completing}} the sentence, Peterkin started up, {{threw himself into}} violent contortions, rolled his eyes in a fearful manner, and, in short, gave the chief and his people <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>something</b> quite indescribable and unutterably terrible would {{be the result of}} their playing us false.|$|R
5000|$|Even after retirement, he {{continued}} to apply his problem solving approach to his motorcycle racing: [...] "The world is not full of unfathomable mysteries that you can only solve with luck. If you really want <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why <b>something</b> is happening, you can probably attack it in a scientific way {{and find out what}} is going on." ...|$|R
2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E

50|$|A {{system can}} be defined as a {{comparatively}} bounded structure consisting of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements that form a whole. Systems thinking argues that the only way <b>to</b> fully <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> or an occurrence is <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the parts in relation to the whole. Thus, systems thinking, which is the process of understanding how things influence one another within a whole, is central to ecological models. Generally, a system is a community situated within an environment. Examples of systems are health systems, education systems, food systems, and economic systems.|$|R
50|$|Conceptual metaphors {{are used}} very often <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{theories}} and models. A conceptual metaphor uses one idea and links {{it to another}} <b>to</b> better <b>understand</b> <b>something.</b> For example, the conceptual metaphor of viewing communication as a conduit is one large theory explained with a metaphor. So not only is our everyday communication shaped by the language of conceptual metaphors, {{but so is the}} very way we understand scholarly theories. These metaphors are prevalent in communication and we do not just use them in language; we actually perceive and act in accordance with the metaphors.|$|R
40|$|Why {{do we want}} functor {{homology}} interpretations? Combinatorial {{features of}} the parametrizing category {{can be used in}} order to get extra structure, additional spectral sequences and more, e. g. {{as in the case of}} the Hodge decomposition of Hochschild homology. Tor- and Ext-functors have universal properties, and this helps to obtain uniqueness results. In order to get functor homology interpretations we have <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what <b>something</b> really is [...] ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What can he mean?" [...] said Ned, at {{the close}} of a series of pantomimic speeches, in which the Indian vainly endeavoured to get him <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> having {{reference}} to the mountains beyond, for he pointed repeatedly towards them.|$|E
60|$|But Mrs Dale was beginning, now at last, <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of {{his mind}} and real character. He could be affectionate and forbearing in his giving; but when asking, {{he could not be}} {{otherwise}} than stern. Indeed, he could not ask; he could only demand.|$|E
5000|$|Lasse Kongo's {{lines are}} mostly incomprehensible to the audience, except for {{intermittent}} outbursts of [...] "Shut up!", yet Percy seems <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> him perfectly, <b>something</b> that {{is reminiscent of}} the interaction between Chewbacca and Han Solo in Star Wars ...|$|R
40|$|Teach {{students}} to reason like scientists. This practical new book provides a clear framework for helping students develop scientific thinking {{so they are}} not just memorizing content but are becoming engaged in the real work scientists do. You'll learn how to teach {{students to}} analyse scientific testing, <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> if <b>something</b> caused <b>something</b> else, and <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the value of evidence. The book offers ideas for lesson plans and assessments and also features reproducible tools and handouts {{that you can use}} in the classroom immediately...|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{happened}} that, on {{announcement of the}} gradual and perfectly regular decrease observed in the orbit of Enck’s comet, at every successive revolution about our Sun, astronomers were nearly unanimous in the opinion that the cause in question was found—that a principle was discovered sufficient to account, physically, for that final, universal agglomeration which, I repeat, the analogical, symmetrical or poetical instinct of Man had predetermined <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> as <b>something</b> {{more than a simple}} hypothesis.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood up}} rather {{close to her}} and looked into her eyes. He {{seemed to be trying}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> very perplexing and elusive. [...] "It's jolly," [...] he said, [...] "to feel you have come to me. It's a sort of {{guarantee}} of confidence. Last time--you made me feel snubbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{other man}} seemed <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of the ranger's indignant pity, for he repeated: [...] "I {{want you to}} swear not to let Lee know I'm alive, no matter what comes; she must not be saddled with my record. Let her go on {{thinking}} well of me. Give me your word!" [...] He held out an insistent palm.|$|E
60|$|Having now {{obtained}} some {{notion of}} how animals are dispersed over the earth's surface, whether as single species or as collected in those groups termed genera, families, and orders, {{it will be}} well, before proceeding further, <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of the classification of the facts we have been considering, {{and some of the}} simpler conclusions these facts lead to.|$|E
40|$|This article uses {{quotes from}} {{interviews}} with diverse {{students as a}} spring board to discuss contextualized learning theory and teaching strategies to enhance student learning. Students must relate new information to their own experience; develop ideas about the new information; and articulate their understanding of it. In other words, <b>to</b> fully <b>understand</b> <b>something,</b> students {{must be able to}} relate to it, own it, and translate it. To help students do this, the article discusses and provides examples of three concrete teaching strategies: experiential learning exercises, writing exercises, and collaborative exercises...|$|R

When you parted {{from him}} after the minuet he stood and watched you, {{for a moment or}} two, with a look which gave me <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>something</b> had {{happened}} between you. It was only natural, was it not? that I should make a shrewd guess as to the nature of that 'something.' I thereupon engaged the young man in a long and animated conversation--we discussed Herr Gluck's singular success in London--until a lady claimed his arm for supper." ...|$|R
30|$|As {{the changes}} {{underway}} emerge, the filters and perceptive grids {{with which we}} have attempted to give order to the world do not help us <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and harness <b>something</b> that surpasses the idea of space and, above all, the notion of city we have become used to.|$|R
60|$|While not {{attempting}} to deal, even in outline, {{with the vast}} subject of evolution in general, an endeavour {{has been made to}} give such an account of the theory of Natural Selection as may enable any intelligent reader to obtain a clear conception of Darwin's work, and <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of the power and range of his great principle.|$|E

It {{is now more}} than forty years since we were in the Calypso together, and ever since that time I've borne the {{commission}} of an officer. You were then a youngster, and thought more of your joke, than of bending sails, or of seeing how they would stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... § XXV. The {{reader will}} now begin <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of the {{importance}} of the study of the edifices of a city which includes, within the circuit of some seven or eight miles, the field of contest between the three pre-eminent architectures of the world:--each architecture expressing a condition of religion; each an erroneous condition, yet necessary to the correction of the others, and corrected by them.|$|E
60|$|At {{the falls}} it comes round a corner, green, solid, ribbed {{with a little}} foam, and not more than thirty yards wide. Then it goes over, still green, and rather more solid than before. After a minute or two, you, sitting upon a rock {{directly}} above the drop, begin <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>something</b> has occurred; that the river has jumped between solid cliff walls, and that the gentle froth of water lapping {{the sides of the}} gorge below is really the outcome of great waves.|$|R
60|$|Piers, poor fellow, wept bitterly, {{only able}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>something</b> had befallen his comrade of seven years, which {{would take him}} away from field and moor. He clung to Hal, and both lads shed tears, till Hob roughly {{snatched}} Piers away and threw him to his aunt, with threats that drew indignant, though useless, interference from Hal, though Simon Bunce was muttering, 'As lief take one lad as the other!' while Dolly's angry defence of her nursling's wisdom broke the sadness of the parting.|$|R
50|$|For {{thousands}} of years ittars were used and <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> be <b>something</b> that attracted angels and warded off darkness or evil spirits. Saints and spiritual aspirants would adorn themselves with the finest scents {{to assist them in}} their journey towards enlightenment.|$|R

"Why, do {{you wish}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of the general {{features}} of the country first, so as to know always, as we go travelling on, where you are, and where you are going, and what you are to expect to see, or would you rather not trouble yourself at all about this, but take things as they come along, and enjoy them as you see them, without thinking or caring what is to come next." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{through the}} long summer Peter Rabbit watched his {{feathered}} friends and learned things in regard to their ways he never had suspected. As he saw them keeping the trees of the Old Orchard free of insect pests working in Farmer Brown's garden, and picking up the countless seeds of weeds everywhere, he began <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of the wonderful part these feathered folks have in keeping the Great World beautiful and worth while living in.|$|E
60|$|From that, {{in answer}} to my questions, he came round to his grandiose plans again. He grew enthusiastic. He talked so eloquently of the {{possibility}} of capturing a fighting-machine that I more than half believed in him again. But now that I was beginning <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>something</b> of his quality, I could divine the stress he laid on doing nothing precipitately. And I noted that now there was no question that he personally was to capture and fight the great machine.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke with}} a fiery earnestness that Nevitt was only just {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> There was <b>something</b> in this.

Surely, a menace to Granville Kelmscott's prospects could never have moved that heavy, phlegmatic, pachydermatous man to such an outburst of anger and suppressed fear.|$|R
40|$|This {{chapter is}} about the role that {{information}} design, and typography and graphic communication play in effective public health communication. It introduces the way that information designers work, particularly in relation to what have been called ‘functional texts’ – those that enable people to take some kind of action, or <b>to</b> better <b>understand</b> <b>something.</b> Examples of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century printed ephemera are used {{to draw attention to}} the ways that language and visual presentation work together to enhance the meaning of a particular message. The role of pictures in health communication is discussed with reference to Isotype and the work of Otto and Marie Neurath. ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him with kind eyes; {{something}} in his voice suddenly made her put away all thought of the defensive airs that a girl, in certain situations, is expected to assume. She perceived that he wanted <b>to</b> make her <b>understand</b> <b>something,</b> and now her only wish was to help him to say it. [...] "You are not happy," [...] she murmured, simply, her voice dying away in a kind of wonderment at this reality.|$|R
