Additionally unusual for Skybus flight crew was that there were very few if any overnight trips thus giving the crew far fewer hours away from home (known as TAFB or time away from base) and higher crew utilization rates for more efficient work schedules.

In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, Hercules Unchained, opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. A suspense film, Terror Is a Man, ran as a [...] "co-feature" [...] with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: [...] "The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'" [...] That year, Roger Corman took AIP down a new road: [...] "When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color." [...] The resulting House of Usher typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification. It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But it is generally seen as a B movie: the schedule was still a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000 (one-tenth <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>average),</b> and its 85-minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B: [...] "Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes." ...|$|E
