5|$|In the {{folklore}} of Croats of Ravni Kotari, {{a region}} in northern Dalmatia, there were men called vidogoja. They {{were believed to}} know past and future things.

The vidogoja were also thought {{to be able to}} inflict diseases on people, and to have evil eyes. They could not fly.|$|E

5|$|The touch was {{originally}} meant to cure tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (commonly {{referred to as}} scrofula or the King's Evil), rheumatism, convulsions, fevers, blindness, goitre and other ailments. Since the reign of Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), however, the touch was applied only to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and the changes were minor; Elizabeth I made <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, James I (r. 1603–1625), made stroking motions above the abscesses instead of actually touching them.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Persian wars in 299, co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius traveled from Persia to Syrian Antioch (Antakya). The Christian rhetor Lactantius records that, at Antioch some time in 299, the emperors were engaged in sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices, diviners of omens from sacrificed animals, were unable to read the sacrificed animals and failed to do so after repeated trials. The master haruspex eventually declared that this failure was the result of interruptions in the process caused by profane men. Certain Christians in the imperial household had been observed making <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> during the ceremonies and were alleged to have disrupted the haruspices divination. Diocletian, enraged by this turn of events, declared that all members of the court must make a sacrifice themselves. Diocletian and Galerius also sent letters to the military command, demanding that the entire army perform the sacrifices or else face discharge. Since there are no reports of bloodshed in Lactantius's narrative, Christians in the imperial household must have survived the event.|$|E

50|$|Ell is most {{remembered for}} his strong {{interest}} in recreation and conservation. From 1900 onwards, Ell pushed for <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> a network of scenic reserves along Christchurch's Port Hills, linked by the Summit Road and with a network of rest-houses to allow travellers and walkers to refresh themselves. Three of these rest-houses, designed by architect Samuel Hurst Seager, were completed during Ell's lifetime: <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellbird, <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiwi, and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packhorse. The last, and grandest, <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Takahe, was not completed until long after Ell’s death, in 1949. All four houses were built of local stone, and designed {{to blend in with}} <b>the</b> landscape. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiwi and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Takahe still function as commercial rest stops serving refreshments while <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellbird survives only as a shelter, but is still a useful stopping place for a picnic and the starting point for some short walks. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packhorse is managed by <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Conservation and used as a hut by trampers.|$|R
