Hartmann {{points that}} there have been cases where a Greek word was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent was also used to mean the same <b>thing.</b> <b>The</b> dedication to Odaenathus would be the using of a Palmyrene equivalent, while the inscription of Vaballathus would be the direct translation.

Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects {{that this will be}} the only way to get back Mjöllnir. Loki points out that, without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard.

5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production (Rruga Sesam/Ulica Sezam) chose to present the languages of the region more evenly.

While acknowledging the film's flaws, such as the grammatically poor English subtitles, commentators praised its clear political message and compared it to films such as La Haine and Do the Right <b>Thing.</b> <b>The</b> French Democracy inspired other politically conscious machinima works and fueled discussion about the art form's potential for political expression. Some raised concerns that video game companies would use their copyrights to control the content of derivative machinima films.|$|E

5|$|Once {{rebuilding}} began, {{the poor}} rebuilt their basic {{housing in the}} same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic orgy of building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For one <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> Spanish viceroy spent {{six months of the}} year in Palermo and six in Catania, holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, from the middle of the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{the brutal}} {{policies}} of the organization soon {{made their way to}} Phnom Penh and into the population foretelling the violence that was about to consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn. War was one <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was quite another. Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was no coincidence. The concentration of the PAVN effort on South Vietnam allowed the Khmer Rouge to apply their doctrine and policies without restraint for the first time.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he looks into the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, who will do the {{unpleasant}} <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E

5|$|The great {{accomplishment}} of the Hortensian Law {{was in that}} it deprived the Patricians of their final weapon over the Plebeians. Therefore, the new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy replaced the old Patrician aristocracy, and the last great political question of the earlier era had been resolved. As such, no important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. This entire era was dominated by foreign wars, which eliminated the {{need to address the}} flaws in the current political system, since the patriotism of the Plebeians suppressed their desire for further reforms. However, this era created new problems, which began to be realized {{near the end of the}} 2nd century BC. For example, the nature of Rome's military commanders changed. Roman soldiers of earlier eras fought short wars, and then returned to their farms. Since their generals did the same <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> soldiers came to view their generals as being nothing more than fellow citizen-soldiers. Now, however, wars were becoming longer and of a larger scale. Thus, this period saw a growing affinity between the average citizen and his general, while the generals acquired more power than they had ever held before.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, {{the game}} was {{designed}} with an overseas release in mind. Among the early ideas created for the title was {{for it to be}} set in New York City, inspired by John Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York. This was vetoed as it would not offer much variety in its cast. To enable an international cast, it was decided to set the game in Antarctica. This choice of setting was also made to depict the danger posed by the Schwarzwelt on a worldwide scale. This setting differed greatly from previous Shin Megami Tensei games, which had taken place in Tokyo. It was also chosen as the North Pole had no widespread landmass, making it an impractical setting. When developing the character drama, the team took inspiration from another film by Carpenter, 1982's The <b>Thing.</b> <b>The</b> moral alignment system, a staple in earlier Shin Megami Tensei entries, was reintroduced for Strange Journey to help players experience the game's themes. The central cast acted as both a microcosm of humanity and representation of the game's alignments. Due to the setting, the characters had to be members of a Special Forces group, as opposed to previous protagonists who had been average people. The game includes a larger presence of science fiction elements than in previous Shin Megami Tensei games. Various elements within the game were inspired by science fiction movies: the Red Sprite was inspired by the main vehicle from the 1977 film Damnation Alley, and some equipment was inspired by James Cameron's 1986 film Aliens. The characters' firearms were all modeled after real-life guns. Elaborating on how the science fiction elements complemented rather than clashed with the mystical elements of Shin Megami Tensei, Kaneko stated that he felt that the series had always had elements of those two genres merging, commenting that some people saw a web URL as something like a magical incantation and referencing a quote from Arthur C. Clark about technology becoming so advanced that it looked like magic.|$|E
