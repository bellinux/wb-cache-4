500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] {{is based}} on Peter Buck's mandolin-playing. Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are trying to get away from those kind of songs, but like I said before, <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E
500|$|Danny Elfman {{was worried}} the {{characterization}} of Oogie Boogie would be considered racist by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Elfman's predictions came true; however, director Henry Selick stated the character {{was inspired by the}} Betty Boop cartoon The Old Man of the Mountain. [...] "Cab Calloway would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing 'Minnie the Moocher' or 'Old Man of the Mountain', and they would rotoscope him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus," [...] Selick continued. [...] "I think <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> of the most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain. We went with Ken Page, who is a black singer, and he had no problem with it".|$|E

5000|$|Harris {{marveled at}} the talent that was around him in Montreal. [...] "I think we had a team in Montreal that would beat {{most of the major}} league teams. Sparky Anderson was my second baseman. We also had Rocky Nelson (1B), John Roseboro (C), George Shuba (OF), Dick Williams (OF) and Chico Fernández (SS). <b>Those</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> great names", he explained.|$|R
500|$|Dungeon Master for Dummies lists Steading of the Hill Giant Chief {{as one of}} the ten best classic adventures. Stephen Colbert, {{who played}} Dungeons & Dragons as a child, reminisced about these modules: [...] "Those old [...] "Giants" [...] modules, those were tremendous. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> of my {{favorite}} memories: working my way through fire giant, frost giant, and storm giant castles." [...] Ken Denmead of Wired said the first module is a [...] "pretty easy crash-and-grab," [...] the second contains [...] "some really excellent treasure," [...] but the third is [...] "the end-all, be-all of hack-fests". According to Denmead, the hill giant adventure does not prepare players for the later adventures. Describing the difficulty of battling the fire giants he said, [...] "remember Bambi Versus Godzilla? You're Bambi".|$|E
500|$|During {{press for}} the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, {{questions}} about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> of the things that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up. But I paid for those mistakes, and there's no way in hell that I will ever make another mistake like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Butters {{and fellow}} {{executive}} producer Chris Dingess stated that Madame Masque {{would appear in}} the season, and that an actress had been cast in the role. Everett was confirmed to be playing the character that October. After being cast and seeing {{a picture of the}} comic version of the character, Everett felt [...] "'They got the wrong girl,' only because I look nothing like her. I was very nervous about it ... thought, 'They will probably dye my hair dark, and I'm going to need to work out a bit. And <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> pretty big boobs.'" [...] However, the producers were looking to take a different approach to the character, taking inspiration from [...] "Hollywood icons like Hedy Lamarr and Lauren Bacall". The character also does not wear the gold mask from the comics, though the show does reference this, with masks appearing in the background of many scenes featuring Frost. Ivy George and Olivia Welch portray younger versions of Cully during her time growing up in Broxton, Oklahoma.|$|E
5000|$|Jodi Walker of Entertainment Weekly gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} episode, stating: [...] "Because this show, in between all the creepy, killer families and Russian mystery men, always ends up boiling down to the relationships. That’s why tonight worked so well on both the big and small scale. Even in the little time we spent with the Kings, <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> juicy family dynamics." ...|$|R

50|$|Most tram routes were on unreserved {{tracks and}} {{side of the}} roads. Route towards Envigado and Berlin was almost {{completely}} on reserved track, so offered high speed service. Tramcars {{were caught in the}} traffic jam caused by the cars, and single track was the main obstacle for a hassle free service. The tracks were also outdated, noisy and not maintained mostly. <b>Those</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> strong reasons of closure of the system.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to criticism {{directed at the}} series that Kirito was a [...] "Mary Sue" [...] type character, Karen Mead of Japanator.com wrote that [...] "I don't think we ever see enough of Kirito's weaknesses to balance out his strengths: he's pretty much a genius at video games, {{as well as a}} kind, giving person, and <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> pretty major positives." [...] However, she praised the positive aspects of Kirito's character, and his [...] "competent and noble" [...] self distinguishes him from other harem protagonists in that he actually earns the girls' affection. Carly Smith of The Escapist criticized Sword Art Online II and compared it unfavourably to the original storyline, summarizing [...] "welcome to Sword Art Online II: the show where everyone loves Kirito and nothing matters", and that the anime doesn't [...] "start to shine" [...] until [...] "Kirito is pushed to the sidelines". In an interview with Bryce Papenbrook, Kirito's English voice actor, when asked whether he would pick Kirito or Eren Yeager (whom he also voiced) from Attack on Titan in a fight, Papenbrook joked that [...] "Inside a game, obviously Kirito would win, because he has God Mode running at all times. I think in real life, Kirito is strong-willed and passionate, but I think Eren would slice him up in real life. He's just too crazy." ...|$|E

5000|$|We {{had a lot}} of {{specific}} design goals for Myth II. Part of <b>those</b> things <b>are</b> enhancements to the engine as well as the gameplay.

In addition to that, we decided to touch basically every facet of the game. We wanted to make the music and sound better, the graphics - so we basically retouched every area of the Myth gaming experience.|$|R

Now, they ought to have been {{separated}} and arranged; all the white paper by itself in front, where you can easily get it to use; the pictures all by themselves in a portfolio; and the books should be arranged, not in a pile, but in a row, on their edges, so that you can get out any one without disturbing the others. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> of the principles of order." ...|$|E

50|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} {{is important to}} attempt to prevent further damage to the brain and further neurologic deficits.

She was greatly revered by the Bahá’ís; many visited her whilst journeying to see Bahá’u’lláh. One occasion the very young Fátimih Nahrí of Isfahán, accompanied by her brother, visited. “They stayed for fifteen days, and <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the happiest days of my life” she later reflected.|$|R

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, the Swedish count Folke Bernadotte {{tried to}} get all Scandinavian {{concentration}} camp prisoners to Sweden. Simultaneously the Danish administration negotiated with the Germans about rescue of the Danish prisoners in Germany. As a result of these efforts many Scandinavian prisoners came with the white buses from the German camps. In March and April 1945 10,000 Danish and Norwegian captives were brought home from Germany. Some of the returning prisoners came to Frøslev Prison Camp. Among <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the 1,960 deported Danish policemen, which had been arrested and deported on 19 September 1944.|$|R
