25|$|When the {{spruce and}} aspen forest types are mixed, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be quite {{different}} from the aspen or spruce stands. Animal and vegetation associations from each type combine to create considerable diversity of habitat which is typical of either spruce or aspen stands. The mixture of the transition soils provides an attractive environment with either pure spruce or pure aspen woodlands. An example of a bird which prefers a mixed wood habitat is the yellow-rumped warbler.|$|E
25|$|Multiplying {{permutations}} {{written in}} cycle notation follows no easily described pattern, and {{the cycles of}} the product can be entirely {{different from those of}} the permutations being composed. However the cycle structure is preserved in the special case of conjugating a permutation σ by another permutation π, which means forming the product π·σ·π−1. Here the cycle notation of <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be obtained by taking the cycle notation for σ and applying π to all the entries in it.|$|E
25|$|As Paul Erdős observed, the Sylvester–Gallai theorem {{immediately}} {{implies that}} any set of n points {{that are not}} collinear determines at least n different lines. As a base case, the result is clearly true for n=3. For any larger value of n, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be reduced from n points to n1 points, by deleting an ordinary line {{and one of the}} two points on it. Thus, it follows by mathematical induction. The example of a near-pencil (a set of n1 collinear points together with one additional point that is not on the same line as the other points) shows that this bound is tight.|$|E

25|$|Holden's current {{projects}} {{include two}} novels {{about the events}} surrounding Japan's triple disaster of March 11, 2011: Tsunami and Escape from Sonoyo. The former, covers the disaster in sixteen self-contained, interconnected stories; the latter centers on the ordeals of one family divided, in search of themselves and one another. Combined, the books present a portrait of loss, heroism, survival, and perseverance {{through the eyes of}} victims, witnesses, rescuers, refugees, reporters, civil authorities, soldiers and criminals. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be read as more than a record of one period in a particular nation’s history, but a universal story of sacrifice, heartbreak, faith, redemption and transcendence during crisis.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with clinical tools, one relatively inexpensive {{type of body}} fat meter uses the principle of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) {{in order to determine}} an individual's body fat percentage. To achieve this, the meter passes a small, harmless, electric current through the body and measures the resistance, then uses information on the person's weight, height, age, and sex to calculate an approximate value for the person's body fat percentage. The calculation measures the total volume of water in the body (lean tissue and muscle contain a higher percentage of water than fat), and estimates the percentage of fat based on this information. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> fluctuate several percentage points depending on what has been eaten and how much water has been drunk before the analysis.|$|E
25|$|Fertile feeding {{grounds for}} forage fish are {{provided}} by ocean upwellings. Oceanic gyres are large-scale ocean currents caused by the Coriolis effect. Wind-driven surface currents interact with these gyres and the underwater topography, such as seamounts and the edge of continental shelves, to produce downwellings and upwellings. These can transport nutrients which plankton thrive on. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be rich feeding grounds attractive to the plankton feeding forage fish. In turn, the forage fish themselves become a feeding ground for larger predator fish. Most upwellings are coastal, {{and many of them}} support some of the most productive fisheries in the world. Regions of notable upwelling include coastal Peru, Chile, Arabian Sea, western South Africa, eastern New Zealand and the California coast.|$|E

25|$|Essentially, as a result, when light propagates {{through the}} {{cleavage}} plane and transits to free space {{from within the}} semiconductor crystal, {{a fraction of the}} light energy is absorbed by the surface states where it is converted to heat by phonon-electron interactions. This heats the cleaved mirror. In addition, the mirror may heat simply because the edge of the diode laser—which is electrically pumped—is in less-than-perfect contact with the mount that provides a path for heat removal. The heating of the mirror causes the bandgap of the semiconductor to shrink in the warmer areas. The bandgap shrinkage brings more electronic band-to-band transitions into alignment with the photon energy causing yet more absorption. This is thermal runaway, a form of positive feedback, and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be melting of the facet, known as catastrophic optical damage, or COD.|$|E
25|$|Checksum – Each note has {{a unique}} serial number. The {{remainder}} from dividing the serial number by 9 gives checksum corresponding to the initial letter indicated on the note. Using {{a variation of the}} divisibility rule shortcut, the remainder from division by 9 can easily be found by adding the constituent digits and, if the sum still does not make the remainder obvious, adding the digits of the sum. Alternatively, substituting the letter with its ASCII value makes the resulting number exactly divisible by 9. Taking the same example, Z10708476264, the ASCII code for Z is 90, so the resulting number is 9010708476264. Dividing by 9 yields a remainder of 0. Using the divisibility rule again, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be checked speedily since the addition of all digits gives 54; 5 + 4 = 9—so the number is divisible by 9, or 9010708476264 modulo 9 is 0.|$|E
25|$|This {{construction}} differs {{slightly from}} the one in (Macdonald, 1979). That construction only uses the surjective morphisms n without mentioning the injective morphisms n: it constructs the homogeneous components of R separately, and equips their direct sum with a ring structure using the n. It is also observed that <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be described as an inverse limit {{in the category of}} graded rings. That description however somewhat obscures an important property typical for a direct limit of injective morphisms, namely that every individual element (symmetric function) is already faithfully represented in some object used in the limit construction, here a ring RSd. It suffices to take for d the degree of the symmetric function, since the part in degree d of that ring is mapped isomorphically to rings with more indeterminates by n for all n'd. This implies that for studying relations between individual elements, there is no fundamental difference between symmetric polynomials and symmetric functions.|$|E

25|$|The Current Population Survey (aka Household Survey) {{measures}} {{the percentage of}} the population that is employed and unemployed. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be multiplied by population estimates to get total employment estimates. This survey has the advantage over the payroll survey in that it includes self-employed. The Household Survey is less accurate in producing total numbers since it requires population estimates and in that it samples many fewer people (60,000 households versus 400,000 business establishments). For better or worse, the Household Survey counts multiple jobs held by one person only once, and it includes government workers, farm workers, unpaid family workers, and workers absent without pay. The Household Survey indicates that {{the percentage of the}} population employed decreased from 64.4% in December 2000 and January 2001 to 62.1% in August and September 2003. By August 2005, it had recovered only to 62.9%. In absolute numbers, this corresponds to a drop of 1.6 million jobs but an eventual net gain of 4.7 million jobs during the Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|The {{front of}} the theatre was the part for which Piermarini showed most concern. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> still be seen today. The lower level, in a granite bugnato ashlar, has a terrace with a three-arched porch while the upper level is {{decorated}} with a double row of columns crowned by an entablature. Finally the attic, with pilasters rather than columns, is surmounted {{by a series of}} torch-bearing vases. Its central pediment has a stucco bas-relief by Giuseppe Franchi representing the allegory of the chariot of the sun chased by the night. Dating from 1828, the body of the building beside the original structure was designed by the engineer Domenico Giusto. In 1858, after the demolition of several minor buildings, the Scala Square was completed, changing the view of the facade envisaged by Piermarini who had intended it to be seen from a much tighter perspective. Like much of the city, the theatre suffered during the allied bombing in the Second World War but {{was one of the first}} buildings to be repaired.|$|E

However {{the times of}} sessions and intervals may be altered in certain circumstances: if bad weather or a change of innings occurs close to a scheduled break, the break may be taken immediately; {{if there has been}} a loss of playing time, for example because of bad weather, the session times may be adjusted to make up the lost time; if the batting side is nine wickets down at the scheduled tea break, then the interval may be delayed until either 30 minutes has elapsed or the team is all out; the final session may be extended by up to 30 minutes if 90 or more overs have not been bowled in that day's play (subject to any reduction for adverse weather); the final session may be extended by 30 minutes (except on the 5th day) if the umpires believe <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be decided within that time.|$|E
