5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|Stannis's maester, Cressen, is {{preoccupied with}} his lord's {{decisions}} and {{especially with the}} influence that the foreign priestess Melisandre has over him. Having come {{under the influence of}} the Red Priestess and her god, the Lord of Light R'hllor, Stannis has even converted to the new religion and has ordered the burning of the statues of the Westerosi Seven Gods. Willing to sacrifice himself for Stannis's sake, Cressen puts poison in a cup and asks Melisandre <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> it after he has done so. While he dies almost immediately, the priestess swallows the entire cup unaffected.|$|E
25|$|These {{ancestors}} were pure and were said <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> Earth's Milk 지유(地乳), {{which came from}} a spring inside the castle. They could speak without making sounds, and act without seeing and never died. Thus they lived for ten thousand years undisturbed.|$|E

25|$|Greater sage-grouse {{apparently}} do {{not require}} open water for day-to-day survival if succulent vegetation is available. They use free water if it is available, however. Their distribution is apparently seasonally limited by water in some areas. In summer, greater sage-grouse in desert regions occur only near streams, springs, and water holes. In winter in Eden Valley, Wyoming, they have been observed regularly visiting partially frozen streams <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> holes in the ice.|$|E
25|$|Before shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups {{of water}} in order to wash off the balls. However, {{research}} has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as E. coli. To avoid any illness, many players put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from.</b> In doing so, it removes the possibility of getting sick or drinking any dirt that may transfer from the ball into the cup.|$|E
25|$|Upon hearing this, {{the people}} became {{convinced}} {{that the only way}} to become pure once more was <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> Earth's Milk again. They then stormed the castle and overwhelmed it, razing the fortress to its foundations in order to reveal the source of the spring that had given them Earth's Milk. The spring, however, began to flow in all directions and thereafter the milk turned into inedible earth, leaving not only the original perpetrators but all the former inhabitants of the now destroyed castle to starve.|$|E

25|$|Involuntary {{movements}} {{may make}} feeding difficult or messy and may excessively prolong mealtimes. It {{may be easier}} to finger feed than use utensils (e.g., spoon or fork). For liquids, it is often easier <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> a closed container with a straw than from an open cup. Caregivers may need to provide foods or liquids so that self-feeding is possible, or they may need to feed the person with A-T. In general, meals should be completed within approximately 30 minutes. Longer meals may be stressful, interfere with other daily activities, and limit the intake of necessary liquids and nutrients.|$|E
25|$|When Cecil landed his forces, they {{realised}} {{that they}} had no food or drink with them. Cecil then made the foolish decision to allow the men <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> the wine vats found in the local houses. A wave of drunkenness ensued, with few or none of Cecil's force remaining sober. Realizing what he had done, Cecil took the only course left open to him, and ordered that the men return to their ships and retreat. When the Spanish army arrived, they found over 1,000 English soldiers still drunk: although every man was armed, not a single shot was fired as the Spanish put them all to the sword.|$|E
25|$|The harsh {{conditions}} and terrain of the Arabian peninsula meant a near-constant state {{of conflict between}} the local tribes, but once a year they would declare a truce and converge upon Mecca in an annual pilgrimage. Up to the 7th century, this journey was intended for religious reasons by the pagan Arabs {{to pay homage to}} their shrine, and <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> the Zamzam Well. However, it was also the time each year that disputes would be arbitrated, debts would be resolved, and trading would occur at Meccan fairs. These annual events gave the tribes a sense of common identity and made Mecca an important focus for the peninsula.|$|E

United Nuclear Corporation employees were dispatched to warn Navajo-speaking residents downstream in accordance with a state contingency plan, but not until {{a few days after the}} spill. The Navajo Nation asked the governor of New Mexico to request disaster assistance from the US government and have the site declared a disaster area, but he refused, limiting disaster relief assistance to the Navajo Nation.|$|E
25|$|Efficiency {{and service}} quality {{improved}} substantially {{over the following}} years. The level on non-revenue water decreased from an estimated 36% in 2005 to 10% in 2009; one quarter of residents received continuous water supply (although the average supply remained at only 7hours per day) in 2009; the share of metered connections increased from 2% in 2007 to 26% in 2009; the number of customers increased; and the company recovered its operating costs plus a portion of capital costs. Identifying and legalising illegal connections was {{an important element in}} the reduction of non-revenue water. The utility prides itself today of the good drinking water quality provided and encourages its customers <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> the tap. The utility also operates a wastewater treatment plant that meets discharge standards. The private utility pays salaries that are higher than civil service salaries and conducts extensive training programs for its staff. It has also installed a modern system to track and resolve customer complaints. Furthermore, it conducts independent annual customer satisfaction surveys. JUSCO’s vision is to be the preferred provider of water supply and other urban services throughout India. Together with Ranhill Malaysia it won a 25-year concession contract for providing the water supply in Haldia City, West Bengal.|$|E
25|$|In the mines, Emma {{interrupts}} the dwarves' work {{by taking}} Happy's pickaxe. This infuriated the dwarves, {{causing them to}} take their complaints to David and Mary Margaret. They interrupt David, Mary Margaret and Regina from researching what they were searching for in Camelot: The Crimson Crown. Following the dwarves' complaints, David blames himself for not saving Emma. However, David is interrupted by Arthur, who tells David that key items from his camp, including a magic bean that would take the displaced Camelot residents home, is missing. David and Arthur stop by the pawnshop first to acquire an item, then begin their search at the Arthurians' camp, where David asks the campers <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> the Chalice of Vengeance. This points him {{in the direction of}} the thief, revealed to be Arthur's squire, Grif, who immediately takes off on horseback, which leads to David and Arthur chasing Grif in David's pickup. David gives Arthur a crash course lesson in driving as he takes a piece of wood, using it as a makeshift joust, and knocks Grif off his horse. Grif later wakes up in the Sheriff's jail and admits that he was tired of how he was being treated, causing him to want to hurt the King. However, there was no magic bean found among the stolen items, but at the camp, David recognized the Crimson Crown on the ground and took it to Regina, who had also seen the question mark that she had handwritten on its illustration back in Camelot.|$|E

500|$|Another {{traditional}} assumption, {{based on}} {{the language of the}} inventories and shared by almost all writers, was that the cup was a piece of secular plate, for use at table, or display on a buffet beside it. The buffet of the period was more like a modern Welsh dresser or shop display unit, with receding shelves for displaying on important occasions all the plate of the household that was not in use. [...] Neil Stratford suggests that the cup was only used <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> on special occasions, including St Agnes' feast day, while Lightbown remarks that at over four pounds in weight the cup is much too heavy <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> conveniently. [...] However John Cherry, noting the exclusively religious subjects depicted (including that on the lost tripod stand) considers that the cup may have been intended as a ciborium from the start. It might have been used either to accompany in its carrying case the duke on his tours of his many castles and palaces, or perhaps for his foundation of the Saint Chapelle at his capital of Bourges, intended to rival the king's Sainte-Chapelle in Paris and his brother's foundation at Champmol in Dijon.|$|E

During a great feast, Alboin gets drunk and orders his wife Rosamund <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> his cup, made from the skull of his father-in-law Cunimund after he had slain him in 567 and married Rosamund. Alboin [...] "invited her to drink merrily with her father". This reignited the queen's determination to avenge her father.|$|E

Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body.|$|E

By August 9, the Rose–Baley Party had begun to lose confidence in Savedra's ability to find water, and had been forced to do their own scouting for the precious resource. They had taken to building casks out of pine in hopes that they could gather enough in containers to last them until the next acceptable supply. Udell wrote, [...] "Our water still holds out... like the widow's cruse of oil, and tastes more pleasant, having been stirred up so often for us." ...|$|E
