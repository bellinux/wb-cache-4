5000|$|PG Tags, {{tea bags}} with a string, were {{launched}} in 1985, and tetrahedron-shaped tea bags in 1996 (branded as Pyramid Bags). The tetrahedral bag {{was designed to}} help the tea leaves move more freely, as loose tea moves in a teapot, and supposedly create a better infusion. One 2011 version of the product packaging makes the claim: [...] "The PG Tips pyramid tea bag gives the tea leaves 50% more room to move around than a flat conventional tea bag. So the tea bag works more like a miniature tea pot. This allows for all the freshness to be released for the best <b>tasting</b> <b>cup</b> of PG." [...] During the T-Birds era, the tetrahedral tea bags were remade with a [...] "freeflow" [...] material, to allow further infusion of the tea.|$|E
40|$|Color {{measurements}} {{have been}} performed using eighteen virgin-olive-oil tasting cups with ten different commercial virgin olive oils, positioned in a color cabinet with a D 65 source. Three geometries (spectroradiometer tilted 0 °, 30 °, and 60 °) were employed, simulating different positions of the taster’s eye. Our main goal was to test whether traditional blue-tinted cups effectively conceal the color of virgin olive oils, as desired in sensorial analyses. None of the cups employed had all their geometrical dimensions within the standardized values, despite being cups used in official sensorial analyses. Measuring a magnitude similar to the spectral transmittance, we found substantial differences among the glasses of the eighteen tasting cups. Comparing color variability for one virgin olive oil in different tasting cups, and one <b>tasting</b> <b>cup</b> with different virgin olive oils, we discovered that: (1) variability was higher {{in the case of}} one virgin olive oil in different cups; (2) in both cases the variability increased with the tilt of the spectroradiometer; (3) even when the variability was lowest (i. e., 0 ° measurements for two oils in the same cup), the average color difference was above typical visual thresholds in simultaneous comparison experiments. In the most usual case of a successive comparison between two oils in the same <b>tasting</b> <b>cup,</b> it is expected that in most cases tasters will perceive color differences between the oils when their eyes are tilted 60 ° with respect to the horizontal, but not when they observe the cup in the horizontal direction. In summary, blue-tinted olive-oil-tasting cups reduce, but do not completely conceal, oil color. The use of opaque tasting cups with black walls is suggested.
