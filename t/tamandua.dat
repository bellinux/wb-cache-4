25|$|Information about {{fish species}} is scarce {{but at least}} four {{protected}} species have been detected. According to a CONANP study in 2007, there are 12 species of reptile here under protection, including the river crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), and one threatened species, the Yucatán banded gecko (Coleonyx elegans). Birds {{are the most common}} type of animal in the park, with about 195 species documented. Six of these species are threatened and 17 are subject to special protection. One threatened bird species in the park is the great curassow (Crax rubra). Relatively abundant species include Actitus macularia, Dendrocygna autumnalis, Egretta caerulea, Egretta thula, Tachybaptus dominicus and Coragyps atratus, all of which are associated with bodies of water. There have been 53 species of mammals detected recently in the park, of which two are considered threatened, two in danger and two subject to special protection. Endangered and threatened species include the spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), jaguarundi, ocelot, lowland paca, white-tailed deer, anteater (<b>Tamandua</b> tetradactyla) and buzzard (Sarcoramphus papa). The most abundant species include the bat Artibeus jamaicensis and the rat Peromyscus mexicanus.|$|E
2500|$|The canopy is {{the primary}} layer of the forest forming a roof over the two {{remaining}} layers. It contains {{the majority of the}} largest trees, typically 30–45 m in height. Tall, broad-leaved evergreen trees are the dominant plants. [...] The densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest canopy, as it often supports a rich flora of epiphytes, including orchids, bromeliads, mosses and lichens. [...] These epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. It is suggested that the total arthropod species richness of the tropical canopy might be as high as 20 million. Other species habituating this layer include many avian species such as the yellow-casqued wattled hornbill (Ceratogymna elata), collared sunbird (Anthreptes collaris), African gray parrot (Psitacus erithacus), keel-billed toucan (Ramphastos sulfuratus), scarlet macaw (Ara macao) as well as other animals like the spider monkey (Ateles sp.), African giant swallowtail (Papilio antimachus), three-toed sloth (Bradypus tridactylus), kinkajou (Potos flavus), and <b>tamandua</b> (<b>Tamandua</b> tetradactyla).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamanduas</b> {{manufacture}} {{a potent}} musk in their anal glands which they use for marking territory. They smear the strong smelling secretions on rocks, trees, fallen logs, and other prominent landmarks to announce their presence to other <b>tamanduas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>tamanduas</b> are nocturnal, {{active at}} night and {{secreting}} away in hollow tree trunks and burrows abandoned by other animals during daylight hours. They spend {{up to half of}} their time in the treetops, as much as 64%, where they forage for arboreal ants and termites. <b>Tamanduas</b> move rather awkwardly on the ground and are incapable of galloping like their relative, the giant anteater. <b>Tamanduas</b> walk on the sides on their clenched forefeet to avoid injuring their palms with their sharp claws.|$|R
5000|$|Their fur is thick, bristly, yellowish-white to fawn in color, {{often with}} a broad black lateral band, {{covering}} nearly {{the whole of the}} side of their bodies. Northern <b>tamanduas</b> are marked with a black V on their backs and a [...] "vest" [...] over their torso, while southern <b>tamanduas</b> in the lowest part of their range are considerably lighter in color and may have only the V.|$|R
2500|$|Termite colonies are {{generally}} large enclosed nests or mounds that house large supplies of wood for the termites to exploit, fulfilling the first criteria for fortress defense. In N. corniger, the soldier caste has had their heads modified to spew a noxious, sticky liquid when {{under attack from}} <b>Tamandua</b> anteaters. The secretion contains pinene, limonene and other high molecular weight compounds that deter the anteater from returning. The termites then remain on guard near the breach for several minutes. This adaptive morphology and defense of the habitat are sufficient for satisfying the second two criteria for fortress defense.|$|E

50|$|The {{northern}} <b>tamandua</b> (<b>Tamandua</b> mexicana) is {{a species}} of <b>tamandua,</b> an anteater in the family Myrmecophagidae. They live in tropical and subtropical forests from southern Mexico, through Central America, and {{to the edge of}} the northern Andes.|$|E
40|$|The {{parasitism}} of the {{two giant}} anteaters adults (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), one male and one female, infected naturally with Eimeria escomeli, E. <b>tamanduae</b> e E. marajoensis was related in the present research. In E. escomeli oocysts were 23. 9 +/- 1. 89 by 19. 7 +/- 1. 60 microm and its sporocysts were 11. 47 +/- 1. 25 by 6. 48 +/- 0. 80 microm. In E. <b>tamanduae</b> oocysts were 23. 52 +/- 0. 95 by 20. 59 +/- 0. 92 microm and its sporocysts were 12. 19 +/- 0. 65 by 7. 15 +/- 0. 55 microm. In E. marajoensis oocysts were 13. 5 +/- 1. 7 by 13. 1 +/- 1. 8 microm and its sporocysts were 7. 4 +/- 0. 58 by 5. 4 +/- 0. 8 microm. Eimeria escomeli was described before parasitizing giants anteater from Bolivia, and it was point out as {{the first time in}} Brazil. The presence of E. <b>tamanduae</b> and E. marajoensis parasitizing giant anteaters indicate the possibility of having co-infection of them among animals of the family Myrmecophagidae...|$|R
5000|$|Southern <b>tamanduas</b> eat ants and {{termites}} {{in roughly}} equal proportions, {{although they may}} also eat a small quantity of fruit. They locate their food by scent, and prey {{on a wide range}} of species, including army ants, carpenter ants, and Nasutitermes. [...] They avoid eating ants armed with strong chemical defenses, such as leafcutter ants. <b>Tamanduas</b> are also thought to eat honey and bees and, in captivity, have been known to eat fruit and meat, as well. Anteaters extract their prey by using their extremely strong fore limbs to rip open nests and their elongated snouts and rounded tongues (up to 40 cm in length) to lick up the insects.|$|R
50|$|With no defined {{breeding}} season for northern <b>tamanduas,</b> females {{appear to be}} able to enter oestrus at any time of year. Males locate fertile females by scent, and court them with repeated sniffing and swatting with their claws. Eventually, they use their strong fore limbs and tails to secure the females while they mate. Gestation lasts from 130 to 190 days, and results in the birth of a single offspring. The young anteater initially shelters in a nest in a hollow tree, but later moves about by clinging to its mother's back. Young leave the mother at about a year of age, and northern <b>tamanduas</b> have been reported to live up to 9.5 years in captivity.|$|R
50|$|Fauna {{includes}} {{species such}} as armadillo (Dasypus species), southern <b>tamandua</b> (<b>Tamandua</b> tetradactyla) and the threatened Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and cougar (Puma concolor).|$|E
5000|$|The word <b>tamanduá</b> is Tupi for [...] "anteater", and in Tupi and Portuguese {{refers to}} anteaters in general. In those languages, the <b>tamandua</b> is called tamanduá-mirim (mirim means [...] "small").|$|E
50|$|Protamandua is an extinct genus of anteaters. Its closest living {{relatives}} are the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and tamanduas (genus <b>Tamandua).</b> It {{may have been}} a common ancestor of Myrmecophaga and <b>Tamandua.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Neotamandua borealis is an {{extinct species}} of anteater. Fossils {{were found in}} the Honda Group at the Konzentrat-Lagerstätte of La Venta, Colombia. [...] It was {{suggested}} to be an ancestor of the giant anteater, and is also related to the <b>tamanduas.</b> The species has been described by Hirschfeld in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Anteater {{habitats}} include dry tropical forests, rainforests, grasslands, and savannas. The {{silky anteater}} (Cyclopes didactylus) is specialized to an arboreal environment, {{but the more}} opportunistic <b>tamanduas</b> find their food both {{on the ground and}} in trees, typically in dry forests near streams and lakes. The almost entirely terrestrial giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) lives in savannas.|$|R
50|$|The Jatobá Centenário {{ecological}} {{park was}} established in 1996. It has about 0.5 km2 of virgin forest and around 2,100 m of trails. Various species of fauna can be found. The most common are the macacos-pregos (nail monkeys), tatus (armadillos), <b>tamanduás,</b> capivaras, wolves, foxes, deer, fish, jabutis, ducks, egrets, hawks, toucans, jaós, partrige, bem-te-vi, and joão-de-barro, among others.|$|R
50|$|The two anteaters of {{the genus}} <b>Tamandua,</b> the {{southern}} (<b>Tamandua</b> tetradactyla) and the northern tamanduas (<b>Tamandua</b> mexicana), are {{much smaller than the}} giant anteater, and differ essentially from it in their habits, being mainly arboreal. They inhabit the dense primeval forests of South and Central America. The usual colour is yellowish-white, with a broad black lateral band, covering nearly the whole of the side of the body.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamandua</b> is a genus of anteaters {{with two}} species: the {{southern}} <b>tamandua</b> (T. tetradactyla) {{and the northern}} <b>tamandua</b> (T. mexicana). They live in forests and grasslands, are semiarboreal, and possess partially prehensile tails. They mainly eat ants and termites, but they occasionally eat bees, beetles, and insect larvae. In captivity, they will eat fruits and meat. They have no teeth and depend on their powerful gizzards to break down their food.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a varied}} fauna, {{including}} southern <b>tamandua</b> (<b>Tamandua</b> tetradactyla), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), cougar (Puma concolor) and Coimbra Filho's titi (Callicebus coimbrai).In 2011 {{a new species}} of amphibian was found, named Crossodactylodes itambe.|$|E
50|$|The Myrmecophagidae are {{a family}} of anteaters, the name being derived from the Ancient Greek words for 'ant' and 'eat' (myrmeco- and phagos). Two genera and three species are in the family, {{consisting}} of the giant anteater, and the <b>tamanduas.</b> The fossil Eurotamandua from the Messel Pit in Germany may be an early anteater, but its status is currently debated.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tamandua's</b> small eyes afford limited vision. Instead {{of relying}} on their sense of sight, they {{primarily}} utilize their senses of smell and hearing to locate their insect prey. They use their sharp claws and powerful forearms to tear open the nest of a colony of termites and employ their elongated tongues, coated with sticky saliva, to extract the insects.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tamanduas</b> have tapered {{heads with}} a long, tubular snout, small eyes, and {{protruding}} ears. Their tapered mouths house a tongue reaching upwards of 40 cm in length. The tail is hairless and pink in color, marked with an irregular pattern of black blotches. The forefeet possess four clawed digits, the third digit bearing the largest claw, while the hind feet have five digits.|$|R
50|$|The forest {{provides}} {{a refuge for}} species such as the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), southern <b>tamandua</b> (<b>Tamandua</b> tetradactyla), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), titi monkeys, and birds such as undulated tinamou (Crypturellus undulatus) and the turquoise-fronted amazon (Amazona aestiva).|$|E
50|$|Fauna include Arrau turtle (Podocnemis expansa), {{spectacled caiman}} (Caiman crocodilus), {{southern}} <b>tamandua</b> (<b>Tamandua</b> tetradactyla), Dasypus species, Kaapori capuchin (Cebus kaapori), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), cougar (Puma concolor), jaguar (Panthera onca), Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis) and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).|$|E

50|$|Northern <b>tamanduas</b> {{are mainly}} nocturnal, {{but are also}} often active during the day, and spend only around 40% {{of their time in}} the trees. They are active for about eight hours each day, {{spending}} {{the rest of the time}} sheltering in hollow trees. They are solitary animals, occupying home ranges of between 25 and 70 ha (62 and 170 ac). Known predators include jaguars and harpy eagles.|$|R
50|$|The IUCN Red List {{considers}} both {{species to}} be least concern. Both species are fairly common, yet face various threats. In Ecuador, <b>tamanduas</b> are killed in precaution {{due to the}} belief that they attack domestic dogs. Elsewhere they are sometimes hunted for meat or captured for the pet trade. They are also taken for the thick tendons in their tails, which are made into cordage.|$|R
