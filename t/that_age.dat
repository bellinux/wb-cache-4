5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious <b>that</b> <b>age</b> affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued <b>that</b> <b>age</b> doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E

5|$|Ocepeia is {{from the}} Paleocene of Morocco's Ouled Abdoun Basin, {{although}} its fossils were initially thought to be earliest Ypresian (early Eocene) in age. <b>That</b> <b>age</b> has been revised, {{and now it is}} known that O. daouiensis comes from the same bone bed that is dated to the Selandian age of the Paleocene (59-60 MYA), which also yields Eritherium, Abdounodus, and Lahimia. O. grandis is slightly younger (more recent) in age, occurring in the Thanetian bone bed of the same area. Its larger size and younger age suggest it is in the same evolutionary lineage as O. daouiensis. The area of western Morocco during the late Cretaceous through the Eocene consisted of warm, shallow inland seas, where the ancient Tethys Ocean met the Atlantic Ocean, and during which phosphate deposits and associated fossils accumulated over some 25 million years.|$|E

40|$|Amyloid {{precursor}} protein (APP) has been modified by β and γ-secretase that cause amy-loid deposits (plaques) in neuronal cells. Glyceraldhyde-derived AGEs {{has been identified}} as a major source of neurotoxicity in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a previous study, we dem-onstrated <b>that</b> glyceraldehyde-derived <b>AGEs</b> increase APP and Aβ via ROS. Furthermore, the combination of AGEs and Aβ has been shown to enhance neurotoxicity. In mice, APP expression is increased by tail vein injection of AGEs. This evidence suggests a correlation between AGEs and the development of AD. However, the role played by AGEs in the patho-genesis of AD remains unclear. In this report, we demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>AGEs</b> up-regulate APP processing protein (BACE and PS 1) and Sirt 1 expression via ROS, but do not affect the expression of downstream antioxidant genes HO- 1 and NQO- 1. Moreover, we found <b>that</b> <b>AGEs</b> increase GRP 78 expression and enhance the cell death-related pathway p 53, bcl- 2 / bax ratio, caspase 3. These results indicate <b>that</b> <b>AGEs</b> impair the neuroprotective effects of Sirt 1 and lead to neuronal cell death via ER stress. Our findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>AGEs</b> increase ROS production, which stimulates downstream pathways related to APP processing, Aβ production, Sirt 1, and GRP 78, resulting in the up-regulation of cell death related pathway. This in-turn enhances neuronal cell death, which leads to the development of AD...|$|R

The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain.

5|$|During {{most of the}} 19th century, {{schooling}} in England {{was provided}} either on a fee-paying basis or by the Church. To ensure that all children had access to elementary education, the Forster Act 1870 set up Local School Boards to provide elementary schools for all children aged 5 to 10. From 1880, schooling became compulsory for <b>that</b> <b>age</b> group. The Education Act 1902 consolidated these boards into local education authorities and allowed them to subsidise schools with money raised from local rate-payers. Alongside a grammar school for boys, a private school for girls and a mixed National School, Sleaford had four elementary schools in 1905: two Wesleyan (one was for infants), one Catholic and one other infants school. The construction of the Bass maltings (1901–06) and the Rauceby Asylum (1897–1902) led {{to an increase in}} the town's population and school inspectors found that the four schools could not accommodate every child in the town. The indebted Wesleyan schools could not afford any enlargements so the town's elementary school managers opted for Kesteven County Council to take responsibility under the 1902 Act. The Council built a schoolhouse on Church Lane at the cost of £11,500, which opened as Sleaford Council School on 4 May 1908. The staff and pupils at the Wesleyan schools were transferred there; its first headmaster was H. H. Godfrey, who had been master at the Wesleyan school. Built with a capacity of 600 pupils, 280 were on roll when teaching commenced.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor is an upland area formed almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Devonian and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the geological period and system, 'Devonian', comes from Devon, as rocks of <b>that</b> <b>age</b> were first studied and described here. With {{the exception of a}} suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself), all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group, which comprises a mix of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member (formerly 'Formation') of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (formerly 'Group'). The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform. The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet, acid soil.|$|E
