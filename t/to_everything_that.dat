500|$|When {{the band}} was {{creating}} the album art, they intended to create something provocative and captivating and so they experimented with how [...] "black and white American flags could represent [...] "a much bigger idea of the sterilization that we are experiencing."

60|$|To own the truth, the {{chaplain}} {{was a little}} confused. He had entered into the controversy with so much zeal, of late, as to have imbibed the feelings of a thorough partisan; and, as is usual, with such philosophers, was beginning <b>to</b> overlook <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> made against his opinions, and <b>to</b> exaggerate <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> sustained them.|$|R

500|$|Knight Ridder {{music critic}} Howard Cohen gave the album {{four out of}} four stars lauding Fernández's vocals and Estefan Jr.'s production. Ramiro Burr's review for the San Antonio Express-News praised the [...] "blend of pop balladry with ranchera rhythms and {{traditional}} instruments that elevates this CD". He felt that Fernández [...] "conveys a wealth of emotion in his songs" [...] and called [...] "En El Jardín" [...] a [...] "glorious ballad". Eliseo Cardona of El Nuevo Herald lauded Santander's compositions and called Fernández a [...] "first-rate interpreter {{who knows how to}} give a poetic edge <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> goes through his throat".|$|E

[...] He appears as a subscriber of El Puerto, the first newspaper published in Pichilemu, which only printed three editions. In {{the first edition of}} the newspaper, dated 16 January 1908, an article states that José María Caro Martínez and Exequiel Fernández were awarded 200 pesos in a raffle held on the previous day in the headquarters of the La Unión newspaper, in Santiago.|$|E

500|$|In a January 1996 murder case, the {{defendant}} counsel for Brian Bassett, 16, and Nicholaus McDonald, 18, {{claimed that the}} pair listened to [...] "Israel's Son", from Frogstomp, which contributed {{to the murder of}} Bassett's parents and a younger brother. McDonald's lawyer cited the lyrics [...] "'Hate is what I feel for you/I {{want you to know that}} I want you dead'" [...] which were [...] "almost a script. They're relevant <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> happened". The band's manager, Watson, issued a statement that they did not condone nor intend any such acts of violence. Prosecutors rejected the defence case and convinced the jury that the murder was committed to [...] "steal money and belongings and run off to California." ...|$|E
500|$|Alongside the [...] "cheating" [...] rumors, {{the public}} {{inferred}} from the lyrics that Usher had impregnated a mistress in real life. Usher, however, emphasized {{that he was}} not in a relationship and [...] "got another girl pregnant" [...] and he was singing a [...] "character". The similarity of situations he faced before and experiences of his friends collectively inspired him to write the song. In the middle of rumors, Dupri admitted that the stories behind the songs in the album are his. He stated, [...] "me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> happened to my main girl."

500|$|Amidst {{widespread}} rumors, Usher stated, [...] "People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my personal experiences {{to make my}} music." [...] He added that he loved Chilli, however, [...] "...it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash..." [...] Although [...] "Burn" [...] is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's just something that I collectively got energy from everybody around me that had been through it." [...] In early 2006, Dupri revealed that {{the story behind the}} album is his: [...] "...me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> happened to my main girl." ...|$|E

500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me. I mean, we are not only saying that a particular piece of music is superior <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> is out now, {{but it will be}} better than most things released in the future as well [...] I only gave one 5 under my watch and it went to Nas's Illmatic." [...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that stuff out {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E
500|$|The cast {{itself has}} {{received}} criticism from reviews. Lundigran criticized {{the manner in}} which romantic interactions play out, stating that [...] "considering that the love story is so integral <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> happens—not to mention forming the central image of the box art—it's incomprehensible why no one says 'I love you' to anyone, ever". With Squall, he felt that [...] "FFVIII does break one cardinal rule: when your story is character centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall, unfortunately, just doesn't fit the bill". However, GameSpot felt that Final Fantasy VIII shifts the story from the [...] "epic" [...] concepts of Final Fantasy VII to the [...] "personal", in that [...] "the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex; moreover, the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny". A later editorial by IGN's Ryan Clements echoed this sentiment, appreciating that Squall and Rinoa's single kiss during the finale serves [...] "one of the player's main rewards for hours of dedication". Although the reviewer at Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine acknowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline, he stated that [...] "it's only later in the game, once you are really attached to all the distinct and complex characters, that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced".|$|E

To the world I am a satanist, which means resistance <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> holds you down. [...] When I use the word 'Satan' it means the natural order, the will of a man, the will to grow, the will to become the superman and not to be oppressed by any law such as the church, which is only a way to control the masses.|$|E

2500|$|Moses descends {{from the}} mountain, {{and his face}} is transformed, so that from that time onwards he has to hide {{his face with a}} veil.

[...] "And all the construction of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting was finished, and the children of Israel did according <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> God had commanded Moses", and from that time God dwelt in the Tabernacle and ordered the travels of the Hebrews.|$|E
2500|$|The Storer House {{was built}} in 1923 for Dr. John Storer, a homeopathic physician. Wright used the textile-block motif to [...] "fit" [...] the home into the hillside, trying to create the {{impression}} that the home was [...] "a man-made extension of the landscape." [...] However, Wright biographer Brendan Gill described the Storer House as a disappointment on this score: [...] "In direct contradiction <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> Wright had earlier preached about the natural, nearly invisible joining of structure and site, the Storer House, small as it is, asserts its presence with a surprising degree of arrogance—an arrogance far more obvious in the 1920s, when the hillside lacked the softening effect of foliage, than it is today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Future {{factional}} ally Benjamin Gitlow {{later recalled}} the initial impression which Pepper made upon {{him when he}} first {{met him at the}} Bridgman convention: [...] The second of the three Comintern nuncios looked like a Hungarian version of the proverbial traveling salesman. Short and stocky, with a large head and a disproportionately larger nose that proudly bore a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles perched importantly on its bridge, he dressed like a dude, combed his hair sleek and neat, was always clean-shaven, smoked gold-tipped cigarettes, listened attentively <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> was being said in his presence, and said absolutely nothing....

Santos then starred alongside Ryan Agoncillo and Eugene Domingo in the comedy film , as a married middle-aged professional donning the patriarchal role. The movie received mixed critical reviews, but was a modest box office success. Philbert Dy of ClickTheCity.com gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, citing, [...] "She [...] {{is still one of the}} finest actresses to ever grace our screens, and she makes it a little easier to forgive the film's technical flaws. Like the film, she largely goes for what's real, and offers up natural, familiar reactions <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> she's given." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 20th century, {{literary}} criticism of Barrett Browning's poetry remained sparse until her poems were {{discovered by the}} women's movement. She once described herself as being inclined to reject several women's rights principles, suggesting in letters to Mary Russell Mitford and her husband that she believed {{that there was an}} inferiority of intellect in women. In Aurora Leigh, however, she created a strong and independent woman who embraces both work and love. Leighton writes that because Elizabeth participates in the literary world, where voice and diction are dominated by perceived masculine superiority, she [...] "is defined only in mysterious opposition <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> distinguishes the male subject who writes..." [...] A five-volume scholarly edition of her works was published in 2010, the first in over a century.|$|E

Mandžukić scored his 11th La Liga goal of the season in his 19th appearance, in Los Colchoneros emphatic 4–0 victory over local rivals Real Madrid in the second league derby of the season, when sport analysts noted that Mandzukic put in one of the great centre-forward displays seen in La Liga in recent years, contributing <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> was good about his side before putting the icing on the cake with a well-taken fourth.
