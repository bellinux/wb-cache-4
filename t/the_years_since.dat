5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian orogeny. This {{happened}} long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since,</b> up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.|$|E

5|$|CR26 has {{continued}} to deteriorate in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since,</b> with one , limited maintenance segment seeing the most wear. This section, situated midway between NY30 and NY3, has become both littered with potholes and extremely narrow due to {{the erosion of the}} highway's shoulders. In mid-2009, residents of Loon Lake petitioned the county to repair all of CR26 and to continuously maintain the highway, citing the road's regional importance as a through route for commuters traveling to and from the village of Malone.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> its release, their fate immediately after the film is ironic. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ronny Howard) attracted a buyer, selling for only a few hundred dollars. The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science fiction film.|$|E

5|$|NY370 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York as a Red Creek–Liverpool highway, replacing NY40 west of Cato and New York State Route37 from Cato to Baldwinsville.

That route was eliminated in 1982, at which time NY370 was extended eastward to Syracuse over NY57's former routing.
