5|$|Veronica goes to Dean O’Dell {{and asks}} for an exchange: Veronica tells him that his son spray-painted his car, and he will hire Weevil. Veronica talks to the {{gambling}} owner, who acts strangely. Veronica tracks his car before removing the tracker later. Veronica talks to Trish, who says that Kurt left for Kansas. Weevil starts his new job as a Hearst janitor. Piz gets a job on a campus radio show, where he interviews both the feminists and the fraternity boys. In {{the middle of the}} show, the feminists get a text <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Claire, the girl who the fraternity boys pointed out, was raped. Veronica and Logan reconcile their relationship and kiss.|$|E

40|$|In the {{contemporary}} {{saga of the}} Greek/Eurozone (=Eurozone) crisis, there are basically four sorts of policy propositions. There are the ones <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Greece is helpless, that the Eurozone is a poor design and, thus, that Greece should default and the Eurozone should dissolve. There are those <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Greece is at a deadlock and thus it should indeed default – but inside the Eurozone, which should improve its governance and complete its integration (towards fiscal union). Then, there are those <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Greece is a sinner in an otherwise catholic Eurozone and should thus suffer (aka undergo an internal devaluation {{of as much as}} it takes) until it redeems itself (i. e., until it becomes competitive – whatever that means outside the virtual reality of economics textbooks). And then there are those discredited ones <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Greece has been in the wrong end of things {{and it needs to be}} supported within a programme of socio-institutional modernisation, capital deepening, economic restructuring and technological upgrading in order to increase its productivity in line with the (imaginary) “Eurozone average”...|$|R

Murray also wrote that in ancient China {{there was more than}} one game called xiangqi.|$|E

25|$|The oldest Catalan symbol is {{the coat}} of arms of Catalonia, {{one of the oldest}} coats of arms in Europe.

25|$|The Groundhog Day celebration {{is rooted}} in a Celtic and Germanic {{tradition}} <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> if a hibernating animal casts a shadow on February 2, the Pagan holiday of Imbolc (known among Christians as Candlemas), winter and cold weather will last another six weeks. If no shadow is seen, legend says, spring will come early. In Germany, the tradition evolved into a myth that if the sun came out on Candlemas, a hedgehog would cast its shadow, predicting snow {{all the way into}} May. When German immigrants settled in Pennsylvania, they transferred the tradition onto local fauna, replacing hedgehogs with groundhogs.|$|E
25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we will never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E

Despite these changes, the copyright date on the film remains 2003. HBO promoted it as [...] "a new movie... from the makers of The Queen" [...] and the DVD was marketed as [...] "The Prequel to The Queen", even though the film was made and originally released before The Queen.|$|E

40|$|Thomas Blackson {{argues that}} interest-relative epistemologies cannot explain the irrationality of certain choices when the agent has three {{possible}} options. I argue that his examples only refute a subclass of interest-relative theories. In particular, {{they are good}} objections to theories <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> what an agent knows depends on the stakes involved in the gambles that she faces. But they are not good objections to theories <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> what an agent knows depends on the odds involved in the gambles that she faces.

The campaign calls for women to start driving from 17 June 2011. By 21 May 2011, about 12,000 readers of the Facebook page had expressed their support. Al-Sharif describes the action as acting within women's rights, and [...] "not protesting". Wajeha al-Huwaider was impressed by the campaign and decided to help.|$|E
500|$|... "The Voice Within" [...] {{was written}} by Christina Aguilera and Glen Ballard, and was {{produced}} by Ballard. The track was recorded by Scott Campbell at The Record Plant in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California and at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, LA, CA, while it was mixed by Peter Mokran. Bass was performed by Mike Elizondo, while Matt Chamberlain played drums. Ballard also played guitar with John Goux, and played keyboards with Randy Kerber. Musically, [...] "The Voice Within" [...] is a piano-driven ballad. Composed in the key of Gmajor, it has a moderately slow tempo of 66 beats per minute. Aguilera's vocal range on the track spans from the low-note of D3 to the high-note of F♯5. Her vocals on the song were described as strong and powerful by critics. Lyrically, [...] "The Voice Within" [...] is an inspirational song <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> one should trust one's heart and own mind, and find inner strength.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E

2500|$|In second-order logic, it is {{possible}} to write formal sentences which say [...] "the domain is finite" [...] or [...] "the domain is of countable cardinality." [...] To say that the domain is finite, use the sentence <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> every surjective function from the domain to itself is injective. To say that the domain has countable cardinality, use the sentence <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> there is a bijection between every two infinite subsets of the domain.

This is essentially saying that temperature comes either from some source or from earlier in time because heat permeates but is not created from nothingness. This is a property of parabolic partial differential equations and is not difficult to prove mathematically (see below).|$|E
