50|$|<b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii,</b> the Norway pout, is {{a species}} of fish in the cod family. It {{is found in the}} Barents Sea, North Sea, Baltic Sea, off the coasts of Norway, Iceland, the British Isles and {{elsewhere}} in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. It prefers depths between 100 and(-) 200 m, but occurs from 50 to(-) 300 m. Norway pout can reach 35 cm, but are more common at around 19 cm.|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} version of the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) is proposed in which a sine wave modifies a standard version of the VBGF, enabling a smooth transition between rapid summer growth and a variable period of zero growth (in length) during winter or during the dry season for aestivating fishes. The key features of a nonlinear routine for fitting this new mode! are also presented, with emphasis on the estimation of the period of zero growth. Application examples, to Salmo salar and <b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii,</b> are presented...|$|E
40|$|In clear oceanic {{waters off}} the Norwegian shelf and in outer shelf waters, mesopelagic fish (Maurolicus muelleri) were located at {{approximately}} 200 m by day. Across a front into water of lower light penetration, M. muelleri ascended about 100 m. Concurrently, {{a layer of}} krill (Thysanoessa inermis) appeared at between 150 - 200 m, i. e. below their potential predator M. muelleri and generally about 100 m above the bottom. The bottom associated fish Norway pout (<b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii),</b> occasionally ascended from the benthic boundary layer, foraging in {{the lower part of}} the krill layer. However, evidence was found that T. inermis responded to their presence by upward swimming. These results indicate that optical properties of water masses may be prominent in governing plankton and fish distributions and their predator-prey interactions. They furthermore suggest instantaneous behavioral responses in fish and krill to the presence of their respective prey and predator...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} frequency response {{is an important}} acoustic feature used to characterise acoustic targets. This response {{has been defined as}} the sv, volume backscattering coefficient, for a specific frequency relative to that of a reference frequency (38 kHz). The acoustic data commonly used in these calculations are derived from integrated measurements in a region containing multiple targets. In this study the {{relative frequency}} responses at 18, 38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz have additionally been measured using filtered target strength data on all frequencies. The spatial comparability of the sv-data is thus avoided, while the single-target detection becomes a new challenge. Target strength was extracted from in situ measurements, using calibrated and digitised data from a Simrad EK 60 with split-beam transducers transmitting simultaneously at all five frequencies. Selected series with nearly pure catches of Atlantic cod (Gadus Morhua L.), saithe (Pollachius virens L.) and Norway pout (<b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii</b> L.) were analysed. The frequency response derived by the new method is compared with standard integration method...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of acoustical scattering layers {{of fish and}} krill changed markedly in concert with fluctuating fluorescence (chlorophyll a) in upper waters, possibly due to a varying 'shadow effect'. Beneath clear waters on the outer Norwegian shelf (about 300 m depth), mesopelagic fish (Maurolicus muelleri) were located at approximately 150 to 200 m by day. Krill (mainly Thysanoessa inermis) was primarily found below the mesopelagic fish and above planktivorous demersal fish (Norway pout <b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii).</b> The vertical distributions changed abruptly across a front into water with less Light penetration associated with increased fluorescence (chlorophyll a). Mesopelagic fish ascended by about 100 m accompanied by a rise of krill. Demersal fish left the benthic boundary zone, with ascending Norway pout foraging in {{the lower part of}} the krill layer. We suggest that the intermediate light conditions inside the front provided an 'antipredation window' (sensu Clark & Levy 1988 : Am Nat 131 : 271 - 290) and thereby favorable feeding conditions for the planktivore. These results indicate that properties of upper layers may impact plankton and fish distributions and their predator-prey interactions throughout the water column on continental shelves...|$|E
40|$|The {{interplay between}} temperature-related {{processes}} and predation in determining age- 1 recruitment strength between 1992 and 2006 was analysed for North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) and Norway pout (<b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii).</b> For this purpose, an predation impact index (PI) was calculated out of survey data. PI {{was assumed to}} depend on the abundance of the predators and on the spatial overlap between predator and prey populations. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were created with spawning stock biomass (SSB) and sea surface temperature (SST) in the respective spawning and nursery areas and PI as explaining variables. SSB had no significant impact on recruitment during this time period for both species. SSTs during spring and PI explained the interannual variability in recruitment strength to a large extent (88 % of the total variance for cod and 68 % for Norway pout). The SST during spring determined the overall level of recruitment. At SSTs above a certain level, however, the effect on recruitment was no longer significant. In these temperature ranges, predation was the dominant effect. Therefore, the fate of North Sea cod and Norway pout stocks under global-warming conditions will be strongly influenced by the status of the North Sea food web...|$|E
40|$|In situ {{swimming}} speed and swimming behaviour of dielly migrating planktivorous fish were studied at a 120 -m-deep location. Acoustic target tracking was performed using a hull-mounted transducer and submersible transducers {{located on the}} sea bottom and free hanging in the water column. The original data displayed a relationship between distance to transducer and {{swimming speed}}. A simplistic smoother applied during post-processing, appeared to break this relationship. Target tracking thus provided robust results on in situ swimming behaviour throughout the water column. Swimming speeds of deep-living fish, mainly Norway pout (<b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii)</b> and whiting (Merlangius merlangus), were highest during the day (speeds centred around 14 – 16 cm·s– 1) and decreased somewhat by night (modes around 10 – 11 cm·s– 1). Fish in the upper 10 – 30 m swam somewhat faster (speeds ranging from 16 to 24 cm·s– 1). Fish in the upper layer at night were mainly Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and whiting. We ascribe the reduction of swimming speed in deep-living fish at night to a switch from visual feeding during daytime to nonvisual feeding by night. We suggest that shallow-living fish could forage visually even by night. Most tracks were fairly short, but some long tracks unveiled elaborate swimming paths as well as cyclic swimming behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The Norway pout (<b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii)</b> {{stock in}} the North Sea has {{experienced}} poor recruitment recently. Herring (Clupea harengus) has been suggested {{to be a major}} predator on fish larvae in the North Sea. We investigated possible interactions between herring and Norway pout using a simple statistical analysis and a modified stock - recruit relationship. There was a significant negative relationship (linear regression, r = 20. 44, p < 0. 05) between total herring biomass and recruitment of Norway pout. The spawning stock of Norway pout is typically dominated by 2 -year-olds, and there was a strong negative relationship (linear regression, r = 20. 79, p < 0. 01) between herring biomass and Norway pout spawning-stock biomass (SSB) 2 years later. A Beverton-Holt model fitted to stock recruit data of Norway pout produced a rather poor correlation (r(2) = 0. 04). However, when only the Norway pout SSB not overlapping with herring is considered, the fit between the model and the stock - recruit data improves (r(2) = 0. 31). The analyses indicate a negative impact by herring on recruitment of Norway pout, the most plausible cause for this being herring predation on Norway pout larvae, but field studies are needed to verify such predation...|$|E
40|$|Younger {{ages and}} smaller sizes at {{maturation}} {{have been observed}} in commercial fish stocks over the last century. We establish that age and length at 50 % proportion mature (i. e. the proportion of mature individuals in a population or the probability that an individual is mature) decreased from the 1970 s to the 2000 s in North Sea cod Gadus morhua, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and whiting Merlangius merlangus, but not in Norway pout <b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii.</b> The potential contributions of demography, phenotypic plasticity and evolution to these trends were assessed. First, maturation trends were extricated from demographic effects and growth-dependent plasticity by estimating probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs). PMRN midpoints have significantly shifted downwards at most ages for cod, haddock and whiting, but not for Norway pout. Second, increased temperature and food abundance, loosened trophic competition and relaxed social pressure may also trigger growth-independent plasticity in maturation. Principal component regression of PMRN midpoints on annual estimates of relevant environmental variables exhibiting a temporal trend suggest that, despite some evidence of environmental effects, PMRN trends were mostly independent of growth-independent plasticity in haddock, whiting and male cod, but not in female cod. According to these findings, evolution of maturation, potentially in response to fishing, is plausible in haddock, whiting and male cod, but unlikely for Norway pout, and does not explain trends in female cod maturation. In agreement with life-history theory, the maturation response was larger in fast-growing, late- and large-maturing species exhibiting moderate reproductive effort...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{diets and}} nest attendance patterns of northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) on Foula and Unst, Shetland, UK, during the breeding seasons of 1998 and 1999. Mean foraging trip duration, derived from nest attendance patterns, differed between incubation (32. 5 h) and chick-rearing (early stage: 11. 2 h, mid-stage: 20. 4 h). It {{was influenced by}} chick age and obviously also by prey availability. The numbers of fulmars attending the colonies were influenced by wind direction, wind speed, time of day and state of reproduction. Diet samples were collected by regurgitations of adult and young fulmars. Diet was analysed by identifying prey items {{on the basis of}} otoliths, vertebrae, premaxillae (fish), cephalopod beaks and fragments of arthropod exoskeletons. Adult fulmars and chicks fed upon a wide range of prey types. Gadoid fish, including Norway pout (<b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii),</b> were the most common prey in the diet. Fish offal was found in 32 % of regurgitates, clupeids in 15 %. In contrast, the proportions of sandeels were very low (1 %). This is different from previous studies where sandeels formed a large part of fulmar diet at Shetland in summer. Differences in food composition of incubating and chick-rearing fulmars were found for fish, but not for offal, crustaceans or squid. The percentage of non-discard fish (Clupeidae, Ammodytidae, Isospondylae) was significantly different between regurgitates from incubating and chick- rearing fulmars. Samples from chick-rearing adults contained non-discard items more frequently than regurgitates from incubating birds. The results strongly indicate that fulmars select to feed their chicks on energy-rich clupeid...|$|E
40|$|This study uses a 20 -year {{time series}} of {{standardized}} bottom trawl winter survey data (1994 - 2013) from the Barents Sea, {{to investigate the}} changes in abundance and distributional range of Norway pout (<b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii)</b> in response to changing sea temperatures. Due to the boreal Norway pout’s rather limited geographical distribution in the Barents Sea, and that Norway pout suffers no targeted fishing mortality in the Barents Sea, the species may be a well suited indicator species of climate and ecosystem change here. Annual Norway pout abundance indices were adjusted for diel changes in catchability, and an evident increase in Norway pout abundance was found during the study period, although a marked decrease {{the last two years}} was also evident. The distributional range was also found to increase, especially northwards from the distinct core area in the southwestern part of the Barents Sea. Although a rather weak correlation was found when comparing annual Norway pout abundance indices with annual corresponding sea temperatures (r = 0. 32), stronger correlations were found when abundance indices were compared to sea temperatures which were measured two (r = 0. 67) and three years (r = 0. 72) in advance. Reasons for these rather strong lagged (delayed) correlations are briefly being discussed in this thesis, and may be related to temperature effects on recruitment, maternal conditions (e. g. fecundity), changes in abundance/distribution of other species which affect Norway pout abundance (prey, predators or competitors), and/or a gradual expansion due to increased suitable habitat...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} 15 years, {{northern}} European hake (Merluccius merluccius) {{has increased in}} abundance, and its spatial distribution has expanded in the North Sea region in correlation with temperature. In a context of global warming, this spatial shift could impact local trophic interactions: direct impacts may affect forage fish through modified predator–prey interactions, and indirect impacts may materialize through competition with other resident predators. For instance, North Sea saithe (Pollachius virens) spatial overlap with hake has increased while saithe spawning-stock biomass has decreased recently notwithstanding a sustainable exploitation. In this context, we investigated the range of potential impacts resulting from most recent hake emergence in the North Sea, with a particular focus on saithe. We carried out a multispecies assessment of North Sea saithe, using the Stochastic MultiSpecies (SMS) model. In addition to top-down processes already implemented in SMS, we built in the model bottom-up processes, relating Norway pout (<b>Trisopterus</b> <b>esmarkii)</b> abundance and saithe weight-at-age. We simulated the effects, on all North Sea species being considered but focusing on Norway pout and saithe, of combining different hake abundance trends scenarios with the inclusion of bottom-up processes in SMS. North Sea saithe FMSY was then evaluated in a multispecies context and contrasted with single-species value. The different scenarios tested revealed a negative impact of hake emergence on saithe biomass, resulting from an increase of predation pressure on Norway pout. These results confirm the competition assumption between saithe and hake in the North Sea and might partially explain the most recent decrease of saithe biomass. This study also highlighted that taking into account bottom-up processes in the stock assessment had a limited effect on the estimation of saithe FMSY which was consistent with single-species value...|$|E
