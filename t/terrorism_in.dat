5|$|Although {{the film}} was not a major success, former Research Fellow at Australia's National Film & Sound Archive Robert Cettl, in his 2009 book <b>Terrorism</b> <b>in</b> American cinema: an {{analytical}} filmography, 1960–2008 argues that the film reveals an alarmingly realist insight into US-Middle Eastern politics and terrorism since the 2000s, dealing with an al-Qaeda-esque terrorist organization and the conspiracy theories that some believe the US government is using the Middle East as a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Oklahoma City was {{the site}} {{of one of the most}} {{destructive}} acts of domestic <b>terrorism</b> <b>in</b> American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Singapore went through some post-independence crises, {{including}} the SARS outbreak in 2003 {{and the threat}} of <b>terrorism.</b> <b>In</b> December 2001, a plot to bomb embassies and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered and as many as 36 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group were arrested under the Internal Security Act. Major counter-terrorism measures were put in place to detect and prevent potential terrorist acts and to minimise damages should they occur. More emphasis was placed on promoting social integration and trust between the different communities.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the attacks, many governments across the world passed {{legislation}} to combat <b>terrorism.</b> <b>In</b> Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted. The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany. The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement. Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, that nation's first anti-terrorism law. The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1991, Jashari {{participated in}} {{attacks against the}} Serbian police before {{travelling}} to Albania to receive military training.

In July 1997, he was convicted of <b>terrorism</b> <b>in</b> absentia by a Yugoslav court. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture or kill him, Serbian police launched an attack against Jashari's home in Prekaz in March 1998. The battle that followed resulted in the deaths of 58 members of Jashari's family, including that of Jashari, his wife, brother and son.|$|E

5|$|Early in the film, Hoffman {{explains}} to his superiors that the terrorists' retreat to pre-tech age communication methods renders useless the high specification tools the CIA uses, {{and increases the}} worth of Ferris's human intelligence methods. They avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring face-to-face communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak on the phone) and surveillance (high altitude spy planes offer {{a different point of}} view throughout) technology. David Denby of The New Yorker said that this was Scott's suggestion that the CIA has the technology but not the human intelligence to properly fight <b>terrorism</b> <b>in</b> the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|In December 1829, Rosas became {{governor}} of the province of Buenos Aires and established a dictatorship backed by state <b>terrorism.</b> <b>In</b> 1831, he signed the Federal Pact, recognising provincial autonomy and creating the Argentine Confederation. When his term of office ended in 1832, Rosas departed to the frontier to wage war on the indigenous peoples. After his supporters launched a coup in Buenos Aires, Rosas was asked to return and once again took office as governor. Rosas reestablished his dictatorship and formed the repressive Mazorca, an armed parapolice that killed thousands of citizens. Elections became a farce, and the legislature and judiciary became docile instruments of his will. Rosas created a cult of personality and his regime became totalitarian in nature, with all aspects of society rigidly controlled.|$|E
5|$|With Thalapathi, Mani {{ended his}} {{long-term}} association with music director Ilaiyaraaja, bringing in debutant music director A. R. Rahman to score his Tamil classic Roja (1992). The venture was successful, earning Mani various awards. Roja, a romantic film, was about <b>terrorism</b> <b>in</b> the Kashmir region. Starring Arvind Swamy and Madhoo, it {{was nominated for}} the Golden St. George Award at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. It became highly popular, gaining an iconic status in Indian cinema and was dubbed into other languages and met similar success in other regions. Mani took a more light-hearted approach with his next film—Thiruda Thiruda (1993). Scripted by Ram Gopal Varma, the film was a fun filled caper, which was a departure from Mani's previous style and fared moderately well at the box office. Thiruda Thiruda was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1994.|$|E

50|$|The {{international}} community {{has not been able}} to come to a universally-accepted definition of <b>terrorism.</b> The difficulty <b>in</b> defining <b>terrorism</b> stem from the fact that it is politically and emotionally charged. The history of <b>terrorism</b> incidence <b>in</b> Northern Ireland, Middle East and South East Asia indicate that terrorism is perpetrated by a group of aggrieved people that see violence as the only means of achieving their political goals. The loose definition of <b>terrorism</b> resulted <b>in</b> the execution of State-sanctioned terrorism as well as acts of terror carried out by militant groups, each trying to legitimise their act of terror.|$|R
5|$|In season 10, Cristina {{decides to}} accept a job to run {{a state of the}} art clinic in Switzerland.

While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of <b>terrorism</b> <b>in</b> Seattle, which later turns out to be just a gas main explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances it out with Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving a patient in the O.R., so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass.|$|E
5|$|She portrayed {{a wealthy}} {{university}} patron in Chen Shi-zheng's much-delayed feature drama Dark Matter, {{a film about}} a Chinese science graduate student who becomes violent after dealing with academic politics at a U.S. university. Inspired {{by the events of}} the 1991 University of Iowa shooting, and initially scheduled for a 2007 release, producers and investors decided to shelve Dark Matter out of respect for the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007. The drama received negative to mixed reviews upon its limited 2008 release. Streep played a U.S. government official who investigates an Egyptian foreign national suspected of <b>terrorism</b> <b>in</b> the political thriller Rendition (2007), directed by Gavin Hood. Keen to get involved in a thriller film, Streep welcomed the opportunity to star in a film genre for which she was not usually offered scripts and immediately signed on to the project. Upon its release, Rendition was less commercially successful, and received mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|The 130th Engineer Brigade mobilized {{in support}} of the Global War on <b>Terrorism</b> <b>in</b> 2003. It was {{commanded}} by Colonel Gregg F. Martin. As preparations were being made for Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 130th Engineer Brigade was placed in charge of the largest engineering force in the theater. This included seven different engineering battalions as well as several separate group and company sized elements. Units of the brigade were then deployed to Kuwait in early 2003, along with much of V Corps' staff. They would provide command and assistance for the 3rd Infantry Division, 82nd Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division as they crossed the border to Iraq and attacked to the capitol region of Baghdad from the south. Coupled with the landings of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team to the north, the operation would see the US Forces surround and destroy Iraqi forces in and around the capitol.|$|E

5|$|The Oklahoma City {{bombing was}} a {{domestic}} terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing killed 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed {{one-third of the}} building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies {{in the wake of}} the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. The Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil until the September 11 attacks six years later, and it still remains the deadliest incident of domestic <b>terrorism</b> <b>in</b> United States history.|$|E
5|$|The {{probable}} {{leader of}} the group was George Gardstein, whose real name was {{likely to have been}} Poloski or Poolka; he used the aliases Garstin, Poloski, Poolka, Morountzeff, Mourimitz, Maurivitz, Milowitz, Morintz, Morin and Levi. Gardstein, who probably was an anarchist, had been accused of murder and acts of <b>terrorism</b> <b>in</b> Warsaw in 1905 before his arrival in London. Another member of the group, Jacob (or Yakov) Peters, had been an agitator in Russia while in the army and later as a dockyard worker. He had served a term in prison for his activities and had been tortured by the removal of his fingernails. Yourka Dubof was another Russian agitator who had fled to England after being flogged by Cossacks. Fritz Svaars was a Latvian who had been arrested by the Russian authorities three times for terrorist offences, but escaped each time. He had travelled through the United States, where he undertook a series of robberies, before arriving in London in June 1910.|$|E

The public may freely photograph Cloud Gate, but permission from Kapoor or the City of Chicago (which has licensed the art) is required for any commercial reproductions of the photographs. Initially the city charged photographers permit fees of $350 per day for professional still photographers, $1,200 per day for professional videographers and $50 per hour for wedding photographers. The policy has been changed so permits are only required for large-scale film, video and photography requiring 10-person crews.|$|E
