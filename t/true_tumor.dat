A comprehensive MEDLINE search was performed to identify all previously reported cases of intrathoracic desmoid tumor.

Patient age ranged from 5 to 66 years. Average tumor size was 9. 2 cm. All patients underwent surgical resection with negative margins in two-thirds. Twenty-five percent of those patients developed local recurrence. ConclusionsUnlike superficial chest wall desmoid tumors which will create a palpable mass, intrapleural tumors will not cause symptoms until they grow large enough to locally invade chest wall or surrounding structures or compress pulmonary parenchyma.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>True</b> {{malignant}} mixed <b>tumor,</b> {{also known}} as carcinosarcoma, is a salivary gland type malignant neoplasm, which is extremely rare, {{and only a few}} cases arising in the larynx have been previously reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a case of <b>true</b> malignant mixed <b>tumor</b> arising in the larynx of a 65 -year-old woman successfully treated with surgery. Histologically, the neoplasm was composed of variably mixed, neoplastic glandular, spindle, and chondroid tissues. Immunohistochemical analyses showed a peculiar expression of myoepithelial markers such as p 63 and calponin in the glandular epithelial component, whereas malignant spindle cell proliferation was immunoreactive for calponin and actin.

The study includes retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with lesions of the endolymphatic sac within our practice between 1994 and 2005 as well as review of the literature. The primary outcome measure was survival, and the secondary outcome measure was disease-free survival following definitive resection. Postoperative complications were assessed.

40|$|Purpose: Pseudoprogression (PsP) is {{characterized}} by therapy-associated but not tumor growth–associated increases of contrast-enhancing glioblastoma lesions on MRI. Although typically occurring during the first 3 months after radiochemotherapy, PsP may occur later {{in the course of}} the disease and may then be particularly difficult to distinguish from <b>true</b> <b>tumor</b> progression. We explored PET using O-(2 -[18 F]fluoroethyl) -L-tyrosine (18 F-FET-PET) to approach the diagnostic dilemma. Experimental Design: Twenty-six patients with glioblastoma that presented with increasing contrast-enhancing lesions later than 3 months after completion of radiochemotherapy underwent 18 F-FET–PET. Maximum and mean tumor/brain ratios (TBRmax and TBRmean) of 18 F-FET uptake as well as time-to-peak (TTP) and patterns of the time-activity curves were determined. The final diagnosis of true progression versus late PsP was based on follow-up MRI using RANO criteria. Results: Late PsP occurred in 7 patients with a median time from radiochemotherapy completion of 24 weeks while the remaining patients showed <b>true</b> <b>tumor</b> progression. TBRmax and TBRmean were significantly higher in patients with true progression than in patients with late PsP (TBRmax 2. 4 ± 0. 1 vs. 1. 5 ± 0. 2, P = 0. 003; TBRmean 2. 1 ± 0. 1 vs. 1. 5 ± 0. 2, P = 0. 012) whereas TTP was significantly shorter (mean TTP 25 ± 2 vs. 40 ± 2 min, P < 0. 001). ROC analysis yielded an optimal cutoff value of 1. 9 for TBRmax to differentiate between true progression and late PsP (sensitivity 84 %, specificity 86 %, accuracy 85 %, P = 0. 015).
