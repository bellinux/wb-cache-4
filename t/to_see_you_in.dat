500|$|When Bowden gives Dussander an SS uniform to {{wear and}} in which to march under Bowden's orders, the student's demands are more {{heightened}} in the film as [...] "more dominant and voyeuristic", according to Picart and Frank. Bowden tells Dussander, [...] "I tried to do this the nice way, but you don't want it. So fine, we'll do this the hard way. You will put this on, because I want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> it. Now move!" [...] The editing style of the Nazi march scene juxtaposes Dussander marching in the uniform and Bowden reacting to the march. Shots of Bowden's reaction are from a low angle, which reflects [...] "the sexual difference between the characters"; Bowden is masculinized as [...] "the bearer of the [...] gaze", and Dussander is feminized as [...] "the object of the gaze". The cutting between Bowden and Dussander [...] "corroborates a homoerotic arrangement of images" [...] which visualizes the latent homoeroticism of the scene from the novella. When Dussander speeds up his march and Bowden tells him to stop, the sped-up shot reverse shot [...] "radically [...] the structure of power", where Bowden loses [...] "control of his sadistic power over Dussander".|$|E

[...] The Rebbe responded: [...] "I also {{want to be in}} Israel." [...] The journalist insisted, [...] "So when, when will you come?" [...] The Rebbe responded, [...] "That depends on the Moshiach, not on me." [...] The journalist persisted, [...] "You are the Moshiach!" [...] to which the Rebbe responded, [...] "I am not." ...|$|E

2500|$|Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks. This line drew the fieriest response from Clinton, who with voice raised and fists shaking, responded, [...] "With all due respect, {{the fact is we}} had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and {{do everything we can to}} prevent it from ever happening again, senator." [...] Other Republicans also attacked Clinton, with Representative Jeff Duncan accusing her of [...] "national security malpractice" [...] and Senator Rand Paul saying that the president should have dismissed her from her job for having failed to read security-related cables coming into the State Department (she had said there are over a million cables that come into the department and they are all formally addressed to her). Senator John McCain said that while [...] "It's wonderful <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> good health and as combative as ever", he was unsatisfied with her answers.|$|E
