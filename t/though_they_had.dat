5|$|All the {{structures}} in Old Yosemite Village, {{except for the}} chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not been flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the priority {{was thought to be}} the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
5|$|Neither USB 1.0 nor 1.1 {{specified}} {{a design}} for any connector {{smaller than the}} standard type A or type B. Though many designs for a miniaturised type B connector appeared on many peripheral devices, conformance to the USB 1.x standard was fudged by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors as <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a tethered connection (that is: no plug or socket at the peripheral end). There was no known miniature type A connector until USB 2.0 (rev 1.01) introduced one.|$|E

5|$|The role of stay-at-home dad may be {{difficult}} for men who feel as <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no option.

5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the {{election}} Barber was moved from the FCO to the Treasury to take over as Chancellor from Iain Macleod, who died suddenly on 20 July. <b>Though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> never enjoyed an easy relationship, Douglas-Home recognised his colleague's stature, and felt his loss politically as well as personally. Some commentators have maintained that Macleod's death and replacement by the less substantial figure of Barber fatally undermined the economic success of the Heath government.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} Greg for hours, Leslie and Dave {{decide to}} go to Ann's party. They stop at the parks department to get Leslie's costume, {{only to find the}} office has been toilet papered and vandalized. Leslie immediately suspects Greg, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been watching him all night. Dave reluctantly agrees to bring Greg in for questioning, but Greg insists he is innocent. Andy comes in and questions Greg, pretending to be an FBI agent named Burt Macklin, but Greg is so mean to him Andy soon starts crying. Greg's mother eventually arrives and takes him away after threatening to report the trio for holding her son without proof of his guilt.|$|E

5|$|At around 04:00 on 5 July, the German attack {{commenced}} with {{a preliminary}} bombardment. Manstein's main attack was delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, which was organized into densely concentrated spearheads. Opposing the 4th Panzer Army was the Soviet 6th Guards Army, which {{was composed of}} the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps and 23rd Guards Rifle Corps. The Soviets had constructed three heavily fortified defensive belts to slow and weaken the attacking armoured forces. <b>Though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been provided superb intelligence, the Voronezh Front headquarters had still {{not been able to}} pinpoint the exact location where the Germans would place their offensive weight.|$|E
5|$|From the Permian, {{numerous}} stem group {{representatives of}} mayflies are known, {{which are often}} lumped into a separate taxon Permoplectoptera (e.g. including Protereisma permianum in the Protereismatidae, and Misthodotidae). The larvae of Permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills, and the adults still had long hindwings. Maybe the fossil family Cretereismatidae from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil also belongs as the last offshoot to Permoplectoptera. The Crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern mayfly families or the extinct (but modern) family Hexagenitidae. However, from the same locality the strange larvae and adults of the extinct family Mickoleitiidae (order Coxoplectoptera) have been described, which represents the fossil sister group of modern mayflies, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> very peculiar adaptations such as raptorial forelegs.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{brothers}} started Ashby Computers and Graphics in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch with Lathbury and Tim's girlfriend, Carole Ward, whom he later married in 1985. They {{worked out of}} a four-room row house next-door to {{the brothers}}' family corner store and ran on a shoestring budget for its first six months, in which they pooled their {{money to pay the}} bills. The company did not credit individuals on their releases, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> individual roles in development: Chris and Lathbury programmed and Tim and Carole designed the graphics. Carole also served as the company's secretary. Ultimate Play the Game, as the company was publicly known, first licensed arcade cabinet conversion kits to companies before moving to the more profitable British home computer market.|$|E

5|$|In {{recent years}} the Ritz has taken {{measures}} to enforce their trademark against infringement. Lawyers have notified competitors using the name to surrender their websites and Facebook accounts marketing under the trademark, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been using these names for many years. The Desborough Ritz, which had been using the name since the 1930s, changed its name in 2012 after being advised by solicitors to do so. That same year, a Northamptonshire wedding location named The Ritz {{changed its name to}} the Banqueting & Conference Suites at the Kettering Ritz after another notification. The Brighouse Ritz, which has operated under the name since 1938, was notified in 2017 to change its name or face legal action.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk {{was burned}} down during the Revolutionary War. After the Revolution, Norfolk was rebuilt in the Federal style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> more refined decorations {{to look like}} New World homes. Federal homes had {{features}} such as narrow sidelights with an embracing fanlight around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal rowhouses remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had a simple construction.|$|E
5|$|The Kaiserliche Marine {{considered}} {{sending the}} two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans {{to abandon the}} plan. Bremse {{was one of the}} ships interned at Scapa Flow {{under the terms of the}} armistice in November 1918. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. She was salvaged in 1929 by teams working for Ernest Cox, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to contend with large quantities of oil and the risks of fires and explosions. Having been brought back to the surface after a decade underwater, she was then scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The {{second part}} expands on enumerative combinatorics, or the {{systematic}} numeration of objects. It {{was in this}} part {{that two of the}} most important of the twelvefold ways—the permutations and combinations that would form the basis of the subject—were fleshed out, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been introduced earlier for the purposes of probability theory. He gives the first non-inductive proof of the binomial expansion for integer exponent using combinatorial arguments. On a note more distantly related to combinatorics, the second section also discusses the general formula for sums of integer powers; the free coefficients of this formula are therefore called the Bernoulli numbers, which influenced Abraham de Moivre's work later, and which have proven to have numerous applications in number theory.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{indirect}} and intangible {{costs of the}} eruption. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, {{and then returned to}} near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption. Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Johnson, {{as leader}} of the Women's Suffrage Movement, and Eugenia Lockhart, the organization's secretary, went to London to plead the case for suffrage. They met with the London branch of the International Alliance of Women to discuss the {{situation}} in the Bahamas, claiming that <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> the support of the majority of Bahamian women, many women could not voice their approval because they were employed by merchants and the government who were opposed to the cause. They also sought an audience at the Colonial Office to air their grievances, accompanied by the chairman of the PLP, Henry Milton Taylor. They met with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Iain Macleod, and two women British Parliamentarians, Baroness Joan Vickers and Baroness Eirene White. The Bahamians were assured that their case was accepted and that change would soon follow. They returned, but no change was forthcoming.|$|E
