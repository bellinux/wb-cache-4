And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E

2500|$|A {{recording}} studio at Chorlton High School, {{one of the}} schools the brothers attended, commemorates Gibb. In honouring Gibb, his brother Barry Gibb noted: [...] "Mo was a real McCartney bass freak, {{as a lot of}} us were. He would pick up on all the things that McCartney would [...] Maurice was very good on different instruments, you know. Good lead guitarist, good bass player, good keyboard player. He was versatile. He loved playing bass more than anything else, I <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Dr. John Lane, {{director}} of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in 1997, although Van Vliet's work has associations with mainstream abstract expressionist painting, more importantly he was a self-taught artist and his painting [...] "has {{that same kind of}} edge the music has". [...] Curator David Breuer asserts that in contrast to the busied, bohemian urban lives of the New York abstract expressionists, the rural desert environment Van Vliet was influenced by is a distinctly naturalistic one, making him a distinguished figure in contemporary art, whose work will survive in canon. Van Vliet stated of his own work, [...] "I'm trying to turn myself inside out on the canvas. I'm trying to completely bare what I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment" [...] and that, [...] "I paint {{for the simple reason that}} I have to. I feel a sense of relief after I do." [...] When asked about his artistic influences he stated that there were none. [...] "I just paint like I paint and that's enough influence." [...] He did however state his admiration of Georg Baselitz, the De Stijl artist Piet Mondrian, and Vincent van Gogh; after seeing van Gogh's paintings in person, Van Vliet quoted himself as saying that, [...] "The sun disappoints me so." ...|$|E

60|$|That is the {{sensation}} persons generally experience {{when they first}} go up in a balloon. Not being used to rising in the air, they <b>think</b> <b>at</b> first <b>that</b> they are stationary, and that the earth {{and all the people}} and houses on it are falling below them.|$|R
5000|$|Less {{impressed}} was {{film critic}} John Mosher of The New Yorker, who {{found in the}} film [...] "a bigger allotment of very British small talk and that special brand of British whimsy which makes us here <b>think</b> <b>at</b> times <b>that</b> <b>at</b> {{least one of the}} clouds over England is this particular kind of humor." ...|$|R

60|$|Well, now, I did not <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, {{that that}} was either a very dignified or very logical {{argument}} but so it was, I had {{to get along with}} it as well as I could.|$|E
6000|$|Nor was I. My pulse beat quick, but it {{was purely}} from excitement, and I do not <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment, had the Misses Harmer {{suddenly}} stepped down the staircase, before me, I should have been afraid of them. Holding my candle well in front of me, I stooped under the low doorway, and began to ascend the narrow stone stairs, Polly following closely behind. The stairs, as papa had calculated, were only five or six in number, and we then stood at once in the chamber into which for so many months we had been so longing to penetrate. Now for the will! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There can be {{no doubt}} that you are right," [...] Harry agreed; [...] "but I cannot blame Scindia and Holkar for forming regiments of infantry, trained by foreign officers. They had seen how the regiments so raised, by the English, had won great {{victories}} in the Carnatic and Bengal; and they did not <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time that, ere long, they might become formidable to the Mahrattas. Scindia and Holkar raised their regiments, not to fight against the strangers, but against each other. It was their mutual hostility that so diminished the strength of the Mahrattas. When dogs fight dogs, the wild boar ravages the land." ...|$|E
60|$|Had a thunder-bolt {{fallen from}} heaven at Dunburne's feet {{he could not}} have been struck more entirely dumb than he was at those astounding words. He knew not for the moment where to look or what to <b>think.</b> <b>At</b> <b>that</b> instant the negro man came into the room, {{fetching}} the bottle of rum and the bread and cheese he had been sent for. As the sound of his entrance struck upon our young gentleman's senses he came to himself with the shock, and suddenly exploded into a burst of laughter so shrill and discordant that Captain Obadiah sat staring at him as though he believed his ragged beneficiary had gone clean out of his senses.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{brother and}} sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer at farthest," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Elton; [...] "and that will be our time for exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of our carriage, {{we should be able}} to explore the different beauties extremely well. They would hardly come in their chaise, I <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> season of the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He must amuse himself, still!" [...] said Valentin's medical adviser. [...] "He insists {{upon seeing}} you, and I am afraid you must come. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> this rate, <b>that</b> he will hardly outlast the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what brings}} you down here?" [...] she asked, with the same searching look. [...] "You don't come down into this hole without some good reason. I did <b>think</b> <b>at</b> first <b>that</b> you might come down {{in order to see}} me, but you soon showed me that it wasn't that. There was a time when you was fond of me." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{had already}} {{developed}} my growing instinct for observance {{to a very}} considerable extent under Siddons, and at Harbury I remember myself, and people remember me, as an almost stiffly correct youth. I was pretty good at most of the work, and exceptionally so at history, geology, and the biological side of natural science. I had to restrain my interest in these latter subjects lest I should {{appear to be a}} [...] "swat," [...] and a modern-side swat at that. I was early in the sixth, and rather a favorite with old Latimer. He incited me to exercise what he called a wholesome influence on the younger boys, and I succeeded in doing this fairly well without any gross interventions. I implied rather than professed soundly orthodox views about things in general, and I was extremely careful to tilt my straw hat forward over my nose so as just not to expose the crown of my head behind, and to turn up my trousers with exactly that width of margin which the judgment of my fellow-creatures had decided was correct. My socks were spirited without being vulgar, and the ties I wore were tied with a studious avoidance of either slovenliness or priggish neatness. I wrote two articles in the Harburonian, became something of a debater in the Literacy and Political, conducted many long conversations with my senior contemporaries upon religion, politics, sport and social life, and concealed my inmost thoughts from every human being. Indeed, so effective had been the training of Harbury and Mr. Siddons, that I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time I came very near concealing them from myself. I could suppress wonder, I could pass by beauty as if I did not see it, almost I think I did not see it for a time, and yet I remember it in those years too--a hundred beautiful things.|$|E
5000|$|That was John {{after a night}} out, with dawn coming up. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point, he was a bit...wondering {{where he}} was going, and to be truthful so was I. I was {{starting}} to worry about him.|$|E
50|$|Recalled Moloney:I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time Van {{was searching}} for his Irish roots.

Musically {{we were going to}} meet each other half way.|$|E

50|$|Many {{painters}} show Mary and John the Baptist kneeling beside Our lord at the Last Judgment...But {{we may not}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> day the Virgin Mary will kneel for {{us before}} the Judge, baring her breast to intercede for sinners. Nor may we think that John the Baptist will fall upon his knees to beg mercy for mankind {{in the way the}} painters show. Rather, the blessed Virgin and St. John shall sit beside the supreme Judge as assessors. The mercy which is extended now will have no place then. There will only be strict justice <b>at</b> <b>that</b> day.|$|R
