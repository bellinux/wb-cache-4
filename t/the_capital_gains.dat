In 1999, Ryan supported the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed some financial regulation of banks from the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. During {{the economic recovery}} from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic assets from banks and other financial institutions, and the auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai {{was a guest}} of honour, which was a signal for much closer {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E
25|$|She {{voted against}} the first {{proposed}} $700billion bailout of financial institutions, which failed to pass 205–228.

However, she also advocated {{a plan that would}} suspend mark-to-market accounting rules and supported suspending <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax.|$|E
25|$|Until 2010, {{for stock}} held {{for more than}} twelve months <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> was exempt. <b>The</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> of stock held for shorter periods of time was taxable on 10%. From 2010 onwards, for residents, all <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> of stock and other assets above €500 is taxable on 20%.

5000|$|Negatively-geared {{properties}} are running at an actual {{loss to the}} investor. Even though the loss {{may be used to}} reduce tax, the investor is still in a net worse position compared to not owning the property. The investor is expecting to make a profit either when the net rental income grows over time and exceeds the interest cost, or on <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> when <b>the</b> property is sold, or both. After sale, the treatment of <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> income is favoured by the tax system since the only half of <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> is assessed as taxable income if the investment is held for at least 12 months (before 2000-2001, only the real value of <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> was taxed, which had a similar effect). From that perspective, distortions are generated by the 50% discount on <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> income for income tax purposes, not negative gearing.|$|R
50|$|However, {{in certain}} {{situations}} the tax rate applied to <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> may be higher than the rate of tax saving because of initial deductions such as for investors who have a low marginal tax rate while they make deductions but a high marginal rate in <b>the</b> year <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> is realised.|$|R
25|$|During the Reagan administration, the newspaper's {{editorial}} page was particularly influential {{as the leading}} voice for supply-side economics.

25|$|Although {{a federal}} wealth tax is {{prohibited}} by the United States Constitution unless the receipts are {{distributed to the}} States by their populations, {{state and local government}} property tax amount to a wealth tax on real estate, and because capital gains are taxed on nominal instead of inflation-adjusted profits, <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax amounts to a wealth tax on the inflation rate.|$|E
25|$|Coleman had a {{consistent}} record of voting for broad tax reform. Coleman supported reductions to <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax, the marriage penalty, {{and supported the}} doubling of the child tax credit. Coleman also supported elimination of the AMT and death tax. Coleman supported efforts to make permanent the tax code enacted by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> that is taxed is {{the excess}} of the sale price over the cost basis of the asset. The {{taxpayer}} reduces the sale price and increases the cost basis (reducing <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> on which tax is due) to reflect transaction costs such as brokerage fees, certain legal fees, and the transaction tax on sales.|$|R

25|$|In October 2008, McCain {{proposed}} {{that the federal government}} buy troubled mortgages, and provide low-interest mortgages to qualified homeowners. For people with 401(k) plans, he wanted to allow more flexibility about when money can be withdrawn, and would lower the tax on that money, as well as lowering the tax on unemployment insurance benefits. McCain also proposed to cut <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax on stock held for more than one year, while increasing the tax write-off for stock losses.|$|E
25|$|Wyden is {{critical}} of the estate tax, which he feels is inefficient, and has voted repeatedly to abolish it. He co-authored the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, which bans internet taxes in the United States. He has also voted with Republicans to lower <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax, to encourage {{the study of the}} flat tax, and to require a 3/5 majority to raise taxes. However, Wyden voted against the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. He has also voted against the balanced budget amendment.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} and fall of 2005, he visited {{homeless}} shelters and job training centers and spoke at events organized by ACORN, the NAACP and the SEIU. He spoke in favor of an expansion of the earned income tax credit; in favor of a crackdown on predatory lending; an increase in <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax rate; housing vouchers for racial minorities (to integrate upper-income neighborhoods); and a program modeled on the Works Progress Administration to rehabilitate the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina. In Greene County, North Carolina, he unveiled the pilot program for College for Everyone, an educational measure he promised during his presidential campaign, in which prospective college students would receive a scholarship for their first year in exchange for ten hours of work a week. The College for Everyone program was canceled in July 2008.|$|E

50|$|In 1986 and 1987 Portuguese {{corporations}} {{changed their}} capital structure {{by increasing the}} weight of equity capital. This was particularly notorious on quoted companies. In these two years, the government set up {{a large number of}} tax incentives to promote equity capital and to encourage the quotation on the Lisbon Stock Exchange. Until 2010, for stock held for more than twelve months <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> was exempt. <b>The</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> of stock held for shorter periods of time was taxable on 10%.|$|R
5000|$|Capital {{losses are}} applied in <b>the</b> usual manner: <b>capital</b> losses (of <b>the</b> same or {{previous}} years) reduce <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain.</b> If {{there is a}} net <b>capital</b> <b>gain,</b> it is included in taxable income and if negative <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> loss is carried {{forward to the next}} year.|$|R
25|$|Perceiving a {{means of}} revenge, Republican congressmen {{defeated}} Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and {{gave way to a}} sharp decrease in popularity. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill. Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be {{a turning point in the}} Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{structured}} for tax efficiency {{and can be}} more attractive than mutual funds. In the U.S., whenever a mutual fund realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, the mutual fund must distribute <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> to its shareholders. This can happen whenever the mutual fund sells portfolio securities, whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund. In contrast, ETFs are not redeemed by holders (instead, holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market, as they would a stock, or effect a non-taxable redemption of a creation unit for portfolio securities), so that investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares or when the ETF trades to reflect changes in the underlying index.|$|E
25|$|Having a keen {{investment}} eye for value, Slim {{adhered to}} his value investment practices {{with a long}} history of buying stakes in companies he sees as undervalued. Much of Slim's business dealings involved a simple strategy, which is to buy a business and hang on to it for its cash flow or eventually sell the stake at a greater profit in future, thereby netting <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> as well as reinvesting the initial principal into a new business. In addition, his conglomerate structure allows Slim to purchase numerous stakes that it is made nearly recession proof if one or more sectors of the economy do not do well. Slim also doesn't address the finer details of the business but instead focuses on business fundamentals where his strategy is buy an asset at an undervalued price for its underlying cash flow and eventually sell his stake for greater profit when the asset gains value, or simply hang to the business for its cash flow.|$|E

25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House. Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>the</b> corporate <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation in Nordic countries, European Union and Finland. The main perspective {{is in the}} corporate income tax law, {{but because of the}} multidisciplinary subject of <b>the</b> corporate <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation, this study also has an economic perspective. Before analyzing the taxation itself, the basic concepts for the study are introduced such as <b>the</b> concept of <b>capital,</b> income and <b>capital</b> <b>gain.</b> Also <b>the</b> tax framework of this study is introduced by describing the most significant features and issues in corporate income taxation and in corporate <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation. Corporate <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation is discussed by starting with Nordic countries, continuing with European Union member states and finally ending up with Finland. A rough comparative summary is created {{at the end of each}} of these sections. Recent changes having taken place until January 2015 in <b>the</b> corporate <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation are also included in the study. Taxation is investigated based on the existing tax law literature, and the analysis is fulfilled with the help of the selected case law. After the international tax system analysis, the future options for corporate <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation are discussed as well as challenges related to the changes in the corporate income taxation such as correct level of harmonization so that individual countries still have their own fiscal policy. This study offers the value-added to the society in a couple of different ways. The study extensively analyzes <b>the</b> international corporate <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation models.
