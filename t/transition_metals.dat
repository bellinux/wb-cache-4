5|$|The {{definition}} of a transition metal, as given by IUPAC, is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell. By this definition all of the elements in groups 3–11 are <b>transition</b> <b>metals.</b> The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> category.|$|E

5|$|Still other chemists further {{exclude the}} group 3 {{elements}} from {{the definition of}} a transition metal. They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry. In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as <b>transition</b> <b>metals.</b> However, though the group 3 elements show few of the characteristic chemical properties of the <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> they do show some of their characteristic physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).|$|E
50|$|The {{salicide}} {{process begins}} with deposition of a thin <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> layer over fully formed and patterned semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors). The wafer is heated, allowing the <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> to react with exposed silicon {{in the active}} regions of the semiconductor device (e.g., source, drain, gate) forming a low-resistance <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> silicide. The <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> does not react with the silicon dioxide nor the silicon nitride insulators present on the wafer. Following the reaction, any remaining <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> is removed by chemical etching, leaving silicide contacts in only the active regions of the device.

5|$|The trends {{going down}} from {{scandium}} and yttrium to lanthanum {{tend to be}} more similar to those going down groups 1 and 2 in the periodic table, while those going down from scandium and yttrium to lutetium {{tend to be more}} similar to those in the early <b>transition</b> <b>metals.</b> Since Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, {{it has been argued that}} lanthanum and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, lanthanum is a strongly electropositive metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity. The rare earth metals in general are more similar in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals that immediately precede them than to the <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> proper which follow them.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically {{similar to the}} two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury.

Cadmium and its congeners in group 12 are often not considered <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm).

5|$|Despite {{the above}} formulations, most silver {{compounds}} have significant covalent character {{due to the}} small size and high first ionization energy (730.8kJ/mol) of silver. Furthermore, silver's Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is {{higher than that of}} lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6kJ/mol is much higher than that of hydrogen (72.8kJ/mol) and not much less than that of oxygen (141.0kJ/mol). Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals.

40|$|Whereas low-valent late <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> {{catalysis}} {{has become}} indispensible for chemical synthesis, homogeneous high-valent <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> catalysis is underdeveloped, mainly {{due to the}} reactivity of high-valent <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> complexes and the challenges associated with synthesizing them. In this manuscript, we report a mild carbon-carbon bond cleavage reaction by a Au(I) complex that generates a stable Au(III) cationic complex. Complementary to the well-established soft and carbophilic Au(I) catalyst, this Au(III) complex exhibits hard, oxophilic Lewis acidity. This is exemplified by catalytic activation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes towards selective conjugate additions as well as activation of an unsaturated aldehyde-allene for a [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. The origin of the regioselectivity and catalytic activity was elucidated by X-ray crystallographic analysis of an isolated Au(III) -activated cinnamaldehyde intermediate.

5|$|Iron {{shows the}} {{characteristic}} chemical {{properties of the}} <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry: indeed, it was the discovery of an iron compound, ferrocene, that revolutionalized the latter field in the 1950s. Iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> due to its abundance and the immense role it has played in the technological progress of humanity. Its 26 electrons are arranged in the configuration 3d64s2, of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy, and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons {{and there is no}} clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable.|$|E

5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert.

5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} the chemistry of the late first-row <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical.

In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row <b>transition</b> <b>metals.</b> Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors.
