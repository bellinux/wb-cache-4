It can cause large blocks of the river to be removed from the bed starting the quarrying process. The initial cracks appear due to a flux in the bedrock itself which is caused by a [...] "rapid and large pressure variation". These can be caused by mass movements, or heavy storms. After the initial crack is made a small amount of sediment, sometimes no more than a grain, is passively deposited in the crack. When the bedrock flexes back into its original position the crack is left open due to <b>the</b> <b>wedging.</b> Gradually as more sediment accumulates in the crack it will widen and deepen. This is more common in an already jointed river bed.|$|E

More generally, a piece is stable when, along all four axes (horizontal, vertical, and each diagonal), it is in terminal position or if from it along the axis one reaches a terminal disk passing only through disks the same color. These are not the only kinds of stable disk, however, and occupying a corner may often be a grave error if one allows one's opponent to create a wedge that results in him or her gathering more stable disks. This can render occupying the corner largely useless, and often much worse than that because of loss of tempo (Where it is an issue of running out of desirable moves and being forced to make undesirable ones, the grabbing of a corner may give the opponent not only <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> response but also a following move which one can not respond to practically).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Hueter-Volkmann's law {{regarding}} growth modulation {{suggests that}} increased {{pressure on the}} end plate of bone retards the growth (Hueter) and conversely, reduced pressure accelerates the growth (Volkmann). Literature described the same principle in Rat-tail model. Human spine and its deformity i. e. scoliosis has also same kind of pattern during the growth period which causes wedging in disc or vertebral body. Methods This cross sectional study in 150 patients of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis was done to evaluate vertebral body and disc wedging in scoliosis and to compare the extent of differential wedging of body and disc, in thoracic and lumbar area. We measured wedging of vertebral bodies and discs, along with two adjacent vertebrae and disc, {{above and below the}} apex and evaluated them according to severity of curve (curve 30 °) to find the relationship of vertebral body or disc wedging with scoliosis in thoracic and lumbar spine. We also compared <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> and rotations of vertebrae. Results In both thoracic and lumbar curves, we found that greater the degree of scoliosis, greater <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> in both disc and body and the degree of wedging was more at apex supporting the theory of growth retardation in stress concentration area. However, the degree of wedging in vertebral body is more than the disc in thoracic spine while <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> was more in disc than body in lumbar spine. On comparing <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> with the rotation, we did not find any significant relationship suggesting that it has no relation with rotation. Conclusion From our study, we can conclude that wedging in disc and body are increasing with progression on scoliosis and maximum at apex; however there is differential wedging of body and disc, in thoracic and lumbar area, that is vertebral body wedging is more profound in thoracic area while disc wedging is more profound in lumbar area which possibly form 'vicious cycle' by asymmetric loading to spine for the progression of curve. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{packing of}} solid {{particles}} {{is an important}} research topic in particle mechanics and powder technology. However, {{it is difficult to}} predict and measure the packing density of particles. Although theoretical models for prediction and test methods for measurement have been developed, the predicted values and measured results do not always agree with each other. Through in-depth review of the theoretical predictions by the existing 2 -parameter model and the respective measured results, it is postulated in this thesis that the discrepancies between the predicted values and measured results are mainly due to <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> effect – a new interaction effect that has not been considered in previous packing models. <b>The</b> <b>wedging</b> effect occurs when some isolated fine particles are entrapped at the gaps between the coarse particles or when the gaps between the coarse particles are not wide enough for the formation of complete layers of fine particles. Such wedging effect would reduce the packing density and therefore should be considered in particle packing modeling. To provide additional measured results covering a wider range of size ratio than those published by others, a comprehensive experimental study of measuring the packing densities of binary mixes of mono-sized and rounded particles has been conducted. <b>The</b> <b>wedging</b> effect was further explained and more importantly quantified in the light of these experimental results. And, by incorporating <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> effect, a 3 -parameter packing model has been developed. The 3 -parameter model was calibrated by fitting the theoretical predictions with the measured results of the comprehensive study conducted herein. After calibration, the theoretical predictions agree very well with the measured results, with the prediction error generally within 1. 43 %. Further, some of the particle packing models were evaluated by comparing with published test results. The particle packing models so evaluated include the 2 -parameter model (with the loosening and wall effects incorporated), the compressible model (with the loosening, wall and compaction effects incorporated) and the 3 -parameter model (with the loosening, wall and wedging effects incorporated). It was found that the accuracy of the models varies with both the size ratio and volumetric fractions of the binary mix. In general, when the size ratio is larger than 0. 65, all the packing models are sufficiently accurate. However, when the size ratio is smaller than 0. 65, the 2 -parameter model and the compressible model would either over- or under-estimate the packing density with the prediction errors generally larger at around the volumetric fractions giving maximum packing density. On the other hand, within the whole range of size ratio from 0. 02 to 0. 74 covered by the test results used for evaluation of the packing models, the packing density prediction by the 3 -parameter model are accurate to within an absolute error of 0. 020. Overall, the better performance of the 3 -parameter model may be attributed to the incorporation of <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> effect. With <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> effect incorporated, the 3 -parameter model is the most accurate and generally applicable to the whole range of size ratio from 0 to 1. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

Since the matrix of cement paste is more expensive and less strong and durable than the natural aggregate, maximizing the packing density of aggregate is generally considered a good strategy both to reduce costs and to get an optimized concrete mix in terms of performance. For the sake of concrete mix optimization, {{it is important to have}} a particle packing model that can accurately predict the packing density of multi-component particulate systems. For this purpose, the 3 -parameter packing density model (3 PPM) has been developed. It is a new particle packing model for packing density estimation of multi-component particulate systems, which is modified from the linear packing density model by incorporating <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> effect. <b>The</b> <b>wedging</b> effect is a particle interaction effect other than the loosening and wall effects, which occurs, for example, when the fine particles are locked at the narrow gaps between the coarse particles. An experimental program of measuring the packing density of binary and ternary mixes of mono-sized spherical glass beads was launched. The model was calibrated from the experimental packing densities of binary mixes. Then, the theoretical packing densities predicted by 3 PPM for ternary mixes were compared with the experimental packing densities. With <b>the</b> <b>wedging</b> effect incorporated, the authors believe that 3 PPM gives an excellent alternative tool for concrete mix optimization...|$|E

The differences between NS/UD and EW/UD at points C 3 and A 6 are significant, and the numerical MHVRs are able to simulate the large difference between the two components. The component with the larger amplitude is parallel to the direction of <b>the</b> <b>wedge,</b> and <b>the</b> component with the smaller amplitude is perpendicular to the direction of <b>the</b> <b>wedge.</b> This shows that <b>the</b> <b>wedge</b> has a large effect on the directional dependence of the MHVRs.
