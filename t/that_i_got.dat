I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a little something of both sides.” In high school, Crews was co-captain of the tennis team, and for decades he remained an avid skier, hiker, swimmer, and runner.

He said of this performance, [...] "Many of the important roles <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> later on were because the guy who was going to hire me was in that audience and had his mind blown."

[...] "I {{would like to thank}} my coach, who had faith in me. It was he who decided to bring me on and what happened next was surreal.

Watros said about the reunion with Hurley and Libby in season six: [...] " [...] so sweet and honest. And I think, hopefully, when people see our scenes that they’ll get that feeling, too.

500|$|According to Kano, {{the editor}} in chief of Rockin'On Japan, he stated that the lyrical content {{discusses}} themes of mystery and daily life actions; he furthered believed that the song's lyrics is an open interpretation, due to its lack of major characteristics and identified philosophy and religion as examples. In an interview that promoted her fifth Japanese studio album Ultra Blue (2005) and her single [...] "Passion", which is the follow to [...] "Hikari", Utada felt the writing process was difficult. She believed that the plot to Kingdom Hearts was soulless, and was unable to become inspired by it to write the song. She further explained; [...] "when I was making the song 'Hikari', the whole outlook for the game and its entry onto the world was so crucial <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a lot more info on the characters (so that 'Hikari' would mirror the image that they wanted)." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Crane {{once wrote}} in a letter, [...] "You can tell nothing... unless you are in that {{condition}} yourself," [...] he wrote The Red Badge of Courage without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco-Turkish and Spanish–American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in The Red Badge of Courage has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six {{years after the end}} of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: [...] "Of course, I have never been in a battle, but I believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days".|$|E
