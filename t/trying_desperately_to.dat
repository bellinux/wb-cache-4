Louis XVIII ordered {{his wife to}} attend the {{marriage}} ceremony in Courland without her long-time friend (and rumoured lover) Marguerite de Gourbillon. Queen Marie Joséphine lived apart from her husband in Schleswig Holstein. Louis XVIII was <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> display to the world a united family front. The queen refused to leave her friend behind with unpleasant consequences that rivalled the wedding in notoriety. Louis XVIII knew that his nephew Louis Antoine was not compatible with Marie-Thérèse. Despite this, he still pressed for the marriage, which proved to be quite unhappy and produced no children.|$|E
25|$|Agrell {{continued}} nominating Merezhkovsky {{up until}} {{his own death}} in 1937 (making eight such nominations, in all), but each year the latter's chances were getting slimmer. The books he produced in his latter years (like the compilation of religious biographies Faces of Saints: from Jesus to Nowadays and The Reformers trilogy, published posthumously) weren't ground-breaking. Hard times and deepening troubles notwithstanding, Merezhkovsky continued to work hard till his dying day, <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> complete his Spanish Mysteries trilogy; {{the last of the}} three pieces, the unfinished Little Theresa, was with him at his deathbed; he died literally with a pen in his hand.|$|E
500|$|Other critics, such as GameZone's Michael Lafferty, {{were less}} {{reserved}} in their {{praise of the}} narrative—The Electric Playground {{referred to it as}} [...] "a textbook example to other console developers on how to write videogame prose"—but agreed that its complex and involved backstory could alienate some players. The Adrenaline Vault's Mike Laidlaw stated that [...] "the folks at Crystal Dynamics obviously have no kindness in their heart for game reviewers <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> describe the plot". Journalists also commonly cited Soul Reaver 2s poor lifespan and replayability as an issue; the reviewer for Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine opined that [...] "the problem is that there just isn't much gameplay there" [...] and Fielder warned that play [...] "burns bright, but not as long as you'd like".|$|E

500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN gave [...] "Walkabout" [...] a 9.5/10, stating that [...] "Terry O'Quinn puts in an {{exceptional}} performance", and commenting that showing Locke, who [...] "seemed like a confident and resourceful {{man with a}} mysterious and intriguing past", to be a [...] "shell {{of a human being}} that is <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> find his place in the world" [...] was [...] "a perfect juxtaposition of the differences between Locke off and on the island". He also praised the supporting stories, claiming that [...] "Matthew Fox does a great job of playing the uneasy leader" [...] as Jack Shephard and that the Shannon-Charlie storyline [...] "does supply a little comic relief". Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it described the revelation that Locke was a paraplegic as being [...] "one of the show's signature moments", and commented that the episode [...] "cemented the show as 'Must-See TV'" [...] and was [...] "a five-star effort." ...|$|E
500|$|In , hope is {{suppressed}} by the dictatorship. As the Judge Advocate {{states in the}} novel, [...] "the President's first rule of conduct is never to give grounds for hope, and everyone must be kicked and beaten until they realise the fact". It {{can be argued that}} Camila represents hope in the novel because both her father and husband were able to persevere under the dictatorship by thinking of her; however, the President destroys this sense of hope with false stories. When the thought of her loyalty is eliminated, both her father and husband die because they have lost the hope of returning to her. Furthermore, Camila's happiness with her child and their escape to the countryside {{can be seen as the}} one glimpse of hope in an otherwise dark and disturbing ending. For critic Jean Franco, it is love that offers what little hope there is in the novel: [...] "The system is undermined only by lovethe love of an idiot for his mother, a woman <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> save her husband from death." ...|$|E
500|$|Moondram Pirai {{attained}} cult {{status in}} Tamil cinema and was praised for bringing out human emotions, unconditional love and sacrifice. The film {{had a significant}} impact among the audience for its style of filmmaking, performances of the lead cast and for Ilaiyaraaja's music. The climax scene where Haasan's character, Cheenu, runs after Sridevi's character, Bhagyalakshmi, who has recovered her memory but forgets the incidents that occur between her accident and recovery completely, and Cheenu <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> make Bhagyalakshmi remember the time he spend with him, to no effect, became popular and was parodied many times. The dialogue told by Smitha's character to Cheenu, [...] "You haave a verrry strrong physique, you know", also attained popularity. A. P. Thiruvadi, in his obituary of Balu Mahendra, called him [...] "The Moondram Pirai of Indian cinema". Moondram Pirai is also the name of a drama written by Tamil poet Puviarasu. When S. Shiva Kumar of The Hindu suggested to Balu Mahendra that the film's ending lacked logic, Mahendra said, [...] "Believe me there’s no logic in life." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Firefly" [...] was co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, {{while being}} {{directed}} by Supernatural veteran Charles Beeson. On October 20, 2010, TV Guide announced that Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd had been cast {{in an upcoming}} episode as [...] "Walter's musical hero". Noble explained Lloyd's role: [...] "We all know how much Walter loves music, right? Well this fellow {{was one of his}} icons. He adored this man. So Walter gets to {{be a bit of a}} fanboy". Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October. Soon before the episode aired, Lloyd told reporters [...] "I was very excited for this role. My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him, and he's adjusting to that." [...] Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in as a part of the ensemble cast. In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that [...] "probably the best fun that I've had [...] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy old guys just <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was a common thread of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [...] thrill to Walter. This happens all the way through this very complicated episode".|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Tyrion {{is just about}} the only {{character}} developing any complexity. Maybe even a glimmer of a conscience." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him the kind of man characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{subsequently}} {{wrote that}} [...] "Miller's war reporting was disastrously wrong, and now she's <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> spin it all away,".

2500|$|Mary {{speaks of}} her {{frustration}} with their summer home, its impermanence and shabbiness, and her husband's indifference to his surroundings. With irony, she alludes to her belief that this air of detachment {{might be the}} very reason he has tolerated her addiction for so long. This frightens Edmund, who is <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> hang on to his belief in normality while faced with two emotionally horrific problems at once. Finally, unable to tolerate the way Jamie is looking at her, she asks him angrily why he is doing it.

2500|$|According to Yorke, [...] "Creep" [...] {{tells the}} tale of an inebriated man who tries to get the {{attention}} of a woman to whom he is attracted by following her around. In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about [...] "Creep" [...] in 1993, Yorke said: [...] "I have a real problem being a man in the '90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it's not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I'm always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> negate it."

2500|$|Kulaylat's {{operation}} thus {{failed to}} deliver the expected results, and on December 10 it was the Muslims who were <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> hold on at the Alcazar Hotel, even though parts of the building had gone up in flames. Pressured by the joint Army-Christian militias' counter-offensive, Kulaylat called the PLO for help and received it. [...] The Phoenicia and St Georges Hotels changed hands {{several times during the}} night. Nevertheless, the Muslim militiamen were able to storm and secure the disputed Phoenicia Inter-Continental Hotel, and the next day they mounted another assault against Christian militia' and ISF Gendarmerie positions. While the Christian militiamen repulsed the attacks on their own positions, the Gendarmes' avoided confrontation and withdrew to the unfinished Beirut Hilton Hotel. The Al-Mourabitoun were forced out from the St Georges and Alcazar Hotels after a heavy artillery bombardment by the Lebanese Army, supported by the Phalangists. Fighting came to a temporary near-halt on December 12 when the exhausted combatants of both sides realised that they had more or less retained their original positions.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{marked the}} band's {{expansion}} into industrial rock, electronic rock and nu metal, while retaining {{the hard rock}} style of previous albums. Critics noted stylistic similarities on the album to Queen, Wings and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Rose cited influence of Dave Grohl's drumming on Nirvana's [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] in recording the title track of the album. The song {{was inspired by the}} movie Kundun about the Dalai Lama. The lyrics [...] "Blame it on the Falun Gong, They've seen the end and you can't hold on now" [...] from the song caused the album to be banned in China. The industrial-flavored [...] "Shackler's Revenge" [...] was written in reaction to [...] "the insanity of senseless school shootings and also the media <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> make more out of one shooter's preference for the Guns song Brownstone to no avail", according to Rose. Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho had written a play based on lyrics of the Guns N' Roses song [...] "Mr. Brownstone". [...] "Better" [...] is an electronic rock influenced song that features Rose singing in falsetto {{in the beginning of the}} track. [...] "Street of Dreams", previously known as [...] "The Blues" [...] is a piano ballad that has been described as a pop oriented song similar to November Rain and The Garden with influences from Elton John. [...] "If The World" [...] has guitarist Buckethead using a Flamenco guitar on the track and is described as having 'an electronic funk slither' and neo soul characteristics, as well as nu-metal and trip hop styles. [...] "There Was a Time" [...] is a heavily layered melody driven orchestral song with a mellotron, violins, choirs and multiple synthesizers.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley is Eddie's next-door neighbor, who {{is obsessed}} with Raven.

Stanley was originally brought in as a love interest for Raven's next-door neighbor, Sierra, but he becomes {{much more interested in}} Raven, and in one episode, Loka. Stanley is rude, obnoxious, mean, sarcastic, and deceptive to everyone. He is a young salesman, who usually tricks Cory into buying something that would eventually go wrong. Stanley is always <b>trying</b> <b>desperately</b> <b>to</b> get Raven to like him, but he suddenly leaves her alone after seeing her kiss Andre in the episode [...] "Mr. Perfect". He loves to eat cheese sandwiches. He also competes against Chelsea in a ping-pong match, and loses. In the same episode ("Taken to the Cleaners"), he asks Victor to make him a cheese sandwich {{in the shape of a}} ping-pong paddle. His catchphrases include [...] "My brotha!", which he exclaims whenever he is trying to [...] "show someone up"; and [...] "I may have said that, but I say a lot of things." [...] This is a partial denial of his ability to be nice to other people. He appears primarily in Seasons 3 and 4, in the episodes [...] "Opportunity Shocks"; [...] "Taken to the Cleaners"; [...] "The Grill Next Door"; [...] "Mr. Perfect"; [...] "The Four Aces"; [...] "Driving Miss Lazy"; [...] "Sister Act"; [...] "Checkin' Out"; [...] "Fur Better or Worse" [...] and [...] "When 6021 Met 4267".

He got into the [...] "Up with Goodness" [...] program, feigned an ankle injury, and stole Cory's presentation. It is also noted that he has a fear of bones, which helps Cory prove that Stanley faked the injury and stole his presentation.|$|E
