Along {{with the increased}} growing coal mining depth, mines in most mining areas are facing deep mining problems.

40|$|International audienceCorrosion product {{deposits}} {{in the secondary}} side of nuclear power plant Steam Generators may result in <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plate flow blockage, and tube fouling. Tube fouling is a deposit on the tube surfaces which is penalizing for the heat exchanges between the primary and the secondary circuits. <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plate flow blockage is a deposit at the inlet of <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plate flow holes which can induce high velocity zones and transverse velocities in the secondary flow, then flow induced vibrations and tube cracks in some cases. Indeed three significant primary to secondary leaks occurred at one nuclear plant in France between 2004 and 2006. The thermal-hydraulic and vibration studies confirmed a cracking mechanism caused by flow induced vibrations resulting in a circumferential crack. Those studies pointed out {{the role of an}} important flow blockage distribution at the upper <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plate as an aggravating factor. In order to simulate those two phenomena in the whole Steam Generator, a solid deposit growth model on the sec- ondary side of Steam Generators has been developed by the EDF R&D Division. This model is implemented in the frame of THYC, which is the EDF’s reference code for the modelling of two-phase thermal-hydraulic phenomena at the subchannel scale. A subchannel scale is a mesoscale which has the advantage to calculate thermal-hydraulic flows and deposition in whole nuclear components with reasonable CPU times. The deposit model aims to predict the localization and the growth rate of {{deposits in}} order to simulate tube fouling as well as <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plate flow blockage at this scale. This work specifically describes the efforts performed by the EDF R&D Division to develop and implement models for <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plate flow blockage. A new deposit process, based on <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plate flow blockage studies, has been developed and implemented in the model, and is presented in this work. It can be defined by two main steps : particle deposition, and strengthening process called “flashing” due to soluble species precipitation in the pores of the particle deposit. This process is calibrated on blockage rates observed in Steam Generators by using an inverse method also developed in this work. The relevance of this process is tested by comparing the simulation results to the actual levels of flow blockage observed in some nuclear plants. Two dominant trends are showed in this work : the flow blockage is more important on the hot leg than on the cold leg and at the top than at the bottom of Steam Generators. Moreover the flow blockage distribution at the upper <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plate has the special feature to be more important at the periphery than at the center. These results are in agreement with observed data in some nuclear plants. A sensitivity analysis of soluble species solubility, and more specifically magnetite solubility, has been performed. The “flashing” phenomenon allows one to underline the magnetite solubility dependence of flow blockage phenomenon. A reduction of magnetite solubility in Steam Generators seems to be an interesting remedy for reducing the <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plate flow blockage phenomenon, and more specifically for <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plates at the top of Steam Generators. Ac- cording to the deposit process developed in this work, this reduction would be more effective in cold leg than in hot leg. In practice, such a magnetite solubility reduction could be obtained by increasing the pH of the secondary circuit. This pH elevation is one of the remedy considered at short term on EDF fleet for its potential benefit on both tube fouling and <b>Tube</b> <b>Support</b> Plate flow blockage. Indeed the operational pH of secondary circuits were planned to raise at certain nuclear plants. This remedy is in agreement with the results obtained in this work...|$|E

The testing also showed that strong bases concentrated more effectively than strong acids, and that the crevice pH, when exposed to seawater-based solutions, increased with increasing superheat and decreasing bulk concentration. The large variations in the crevice chemistry observed under heat transfer were eliminated upon shutdown. These new test data suggest {{that it might be}} beneficial to evaluate the variation in the extent of stress corrosion cracking with <b>tube</b> <b>support</b> plate elevation found in some steam generators in light of local chemistry changes, as well as the variation in tubing temperature.

As deposition phenomena {{are very sensitive to}} parameters such as pressure and velocity, notable enhancement of the deposit models may be obtained from a better knowledge of local thermal-hydraulic profiles. <b>Tube</b> <b>support</b> plate flow blockage can be induced by the sudden contraction due to the broach holes. Recirculation zones and sudden pressure drops are expected. These physical phenomena can encourage specific particle deposition mechanisms or the precipitation of soluble species. The “flashing” deposition mecha- nism for instance shows high sensitivity to pressure drops. CFD calculations may capture and quantify the local and sudden change of thermal-hydraulic parameters at the inlet of broach holes. In this paper, CFD calculations are performed by EDF’s open-source Code Saturne CFD code. The initial concern {{of this study is to}} better understand local thermal-hydraulics.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Hemodynamic {{alterations}} {{have been}} implicated as major stimuli {{for the development}} of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts that are implanted in the arterial circulation. Tyrosine kinase is known to mediate cell signaling. However, its role with in vivo mechanotransduction is not yet well defined. We used a novel bioprosthetic collagen tube to provide an external support to vein grafts and examined the subsequent changes in hemodynamics, tyrosine kinase signaling, wall remodeling, and vasomotor function. Methods: Carotid interposition bypass grafting was performed with the reversed jugular vein in New Zealand white rabbits. In the experimental group (n = 15), after the completion of the proximal anastomosis, the vein was passed through a 4 -mm collagen tube and the distal anastomosis was performed. The <b>tube</b> <b>support</b> was fashioned to completely cover the vein grafts. The control animals (n = 14) had no <b>tube</b> <b>support.</b> After surgery, the blood pressure and flow rate were measured and the wall tension and shear stress were calculated in the vein grafts on day 3 or day 28 (n = 5 per group). Tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed with the Western blot test in vein grafts at day 3 (n = 4 per group). The intimal and medial dimensions of the vein grafts were assessed with videomorphometry on day 28 (n = 5 per group). The cumulative dose response curves of the vein grafts to contractile and relaxant agonists were determined in isometric tension studies on day 28 (n = 5 per group). Results: The use of <b>tube</b> <b>support</b> reduced wall tension 1. 7 -fold (P <. 01) and increased shear stress 4. 8 -fold (P <. 001) without altering the flow rate or blood pressure. The tyrosine kinase activity was reduced 15 -fold (P <. 001) in the tube-supported vein grafts. The intimal thickness was reduced by 45 % in the tube-supported vein grafts as compared with the control grafts (46 ± 2 mm vs 84 ± 5 mm, respectively; P <. 0001), and the media thickness was reduced by 20 % (63 ± 8 mm vs 79 ± 4 mm, respectively; P <. 05). Isometric tension studies showed preservation of contractile function and modulation of endothelial-dependent dysfunctional relaxation in tube-supported vein grafts. Conclusion: These results show that reduced wall tension and increased shear stress with an external <b>tube</b> <b>support</b> can effectively modulate the signaling, functional, and hyperplastic responses in vein grafts. We conclude that this simple strategy deserves further study and clinical consideration. (J Vasc Surg 1999; 29 : 334 - 44. ...|$|E
