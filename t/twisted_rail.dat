2500|$|A few notable bridges, sans rails, {{still stand}} on the route to Ross, {{including}} an impressive truss bridge over the Totara River just north of Ross itself and a smaller truss bridge over the Mahinapua Creek 5km south of Hokitika that is now protected by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. [...] The route between Ruatapu and Ross is largely out of sight from the road, but can be driven for much of its length and is used as an accessway by some locals. From Hokitika to Ruatapu, the railway's formation is readily apparent as it is often near the road, and the road has even been diverted to use portions of it. [...] Little else remains of the railway due {{to the passage of}} time and influence of human and natural activity, but at the site of Ross's yard, some <b>twisted</b> <b>rail</b> and a loading bank remain. In March 2010 work was started on clearing the Ruatapa - Ross section for use by cyclists. However, the long-term future of this is somewhat in doubt due to gold prospecting in the area. A number of bridges still exist in this section and are being refurbished as part of the cycle track. The West Coast Wilderness Trail from Hokitika to Ross, which incorporates the former railway route from Ruatapu south, opened on 24 October 2015.|$|E
60|$|We {{peered out}} of the {{loophole}} together and through the little orchard we had planted. The moon flooded the fields, and beyond it the forest was a dark blur. I can recall the scene now, the rude mill standing by the water-side, the <b>twisted</b> <b>rail</b> fences, and the black silhouettes of the horses and cattle as they stood bunched together. Behind us little Tom stirred in his sleep and startled us. That very evening Polly Ann had frightened him into obedience by telling him that the Shawanees would get him.|$|E
50|$|The 1906 San Francisco {{earthquake}} flattened the new steam {{crushing plant}} and temporarily halted operations. Train rails were <b>twisted,</b> <b>rail</b> cars overturned, and the quarry operation was devastated. Fortunately, the earthquake's destruction {{created a new}} demand for construction. In the years that followed, Granite Rock Company supplied materials {{for a number of}} important buildings in San Francisco and around the Monterey Bay area. Among those still standing are the old Gilroy City Hall and the old San Francisco Wells Fargo Building.|$|E
50|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>Rails</b> is a 1934 American film {{directed}} by Albert Herman. It was {{distributed by the}} independent Imperial Distributing Corporation for the states-rights market. The plot concerns $50,000 in gold that is hidden on a train and a gang's efforts to get it.|$|R
50|$|Another, more classical, form of {{handrailing}} {{which is}} still in use is the tangent method. A variant of the Cylindric method of layout, it allows for continuous climbing and <b>twisting</b> <b>rails</b> and easings. It was defined from principles set down by architect Peter Nicholson in the 18th century.|$|R

5000|$|Engineer Lilly (age 48) {{was killed}} {{instantly}} by decapitation and fireman Connolly (age 25) {{died from a}} broken neck and skull injuries shortly after being removed from the wreckage. Four newspaper messengers were injured. The two most seriously injured were the only occupants of the destroyed baggage car. They believed they survived only by being cushioned by bundles of newspapers, and were treated at the Little Falls hospital. The engine and second baggage car were damaged but not seriously and could be repaired. The other derailed baggage car was destroyed. All three set of tracks involved were forced out of service due to <b>twisted</b> <b>rails</b> and damaged ties. [...] Another train was sent and the newspapers were delivered with a two-hour delay.|$|R

60|$|I {{told him}} of Poe's {{contrivance}} of the hook and chain, and how the heaviest rails were easily overturned with it, and how the ties were piled and fired and the <b>rails</b> <b>twisted</b> out of shape. The President listened to every word with intense interest.|$|R
5000|$|By 1864 the top Union generals Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman {{realized}} the weakest {{point of the}} Confederate armies was the decrepitude of the southern infrastructure, so they escalated efforts to wear it down. Cavalry raids were the favorite device, with instructions to ruin railroads and bridges. Sherman's insight was deeper. He focused on the trust the rebels had in their Confederacy as a living nation, and {{he set out to}} destroy that trust; he predicted his raid would [...] "demonstrate the vulnerability of the South, and make its inhabitants feel that war and individual ruin are synonymous terms." [...] Sherman's [...] "March to the Sea" [...] from Atlanta to Savannah in the fall of 1864 burned and ruined every part of the industrial, commercial, transportation and agricultural infrastructure it touched, but the actual damage was confined to a swath of territory totaling about 15% of Georgia. Sherman struck at Georgia in October, just after the harvest, when the food supplies for the next year had been gathered and were exposed to destruction. In early 1865 Sherman's army moved north through the Carolinas in a campaign even more devastating than the march through Georgia. More telling than the <b>twisted</b> <b>rails,</b> smoldering main streets, dead cattle, burning barns and ransacked houses was the bitter realization among civilians and soldiers throughout the remaining Confederacy that if they persisted, sooner or later their homes and communities would receive the same treatment.|$|R

50|$|Besides the {{numerous}} {{farms in the}} region, a number of homes were constructed, {{many of which were}} destroyed in the April 18, 1906, earthquake. A fissure opened under the house at the Morrell Ranch, throwing the structure from its foundation and splitting it in two. The quake also destroyed a number of bridges, damaged the tunnels, and <b>twisted</b> the <b>rails,</b> as Robert Iacopi and William Bronson recounted in their published accounts. Another large fissure opened in the dirt road near the blacksmith shop. About 400 feet from the eastern end of the 6200 ft railroad tunnel (between Wrights and Laurel), a 5 ft offset occurred, badly damaging the tunnel. Fences were also split.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls are}} {{constructed}} of vertical hardwood slabs {{that have been}} shaped with an axe or adze. The slabs have been dressed {{at the top and}} bottom to conform to a regular depth and are connected to top and bottom plates with either nails or lengths of <b>twisted</b> wire. <b>Rails</b> have been checked into round corner posts and there is also a central round post in each of the long sides of the hut. The floor is formed from ant-bed and although now covered with dust, is clearly discernible. An entry door is located on the eastern wall, it has a fanlight space above that is covered with corrugated iron. In the eastern end of the southern wall the slabs have been cut at about two-thirds height to form a long window-like opening. This has now been boarded up with horizontal boards. A galvanised, corrugated iron water tank is also situated against the southern wall.|$|R
5000|$|Kolov left Bulgaria {{and moved}} to the United States at the age of 17. He worked various jobs until he found work as a {{railroad}} construction worker. He impressed people with his physical power and became famous for his ability to <b>twist</b> metal <b>rails</b> around his neck. He even fought a bear while hunting. Legend has it that he fought the beast for an hour with his bare hands until he got a chance to kill the animal with his rifle later. Apparently, witnesses saw the marks of Kolov's hands on the neck of the bear. He was subsequently hired as a wrestler with [...] "Victoria Circus". At the beginning of the last century, wrestling was represented in freestyle wrestling bout in which punches and kicks were allowed. It was a dangerous sport with extremely serious and severe injuries. Catch as Catch Can (CACC) or catch wrestling could be considered the father of today's mixed martial arts (MMA).|$|R
50|$|During {{the running}} of the race a dog ran onto the race track causing one of the horses, Wheatear, to fall. Shortly after that Dodd's horse, Suwarrow, was forced into the rails. Dodd {{suffered}} a broken leg and internal injuries. He died two weeks later in the Melbourne Hospital. His death was widely reported in local and international newspapers at the time.An inquest on his body found that he died of complications from a compound fracture caused when his leg was <b>twisted</b> between the <b>rail</b> and the post. The coroner recommended paling the fence to avoid similar accidents in the future.|$|R
60|$|The Nan-Shan {{was being}} looted {{by the storm}} with a senseless, {{destructive}} fury: trysails torn out of the extra gaskets, double-lashed awnings blown away, bridge swept clean, weather-cloths burst, <b>rails</b> <b>twisted,</b> light-screens smashed--and two of the boats had gone already. They had gone unheard and unseen, melting, as it were, in the shock and smother of the wave. It was only later, when upon the white flash of another high sea hurling itself amidships, Jukes {{had a vision of}} two pairs of davits leaping black and empty out of the solid blackness, with one overhauled fall flying and an iron-bound block capering in the air, that he became aware of what had happened within about three yards of his back.|$|R
60|$|As {{she glanced}} at the track she noted that room for it had been dug out of the hillside, which was seamed by gullies that the <b>rails</b> <b>twisted</b> round. The loose soil, {{consisting}} largely of volcanic cinders, appeared to offer a very unsafe support. It had slipped away here and there, leaving gaps between the ties, which were unevenly laid and at the sharper bends overhung the steep slope below. In the meantime, the small locomotive came nearer, panting loudly and throwing up showers of sparks, and Ida remarked how the rails bent and then sprang up again as the truck, which carried two ponderous blocks of stone, rolled over them. The engine rocked, sparks flashed among the wheels as their flanges bit the curves, and she wondered what the driver felt or if he had got used to his rather dangerous work.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1908, a large {{forest fire}} {{consumed}} 2500000 acre of Presque Isle County, {{and most of}} the area of Metz. Killed were 26 men, women, and children, many of whom were on a train derailed by <b>rails</b> <b>twisted</b> from the fire. These included Emma Hardies, adult; Pauline Hardies, nine years; Mary Hardies, three years; Minnie Hardies, eight months; Enfrozyna Konieczny, adult; Joseph Konieczny, three years; John Konieczny, two years; Helena Konieczny, seven months; Lizzie Cicero, adult; Margaret Cicers, seven years; George Cicero, five years; Gerlen Cicero, two years; Otille Erke, adult; Matilda Erke, six years; Gertrude Erke, eight years; Chearles Erke, four years; Lorene Erke, two years; John Nowicki, adult; Catherine Nowicki, adult; Rovert Wagner, eighteen years; Elizabeth dost, four years; John Samp, adult; Leo Buskowski, adult; William Barrett, adult; and Arthur Lee, adult. Most were of either Polish or German nationality. This became known as the [...] "Metz Fire." ...|$|R
5000|$|The work of {{destroying}} Atlanta's military assets began {{under the direction}} of the Chief Engineer, Capt. Poe, on Nov 12, and would continue until the evening of November 15, 1864. In his official report, Captain Poe states: The engineer regiments were divided into detachments, under picked officers, each of whom received a written order as follows:You will please take the detachment now under your orders to the first high chimney (stating locality and building) and throw it down, and continue to work along (stating the route) until you reach (the point designated as the limit of work for this detachment), being careful not to use fire in doing the work, since it would endanger buildings which it is not intended to destroy.These orders were faithfully carried out, and neither fire nor power were used for destroying buildings until after they had been put in ruins by battering down the walls, throwing down smokestacks, breaking up furnace arches, knocking steam machinery to pieces, and punching all boilers full of holes. The railroads within the limits of the old rebel defenses were destroyed by tearing up the rail, piling up the ties, and after putting the rails across them firing the wood which heated the iron and then the <b>rails</b> were <b>twisted.</b> The <b>rails</b> were torn up by using a small but very strong iron [...] "cant hook," [...] devised by myself, and after they were heated were twisted by applying the same hooks at each end of each <b>rail</b> in <b>twisting</b> the iron bar around its horizontal axis, being careful to give the rail at least a half turn. The length of railroad destroyed in this manner, within the limits indicated above, was about ten miles. The depot, car sheds, machine shops, and water tanks were also destroyed.It was not until the evening of the 15th of November that fire was applied to the heaps of rubbish we had made. I was upon the ground in person to see that the work was done in a proper and orderly manner; and, as far as engineer troops were concerned, this was the case. But many buildings in the business part of the city were destroyed by lawless persons, who, by sneaking around in blind alleys, succeeded in firing many houses which it was not intended to torch. Capt. Orlando M. Poe ...|$|R
