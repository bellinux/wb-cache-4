5|$|The Scranton branch faces {{off against}} the {{corporate}} branch, commenting that <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> lose for deciding {{to close down}} Buffalo. The game is close, and Pam ends up injuring her ankle, although she wants to continue. Seeing an opportunity to remove Scranton's best player from the game, Charles insists that Pam take {{a seat on the}} grounds of her injury being a company liability. Determined to beat corporate, Jim takes Pam to a local hospital to get an X-ray while Dwight stalls the game to give them time to get back. When the doctor calls Jim into the room for an update, the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that causes them to be ecstatic, presumably that Pam is pregnant. Jim then calls Dwight to send in the substitute players.|$|E

Unlike her debut album though, Kesha {{enlisted the help of}} producer Bangladesh. She explained the reason for enlisting his help was that she wanted to [...] "add a tougher edge to her music". She said that the message she wanted to put out through this album was to create [...] "good, positive, [...] music". She elaborated, [...] "I feel like I’m creating this hopefully very youthful and irreverent movement of the kids, of like adolescence. I feel like the parents don’t get it, but the kids get it. And <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> have more good, positive music.” ...|$|E
500|$|Moran was {{in favor}} of {{stronger}} prohibitions against animal fighting. [...] He sponsored legislation to penalize those who [...] "knowingly attend animal fights and allow minors to attend." [...] He sponsored legislation limiting federal funding for horse slaughter inspection plants, effectively preventing the practice. [...] In the past he promoted reinstating a five-year ban on slaughtering horses for food, noting that [...] "horses hold an important place in our nation's history and culture... <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be cared for, not killed for foreign consumption." [...] Moran in the past promoted safer keeping and treatment of exotic animals used in circus performances. In October 2014, Moran received the Lord Houghton Award from Cruelty Free International for his service and contribution to animal welfare.|$|E
500|$|The main feud on Raw {{heading into}} the event was between WWE Champion John Cena, Bobby Lashley, King Booker, Mick Foley, and Randy Orton. The feud began when Lashley was drafted to Raw and {{stripped}} of the ECW World Championship. After being stripped of the title, Lashley began to pursue the WWE Championship. On the June 18 episode of Raw, Foley, Orton, Booker, and Lashley all cut promos on why <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be the number-one contender to the WWE Championship.

500|$|Sportswriters {{also pointed}} to the Tigers' tougher conference {{schedule}} when compared to those of USC and Oklahoma. SEC commissioner Mike Slive remarked, [...] "If Auburn goes through this league undefeated, <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> play for the national championship." [...] Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer, in the runup to the game, seemingly agreed with the assessment, saying, [...] "We started out playing Southern Cal and I believe this Auburn team is better." [...] Some writers also indicated USC's five-point win—in which the Trojans struggled—over rival UCLA as an indicator that the Tigers could be the better team. In the end, such arguments were unable to sway voters, who ranked USC first, Oklahoma second, and Auburn third {{in all of the}} major polls decided by human voters. The Utes, who were also undefeated {{at the conclusion of the}} regular season, received limited attention because they were a member of a non-BCS conference.|$|E
500|$|On December 21, 2008, LenDale White and Keith Bulluck of the Tennessee Titans {{stepped on}} a Terrible Towel after the Titans's 31–14 victory. Pittsburgh's Larry Foote responded, [...] "They {{deserved}} to do that, they whooped us, <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> celebrate and, hopefully, we'll see them again." [...] While Hines Ward said, [...] " [...] did kind {{of the same thing}} and you see where they went." [...] Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher, by this point working for CBS as an analyst on The NFL Today, mentioned on the program that such antics can come back to haunt teams. Tennessee was the top seed in the playoffs, however following the incident the Titans proceeded to lose eight consecutive games, including an '08 divisional playoff game and their '09 Week 1 game against the Steelers, 13-10. After the Titans' 8th consecutive loss—a 59-0 blowout to the New England Patriots, the Titans worst loss ever—Titans coach Jeff Fisher expressed regret for his team's behavior towards the Towel, and a number of Titans players autographed a Terrible Towel and mailed it to Allegheny Valley School – the Pittsburgh charity that now owns the trademark. The Titans won their next 5 games.|$|E
500|$|Absolute Garbage {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinqumani gave a positive {{overview of the}} compilation, writing that the album [...] "serves as an anthropological study of the musical relics of a bygone era", while Laila Hassani of Heat summed up her five-star review by writing, [...] "Few modern female-fronted rock bands {{stand the test of}} time, but this reminds you why, along with Gwen Stefani's No Doubt, Garbage are one of them." [...] A reviewer for Instinct wrote [...] "this hits collection is loaded with songs best described as massive... you'll find something to love here". Jaime Gill, in a review for BBC Music, felt that [...] "Absolute Garbage is a fine legacy, the sound of a briefly brilliant and always interesting band" [...] and that overall the album [...] "sounds like no other greatest hits you own." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine wrote, [...] "By wrapping their nut-grabbing hooks and transcendent melodies in layers of gutsy guitars, Garbage managed to make pop music for people who thought they didn't like pop music. For that reason, whatever happens next, <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be remembered fondly." [...] A reviewer for the Daily Mail described it as [...] "a slick blend of grunge-rock power and sultry girl-group harmonies" [...] and added, [...] " [...] already sounds dated, but the songs stand up well." ...|$|E

[...] He claims that he was given a source for this period by Archdeacon Walter of Oxford, who presented him with a [...] "certain very ancient book written in the British language" [...] from which he has translated his history.

[...] In a GOP debate, mentioning the ongoing “Occupy Wall Street” protesters, he stated that crony capitalists are those “that benefit from contract from government, benefit from the Federal Reserve, benefit from all the bailouts.

[...] Guitarinternational.com stated [...] "Cold Day Memory is a killer release, and one that should act to propel the band into the new decade with {{a renewed sense of}} confidence, hopefully forgetting, at least somewhat, the events that haunted them {{for the majority of the}} past decade. If this record is any indication of things to come, then we could be hearing great things from a band that has more than paid their dues, and come screaming back onto the scene, leaving no doubt that <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be included next to the biggest names in Metal today." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{show has}} been criticized for being too {{derivative}} of The Simpsons, with both exemplifying a working-class family with three children. Several episodes of The Simpsons, including [...] "," [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIII," [...] and [...] "The Italian Bob", have poked fun at Family Guy, with the latter two implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of plagiarism. However, both MacFarlane and Simpsons creator Matt Groening have said that there is no serious feud {{between the two of them}} and their shows. At the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International on July 24, 2010, The Simpsons writer Matt Selman jokingly referred to MacFarlane, stating, [...] "Come on, Seth MacFarlane does one show three times." [...] Selman later backed away from the comment, adding, [...] "Those shows are all really funny – <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> exist."

2500|$|Upon release, {{critical}} {{reaction to the}} album was almost universally positive, with Billboard magazine noting [...] "the group has successfully combined folk material with pop-dance beat arrangements. Pete Seeger's [...] "The Bells Of Rhymney" [...] {{is a prime example}} of the new interpretations of folklore." [...] In its July 1965 issue, Time magazine praised the album by stating [...] "To make folk music the music of today's folk, this quintet has blended Beatle beats with Lead Belly laments, created a halfway school of folk-rock that scores at the cash box if not with the folk purists." [...] In the UK, the NME described the band and its debut album by commenting [...] "They look like a rock group but are really a fine folk unit. They play their stringed instruments with great skill and invention against the rock-steady drumming. [...] Their voices merge well...As the first group to bridge the gap between beat and folk, <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> be winners." [...] The UK publication Music Echo was also enthusiastic about the album's contents, concluding that the record was [...] "an album which easily lives up to the promise of their great knock-out singles." ...|$|E
2500|$|The press duly {{built the}} series up as a must-see, but {{the players were}} far more reticent {{than they had been}} during the {{adjacent}} encounter three years before. [...] Early in December, however, Australian captain Ricky Ponting drew considerable criticism for his comments about the ICC's wines and spirits. [...] "It has taken us a long time and a lot of great wins in different conditions around the world to get us to that number-one spot", Ponting declared, speaking to the Associated Press. [...] "If South Africa beat us three-nil I don't know if that gives them enough points to get over us. [...] But if they won the series one-nil or two-one, I don't think that would mean that <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> take over that mantle. [...] It's a bit the same with India last series. [...] Just because they beat us, the number-one team, doesn't necessarily mean they go from the number four or number five in the world to number one in the world, because it's something that's accrued {{over a long period of}} time." [...] The remark was seen as fatalist and trivialising, suggesting that the rubber hardly mattered and, in the eyes of many, that Ponting's hopes of securing a series victory were low.|$|E

[...] "It's not bad luck." [...] Villumsen said. [...] "If someone is better, <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> win. Ellen van Dijk has been riding very well all throughout the year, she has won all kinds of time trials, short ones, long ones. She really deserved to win. A place on the podium is still nice.
