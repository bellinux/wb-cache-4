25|$|Criticality {{in nature}} is uncommon. At three ore {{deposits}} at Oklo in Gabon, sixteen sites (the so-called Oklo Fossil Reactors) {{have been discovered}} at which self-sustaining nuclear fission took place approximately 2billion years ago.

25|$|RCA used Valensi's {{concept as}} the basis of all of its developments, believing it to be the only proper {{solution}} to the broadcast problem. However, RCA's early sets using mirrors and other projection systems all suffered from image and color quality problems, and were easily bested by CBS's hybrid system. But solutions to these problems were in the pipeline, and RCA in particular was investing massive sums (later estimated at $100 million) to develop a usable dot-sequential tube. RCA was beaten <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> by the Geer tube, which used three B tubes aimed at different faces of colored pyramids to produce a color image.

25|$|Although Ten HD was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} the first new commercial television channel in metropolitan areas of Australia since 1988, it was instead beaten <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> by 7HD. Following the announcement by the Ten Network, Network Seven also announced its previously hidden plans to launch a dedicated HD channel on 15 September 2007 and pushed the launch date forward to 10 October. 7HD was the first dedicated HD multichannel launched, 2 months earlier than the Channel 10 equivalent. The Nine Network's move to a HD channel was considered sluggish by industry insiders, taking until March 2008. The Network was more excited by its plans to introduce a new SD channel in 2009 called GO!, which is when digital multicasting restrictions were scheduled to be lifted from the commercial stations. GO! was released to the public on 9 August, spelling the end of 9HD which was replaced by the previous HD version of Nine.|$|E
25|$|Carl Froch lost in {{the final}} of the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament in a {{dramatic}} bout against undefeated WBA super-middleweight champion Andre Ward. The vacant The Ring super-middleweight title would be on the line in the fight, as well as Froch and Ward's super-middleweight titles. In the first 7 rounds, Ward outboxed Froch, successfully using his jab to neutralize Froch and beating Froch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>punch</b> from a distance and at close range. In the later rounds, Ward seemed to take his foot off the gas, leaving Froch to win a couple of rounds {{near the end of the}} fight, though they were close and fairly competitive rounds. The judges scorecards were 115–113, 115–113 and 118–110, all in favor of Ward. Ward won the vacant The Ring super-middleweight title and is also regarded as becoming Lineal champion with his Super Six World Boxing Classic win against Froch, despite some independent sources rating undefeated IBF title holder Lucian Bute #1 or 2. The fight peaked at 580,000 viewers on Showtime.|$|E

25|$|After asking Gibson to {{take over}} his {{personal}} finances and switching his management from Jacobs and Roxborough to Marshall Miles, the Louis camp negotiated {{a deal with the}} IRS under which Louis would come out of retirement, with all Louis's net proceeds going to the IRS. A match with Ezzard Charles—who had acquired the vacant heavyweight title in June 1949 by outpointing Walcott—was set for September 27, 1950. By then, Louis was 36 years old and had been away from competitive boxing for two years. Weighing in at 218, Louis was still strong, but his reflexes were gone. Charles repeatedly beat him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>punch.</b> By the end of the fight, Louis was cut above both eyes, one of which was shut tight by swelling. He knew he had lost even before Charles was declared the winner. The result was not the only disappointing aspect of the fight for Louis; only 22,357 spectators paid to witness the event at Yankee Stadium, and his share of the purse was a mere $100,458. Louis had to continue fighting.|$|E

40|$|Punching {{shear failure}} of {{concrete}} slabs poses a significant risk in many concrete structures. This {{mode of failure}} can be brittle and catastrophic. <b>The</b> ability <b>to</b> accurately estimate <b>the</b> <b>punching</b> shear capacity of slab column connections in existing structures is essential, especially in evaluating <b>the</b> suitability <b>to</b> new loads added to a building. Punching shear has been studied, both experimentally and analytically. However, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of parameters involved and the complexities in modeling, current approaches used <b>to</b> estimate <b>the</b> <b>punching</b> shear capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) slabs include mechanical models and design code equations. Mechanical models are complex, while design code equations are empirical. This study investigates the ability of artificial neural networks (ANN) <b>to</b> predict <b>the</b> <b>punching</b> shear strength of concrete slabs. <b>The</b> parameters considered <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> most significant in punching shear resistance of RC slabs were: concrete strength, slab depth, shear span to depth ratio, column size to slab effective depth ratio and flexure reinforcement ratio.
