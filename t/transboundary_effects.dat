It especially focuses on the paradigm-shifts of policies, principles and rules (adopted by the states in numerous rules), which are relevant in handling the environmental, political, societal and financial outcomes of the environmental disasters having <b>transboundary</b> <b>effect.</b> The well-known environmental disasters (e. g. from Seveso to Fukushima, mainly Chernobyl) and their crisis-management technics provide essential examples and solution mechanism to the whole international community and countries, which are facing with the same challenges and threats according to their characteristics and their exposures to similar environmental threats (whether they are man-made or not). ...|$|R

The research discusses potential sources of DGT-measured labile metals in water and seasonal variations. Our results demonstrate the application of DGT for identifying and measuring labile metal concentrations in contrasted climate conditions (cold snowy winter and hot summer) and appropriateness of such a tool for continuous water monitoring with the presence of an ice cover. Results show that DGT-measured concentrations of most of trace metals were much higher downstream of the wastewater treatment plants discharges than upstream; thus wastewater treatment plants seemed not able to reduce or to remove trace metals' contaminations and become major sources of pollutants in the studied rivers. The calculation of the average metal fluxes based on the DGT-measured concentrations confirmed that the urban wastewater discharges significantly contribute to the metal fluxes into the Udy and the Lopan rivers during both low-flow and high-flow periods. Compared to the wastewaters inputs to the rivers, the <b>transboundary</b> <b>effect</b> is limited, but should be taken into account as the origin of some metals is from sources located on the adjacent Russian territory...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ecological {{compensation}} is being applied {{to deal with}} <b>transboundary</b> external <b>effects</b> caused by water resources conservation or exploitation in China. A concept of water resources co-conservation and sharing was applied to burden the upstream conservation cost and to share the benefit in the whole river basin. Xin’an River Basin, related to two provinces in East China, was taken as the study area. The current territorial scales of the co-conservation area and the benefit sharing area were determined. The total actual water conservation cost for Xin’an River Basin {{was estimated to be}} about 488 million CNY in 2006. By analyzing the transformation of protection costs and benefits between different districts and sections, benefits brought by water to different beneficiaries were also estimated. The conservation cost was distributed to the water users or governments in the whole sharing area according to the proportion of shared benefits...|$|R
40|$|United States {{commercial}} fisheries are managed by regional councils whose jurisdictions are circumscribed by political boundaries. Species range often spans management borders, linking fishing regions by participation. On the East Coast, individuals commonly prosecute several fisheries managed by different councils. This study tests both {{the existence and}} magnitude of policy-induced transboundary impacts on fishery participation, {{with the goal of}} providing a quantitative starting point for further investigation into the economic and social impact of spillover fishing effort. Regulatory structures vary across a spectrum from open access to individual harvest rights. In 2010, the New England Fishery Management Council expanded a cooperative rights-based management program – “sectors” – to enhance stock sustainability and economic efficiency in the groundfish fishery. Groundfish sector management altered the deployment of fishing effort in New England. Newly idled groundfish fishers possess the potential to increase participation in regulated open access Mid-Atlantic fisheries characterized by low entry barriers. This study utilizes econometric methods to estimate the <b>transboundary</b> <b>effect</b> of sector management on Mid-Atlantic fisheries. The use of a difference-in-differences estimation strategy allows the author to evaluate the causal link between New England sector management and altered fishing effort directed towards Mid-Atlantic managed species. Econometric methodology is employed to control for exogenous factors that may also affect fishing effort and to assess the unobservable policy counterfactual of present day Mid-Atlantic effort levels in the absence of New England groundfish sectors. The study finds that the establishment of groundfish sectors does affect Mid-Atlantic fisheries, but impacts are not uniform across species nor are they uniform across the 17 groundfish sectors. Further, effort redirection can be more or less pronounced when looking at the behavior of enrolled sector members, or looking only at those sector members who are now inactive in New England fisheries. Certain sectors are identified as redirecting more effort towards Mid-Atlantic species. While cumulative effort spillover {{does not seem to be}} pushing Mid-Atlantic fisheries perilously close to capacity limits, the identified influx can impact profitability in effort-receiving fisheries and could potentially have a negative effect on socioeconomic outcomes in the greater regional fishing economy...|$|R

The project is designed to be run-of-the river and as such will not create a large reservoir. However, both the Xayaboury and Don Sahong dams have attracted international attention due to the <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> to the Mekong River assumed to affect people and the environment downstream, in Cambodia and Vietnam.

40|$|National and <b>transboundary</b> adverse <b>effects</b> of {{competition}} for land are being increasingly recognized by researchers and decision-makers, however {{the consideration of}} these impacts within national planning strategies is not yet commonplace. To estimate how increasing agricultural production can be conciliated with protection of natural resources at the national scale, we analyzed current land use in Suriname, and investigated opportunities for, and constraints to developing a sustainable agricultural sector. Suriname is a remarkable case study. To date, Suriname has retained most of its natural resources with forest areas covering over 90 % of the country. Surinamese forests combine extremely high levels of both biodiversity and carbon, making them top priority from a global ecosystem services perspective. Among other national and international pressures from increased demand for agricultural products, the country is also considering significant expansion of agricultural output to both diminish imports and become a ‘bread basket’ for the Caribbean region, which collectively may pose risks to natural resources. In this study, combining locally-obtained primary data, expert consultation and secondary data from the Food and Agriculture Organization we analyzed a range of scenarios, we show the complexities associated with current land management and we discuss alternatives for developing a sustainable agricultural sector in Suriname. We show that Suriname can increase the production of rice, {{which is the most}} important agricultural activity in the country, without expanding rice area. Rather, future increase in rice production could be promoted through an increase in rice productivity, and the employment of more environmentally-favorable management methods, in order to both diminish pollution and avoid encroachment of the agriculture into pristine areas. Further, we show a potential to both contribute to greening of the agricultural sector and to higher economic returns through expanding the production of ‘safe food’ and through possible development of organic agriculture in Suriname. If Suriname develops a ‘greener’ agricultural sector, it may both increase economic returns from the agricultural sector and benefit from continuing protection of natural resources. Because most of Suriname forests present top levels of carbon and biodiversity, the country could benefit from so-called ‘early-action’ Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) finance, which is already being paid mostly through bilateral agreements. Further, by adopting land-use planning that protects natural resources, Suriname may be in extraordinary position to benefit from both improved-quality agricultural production and from incentives to conserve forest carbon and biodiversity, such as payments for ecosystem services. Given the high stakes and the severe lack of both primary data and applied analyses in Suriname, further research focused on better informing land-use policies would be a valuable investment for the country. Although this analysis was performed for Suriname, conclusions drawn here are transferrable and may assist formulation of policy recommendations for land use elsewhere...|$|R

The Vrancea Seismic Region, corresponding to the curvature sector of the Eastern Romanian Carpathians, represents the most active sub-crustal (focal depth > 50 km) earthquake province of Europe. It represents the main seismic energy source throughout Romania with significant <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> recorded as far as Ukraine and Bulgaria. During the last 300 years, the region featured 14 earthquakes with M> 7, among which seven events with magnitude above 7. 5 and three between 7. 7 and 7. 9. Apart from the direct damages, the Vrancea earthquakes are also responsible for causing numerous other geohazards, such as ground fracturing, groundwater level disturbances and possible deep-seated landslide occurrences (rock slumps, rock-block slides, rock falls, rock avalanches).

40|$|The current euro {{crisis is}} shaped by urgency and actuality. Since it affects {{a lot of people}} and {{different}} countries, it is also denoted by <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects.</b> Considering these circumstances, the call for quick crisis solution occurs. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to investigate the leadership issue during the euro crisis. Based on theoretical principles of crisis leadership, we examine the role and behavior of Germany in the euro crisis. Due to the fact that Germany is currently in a significant position, we narrow down the crisis leadership aspect to this specific view. Providing an overall and thorough picture, we investigate Germany’s leadership in the euro crisis from different perspectives. In order to achieve this purpose, we determine this issue from a political, economical and societal perception, which seem to be the most influencing factors in the case of the euro crisis. By assembling the crucial findings of these separate categories, we gain a broader perspective and hence a generalized evaluation and understanding of the German leadership style. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problem of optimal recapitalization of banking sectors after banking crises and analyzes the effect of trade liberalization on environmental policy and welfare in a strategic setting {{in the presence of}} transboundary pollution.;Government-financed bank restructuring programs, occasionally costing up to 50 % of GDP, have commonly been used to resolve banking crises. In Chapter 2 analyze the Ramsey-optimal paths of bank recapitalization programs that weigh recapitalization benefits and costs under different financing options. In our model bank credit is essential, due to a working capital constraint on firms, and banks are financial intermediaries that borrow from households and lend to firms. A banking crisis produces a disruption of credit and a fall in output equivalent to those in developing countries affected by banking crises. Full recapitalization of the banking system immediately after the crisis is optimal only if international credit is available. One-shot recapitalization is not optimal with domestically-financed programs, even if the government has access to non-distortionary taxes. The welfare cost of a crisis is substantial: the equivalent permanent decline in the no-crisis steady state comsumption ranges between 0. 51 % and 0. 65 %, depending on the source of financing the recapitalization program.;In Chapter 3 analyze the effects of free trade on environmental policies in a strategic setting with transboundary pollution. Trade liberalization can result in a race to the bottom in environmental outcomes, which makes both countries worse off. In our model it is not the terms of trade motive, but the incentive, in a strategic setting, to reduce the incidence of transboundary pollution, that drives countries to relax domestic environmental policy. When command and control policies such as quotas are used instead of taxes, countries are unable to influence foreign emissions by strategic choice of domestic policy; hence, there is no race to the bottom. However, when permits are tradable across countries, unless pollution is a pure global public bad, there is a race to the bottom in environmental policy. In the free trade equilibrium, internationally nontradable quotas result in the lowest pollution level, while the relative ranking of pollution in the internationally tradable quota equilibrium and the tax equilibrium depends on the relative magnitudes of domestic and transboundary pollution and the relative slopes of the demand and supply schedules. The nontradable quota equilibrium strictly welfare-dominates the tax equilibrium.;Chapter 4 extends the model of the previous chapter to explicitly model differences between countries that may lead to trade in equilibrium. We analyze the effect of trade liberalization on pollution policy and welfare in the presence of both the terms of trade motives and the <b>transboundary</b> pollution <b>effect.</b> We find that, when countries use taxes to regulate pollution, the importer of the polluting good unambiguously lowers its tax due to trade liberalization, while the exporter of the polluting good reduces (increases) its tax if the transboundary pollution (terms of trade) effect dominates. It is possible for both countries to be worse off due to trade liberalization. When the only source of comparative advantage is a difference in preference towards pollution, then aggregate (world) welfare is higher under free trade as compared to autarky if countries use quotas to regulate pollution, but is lower under free trade relative to autarky if the policy instrument in both countries is a pollution tax...|$|R
40|$|Ambient {{concentrations}} of many pollutants {{are associated with}} emissions due to human activity, such as road transport and other combustion sources. In this paper we consider air pollution as a multi [...] level phenomenon within a Bayesian hierarchical model. We examine different scales of variation in pollution concentrations ranging from large scale <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> to more localised effects which {{are directly related to}} human activity. Specifically, in the first stage of the model, we isolate underlying patterns in pollution concentrations due to global factors such as underlying climate and topography, which are modelled together with spatial structure. At this stage measurements from monitoring sites located within rural areas are used which, as far as possible, are chosen to reflect background concentrations. Having isolated these global effects, in the second stage we assess the effects of human activity on pollution in urban areas. The proposed model was applied to {{concentrations of}} nitrogen dioxide measured throughout the EU for which significant increases are found to be associated with human activity in urban areas. The approach proposed here provides valuable information {{that could be used in}} performing health impact assessments and to inform policy. Comment: 22 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

The natural as well as man-made mass disasters have more propensity to affect the developing countries of the Third World. The data presented in tabular form in the paper reveals their increasing 'killer potential'. The present inquiry shows that the non-sustainable development patterns and practices by the Third World countries have brought them on {{to the brink of}} irreversible environmental consequences. The study underlines that due to lack of adequate disaster identification, prevention and management capabilities these countries suffer the worst. It suggests that a regional level cooperation, on the lines of the SAARC, is suitable to streamline joint efforts to combat mass disasters. The study also highlights the possible legal responses and role of lawyers in this respect. Some of the emerging international eco-standards provide a basis for resolving disputes concerning <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> of disasters.

40|$|From the Chernobyl {{accident}} onwards most European countries established or enhanced {{their national}} radioactivity monitoring and information systems for emergency situations. The large <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> of the radioactive release during the Chernobyl accident evidenced {{the need for}} international provisions to ex-change radiological monitoring and modelling information. Based on the experience gained from existing bi- and multilateral data exchanges the European Com-mission has made provision for and is continuing to develop technical systems to exchange information of com-mon interest. The objectives and technical realisations of the EC international information exchange systems, European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange (ECURIE) and European Union Radiological Data Exchange Platform (EURDEP), are described. At this moment, gamma dose-rate measurements from automatic monitoring stations in more than twenty European countries are exchanged on a daily basis, using a common format, by means of EURDEP. On the other hand, modelling results are currently exchanged using the Real-Time MODel evaluation system (RTMOD). Regular tests for the evaluation and improvement of long range transport and dispersion models operational in Emergency response agencies in the European Union and world-wide are being performed.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{generated by}} vegetation fire smoke (VFS) {{is a phenomenon}} that has influenced the global environment in prehistoric and historic time scales. Although historic evidence of the impacts of VFS on societies is scarce, {{there are indications that}} VFS has been a factor that influenced society significantly since the Middle Ages. In recent decades, increasing application of fire as a tool for land-use change has resulted in more frequent occurrence of extended fire and smoke episodes with consequences on human health and security. Some of these events have been associated with droughts that are attributed to inter-annual climate variability or possible consequences of regional climate change. In metropolitan or industrial areas, the impacts of VFS may be coupled with the emission burden from fossil fuel burning and other technogenic sources, resulting in increasing adverse affects on the human population. We review the character, magnitude, and role of pyrogenic gaseous and particle emissions on the composition and functioning of the global atmosphere, human health, and security. Special emphasis is given on radioactive emissions generated by fires burning in peatlands and on terrain contaminated by radionuclides. The <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> of VFS pollution are a driving argument for developing international policies to address the underlying causes for avoiding excessive fire application, and to establish sound fire and smoke management practices and protocols of cooperation in wildland fire management at an international level...|$|E
40|$|Hydropower {{developments}} {{along the}} main stem of the Mekong River and its tributaries cause <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> within the Mekong Basin Region, which comprises parts of six countries. On the one hand, the provision of hydropower triggers economic development and helps to meet the rising energy demand of the Mekong riparian countries, especially China, Thailand, and Vietnam. On the other hand, {{the negative impact of}} dam construction, mainly altered water flow and sediment load, has severe impacts on the environment and the livelihoods of the rural Mekong population. Several discrepancies exist in the needs, demands, and challenges of upstream versus downstream countries. Against the common apprehension that downstream countries are powerlessly exposed to mainly negative impacts whereas upstream countries unilaterally benefit from hydropower, the authors argue that upstream–downstream relations are not really clear-cut. This conclusion is based on a consideration of the complex power play between Mekong riparians, with a focus on recent power trade interactions. The article investigates the consequences of hydropower dams for the Mekong region as well as the role of supranational players, such as the Mekong River Commission and the Greater Mekong Subregion Initiative, on the hydropower debate. It is not nations that are the winners or losers in the hydropower schemes in the Mekong, but rather parts of the riparian population: a few influential and powerful elites versus the large mass of rural poor...|$|E
40|$|European {{environmental}} law {{consists of a}} large number of directives and regulations dealing with environmental domains such as air, water, or waste, or with issues such as greenhouse gases, chemicals or industrial emissions. These directives and regulations do not form a comprehensive system of {{environmental law}}. Particularly those subjects which have <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> or affect the internal market are regulated at the EU level. In view of the subsidiarity principle (Article 5 (3) TEU), other parts of environmental law are left to the Member States. Member States each have their own existing national system of environmental law. Directives have to be transposed into those national systems by the Member States. It is in this process of transposition that flaws in or discrepancies between directives are likely to be felt. In order to facilitate their implementation, it is important that directives form a coherent system: provisions from different directives should not clash, and preferably the same terms and definitions should be used. This enables the Member States to implement the directives in a general act in the field of environmental law, and moreover does not force them to differentiate between terms coming from different directives. This chapter will first pay attention to the implementation of environmental directives (Section 1). Then, several environmental directives will be used as an illustration of the problems which may arise when there is a lack of coherence between directives (Section 2) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} principles governing international law are changing dramatically. International law, which traditionally has regulated the conduct {{between and among}} countries, has had as its core the respect for state sovereignty. However, {{the latter part of}} the twentieth century witnessed fundamental changes to the way in which the international community operates that are based upon a deep interdependence among states and their openness to international actors. This is often labeled the process of globalization. This process has had a significant impact on states' sovereignty and on the way in which international law regulates the interaction among states. This phenomenon includes the way in which international trade law (spearheaded by the World Trade Organization) dictates how member states' trade policies may operate; the way in which international financial law (led by the International Monetary Fund) determines financial policies of member states; and the way in which international environmental law regulates actions with <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects.</b> Thus, international law is no longer restricted to areas of interstate concern but it has also come to regulate states' domestic actions as well. Opponents to this view may hold that states are still sovereign in that they are not forced to take part in these international legal regimes. However, this view fails to take account of the political and economic realities of international relations where the voluntary nature of this regulation for most states (particularly weaker or poorer states) is a legal fiction.

40|$|The {{judgment}} of the International Court of Justice in the Pulp Mills (Argentina v. Uruguay) case makes a very important contribution to international law relating to shared international water resources and to international environmental law more generally. It does much to clarify the relationship between procedural and substantive rules of international environmental law. The Court linked interstate notification of new projects {{to the satisfaction of}} the customary due diligence obligation to prevent significant transboundary harm. It found that environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an essential requirement of customary international law in respect of activities having potential <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects.</b> The real significance of the judgment is that it held that the duty to notify, and the related duty to conduct an EIA taking account of transboundary impacts, exist in customary international law and thus apply to all states, not just those that have concluded international agreements containing such obligations. The Court confirmed that for shared international water resources, the principle of equitable and reasonable utilisation, universally accepted as the cardinal rule of international water law, is virtually synonymous with the concept of sustainable development, and suggests that considerations of environmental protection are absolutely integral to the equitable balancing of interests involved. The judgment makes it clear that the principle of equitable utilisation ought to be understood as a process, rather than a normatively determinative rule. This ought to help to address widespread confusion {{about the nature of the}} key rules and principles of international water resources law and its role in the resolution of water resources disputes and in environmental diplomacy more generally...|$|E
40|$|Management {{of coastal}} systems {{has become the}} focus of many {{national}} and international projects. Coastal systems extend beyond jurisdictional boundaries and are affected by impacts of many local users and by decisions made by different levels of government. The management of coastal systems thus requires involvement of many bodies- the interconnected calling for an integrated approach. This paper presents a model for designing an effective, comprehensive Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Framework for the small islands, including coastal profiles, with the goal of promoting ecologically sustainable use and development of the coastal zone. Furthermore, it contains an important component of addressing policy and strategy development related to ICZM at national level in line with the requirements of various relevant Conventions and Protocols of which the islands are party to. The strategy and plan to be formulated will contribute to ICZM strategies at national and regional levels. It will enable exchange of knowledge and experience in such management within the region, and assist in addressing coastal and marine resources management problems and their <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects.</b> The ICZM Plan shall provide the basis for protecting, restoring and preserving the coastal zones important and diverse coastal resources. The ICZM plan will set a number of objectives that shall be achieved in order to fulfill its aim. The objectives will then divided into several measurable and achievable targets. The Plan will outline the resources that will be targeted, who are responsible for actions, what actions are needed, how they will be managed and how to implement them, in order that sustainability is achieved and the available resources can benefit the future generations...|$|E
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{compiled}} {{within the framework}} of the programme on Regional Air Pollution in Developing Countries (RAPIDC), Phase III conducted during the period 2005 - 2008. RAPIDC is funded by the Department of Infrastructure and Economic Cooperation (INEC) of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA). It is coordinated by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and carried out in collaboration with Swedish Universities and research organisations together with inter-governmental agencies and research organisations in Asia and Africa. This work has been produced by the International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) at Lund University. This document generally focuses upon, and is primarily directed towards the eight signatory countries to the Malé Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution and Its Likely <b>Transboundary</b> <b>Effects</b> for South Asia (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) but is in essence relevant to most developing countries. This document serves as a decision support information resource for best available technologies and techniques to address air pollution from the transport sector. Drawing on the experiences of other countries, regions and municipalities this document presents a comprehensive overview and successful examples of technical and organisational measures and strategies that can contribute towards reduced air pollution from transport systems. Best available technologies and techniques (practices) that should be considered when defining strategies for sustainable and cleaner transport systems are presented within this report. This work distinguishes between: (1) land use planning and mobility management, being the fundamental starting point for managing and steering transport demand, (2) transit, walking and cycling being more sustainable transport options than individual motorised transport, and finally (3) cleaner vehicles and cleaner fuels...|$|E
40|$|For some decades, {{there has}} been a growing {{emphasis}} on the importance of intellectual property rights in general, and patents in particular, as a tool of economic strategy and competitiveness. More than 90 % of the patents granted in industrialized countries originate from employee inventors. This reality has prompted legislators in most European Member States to promulgate laws that regulate the matter of employee inventions. This paper aims, in a first part, at describing the characteristics of the legislative regime in several EU Member States. It is shown that, save for university inventions, the legislative landscape has not undergone fundamental changes during the past decades. In today’s globalized world economy the issue of employees’ inventions is, however, no longer a mere national issue. Also in Europe, more and more research takes place in a multinational setting and the <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> of the currently diverging national solutions are important. Hence, the lack of harmonized European rules governing the issue of employee inventions is not only surprising but also unfortunate. The paper discusses some attempts that {{have been made in the}} past all of which have failed at an early stage. Possibly, because the issue of employee inventions is legally situated at the intersection between patent law and labour law, it revealed itself as too tricky to handle. The paper criticizes the current reticence demonstrated by the European legislator. The viewpoint that existing differences between member states' laws on employees' inventions are not likely to have an impact on innovation or on the conditions of competition seems short-sighted. The paper shows that a coherent regulatory framework that takes the trend towards Europeanization is not illusive and may have many benefits for intra-European relationships. It is argued that such a goal is feasible even though the specific details of the current statutes vary from Member State to Member State. status: publishe...|$|E

This report has been principally produced for eight countries – Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – that are signatories to the Malé Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution and Its Likely <b>Transboundary</b> <b>Effects</b> for South Asia. The Malé Declaration developed from the policy dialogue held in 1998 under the auspices of UNEP as part of the RAPIDC programme. This report is produced in response to the Malé Activity 5. 2. 1 Impacts in the Housing Sector. The report gives an overview of the existing techniques and technologies in the housing sector for reduction of air pollution. As a result of the relatively pollution intensive nature of energy production in the region, and as other areas such as the production of building materials (e. g. cement production) are addressed by other resource documents, this document is mainly focused upon energy consumption. The different sections of this report describe technologies and techniques for the lower emission lifecycle building envelopes (including insulation issues, windows, roofs and walls, etc.) and other building support systems such as cooling, ventilation, heating, water heating, cooking and lighting. The report seeks to give examples from Malé countries or from countries with similar climatic conditions to the extent possible...|$|E
40|$|At its fifty-third session (2001), the International Law Commission finally {{adopted a}} {{complete}} {{text of the}} Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities. The Articles apply to activities not prohibited by international law, which involve a risk of causing significant transboundary harm through their physical consequences. “Transboundary harm” means harm caused in the territory of, or in other places under the jurisdiction or control of a state, other than the state of origin, {{whether or not the}} states concerned share a common border (Art. 2 c). The scope of the Draft Articles encompasses the activities involving a low probability of causing disastrous transboundary harm or a high probability o f causing significant transboundary harm. International liability arises only when there is a physical link between such an activity and its <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects.</b> Art. 3 of the Prevention Draft imposes a general obligation to take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm, or at any event, to minimize the risk thereof. The state of origin shall procure prior authorization for any activity within the scope of the Draft Articles carried out in its territory or otherwise under its jurisdiction or control. Any decision in respect of the authorization will be based on an assessment of the possible risk o f transboundary harm caused by that activity, including an environmental impact assessment. If the assessment indicates a risk of causing significant transboundary harm, the state of origin shall provide the states likely to be affected with timely notification o f the risk. The state of origin and the states likely to be affected shall enter into consultation, at the request of any of them, with a view to achieving acceptable solutions regarding measures to be adopted in order to prevent significant transboundary harm. Due diligence is the criterion to assess whether the state has complied with its obligations under the Prevention Draft...|$|E
