40|$|This paper {{analyses}} speaking rate {{variations in}} English and Danish and relates them to problems encountered in speech recognition. Intra speaker variabilities in speech rates are explained {{with reference to}} <b>time</b> <b>equalisation</b> of stress groups and utterances. Further, it is shown that certain natural classes of phonemes are more affected by speaking rate variations than others. Keywords: Phoneme modeling, rate of speech, phone duration, <b>time</b> <b>equalisation</b> of stress groups and phrases. 1. Introduction Large vocabulary Speech recognition systems based on Hidden Markov Models modeling phonemes or units derived from phonemes (triphones, generalised triphones, diphones) have over the recent years moved towards increasing feature vector dimensions which typically include parameters like 1 st and 2 nd order delta cepstrum. Furthermore preprocessing is typically performed within a fixed window of around 100 msec necessary for modeling the huge number of qualitative phoneme variants found in larg [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The thin slab direct {{charging}} process (TSDC) {{as applied to}} microalloyed steels has had a considerable development due to its relatively low production costs and ability to produce steels with good mechanical and toughness properties, comparable to those manufactured by the conventional cold {{charging process}} (CCC). This research {{is concerned with the}} effect of <b>equalisation</b> <b>time</b> on the microstructures. Three <b>equalisation</b> <b>times</b> (53 min, 318 min, and 1 333 min) at 1 150 °C were investigated for a vanadium microalloyed steel, which contained a low carbon content (0. 073 wt%) and a high nitrogen content (0. 021 wt%). The experimental results show that MnS precipitates provided the main pinning forces during casting due to the high solubility temperature, but MnS particles did not provide a sufficient pinning force to prevent the austenite grains from growing. The austenite grain growth appears more likely to be abnormal in this stage. AlN precipitates were only identified at the longest <b>equalisation</b> <b>time</b> due to a low precipitation rate. The AlN pinning effect was evident at 1 333 min <b>equalisation</b> <b>time,</b> and was able to prevent further austenite grain growth by providing an additional pinning force. The study shows that vanadium does not have any effect on austenite grain growth at 1 150 °C because of its low solubility temperature in austenite. When the steel was water-quenched, vanadium remained supersaturated in the solution but tempering in the ferrite phase field (650 °C) can promote VN or VCN precipitation often using AlN as the nuclei...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of space-time coded(STC) {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) enhancements were implemented in a MatLab simulation by shaping the OFDM pulses transmitted through various terrestrial Rayleigh fading channel models. The goal is to achieve the lowest possible BER to overcome channel effects. The pulse shaping investigated achieved high data rates by being overlapped in the <b>time</b> domain, <b>equalisation</b> was then used to suppress the resulting intersymbol interference. Our finding after researching a number of pulses is that the harris-moerder pulse was the most successful. Unlike the other pulse shapes this shape performs better in a Rayleigh fading channel than in an approximated AWGN channel. This also indicates that simulations using an overly simplified channel model can give results that are likely to be contrary to performance in the real physical environment. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a {{study focused on}} the hydro-mechanical behaviour of a plastic clay under partially saturated conditions. Clay remoulded samples were dried using vapour transfer under one-dimensional conditions. Samples underwent an important vertical shrinkage on drying, which progressed along more than one week. To study the time evolution of this phenomenon, simulation aided techniques were used to analyse the progression of suction at local scale and to determine {{the time required to}} equilibrate homogeneously the sample. In this case the fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical finite element code Code_Bright [1] was used to analyse this process. The simulation adequately followed the evolution of sample shrinkage measured experimentally. The determination of the suction <b>equalisation</b> <b>time</b> also agreed with the experimental information. ...|$|R
40|$|Wireless Personal Area Networks are {{increasingly}} widespread In their application. These range from simple remote controls to highly complex networks {{that allow the}} communication of heterogeneous data-collecting devices and actor devices via routing nodes and gateways, to networks such as wired JP networks. Key performance aspects for wireless personal area networks are {{the large number of}} nodes capable of working within the same reception area and the energy consumption of such nodes. This work shows how equalisation for wireless personal area networks can be realised with a small increase in hardware, in order to achieve performance improvements in highly dispersive environments. The proposed ideas are extended to a multiple-antenna solution which can be made downwards-compatible to the appropriate IEEE standard. In this manner, the performance in terms of either bit rate or robustness can be improved. For both equalisation and multiple-antenna procedures it is shown how the existing pre-amble can be used to find an estimate of the channel impulse response. This processing is performed in the <b>time</b> domain. <b>Equalisation</b> as well as multi-antenna channel separation is achieved by one set of cyclic filters operating at the chip rate. This allows a simple hardware design for integration. Selected methods are tested in real-time in a testbed for wireless personal area networks and. are shown to offer real performance improvements.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} of four vanadium based steels which have been processed by a simulated direct charging route using processing parameters typical of thin slab casting, where the cast product has a thickness of 50 to 80 mm (in this study 50 mm) and is fed directly to a furnace to equalise the microstructure prior to rolling. In the direct charging process, cooling rates are faster, <b>equalisation</b> <b>times</b> shorter {{and the amount of}} deformation introduced during rolling less than in conventional practice. Samples in this study were quenched after casting, after equalisation, after 4 th rolling pass and after coiling, to follow the evolution of microstructure. The mechanical and toughness properties and the microstructural features might be expected to differ from equivalent steels, which have undergone conventional processing. The four low carbon steels (~ 0. 06 wt%) which were studied contained 0. 1 wt%V (V-N), 0. 1 wt%V and 0. 010 wt%Ti (V-Ti), 0. 1 wt%V and 0. 03 wt%Nb (V-Nb), and 0. 1 wt%V, 0. 03 wt%Nb and 0. 007 wt%Ti (V-Nb-Ti). Steels V-N and V-Ti contained around 0. 02 wt% N, while the other two contained about 0. 01 wt%N. The as-cast steels were heated at three equalising temperatures of 1050 C, 1100 C or 1200 C and held for 30 - 60 minutes prior to rolling. Optical microscopy and analytical electron microscopy, including parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy (PEELS), were used to characterise the precipitates. In the as-cast condition, dendrites and plates were found. Cuboid particles were seen at this stage in Steel V-Ti, but they appeared only in the other steels after equalization. In addition, in the final product of all the steels, fine particles were seen, but {{it was only in the}} two titanium steels that cruciform precipitates were present. PEELS analysis showed that the dendrites, plates, cuboids, cruciforms and fine precipitates were essentially nitrides. The two Ti steels had better toughness than the other steels but inferior lower yield stress values. This was thought to be, in part, due to the formation of cruciform precipitates in austenite, thereby removing nitrogen and the microalloying elements which would have been expected to precipitate in ferrite as dispersion hardening particles...|$|R
