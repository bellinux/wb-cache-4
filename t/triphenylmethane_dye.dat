40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{investigate}} the influence of different metal ions on laccase activity and <b>triphenylmethane</b> <b>dye</b> decolorization by laccase from white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor. Laccase activity was inhibited by monovalent ions (Li+, Na+, K+ and Ag+) but the presence of divalent ions increased laccase activity at the concentration of 10 mmol/l. The effect of metal ions on decolorization of triphenylmethane dyes with different structures namely Bromochlorophenol Blue, Bromophenol Blue, Bromocresol Blue and Phenol Red was tested. The presence of metal ions (Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Ba 2 +, Mn 2 +, Zn 2 +) slightly decreased <b>triphenylmethane</b> <b>dye</b> decolorization by laccase from T. versicolor except Na+ and Mg 2 +, which caused the increase of decolorization for all tested dyes. Decolorization of selected dyes showed that the presence of low-molecular-weight compounds is necessary for effective decolorization. Hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) is the most frequently used. Although HBT belongs to most frequently used redox mediator and generally increase decolorization efficiency, so its presence decreased decolorization percentage of Bromophenol Blue and Bromochlorophenol Blue, the influence of metal ions to dye decolorization by laccase has the similar course with or without presence of redox mediator HBT...|$|E

The tumor incidence was 50 % in females and 26 % in males, the median latent period was 50 and 30 weeks, respectively, and the average total dose required for induction was 417 and 307 mg, respectively. Metastases occurred fre-quently and the tumors were successfully transplanted into rats of the same strain. -J Nat Cancer Inst 37 : 845 - 857, 1966. DURING food-color toxicity studies, rhabdomyo-sarcomas were observed in rats {{at the site of}} subcutaneous injections of the <b>triphenylmethane</b> <b>dye</b> Blue VRS (C. I. 1956 No. 42045) (1). Weekly injections of the dye caused initial local ulceration and abscess formation with eventual chronic sclerodermatitis and cicatrization in most rats. Rhabdomyosarcomas were seen in 2 animals. The present study was undertaken to ascertain the rhabdomyoma-producing potential of the dye injected directly into a large muscle mass. The gross and histologic characteristics, the method of spread, and transplantability of induced tumors also were studied. METHODS The Blue VRS (text-fig. 1) used was a commercial sample of food-grade quality. Analyses by paper chromatography showed it to be a single dye containing almost no subsidiary dyes. Sixty Wistar-derived rats from the Food and Drug colony were divided into 4 groups at 10 weeks of age. With sterile techniques, 0. 4 m 1 of a 4 % solution ofBlue VRS in 0. 9 % saline was injected at weekly intervals into the posterior thigh muscles of the right leg of 2 groups of 20 males and 20 females. Ten control animals of each sex received similar injections of saline. Although initial injec-tions were made weekly, it was necessary to depart from this schedule occasionally if a rat temporarily became lame or disabled from the injection.

30|$|Brilliant green (BG) is a <b>triphenylmethane</b> <b>dye</b> {{that has}} been used as {{antiseptic}} and fungicide in fisheries and aquaculture.

However, like two other dyes in the triphenylmethane family (malachite green and crystal violet), BG has generated critical concerns regarding its use in aquaculture, due to its reported toxic effects. It is readily absorbed into fish tissue from water and then causes serious damage to fish internal organs. Also, this dye has mutagenic and carcinogenic effects that affect human health (Dutta 1994; McKay et al. 1985; Krishna and Bhattacharyya 2003).

A 6 -blade mixed flow impeller (6 MFD) showed better removal than a radial 6 -curved blade (6 CB) impeller, at the same agitation speeds, albeit with higher power demand.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{discolouration}} of a <b>triphenylmethane</b> <b>dye</b> (ie methyl violet 10 B) using a gliding arc plasma discharge in humid air. The {{results show that the}} discolouration process is strongly dependent on the initial dye concentration. The maximum discolouration rates are 96. 9 % and 6. 7 % after 60 min for initial dye concentrations of 2. 5 mg L− 1 and 100 mg L− 1, respectively. The incorporation of maghemite (γ-Fe 2 O 3) into a 100 mg L− 1 dye solution increases the discolouration rate under plasma up to 55. 6 %. This improvement of the discolouration efficiency suggests that maghemite acts as a heterogeneous catalyst for Fenton decomposition of H 2 O 2 resulting from the dimerization of HO radicals produced by plasma in the gas phase. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform-infrared(FTIR) characterizations of the catalyst before and after being used 3 -times show that the maghemite nanoparticles are stable in the target-solution exposed to gliding arc plasma and can be therefore reused for further treatments...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: β-Arrestins {{regulate}} G protein-coupled receptor signaling {{as competitive}} inhibitors and protein adaptors. Low molecular weight biased ligands that bind receptors and discriminate between the G protein dependent arm and β-arrestin, clathrin-associated arm of receptor signaling are considered therapeutically valuable {{as a result}} of this distinctive pharmacological behavior.

We show that within minutes of exposure to the cationic <b>triphenylmethane</b> <b>dyes</b> malachite green and brilliant green, tissue culture cells recruit β-arrestins to clathrin scaffolds in a receptor-activation independent manner. In the presence of these compounds, G protein signaling is inhibited, ERK and GSK 3 β signaling are preserved, and the recruitment of the beta 2 -adaptin, AP 2 adaptor complex to clathrin as well as transferrin internalization is reduced.

40|$|SUMMARY: Glutamine {{synthesis}} by Staphylococcus aureus is inhibited by {{the basic}} triphenylmethane dyes crystal violet, methyl green, fuchsin, pararosaniline, brilliant green and malachite green.
