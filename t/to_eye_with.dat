5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always see eye <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, {{there was always the}} factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E

The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel opened a mission station in Pinyin in 1979. During the time Phillips was there, {{there were no other}} mission stations present in the area. Phillips often did not see eye <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> missionaries in Pinyin and wished to build a permanent hospital. In 1908, Phillips received permission to build the hospital that she had requested. Phillips opened St. Agatha's Hospital on 5 February 1909 and it was dedicated on 1 May.|$|E
25|$|Nariakira {{did not see}} eye <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> his father, Shimazu Narioki, or his father’s chief advisor, Zusho Hirosato. Both Narioki and Zusho were wary of the Tokugawa shogunate. Zusho {{also saw}} many {{similarities}} in Nariakira and his grandfather, Shigehide. Shigehide also had {{a great interest in}} Dutch studies as well as scientific and industrial projects, which promptly led to the deterioration of the domain’s financial position. Having worked so hard to rehabilitate and strengthen the treasury of Satsuma, Zusho did not encourage Nariakira’s ambitious and costly program for a military build-up. Narioki and Zusho’s mutual disdain and mistrust for Nariakira led to their endeavoring to isolate Nariakira from Satsuma’s affairs, which entailed withholding or all together ceasing the flow from all sources of information regarding Satsuma’s officials or their dealings with the shogunate.|$|E

The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire all you want and still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't I pay for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness to put me eye <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E

Tovey said Aden {{will always be}} [...] "the love of Belle's life", but she is traumatised by the previous events. Aden witnesses Belle kissing Angelo, which destroys their relationship. Belle is left unsure what to do because she sees Angelo has her [...] "safety net" [...] and Aden [...] "brings out the passion in her". She added that Angelo doesn't compare with her love for Aden, that her relationship with Aden was the [...] "most beautiful" [...] on the programme {{and that she would}} never escape her feelings for Aden. Aden later [...] "jumps on Belle" [...] and tells her they are in love and should be together. Tovey said Belle gets [...] "caught in the moment" [...] and they make love. Tovey was unhappy with the fact that Belle cheated, as she thought it was out of character. When Angelo finds out the truth, he publicly humiliates Belle. He later goes around to her home and becomes violent. Belle is later found badly beaten and although Angelo is not responsible, he gets the blame. Jacobz said the under the circumstances he would have thought the same. He added that Aden [...] "hates" [...] Angelo. After Angelo verbally abused Belle, Aden does not [...] "see eye <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> Angelo" [...] and decides to testify as a witness against Angelo.|$|E

40|$|Phacoemulsification and posterior-chamber-lens {{implantation}} in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> acute angle-closure glaucoma {{compared to}} cataract extraction in their partner eyes. Methods: Twelve patients were included, one with bilateral angle-closure-glaucoma and eleven with unilateral glaucoma. Thirteen <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> an elevated intraocular pressure {{due to an}} angle-closure were treated by phacoemulsification and IOL implantation and compared <b>to</b> 11 partner <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> narrow angle (three previously treated by iridectomy) without intraocular pressure elevation. The average follow-up period was 15. 7 ± 2. 1 months. Results: The average intraocular pressure in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> angle-closure glaucoma was 54. 1 ± 14. 7 mmHg and in the partner eyes 22. 4 ± 8. 6 mmHg preoperatively. Follow-up pressure was 19. 3 ± 2. 0 mmHg in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> angle-closure glaucoma and 18. 8 ± 1. 8 mmHg in the partner eyes. Conclusion: Primary cataract extraction including posterior-chamber-lens implantation into <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> angle-closure-glaucoma reduced intraocular pressure to normal levels, increased visual acuity, and decreased the number of antiglaucomatous drugs. <b>Eyes</b> <b>with</b> angle-closure-glaucoma do not respond differently to phacoemulsification and lens implantation compared <b>to</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> narrow angle without pressure elevation during and after phacoemulsification...|$|R

Subsequently, she made fewer New York appearances than hoped in the early 1970s and was virtually excluded from the Salzburg Festival.

2500|$|Despite their friendship, {{tensions}} between Graham and King emerged in 1958 when the sponsoring committee of a crusade {{which took place}} in San Antonio, Texas on July 25 arranged for Graham to be introduced by that state's segregationist governor, Price Daniel. On July 23, King sent a letter to Graham and informed him that allowing Daniel to speak at a crusade which occurred the night before the state's Democratic Primary [...] "can well be interpreted as your endorsement of racial segregation and discrimination." [...] Graham's advisor, Grady Wilson, replied to King that [...] "even though we do not see eye <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> him on every issue, we still love him in Christ." [...] Though Graham's appearance with Daniel dashed King's hopes of holding joint crusades with Graham in the Deep South, the two still remained friends and King told a Canadian television audience the following year that Graham had taken a [...] "very strong stance against segregation." [...] Graham and King would also come to differ on the Vietnam War. After King's [...] "Beyond Vietnam" [...] speech denouncing U.S. intervention in Vietnam, Graham castigated him and others for their criticism of American foreign policy.|$|E

On Jam Jar (1995), by Fresh Film in association with BBC Four, which aired in the UK, Williams provided her audience with a greater depth of understanding of autism.
