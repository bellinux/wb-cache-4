40|$|Chemical {{reaction}} {{outcomes are}} often rationalized {{on the basis}} of independent analyses of steric and <b>electronic</b> <b>effects.</b> We applied three-dimensional free energy relationships correlating steric and <b>electronic</b> <b>effects</b> to design and optimize a ligand class for the enantioselective Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi propargylation of ketones. The resultant mathematical model describing the steric and electronic parameter relationship is highly reliant on the synergistic interactions of these two effects. Complex chemical reactions can proceedthrough numerous pathways to many dif-ferent products, although synthetic utility generally requires enrichment of a single product, presumably through a preferred low-energy path-way. This selectivity is commonly ascribed to two specific properties: <b>electronic</b> and steric <b>effects.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>effects</b> refer to variations in orbital elec-tron density through bonding or spatial interac-tions (1). An <b>electronic</b> <b>effect</b> is a general term that can include inductive effects, conjugative (resonance) effects, or molecular orbital sym...|$|R

50|$|Heteroatoms like {{fluorine}} and chlorine, can exhibit both inductive (electron-withdrawing) and p-donation <b>electronic</b> <b>effects</b> {{because of}} their high electronegativities and p-electrons. Stabilization then depends on the balance between the two <b>electronic</b> <b>effects.</b> For fluorine, destabilization via induction is dominant and resonance is significantly weaker. While for chlorine, resonance is sufficient to counteract induction so that overall the effect is stabilizing.|$|R
