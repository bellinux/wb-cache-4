60|$|I lost my {{business}} therefore, spent my money, and finished my poem. It was <b>the</b> <b>Pleasures</b> of Melancholy, and was cried {{up to the}} skies by the whole circle. <b>The</b> <b>Pleasures</b> of Imagination, <b>the</b> <b>Pleasures</b> of Hope, and <b>the</b> <b>Pleasures</b> of Memory, though each had placed its author in the first rank of poets, were blank prose in comparison. Our Mrs. Montagu would cry over it from beginning to end. It was pronounced by {{all the members of}} the Literary, Scientific, and Philosophical Society the greatest poem of the age, and all anticipated the noise it would make in the great world. There was not a doubt but the London booksellers would be mad after it, and the only fear of my friends was, that I would make a sacrifice by selling it too cheap.|$|R

5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without <b>the</b> <b>pleasure.</b> Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E

5|$|The White House {{travel office}} controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy of the Clinton administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House Travel Office were fired. This action was unusual because although theoretically staff employees serve at <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of the President and could be dismissed without cause, in practice, such employees usually remain in their posts for many years.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} stylistic {{influence was}} the experimental oeuvre of Kenneth Anger, {{and in particular}} Inauguration of <b>the</b> <b>Pleasure</b> Dome. Noé saw Anger's films in the early 1990s, while promoting the short film Carne, and quickly became a fan. Other influences from experimental cinema included the works of Jordan Belson and Peter Tscherkassky. Noé's favourite film, , was the most prominent influence among mainstream films; Noé {{wanted to become a}} filmmaker after he saw it at the age of seven. Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes and other films which feature hovering overhead shots inspired Noé to make a film largely from such a perspective.|$|E

5|$|Both <b>The</b> <b>Pleasure</b> Garden and The Mountain Eagle were {{produced}} in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich {{in the fall}} of 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the Ötztal Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and influences in the technique and style of German cinema are evident in his early works.|$|E

5|$|Hogarth {{designed}} the series for an original commission by Jonathan Tyers in 1736 {{in which he}} requested a number of paintings to decorate supper boxes at Vauxhall Gardens. Hogarth {{is believed to have}} suggested to Tyers that the supper boxes at Gardens be decorated with paintings as part of their refurbishment; among the works featured when the renovation was completed was Hogarth's picture of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. The originals of Four Times of the Day were sold to other collectors, but the scenes were reproduced at Vauxhall by Francis Hayman, and two of them, Evening and Night, hung at <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> gardens until at least 1782.|$|E

5|$|On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven {{employees}} of the White House Travel Office, causing the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> {{of the president and}} could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.|$|E
5|$|The College of Arms is a {{corporation}} of thirteen heralds, styled Officers in Ordinary. This thirteen {{can be divided}} hierarchically into three distinctive ranks: three Kings of Arms, six Heralds of Arms and four Pursuivants of Arms. There are also presently seven Officers Extraordinary, who take part in ceremonial occasions but {{are not part of}} the College. As members of the Royal Household, the heralds are appointed at <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Earl Marshal. The Officers in Ordinary are appointed by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm, and the Officers Extraordinary by Royal Sign Manual; all appointments are announced in the London Gazette.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pleasure</b> Beach Bridge is a movable Warren through-truss {{bridge in}} Bridgeport, Connecticut. Completed in 1927, it {{functioned as a}} toll bridge until the Great Depression, when it was {{transferred}} to the city of Bridgeport. Its service life came to an end after it was badly damaged by fire in 1996, cutting off access to Pleasure Beach. In the decade following the fire, several bonds to fund a new bridge were proposed, but ultimately fell through. Pleasure Beach has become the subject of debate, whether it will become an undisturbed protected salt marsh or be revitalized. An alternate method of access via water taxi service, first made possible by a grant in 2009, was not realized until 2013.|$|E

5|$|The Sydney Hotel {{was built}} within the gardens. It {{later became the}} Holburne Museum. The {{original}} design for the hotel, prepared by Thomas Baldwin in 1794, was a two-storey building which would serve <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> gardens. After Baldwin was bankrupted his design for the hotel was not implemented. Instead a three-storey building was designed by Charles Harcourt Masters. The foundation stone was laid in 1796 and the building was ready by 1799. Visitors entered the gardens through the Hotel. Projecting {{from the rear of}} the building at first floor level was a conservatory and a semi-circular orchestra with a wide covered loggia below. Two semi-circular rows of supper boxes projected from the sides of the building.|$|E
