500|$|McCain was a {{supporter}} of the Euromaidan protests against the elected Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government, and appeared in Independence Square in Kiev in December 2013. Following the overthrow of Yanukovych and subsequent 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces, saying the sanctions imposed against Russia were not enough. [...] In 2014, McCain led the opposition to the appointments of Colleen Bell, Noah Mamet, and George Tsunis to the ambassadorships in Hungary, Argentina, and Norway, respectively, arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising. [...] Unlike many Republicans, McCain supported the release and contents of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014, saying [...] "The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> entitled to it, nonetheless." [...] He added that the CIA's practices following the September 11 attacks had [...] "stained our national honor" [...] while doing [...] "much harm and little practical good" [...] and that [...] "Our enemies act without conscience. We must not." [...] He opposed the Obama administration's December 2014 decision to normalize relations with Cuba.|$|E
500|$|McCain did join Bush for a {{few days}} of {{appearances}} in late October, emphasizing, {{in the wake of the}} October 12 USS Cole bombing, his belief that Bush was a better choice than Democratic Party nominee Al Gore to deal with international security threats. [...] Bush aide Scott McClellan later described the joint appearances by saying, [...] "The tension was palpable. The two were cordial, but McCain would get that forced smile on his face whenever they were together." [...] McCain also campaigned for about forty Republican House of Representatives candidates, and was credited by National Republican Congressional Committee chair Tom Davis with keeping the House in Republican hands. [...] McCain would state that he voted for Bush on November 7 (although years later several witnesses would relate that McCain and his wife Cindy had both said at a dinner party that they had not). [...] When the November presidential election continued on in indecision during the Florida election dispute, McCain stayed generally quiet in an atmosphere of extreme partisanship, though he did appear on CBS' Face the Nation to say, [...] "I think the nation is growing a little weary of this. [...] We're not in a constitutional crisis, but <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> growing weary, and whoever wins is having a rapidly diminishing mandate, to say the least." [...] Once Bush was declared the winner and inaugurated in January 2001, McCain's battles with him would resume, with a significant amount of lingering bitterness between the two men and their staffs over what had transpired during the course of 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Current U.S. {{policy is}} not working, {{as the level of}} {{violence}} in Iraq is rising and the government is not advancing national reconciliation.

Our ability to respond to other international crises is constrained. A majority of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> soured on the war. This level of expense is not sustainable over an extended period, especially when progress is not being made.

2500|$|On 16 September 2001, at Camp David, U.S. {{president}} George W.

[...] And the American people must be patient. [...] I'm going to be patient." [...] Shortly after, the White House said the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. [...] It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adorno's {{reputation}} as a musicologist has been in steady decline since his death. [...] His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the Second Viennese School in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him {{to fall out of}} favour. [...] The distinguished American scholar Richard Taruskin declared Adorno to be [...] "preposterously over-rated." [...] The eminent pianist and critic Charles Rosen saw Adorno's book The Philosophy of New Music as [...] "largely a fraudulent presentation, a work of polemic that pretends to be an objective study." [...] Even a fellow Marxist such as the historian and jazz critic Eric Hobsbawm saw Adorno's writings as containing [...] "some of the stupidest pages ever written about jazz". The British philosopher Roger Scruton saw Adorno as producing [...] "reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine." [...] Irritation with Adorno's tunnel vision started even while he was alive. [...] He may have championed Schoenberg, but the composer notably failed to return the compliment: [...] "I {{have never been able to}} bear the fellow [...] It is disgusting, by the way, how he treats Stravinsky." [...] On the other hand, the scholar Slavoj Žižek has written a foreword to Adorno's In Search of Wagner, where Žižek attributes an [...] "emancipatory impulse" [...] to the same book, although Žižek suggests that fidelity to this impulse demands [...] "a betrayal of the explicit theses of Adorno's Wagner study." ...|$|E

60|$|But the {{argument}} drawn from that comparison between our own conduct {{when we were}} creating our debt, and {{the conduct of the}} Americans while they have been creating their debt--during the twelve months from April 1, 1861, to March 31, 1862, let us say--is hardly a fair argument. We, at any rate, knew how to tax ourselves--if only the taxes might be forthcoming. We were already well used to the work; and a minister with a willing House of Commons had all his material ready to his hand. It has not been so in the United States. The difficulty has not been with the people who should pay the taxes, but with the minister and the Congress which {{did not know how to}} levy them. Certainly not as yet have those who are now criticising the doings on the other side of the water a right to say that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> unwilling to make personal sacrifices for the carrying out of this war. No sign has as yet been shown of an unwillingness on the part of the people to be taxed. But wherever a sign could be given, it has been given on the other side. The separate States have taxed themselves very heavily for the support of the families of the absent soldiers. The extra allowances made to maimed men, amounting generally to twenty-four shillings a month, have been paid by the States themselves, and have been paid almost with too much alacrity.|$|E
60|$|Three {{months have}} passed--three long months of tossing waters and ever-present winds. The Harpoon, shaping her course for Norfolk, in the United States, had made but a poor passage of it. She {{got into the}} {{south-east}} trades, and all went well till they made St. Paul's Rocks, where they were detained by the doldrums and variable winds. Afterwards she passed into the north-east trades, and then, further north, met a series of westerly gales, that ultimately drove her to the Azores, just as her crew were getting very short of water and provisions. And here Augusta bid farewell to her friend the Yankee skipper; for the whaler that had saved her life and Dick's, after refitting once more, set sail upon its almost endless voyage. She stood on the breakwater at Ponta Delgada, and watched the Harpoon drop past. The men recognized her and cheered lustily, and Captain Thomas took off his hat; for the entire ship's company, down to the cabin-boy, were head-over-heels in love with Augusta; and the extraordinary offerings that they had made her on parting, most of them connected {{in some way or}} other with that noble animal the whale, sufficed to fill a good-sized packing-case. Augusta waved her handkerchief to them in answer; but she could not see much of them, because her eyes were full of tears. She had had quite enough of the Harpoon, and yet she was loth so say farewell to her; for her days on board had in many respects been restful and happy ones; they had given her space and time to brace herself up before she plunged once more into the struggle of active life.
