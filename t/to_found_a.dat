5|$|Because of {{religious}} and ethnic discrimination, Roman Catholics in the late 19th century were regularly excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism could be compatible and wanted <b>to</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> society to encourage men {{to be proud of}} their American-Catholic heritage.|$|E

5|$|Ifs origins can {{be traced}} to 1948 and 1949, when Raymond Palmer founded two {{magazines}} while working at Ziff-Davis in Chicago: Fate and Other Worlds. Fate published articles about occult and supernatural events, while Other Worlds was a science-fiction magazine. The two were sufficiently successful to attract the notice of James L. Quinn, a New York publisher. When Ziff-Davis moved to New York City in late 1950, Paul W. Fairman, a prolific writer, went with them, and was soon in touch with Quinn, who decided <b>to</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> pair of magazines modelled after Palmer's. One was a nonfiction magazine entitled Strange; the other was If.|$|E

Yuknoom Ch'eenII then reinstated Balaj Chan K'awiil upon the throne of DosPilas as his vassal. He thereafter served as a loyal ally of Calakmul.|$|E

5|$|Seibal {{underwent}} a revival in the Late Classic with {{an expansion of}} occupation linked to the great city of Tikal. About AD 650 new inhabitants moved into the city in order <b>to</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> new kingdom.

Any monuments raised by the Late Classic rulers responsible for this renewed occupation were defaced when the city suffered a catastrophic defeat in the 8th century AD.|$|E
5|$|The Guthrie Theater, {{opened in}} 1963, was {{the brainchild of}} Sir Tyrone Guthrie, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> {{regional}} theater without the commercial constraints of Broadway. The high cost of staging Broadway productions meant that shows had to be immediately successful and return a high amount of revenue. This discouraged innovation and experimentation, and made it difficult to stage important works of literature. These ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the New York Times, and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were eager to support the idea. The theater served as a prototype for other resident non-profit theaters.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> {{national organization}} was likely {{the result of}} several factors. First, the mainstream trade unions were increasingly reformist and centralized. Second, the localists gained confidence from their involvement in the dock workers' strike in Hamburg in late 1896 and early 1897. Third, loss of membership (for example, the Berlin metal workers rejoined the DMV in 1897) convinced the localists {{of the need for}} action.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms. In 1496, King Henry VII of England, following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration, commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic. Cabot sailed in 1497, {{five years after the}} European discovery of America, but he made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland, and, mistakenly believing (like Christopher Columbus) that he had reached Asia, there was no attempt <b>to</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> colony.

5|$|Walter {{revived the}} scheme of his predecessor, Baldwin of Forde, <b>to</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> church in Canterbury that would be secular and not monastic. He promised that the new foundation's canons {{would not be allowed}} to vote in archiepiscopal {{elections}} nor would the body of Saint Thomas Becket ever be moved to the new church, but the monks of his cathedral chapter were suspicious and appealed to the papacy. The dispute from the time of Baldwin of Forde flared up again, with the papacy supporting the monks and the king supporting the archbishop. Finally, Pope Innocent III ruled for the monks and ordered Walter to destroy what had been built.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{teenagers}} who {{were interested in}} Wicca had begun hanging around at the Warlock Shop, and they too were initiated into the Traditionalist Gwyddoniaid, after gaining parental permission. Proceeding through the outer court of Buczynski's coven, they eventually hived off to form their own coven, the Children of Branwen, in December 1972, with prominent members including Robert Carey, Denny Sargent, and Karen and Eddie Chiecho. Buczynski initially attended some of the group's meetings, in order to instruct these students in the Craft, but soon found his time preoccupied with his own primary coven, leaving the coven under the control of high priestess Kay Smith. She would subsequently go on <b>to</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> Welsh Traditionalist coven for adults, leaving the position of high priestess to Melda Tamarack.|$|E
5|$|At the Restoration the Privy Council {{established}} {{a force of}} {{an unknown number of}} infantry regiments and a few troops of horse. The Commonwealth fortresses were abandoned, but garrisons were placed in Edinburgh, Stirling, Dumbarton and Blackness castles. There were attempts <b>to</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> national militia on the English model. The standing army was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East. Units included a regiment of foot guards, later known as the Scots Guards and Le Regiment of Douglas, formed and serving in France since 1633, it returned, eventually became the Royal Regiment of Foot. Pikemen became less important in the late seventeenth century and after the introduction of the socket bayonet, a process complete by 1702, disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. Three troops of Scots Dragoons were raised in 1678 and another three were added to make The Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons in 1681. On the eve of the Glorious Revolution the standing army in Scotland was about 3,000 men in various regiments and another 268 veterans in the major garrison towns, at an annual cost of about £80,000. After the Glorious Revolution the Scots were drawn into King William II's continental wars, beginning with the Nine Years' War in Flanders (1689–97).|$|E
