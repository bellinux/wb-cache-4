40|$|There {{are some}} {{factors that can}} be taken to gain a success of English {{instruction}} curriculum. One of them is a textbook. Textbooks have appeared to play important role in teaching learning process, as they are the main sources of material for language teachers. If nit chosen appropriately and evaluated properly it can have a very negative effect on learning. Writers and publishers started competing to produce new textbooks when the new curriculum is released in our educational program. Teacher and student may find them in certain parts, if not all parts, irrelevant to the curriculum or not satisfactorily complete. Then they may try <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>other</b> <b>instructions</b> in order to adapt to the curriculum. Although all the competences have important roles, teacher as the component has an important role to teach English as second or foreign language, especially linguistic {{this is one of the}} competences that must be mastered by the student to get English very well. Because linguistic competence is one of competence in Competency Based Curriculum (CBC), it can show the quality of any textbook as it refers to the ability of applying and understanding the elements of grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and spelling in the text properly. This study is designed to obtain answer of whether the textbook meets the criteria of “CBC” in term of linguistic competence. Research design used in this thesis is descriptive because it was concerned the analysis of the content. The subject in this research is Textbook published by National Education Department. In order to collect the data, the writer utilized documentation. Based on Competence based Curriculum (CBC), there are 41 items of linguistic competence that must appear in a textbook. Therefore, a good textbook should contain them. The analysis of the textbook published by National Educational Department showed that several items were not presented by the writer. This textbook provides 29 items. It means that this textbook provides only 70. 73...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} study investigates {{the hypothesis that}} listeners comprehend more effectively {{in a foreign language}} when they are aware of and consciously use listening strategies and attempts to verify this hypothesis in the case of Japanese language education. The research method for the study consisted of an experiment consisting of 10 Japanese listening comprehension tests <b>given</b> <b>to</b> two groups of Japanese language learners - one group of beginner level learners and another group of intermediate level learners - with each group divided into an experimental group and a control group. For all 10 tests, the experimental group was given continuous awareness training of listening strategies while the control group was <b>given</b> <b>other</b> <b>instruction</b> not related with listening strategies for the same amount of time. The study found that effectiveness of listening strategy awareness was greater for Japanese language learners at the higher proficiency level (intermediate) when compared to lower proficiency level students (beginner). The study also found a correlation between learners: LI listening strategy use and L 2 listening strategy use, suggesting some transfer of listening strategies between learners' first and second language...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recently we have {{reported}} the syntheses {{of a variety}} of silsesquioxanes including laddersiloxanes and cage silsesquioxanes. As a precursor of these compounds, cyclotetrasiloxanetetraols are very useful. Several groups reported the syntheses of alkyl-substituted all-cis-cyclotetrasiloxanesilanolate that can be converted to all-cis cyclotetrasiloxanetetraols. In addition, there was a report of the isomerization of phenyl-substituted all-cis-tetraphenylcyclotetrasiloxanetetraol by hydrochloric acid <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>other</b> three stereoisomers. With an aim to elucidate that the reaction is commonly applied or not to other cyclic silanols, we synthesized all-cis isobutyl cyclic silanol. With investigating the reaction condition, we could obtain this cyclic silanol in better yield than previously published methods. Additionally, stereoisomerization reaction with hydrochloric acid was investigated. With a slightly longer reaction time, isomerization reaction was observed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>other</b> stereoisomers. This is the second example of the stereoisomerization of cyclic silanols...|$|R
