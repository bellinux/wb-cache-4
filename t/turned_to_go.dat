25|$|On the {{following}} day at 7:15a.m., Borel arrived {{at the home of}} his friend Alan Guillemette. When Guillemette's mother opened the door Eric asked her to wake him. The two had a lengthy discussion in the garden, and apparently Eric wanted something from Guillemette, but when he declined and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back into the house, Eric shot him in the back, mortally wounding him. From 7:30a.m. onwards, Borel started shooting people at random. No one grew suspicious of his rifle until he started his rampage, since it was hunting season and the sight of rifles outside was to be expected.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{read the}} words of [...] "And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh," [...] to teach that Moses saw Pharaoh's ministers turning to one another, as if {{inclined}} to believe the words of Moses.

2500|$|According {{to another}} story, a farmer in Bavaria took a consecrated Host from Mass to his house, believing {{that it would}} give {{him and his family}} good fortune. However he was plagued by the feeling that what he had done was very wrong and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to the church to confess his sin. As he turned, the Host flew from his hand, floated in the air and landed on the ground. He searched for it, but he could not see it. He went back, {{accompanied}} by many villagers and the priest, who bent to pick up the Host, having seen it from some distance off. It again flew up into the air, floated, and fell to the ground and disappeared. The Bishop was informed and he came to the site and bent to pick up the Host. Again it flew into the air, remained suspended for an extended time, fell to the ground and disappeared.|$|E

2500|$|In stormy but moderating {{conditions}} on Monday, 22November1971, fifty men were searching with helicopter support. In {{the morning the}} Braemar MRT, travelling from the south, reached Corrour Bothy only to find it unoccupied. It was at about 10:30 that Davidson was spotted from a helicopter. The Whirlwind helicopter had been dispatched from RAF Leuchars in Fife and the pilot attempted to fly up the line of Glen Shee but turbulence meant he had to reduce airspeed to [...] with groundspeed less than walking pace. At Pools of Dee he {{was reduced to a}} hover and was unable to ascend to the plateau so he took a wide detour to Glenmore Lodge from where the crew was asked to make an airborne check of various shelters, without any delay for refuelling. At Curran shelter {{there was nothing to be}} seen but as they <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Glenmore Lodge they spotted what they thought was a red tent.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1800, McGready {{was joined}} at Red River by several area Presbyterian ministers, {{including}} William Hodge, John Rankin (whom McGready had recently appointed the minister for the Gasper River congregation), and the brothers, William and John McGee, the latter a Methodist minister who, some years later, wrote his {{account for the}} Methodist Missionary Magazine. [...] His narrative painted a vivid picture of the revival’s beginnings: [...] “All was silent until Monday, {{the last day of}} the feast. … [...] While Mr. Hodge was preaching, a woman in the East end got an uncommon blessing, broke through order, and shouted for some time and then sat down in silence." [...] McGee continued, relating that most of the ministers were already gathered outside the meeting house while the people remained seated inside, unwilling to leave, when his brother, William, “felt such a power come on him that he quit his seat and sat down in the floor of the pulpit." [...] John McGee began to tremble as weeping erupted through the congregation. [...] The woman in the east end began to shout again and McGee started toward her just as someone reminded him that his Presbyterian hosts were “much for order” and would not “hear this confusion; go back and be quiet." [...] McGee <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and was “near falling” when he changed his mind and “went through the house shouting and exhorting with all possible ecstasy and energy." [...] Using the term that came to be associated with the revival phenomenon of collapsing in a state of physical helplessness, McGee continued: [...] “The floor was soon covered with the slain; their screams for mercy pierced the heavens.” ...|$|E
