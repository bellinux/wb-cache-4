The process is able to effectively machine a large surface area on the TiN/Si 3 N 4 nanocomposite ceramics with good surface quality and low cost. The effects of machining conditions on the material removal rate, and surface roughness have been investigated. The surface microstructures machined by the new process are examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the TiN/Si 3 N 4 nanocomposite ceramics is removed by melting, evaporation and <b>thermal</b> <b>spall.</b> The experimental results indicate that the cutting speed (material removal rate), the surface roughness and the width of the slit of cutting test material significantly depend on experiment parameters. An appropriate servo voltage, a short pulse-on time, and a short pulse-off time, which are normally associated with a high cutting speed, have little effect on the surface roughness.

40|$|The {{response}} of high-performance concrete (HPC) to rapid heating due to exposure to fire with air temperatures exceeding 700 °C is analyzed. The analysis focuses on coupled thermal-mechanical-transport processes at the mesoscale {{in the first}} 10 minutes of exposure during which heating rates {{on the order of}} 10 °C/minute and temperature gradients on the order of 15 °C/cm are involved. The driving forces for damage considered are thermomechanical stresses and internal pore pressure resulting from the expansion of water within the material. The HPC is modeled as a two-phase composite consisting of a cementitious matrix and a population of quartz aggregate particles. Mesostructures with aggregate sizes of 400 - 1600 μm and aggregate volume fractions of 10 - 30 % are considered. To capture the development of stresses and pore pressure, the cementitious matrix is modeled using a coupled thermal-mechanical-transport formulation and the aggregate is modeled using a thermal-mechanical formulation. Simulations show that the composition of the mesostructures significantly influences the time and spatial distribution of damage. Materials with smaller aggregate sizes and the lower effective permeability are found to exhibit more rapid property degradation. The time to failure and depth of <b>thermal</b> <b>spall</b> are quantified as functions of structural variables.

Minor additions of silicon have been found to appreciably increase the oxidation resistance of plasma-sprayed NiCoCrAlY coatings on a single crystal nickel-base superalloy. Increasing the chromium content of MCrAlY coatings substantially increases the resistance to acidic (Na 2 SO 4 -SO 3) hot corrosion at temperatures of about 1300 F (704 C) but gives no significant improvement beyond contemporary coatings in the range of 1600 F (871 C). Surface enrichment of MCrAlY coatings with silicon also gives large increases in resistance to acidic hot corrosion in the 1300 F region.

40|$|Laser {{concrete}} scabbling is {{the process}} by which the surface layer of concrete may be removed {{through the use of a}} low power density laser beam. The main aim of this investigation was to establish relationships between laser interaction time and volume removal for a wide range of material compositions, including different w/b ratios, binder compositions (OPC/PFA), aggregate/binder ratios and coarse aggregate sizes. The results show that 25 % replacement of ordinary Portland cement with pulverised fuel ash and/or a reduced water/binder ratio improves the efficiency of scabbling of cement pastes. Mortars and cement pastes were seen to scabble at a constant rate, whereas concretes experienced a peak rate, after which volume removal reduced dramatically. Basalt aggregate concrete was less susceptible to laser scabbling than limestone aggregate concrete. The effects of composition on the mechanisms which drive laser scabbling are discussed. It is suggested that pore pressure spalling governs behaviour in cement pastes, and <b>thermal</b> stress <b>spalling</b> is more dominant in mortar specimens.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of heat and}} moisture transport in concrete {{is critical to the}} {{development of}} pore pressures, which are thought to be a primary driver of damage and <b>thermal</b> <b>spalling</b> in concrete exposed to elevated temperatures. In the light of uncertainty and variation in the value of certain material properties and constitutive or parametric descriptions found in the literature, various sets of numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the significance of the intrinsic permeability, the evolution of permeability related to temperature and the relative permeability of the fluid phases as functions of saturation in predicting and analysing the behaviour of concrete drying under normal, low temperature, isothermal conditions and under exposure to very high temperature conditions as might be encountered during a fire. A fully coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical finite element model for concrete was employed with the permeability values and parametric functions altered in the model as required. Results of mass loss and the development of gas pressures with time were considered in relation to the potential for the occurrence of damage and <b>thermal</b> <b>spalling,</b> which is thought to be variously related to these processes. The analyses showed that permeability, and its variation with temperature, are very important in controlling the predicted behaviour at both low and high temperatures. Most significant of all were the relationships chosen to define the relative permeabilities. These were shown to strongly control the results of analyses of both low and high temperature problems and to potentially imply apparently different permeability values for the same concrete...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A brief {{review of}} the problem of calculating the {{evolution}} of the distributions of pore pressure and thermal stresses in rapidly heated concrete is presented. The difficulties caused by order-of-magnitude jumps in permeability as a function of temperature and in water content as a function of pore pressure are discussed in some detail and the conditions for the movement of the interface between the saturated concrete and unsaturated concrete are established. Some aspects of the numerical difficulties caused by the jumps are elucidated. A weak point in explaining the explosive spalling of rapidly heated high-strength concrete by pore pressures is pointed out and clarified. It is argued that the main driving force of the explosive <b>thermal</b> <b>spalling</b> must be the release of the stored energy due to the thermal stresses, which requires fracture mechanics. Finally, a simplified analysis of the pore pressure distribution, based on the calculation of the movement of the fronts of drying and wetting, is outlined and some other relevant literature is briefly reviewed. ...|$|E

Performing a vulnerability assessment for {{a structure that}} has already sustained damage in an earthquake and is then exposed to fire is therefore of importance. This paper describes a performance-based investigation in which applied loads to a structure are appropriately quantified. To do so, a sequential structural analysis is performed on the Life Safety performance level of a three-story reinforced concrete frame selected from a building. For the analysis to be more realistic, the slab is {{also included in the}} frame analysis through the concept of effective length. The frame is first subjected to an earthquake load with the PGA of 0. 30 g followed by a fire analysis, using the ISO 834 fire curve and the iBMB fire curve. The time needed for the structure weakened by the earthquake to collapse under fire is then calculated. As a benchmark, fire-only analysis is also performed for the undamaged frame. Moreover, the effect of <b>thermal</b> <b>spalling</b> is considered in the slabs. The selected frame is evaluated under various failure criteria such as load capacity, displacement, and rate of displacement. The results show that no failure is observed when the frame is exposed to fire alone, either when using the ISO curve or the iBMB curve under various failure criteria. It is also shown that while the PEF resistance based on load capacity criteria under the ISO curve is around 120 minutes, it reduces to about 95 min under the iBMB curve. However, considering the rate of deflection failure criteria, the PEF resistance is around 103 min and 75 min under the ISO and the iBMB curves, respectively. It is then concluded that in the PEF analysis, the iBMB curve is more compatible with the concept of performance-based design than the ISO curve is. Copyrigh...|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} of replacing metals in aircraft turbine engines with high-temperature polymer matrix composites (PMC's) include weight savings accompanied by strength improvements, reduced part count, and lower manufacturing costs. Successfully integrating high-temperature PMC's into turbine engines requires several long-term characteristics. Resistance to surface erosion is one rarely reported property of PMC's in engine applications because PMC's are generally softer than metals and their erosion resistance suffers. Airflow rates in stationary turbine engine components typically exceed 2. 3 kg/sec at elevated temperatures and pressures. In engine applications, {{as shown in}} the following photos, the survivability of PMC components is clearly a concern, especially when engine and component life-cycle requirements become longer. Although very few publications regarding the performance of erosion coatings on PMC's are available particularly in high-temperature applications the use of erosion-resistant coatings to significantly reduce wear on metallic substrates is well documented. In this study initiated by the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field, a low-cost (less than $ 140 /kg) graphite-fiber-reinforced T 650 35 /PMR 15 sheet-molding compound was investigated with various coatings. This sheet-molding compound has been compression molded into many structurally complicated components, such as shrouds for gas turbine inlet housings and gearboxes. Erosion coatings developed for PMC s in this study consisted of a two-layered system: a bondcoat sprayed onto a cleaned PMC surface, followed by an erosion-resistant, hard topcoat sprayed onto the bondcoat as shown in following photomicrograph. Six erosion coating systems were evaluated for their ability to withstand harsh thermal cycles, erosion resistance (ASTM G 76 83 "Standard Practice for Conducting Erosion Tests by Solid Particle Impingement Using Gas Jets") using Al 2 O 3, and adhesion to the graphite fiber polyimide composite (ASTM D 4541 95 "Pull Off Strength of Coatings"). Glenn and Allison Advanced Development Company collaborated to optimize erosion coatings for gas turbine fan and compressor applications. All the coating systems survived aggressive <b>thermal</b> cycling without <b>spalling.</b> During erosion tests (see the final photo), the most promising coating systems tested had Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr and WC-Co as the hard topcoats. In all cases, these coating systems performed significantly better than that with a TiN hard topcoat. When material depth (thickness) loss is considered, the Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr and WC-Co coating systems provided, on average, an erosion resistance 8. 5 times greater than that for the uncoated PMR 15 /T 650 35 composite. Similarly, Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr and WC-Co coating systems adhered to the PMC substrate during tensile tests significantly better than systems containing a TiN topcoat. Differences in topcoats of Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr and WC-Co were determined by considering issues such as cost and environmental impact. The preferred erosion-resistant coating system for PMR 15 /T 650 35 has WC-Co as the hard topcoat. This system provides the following benefits in comparison to the coating system with Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr topcoat: lower powder material cost (15 to 20 percent), environmentally friendly materials (Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr is hazardous), and higher deposition yield (10 to 15 percent), which results in less waste...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{ceramics}} {{have been}} widely used in modern industry for their excellent physical and mechanical properties, and they are difficult to machine owing to their high hardness and brittleness. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is the appropriate process for machining engineering ceramics provided they are electrically conducting. However, the electrical resistivity of the popular engineering ceramics is higher, and there has been no research on the relationship between the EDM parameters and the electrical resistivity of the engineering ceramics. This paper investigates the effects of the electrical resistivity and EDM parameters such as tool polarity, pulse interval, and electrode material, on the ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic's EDM performance, in terms of the material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear ratio (EWR), and surface roughness (SR). The results show that the electrical resistivity and the EDM parameters have the great influence on the EDM performance. The ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic with the electrical resistivity up to 3410 Ω·cm can be effectively machined by EDM with the copper electrode, the negative tool polarity, and the shorter pulse interval. Under most machining conditions, the MRR increases, and the SR decreases with the decrease of electrical resistivity. Moreover, the tool polarity, and pulse interval affect the EWR, respectively, and the electrical resistivity and electrode material have a combined effect on the EWR. Furthermore, the EDM performance of ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic with the electrical resistivity higher than 687 Ω·cm is obviously different from that with the electrical resistivity lower than 687 Ω·cm, when the electrode material changes. The microstructure character analysis of the machined ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic surface shows that the ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic is removed by melting, evaporation and <b>thermal</b> <b>spalling,</b> and the material from the working fluid and the graphite electrode can transfer to the workpiece surface during electrical discharge machining ZnO/Al 2 O 3 ceramic...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{different}} quality of alumina are taken along with different metals {{as the starting}} materials. Different compositions are formulated taking single or combination of metals which are mixed with phenol formaldehyde resin and pressed with a specific pressure of 2000 kg/cm 2. The bricks are cured at 240 °C for 12 hours. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated. Also the bricks are fired at 1100 °C in reducing atmosphere. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated and correlated with the mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Based on these findings carbon bearing plates are made {{with the addition of}} carbon black or carbon black and graphite. The addition is restricted up to 5 %. Properties are evaluated and correlated with mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Plates containing aluminium metal shows superior thermal and thermo-mechanical properties than silicon metal containing Al 2 O 3 slide plates. However plate containing metal in combination has the best thermal and thermo-mechanical properties. Fused alumina based plates has comparatively superior properties for all grade of metal addition. Plate containing both carbon black and graphite flake was having comparatively efficient properties in carbon bonded slide plates. To improve the thermal shock resistance, corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance, along with mechanical properties, in situ synthesised plasma fused ZrO 2 -SiC was incorporated in the Al 2 O 3 –C slide gate plates. Apart from mechanical properties, <b>thermal</b> <b>spalling</b> resistance, erosion resistance and oxidation resistance of these slide plates were compared with the normal ones. The metal bonded slide gate plates are fired in 1600 °C in nitrogen atmosphere for forming nitride bonds. These nitride bonded slide plates were giving significant enhancement in properties and it can be a suitable substitution for all the carbon bonded slide gate plates...|$|E
40|$|The {{by-products}} of coke dissolution in iron {{are primarily}} calcium aluminate minerals known as coke ash. These minerals are unreactive with the iron bath and can therefore deposit onto the blast furnace hearth refractories when they form below the iron-slag interface. This study {{was focused on}} understanding the interactions between these coke ash minerals and blast furnace hearth refractories. Improved understanding of these interactions may have implications for the campaign life of the blast furnace hearth refractory materials. It {{was found that the}} aluminosilicate refractory followed the linear rate law and the alumina carbon refractory corresponded to the logarithmic rate law. Thermodynamic modelling was conducted and compared with the spot analysis results and micrographs to determine the phases likely to have formed. It was found that the formation of gehlenite (Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7) and anorthite (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8) were more likely in the reactions with the aluminosilicate refractory due to the higher silicon content in the refractory. This corresponds with the observation of this refractory following the linear rate law which is typical of a material which forms a non-protective reaction layer with high porosity or forms liquid phase reaction products. The rates of reaction were found to follow an Arrhenius relationship, demonstrating temperature dependence for the reactions between both hearth refractories and the calcium aluminates. The reaction rate was also observed to increase with the calcium content as predicted by Fick’s 1 st law of Diffusion. The Kirkendall effect was demonstrated via an inert wire test indicating net mass transport of material into the refractory materials from the calcium aluminates. This suggests that the active species responsible for most the reactions observed was the calcium ion. Detailed analysis using thermodynamic data was carried out to determine the possible reactions between the calcium aluminates and the refractory minerals. The formation of low liquidus temperature phases (anorthite and gehlenite) and the possible formation of liquid oxide phase were determined to increase the rate of refractory wear and limit the ability of the refractories to form a protective reaction layer. The formation of grossite (CaAl 4 O 7) and hibonite (CaAl 2 O 19) was found to make the refractory more susceptible to structural and <b>thermal</b> <b>spalling</b> due to the increased stress in the reaction layer cause by the volume change and variation in thermal expansion coefficients of the reaction products...|$|E
40|$|A {{broad range}} of {{commercial}} and experimental grades of ceramics and ceramic composites was tested in various model tests and simplified component tests. The tests were done to establish important microstructural features, friction and wear mechanisms. Important tribological systems used in the tests included face seals, abrasive-waterjet nozzles and hybrid bearings. The importance of mechanical and physical properties at the micro-level has been highlighted in the work, as they play vital roles in the tribology of ceramics and are less commonly investigated than the bulk properties. Novel ceramic whisker composites were produced by hot-isostatic-pressing. The composites {{were based on a}} silicon nitride matrix reinforced with silicon carbide whiskers. The matrix of silicon nitride showed high strength and fracture toughness. But the composites showed no improvements in the bulk mechanical properties when compared with the matrix. This was mainly due to impurities in the whisker batch, causing defects and lower fracture toughness. A new type of silicon carbide material was made dense using liquid-phase sintering, and its wear behaviour was established and compared with conventionally solid-state sintered silicon carbides. The presence of grain boundary phases was both an advantage and a disadvantage regarding wear rates. At high wear rates the grain boundary phase limits the severity, probably due to crack deflection of the micro-fractures that occur. However, in mild wear the limited high-temperature properties of the grain boundary phases can be a disadvantage. Monolithic ceramics and composites with similar mechanical and physical properties to the bulk showed dramatically different wear behaviour in the tests. A newly developed, more homogeneous grade of whisker reinforced alumina showed superior wear resistance to the other monolithic ceramics and composites that were considered. A high-speed abrasive-waterjet test was developed in the work for wear testing, and was used to investigate the resistance of ceramics to thermal wear. The wear was caused by <b>thermal</b> <b>spalling,</b> oxidation, creep and plastic deformation. Abrasive-waterjet tests were done at low inclination angles, and newly commercialized machines were used. The tests highlighted the influence of thermal wear in the mixing nozzle for the abrasive and the waterjet, and the thermal mechanisms present while machining engineering ceramics. It was previously not known that an abrasive waterjet creates a thermal zone when machining ceramics at the wear front and in the mixing nozzles. The temperatures reached in the wear zone of the test specimens were at least 1280 ° C for the garnet abrasive, and 2050 ° C for the alumina abrasive. In scratch testing with diamond tips the presence of four different wear regimes was established for ceramics. On the tested materials a transition was seen from entirely ductile deformation at low loads, towards catastrophic brittle fractures at high loads. In scratch testing some materials, such as a hot-isostatic-pressed silicon nitride composite, showed much higher resistance to the initiation of brittle fracture. Ceramic composites reinforced with long fibres were studied to rank their sensitivity to particle impact. The test showed that composites with silicon carbide spheres on the surface were more resistant to the impact of abrasive particles. The spheres were present from the manufacturing process (chemical vapour infiltration). A study of thrust bearings was performed to compare all-steel bearings with hybrid ones. The hybrid bearing was of the same type as the all-steel one except the balls were of silicon nitride. The influence of contaminants in the bearings was investigated for fairly soft micron-sized (0. 1 - 5. my. m titania) and macro-sized (75 100. my. m quartz) ceramic contaminants. The hybrid bearing showed greatly superior performance when contaminants were present compared to the traditional all-steel type of bearing. It was shown that it is even possible to reduce friction and wear in a hybrid bearing system by the introduction of micron-sized titania particles...|$|E
