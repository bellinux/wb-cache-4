40|$|Scientific studies {{state that}} a {{considerable}} {{part of the}} economic value of crop plant production should {{be attributed to the}} free services of pollinating insects. Such calculations are available for several EU and North American countries, and the present paper evaluates the value of pollination services to 19 important Polish crop plants. It is estimated that the market value of 19 entomogamous crops reaches the sum of approx. 7. 5 billion <b>PLN</b> (<b>thousand</b> million) (approx. 1. 8 billion EUR), 39 % of this may be attributed to the insect activities, the most important being bees (the service value of approx. 2. 5 billion PLN/ 0. 6 billion EUR) and dipterans (almost 0. 3 billion PLN/ 74 billion EUR). The paper discusses also the challenges and pitfalls of similar estimations and the need for conservation actions directed on crop plant pollinators...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} was to {{determine}} the feasibility and advisability of the use of secondary filters applied before discharge of wastewater into the ground {{in the context of the}} fulfillment of the conditions of the current Regulation of the Minister of Environment of 18 November 2014 on the conditions to be met during the discharge of wastewater into the water or the ground and on substances particularly harmful to the aquatic environment. Due to expected in practice, an application and popularity, as compared variants, reactors having a very simple construction were used. The average values of removal of BOD 5, COD and total suspended solids for three secondary filters technologies: biological trickling filter with natural ventilation, sand filter and nonwoven filter were compared. Additionally, as a fourth option a simple mathematical model has been presented. This model allows to estimate of BOD 5 at the outflow from biological trickling filter and to verify the empirical data. Despite a large usefulness, it is rarely used in our country. It has been found the possibility of reduction of the infiltration area (surface area after reduction is 38 – 63 % of the initial value) due to the application of secondary filters. In the case of a high initial demand of the terrain area for drainage localization the benefit in costs resulting from the reduction (several <b>thousand</b> of <b>PLN)</b> or may even significantly exceed the cost of buying and installing a cheap secondary filter. In addition, reduction the occupied area of the lot (in extreme cases up to 100 m 2) by using the secondary filter allows to use the unoccupied space for other purposes, and thus gives additional economic advantage...|$|R

Common questionnaire was implemented in 8 European countries: Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Spain, Denmark. Poland’s research was conducted by Warsaw Ecological Economics Centre in 2004 – 2006. The monetary indicators can be used in decisive processes in health care and environmental protection sectors. Taking into account first Polish experiences in valuation of life year and trends in development of valuation methods, some directions for future research in this field have been outlined. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper determines labour {{consumption}} of {{production in the}} selected fruit farms located on the territory of Łańcut commune. The research {{was carried out in}} the form of a guided survey in thirty fruit farms. For comparative purposes, the investigated farms were divided into area groups and the groups of a varied percentage share of orchards in the total area of AL. The net output balance showed that in the unit view, the highest value of this pro-duction category (8. 88 thousand PLNha- 1 AL) was obtained in farms, which had the lowest land resources i. e. to 5 ha of AL. In case of the economic index of workforce productivity, the most advantageous result was obtained in the biggest objects i. e. of the area above 10 ha, where one man-hour was compensated with the value of the net output at the level of 0. 23 <b>thousand</b> <b>PLN.</b> Key words: fruit production, work inputs, economic work performanc...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} equipment with the machinery park in 30 ecologi-cal farms. Area of arable land {{was accepted as}} a grouping variable. Activities related to inte-gration of our country with the European Union constituted the second aspect of the paper. In order to fully realize the accepted objective of the paper, replacement value of the machinery park, which was at the average 16. 44 <b>thousand</b> <b>PLN.</b> ha- 1 AL, was calculated. Quantitative machinery equipment proved that each examined farm possessed inter alia one tractor and a farm trailer as a transport mean. Characteristics of tractors proved that {{they were at the}} av-erage 16 years old and their average power was of 5. 91 kW. ha- 1 AL. 24 out od 30 responders, declared that they additionally used available subsidies within structural funds both pre-accession and after integration with the EU.

40|$|The {{market of}} organic {{products}} {{is now one}} of the fastest growing sectors of food production in the world and especially in the EU countries. The purpose of this article is to present the status of organic farming in Poland and in the EU countries and to show the impact of these products on sustainable consumption. The article uses data from FiBL, IFOAM and IJHARS. For the presentation of the data we used the time series, cluster analysis, and multidimensional clustering of features and objects. In Europe, in 2012, organic products were produced by approx. 320 thousand manufacturers with a total value of 22. 8 billion euros, of which 250 thousand in the EU and its value amounted to 20. 9 billion euros. In Poland 26 376 organic producers were registered and the value of organic products was valued at 650 <b>thousand</b> <b>PLN.</b> It is crucial for organic farming to invent capital into processing and distribution of organic products. This will provide for continual development and increase the consumer’s awareness of the importance of organic food for both their health and the environment...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of research on the opportunity costs related to establishing nature reserves in four randomly-selected forest districts located in the Mazowieckie Province: Celestynów, Grójec, Płońsk and Zwoleń. Our analysis included calculation of profits forgone by forest districts due to the cessation of timber harvesting in nature reserves and an estimation of work places lost as a result of introduction of new limitations, as well as the expenses incurred by municipalities related to their establishment of forest tax concessions in nature reserves. The establishment of nature reserves incurred losses related to timber harvest of about 246 thousand m 3 during the period of 10 years, which is equivalent to between 4. 1 % and 19. 8 % of the planned timber harvest stated in the forest management plans of the studied forest districts. Total opportunity costs were equal to 25. 5 – 27. 2 million PLN during these 10 years or 1502 – 1605 PLN/ha of nature reserve annually. Annual opportunity costs calculated per unit of forest area were equal to 56 – 60 PLN/ha. The estimated loss in work places was 98. 8 working days annually per 1000 ha of forest area in forest districts. Total expenses incurred by municipalities related to establishment of forest tax concessions in nature reserves reached about 18. 1 <b>thousand</b> <b>PLN</b> in 2011. The research results show that the economic and social costs of nature protection activities are concentrated in their places of their origin. Those costs are felt the most by the owners of the affected forests and local communities. We recommend that possibilities are explored for the introduction of instruments to allow the mitigation of negative effects resulting from restrictions in forest use. Restructuring of forest and nature protection policy, {{to take into account the}} interests of all stakeholders would provide an improved model for the use of these forests...|$|E
