5|$|Following {{the release}} of Funeral (2004), which had been {{recorded}} in an attic studio known as Hotel2Tango, Arcade Fire decided a permanent recording location was necessary. Following their tour in support of Funeral, the band bought <b>the</b> <b>Petite</b> Église in Farnham, Quebec. Being used as a café {{at the time of}} purchase, <b>the</b> <b>Petite</b> Église had once been a church and a Masonic Temple. Once renovation of the church was complete, the band spent the latter half of 2006 recording a majority of the album there. Michael Pärt produced additional recordings in Budapest, recording the Budapest Film Orchestra and a military men's choir. Other sessions included one in New York, where the band recorded along the Hudson River to be near water.|$|E
5|$|At the Tenth Party Congress in March 1921, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin {{declared}} war against <b>the</b> <b>petite</b> bourgeoisie, {{and in particular}} the anarcho-syndicalists, with immediate consequences; the Cheka closed the publishing and printing premises of Golos Truda in Petrograd, as well as the paper's bookstore in Moscow, where all but half a dozen anarchists had been arrested.|$|E
5|$|Bernhard Mahler, the pedlar's {{son and the}} composer's father, {{elevated}} {{himself to}} the ranks of <b>the</b> <b>petite</b> bourgeoisie by becoming a coachman and later an innkeeper.

Bernhard's wife, Marie (Herrmann), gave birth to the first of the couple's 14children, a son Isidor, who died in infancy. Two years later, on 7 July 1860, their second son, Gustav, was born.|$|E

5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} a clay {{model of a}} companion to the École des Beaux-Arts {{in an attempt to}} win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving <b>the</b> <b>Petite</b> École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, {{three years}} after the first performance, Rossini discreetly orchestrated <b>the</b> <b>Petite</b> messe solennelle, partly for fear that others would do it anyway after his death. As he disliked the sound of cathedral boys' choirs, he {{requested}} permission from the pope to perform the work with female voices at a church. When his request was rejected, he demanded that the orchestral version would only be performed after his death. The composer preferred the chamber music version anyway.|$|E

Katniss's stylist, Cinna, is the only person at the Capitol she considers a friend. They are also introduced to the general public, given some training, and evaluated by the Gamemakers.

5|$|Rodin {{was born}} in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police {{department}} clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age ten. Between ages 14 and 17, Rodin attended <b>the</b> <b>Petite</b> École, a school specializing in art and mathematics, where he studied drawing and painting. His drawing teacher, Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections. Rodin still expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite École that he first met Jules Dalou and Alphonse Legros.|$|E
5|$|Rossini {{composed}} <b>the</b> <b>Petite</b> messe solennelle in 1863, 34 {{years after}} his last opera, in Passy, where he spent the last decades of his life. Rossini and his wife entertained a circle of friends, holding samedi soirs for which he composed several pieces of chamber music, often vocal, which the composer called his péchés de vieillesse (sins of old age). The mass was possibly commissioned by Count Alexis Pillet-Will for his wife Louise to whom it is dedicated, but the musicologist Nancy P. Fleming points out that Rossini may have had reasons of his own to compose it, and dedicated it in response to staging the first performance.|$|E

5|$|De l'Orme's {{original}} {{plans have}} not survived. Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, however, has left us {{a set of}} plans for the Tuileries. One engraving shows a grandiose palace, with three courts and two oval halls. This design is atypical of de l'Orme's style and so {{is likely to have}} been du Cerceau's own proposal or his son Baptiste's. It recalls the houses with tall pavilions and multiple courtyards that du Cerceau often drew in the 1560s and 1570s. Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau's courtyards were Catherine de' Medici's idea. She may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments. Du Cerceau's drawings reveal that, before he published them in 1576, Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine. Only the ground floor of the first section, <b>the</b> <b>Petite</b> Galerie, was completed in her lifetime. It was left to Henry IV, who ruled from 1589 to 1610, to add the second floor and the Grande Galerie that finally linked the two palaces.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on <b>the</b> <b>Petite</b> claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a mobile}} war party of 150 Albany militia and Iroquois warriors under Captain John Schuyler marched and canoed {{overland}} to Montreal, imitating <b>the</b> <b>petite</b> guerre tactics (long-range expeditions into enemy territory) perfected by the French colonists. Schuyler's expedition {{was designed to}} seize Montreal and pin French forces south of Quebec, allowing the Boston fleet to sail against the capital unopposed. Smallpox, lack of supplies, and disagreements among the officers caused most of the militia and Iroquois to turn back in disgust, leaving Schuyler with {{a fraction of the}} 855 men promised by the New England authorities. On 4 September the English raiders attacked settlements south of Montreal, killing some 50 habitants {{in the middle of their}} harvests. Too weak to risk a battle with the town's garrison, Schuyler wrapped up the New England invasion and turned home. Thus, when Phips was sighted off Tadoussac, Frontenac ordered the garrisons of Montreal and Trois-Rivières to make for the threatened capital with all haste. Four days later the Governor arrived in Quebec with 200–300 troops freed-up by the failure of Schuyler's invasion, considerably lifting the capital's spirit of resistance.|$|E
