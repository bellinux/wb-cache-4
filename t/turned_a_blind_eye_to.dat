5|$|After his capture, the U.S. Army handed Hartmann, his pilots, {{and ground}} crew {{over to the}} Soviet Union on 14 May, where he was imprisoned in {{accordance}} with the Yalta Agreements, which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them. Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open-air compound to await the transfer. The number of prisoners grew to 50,000. Living conditions deteriorated, and some American guards <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> escapes. In some cases they assisted by providing food and maps.|$|E

They fled to Cambodia, where they were happily given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Cambodia and South Vietnam had been on bad terms; Cambodia <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> Vietnamese communists using their territory as a staging ground, while Diệm and Nhu had tried to foment opposition and had supported attempts to overthrow the Cambodian leader. Nhu had failed in a 1959 attempt to assassinate Sihanouk with a parcel bomb, and both nations' leaders despised one another.|$|E

Before the collapse, some people expressed concerns about the safety of the Bonfire, citing the partial collapse that occurred in a previous Bonfire, the progressively shorter Bonfire burn times (collapse of the stack after lighting) which had dropped from several hours to less than 20minutes, and numerous incidents involving alcohol or unsafe horseplay at the Bonfire site. One of the students killed in the 1999 Bonfire collapse was under the legal drinking age yet a toxicology test showed high blood-alcohol levels; however, lower readings in a second test and inconsistencies in the initial sampling and annotation methods led to questions about the accuracy of the original tests.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1965, Buddhist {{protests against}} junta-appointed {{civilian}} Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương broke out across South Vietnam. The unrest came after Huong had unveiled {{plans to expand}} conscription and {{the war against the}} communists, and demonstrations were at their largest in I Corps, a Buddhist and anti-war escalation stronghold. In Huế, matters degenerated into a riot as 5,000 demonstrators attacked the United States Information Service Library and burned 8,000 books. Khánh and Thi were thought to have <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the rioting in order to allow the disorder to ruin the Huong government and allow them to inherit power. Khánh decided to have the armed forces replace Huong, and on the morning of 27 January, Khánh staged a bloodless putsch with the support of Thi and Kỳ. However, many of the officers had agreed to Khánh's plan in hopes he would fail and discredit himself.|$|E
5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained {{that he had been}} there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E

25|$|Charles I of England, {{to protect}} his own dignity and Buckingham, who had failed to ensure the {{invasion}} fleet was well supplied, {{made no effort to}} inquire as to the cause of the failure of the Cadiz Expedition.

In this case, it was the conservative mother of the previous crown prince, who had died before he could ascend the throne. The new king’s father, Yi Ha-ung, a wily and ambitious man in his early forties, was given the traditional title of the unreigning father of a king: Heungseon Daewongun, or “Prince of the Great Court”.|$|E

25|$|However, it {{has been}} argued that one of Lee's failings as {{president}} of Washington College was an apparent indifference to crimes of violence towards blacks committed by students at the college. Historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor notes that students at Washington College formed their own chapter of the KKK and were known by the local Freedmen’s Bureau to attempt to abduct and rape black schoolgirls from the nearby black schools. There were also at least two attempted lynchings by Washington students during Lee’s tenure.

25|$|Hoveyda's plan {{to crack}} down on {{corruption}} became an example of the entrenched ineptitude of many in power. Many important members of the government were corrupt, and the Shah was consistently flattered and schmoozed by them and <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the problem. The Shah began receiving an increasingly distorted picture of Iranian society, while becoming completely blind to increasing frustration to this rule by regular Iranians, as well as the shortcomings of his own government. Hoveyda's inability to move forward with his personal mandate eventually turned the overtly optimistic prime minister into a cynic. After years of political maneuvering, most of his proposed initiatives were stonewalled by bureaucratic obstacles. During the 1970s, the now veteran Prime Minister became nonchalant when it came to following through with his own convictions. His earlier aggression towards the dysfunctions of an obtrusive system slowly turned into feigned support. Publicly, Hoveyda assumed the notion that the regime in its current state would eventually reform on its own, and that political liberalization was only a small issue {{in the grand scheme of}} modernization. In private, Hoveyda often lamented over Iran's conditions, admitting to insufficiencies of the state and his own political impotence. The powerlessness of the premier's office was coupled with intricate internal rivalries. Hoveyda had an intensely rough relationship with the likes of Asadollah Alam and Ardeshir Zahedi, son of the famed participant in the 1953 coup against Mossadegh, General Fazlollah Zahedi.|$|E

He dressed him in an imposing blue uniform, gave him a peaked cap, and used him as a guard to the door of his study; Bazna excluded visitors when Sir Hughe was thinking or napping. For ceremonial occasions, Sir Hughe dressed him in richly embroidered brocade, shoes with turned up toes, a fez with a tassel, gave him an immense scimitar, and placed him on the main door. Sir Hughe also paid him more than the 100 Turkish lira that was standard for a valet, and quietly <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the fact that Bazna {{was having an affair with}} Lady Knatchbull-Hugessen's handmaiden in the servants' quarters."
