The members of Real Madrid, called socios, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of <b>the</b> <b>club.</b> As of 2010, <b>the</b> <b>club</b> has 60,000 socios. At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year.

5|$|Bamlett was {{manager for}} four years, {{but was unable}} to muster any success, the club's highest {{position}} during his reign being 12th. <b>The</b> <b>club</b> was relegated to the Second Division again in 1931, and Bamlett was replaced by club secretary Walter Crickmer.

5|$|Hodgson's {{departure}} from <b>the</b> <b>club</b> in 1989 marked {{the start of}} a 15-year period during which Malmö FF failed to win a league or cup title.

He was replaced by Dane Viggo Jensen in July 1992. Jensen returned to Denmark {{at the end of the}} 1993 season, and was succeeded by Rolf Zetterlund, who managed <b>the</b> <b>club</b> between 1994 and 1996. Zetterlund's time at <b>the</b> <b>club</b> was fairly successful as <b>the</b> <b>club</b> finished each of his years in charge in the top four league places. Dutchman Frans Thijssen took Zetterlund's place in January 1997, and stayed at <b>the</b> <b>club</b> until August 1998 when he was sacked following poor results in Allsvenskan and European competition. Roland Andersson then managed <b>the</b> <b>club</b> until it was relegated at the end of the 1999 season. As <b>the</b> <b>club</b> had never before been relegated (having only previously been removed from the top division by a punitive demotion), Andersson was sacked.

5|$|On 7 January 2011, {{the parts}} {{announced}} that they had reached a compromise. Stabæk would remain at Telenor Arena {{for at least the}} 2011 season. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>club</b> held an option to take over the responsibility for events at the venue. Stabæk Fotball had until 30 June to accept the option, which would allow <b>the</b> <b>club</b> to remain at the venue on a permanent basis. This would require them to invest NOK20 million in an event administration, which would increase event revenue, {{but at the same time}} move the risk from Stabæk Holding to Stabæk Fotball. If <b>the</b> <b>club</b> declined the option, they would not be allowed to play at the venue from the 2012 season. On 30 June, Stabæk {{announced that they}} would not fulfill the option to continue renting the stadium. The necessary NOK35 million would entail a risk <b>the</b> <b>club</b> was not willing to take. <b>The</b> <b>club</b> stated that they hoped they could remain at the stadium by establishing a foundation which could purchase the venue form Ulrichsen. If this does not work out, <b>the</b> <b>club</b> will have to relocate from the 2012 season. <b>The</b> <b>club</b> is then considering relocating back to Nadderud, to Ullevaal or to Marienlyst. <b>The</b> <b>club</b> estimates that any relocation would result in <b>the</b> <b>club</b> losing half their revenue. Stabæk played its last match at Fornebu Arena on 20 November 2011, losing 1–2 against Haugesund. Subsequently, the pitch was removed, and Stabæk returned to Nadderud from the 2012 season.|$|E
