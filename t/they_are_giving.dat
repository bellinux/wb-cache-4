Pastor Bob Beeman of Sanctuary International stated that this is a compliment to secular music, as it lets people to listen to the music they enjoyed without feeling like <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> up on the style they love and allows bands to crossover into mainstream success.|$|E
25|$|In July, 2011, GoDaddy {{introduced}} {{a policy of}} blocking DNS queries from some outside DNS servers, {{in order to prevent}} other DNS queries from being too slow. Among other things, this prevents some bots from visiting websites, forcing some search engines to exclude domains hosted with GoDaddy. This policy affects search engine ranking for various GoDaddy customers who have multiple domains with different registrars. GoDaddy has refused to comment on the policy or the perception that their servers cannot handle the load or <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> preference to their platinum level customers. It has also interfered with projects that collect Internet statistics.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> too much social support to other SNS friends. This dark side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'. It {{is caused by the}} extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.|$|E

50|$|In an {{experiment}} conducted by Raghubir and Srivastava, university students <b>were</b> <b>given</b> a dollar, either in quarters or {{as a single}} dollar bill.

Consistent with the theory, the students <b>given</b> the quarters <b>were</b> more likely {{to spend the money}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{obtain the}} full non-perturbative {{thresholds}} of $R^ 4 $ terms in IIB string theory compactified to eight and seven dimensions. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> by the perturbative results plus a sum over D-instantons and (p,q) string instantons. The thresholds are shown to <b>be</b> U-duality invariant. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> by a weight- 3 / 2 non holomorphic form of SL(3,Z) and a weight- 1 form of SL(2,Z) in the eight-dimensional case. In seven dimensions <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> by a weight- 3 / 2 form of SL(5,Z). We conjecture also formulae for the non-perturbative thresholds in lower dimensional compactifications...|$|R
25|$|The cap also {{includes}} a provision to close a potential loophole that would provide incentives for teams to skirt the cap by signing an older player to a long-term deal that would not end until after the team expects the player to retire. Cap analyst Larry Coon outlined how this potential loophole would work:For example, suppose the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception is $9 million. With 5% raises, a three-year contract would total $28.35 million. But if they added a fourth year to the contract, the salary would total $38.7 million. If the player retires after three seasons and continues drawing his salary for the additional season, then he effectively will be paid $38.7 million for three years' work. In essence, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> the player a three-year contract with additional deferred compensation.|$|E
25|$|The Attorney General is a non-cabinet {{minister}} {{who leads the}} Attorney General's Office. The rule that no Attorney General may be a cabinet minister is a political convention rather than a law, and {{for a short time}} the Attorney General did sit in cabinet, starting with Lord Birkenhead in 1915 and ending with Douglas Hogg in 1928. There is nothing that prohibits Attorneys-General from attending meetings of the cabinet, and on occasion they have been asked to attend meetings to advise the government on the best course of action legally. Despite this it is considered preferable to exclude Attorneys General from cabinet meetings so as to draw a distinct line between them and the political decisions on which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> legal advice. As a government minister, the Attorney General is directly answerable to Parliament.|$|E

500|$|With these issues, Kavanagh {{argues that}} there {{are likely to be}} consequences. Firstly, if judges replace the text of a statute with the meaning given to it by a single {{minister}} in Parliament, there is a risk that they will attribute a meaning to it which was not supported by the MPs; interpretations, based on the views of ministers, are more likely to reflect the executive's intention than that of Parliament. Kavanagh also suggests that it could impact on the actions of ministers; rather than attempting to specify law through the difficult route of placing it in legislation, they can simply make a statement within Parliament about the legislation's intent. Lord Mackay's worry that this would increase the cost of litigation was also considered; under Pepper, every lawyer must go through every word said in both Houses of Parliament and in the various committees to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> the best advice to their client. Academics have also expressed worry about the reliability of Hansard as a source; [...] "the debate on the Bill is a battle of wits often carried out under extreme pressure and excitement where much more than the passage of this Bill may be at stake. The Ministers supporting it cannot be expected to act as if they were under oath in a court of law".|$|E
