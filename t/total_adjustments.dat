One such method was making a <b>total</b> <b>adjustments</b> for every case, even when customer complaints were unreasonable. The advantage of this method was described as a possible increase in confidence of the customer towards the firm, resulting in the customer making more purchases. This theory described similar effects with SRP. Before the term Service Recovery Paradox was first used, the concept was described by these quotes in the theoretical paper by Hart, Hessket and Sasser: [...] "A good recovery can turn angry, frustrated customers into loyal ones. It can, in fact, create more goodwill than if things had gone smoothly in the first place”. It was also theorized that this concept could be used strategically to increase customer retention.The term Service Recovery Paradox was coined in 1992 by Michael McCollough and Sundar Bharadwaj, who defined service recovery as [...] "a situation in which a consumer has experienced a problem which has been satisfactory resolved, and where the consumer subsequently rates their satisfaction to be equal to or greater than that in which no problem had occurred". After its initial use, the concept has been a topic of research and the results on its existence have been inconclusive.|$|E

By having to source current-year funds for upward adjustments to canceled-year accounts, we are making scarce resources even more scarce.

By doing this, we are losing all automated tracking to the appropriated accounts or programs incurring the upward adjustments.

This value is considerably weaker than the estimate of − 1. 2 W m− 2 in AR 4.

We find that, in the CMIP 5 multimodel median, the ERF in the terrestrial spectrum is small, unless microphysical effects on ice- and mixed-phase clouds are parameterized. In the latter case it is large but accompanied by a very strong ERF in the solar spectrum. The <b>total</b> <b>adjustments</b> can be separated into microphysical adjustments (aerosol “effects”) and thermodynamic adjustments.

40|$|We test several {{categories}} of ratios-short-term liquidity, performance measures, {{earnings per share}} (EPS), capital structure, and the gross margin ratio-to determine if they have equilibrium values or follow a random walk. For ratios with an equilibrium value, {{the speed at which}} the ratio returns to equilibrium from out-of-equilibrium conditions is measured. Since equilibrating forces may differ with firm size, we also test for differences in adjustment speeds between small and large firms. An accounting ratio may have an equilibrium value if management targets a certain ratio so that any deviation from the target causes management to initiate actions that will return the ratio to target. Also, although management may not be targeting a ratio, the interaction of management's actions with external market industry forces may lead to an equilibrium value. We investigate the <b>total</b> <b>adjustment</b> over time and then assess both the relative adjustment speed and the relative weights of the two main equilibrating forces: industry and management. The statistical technique used allows each firm to have its own, unknown equilibrium value. In addition, we remove an important sampling bias in measuring the autocorrelation coefficient. The results show that when firms experience a liquidity shock, equilibrating forces counterbalance {{a little more than a}} third of the shock in the next period. This finding suggests that firms' liquidity ratios have a fast adjustment to equilibrium values. EPS ratios also have a high adjustment rate to equilibrium value; about one-third to one-half of the shock is adjusted within one period. For performance measures (net operating income over sales or assets), for the equity to debt and gross margin ratios, the findings imply a relatively long adjustment process to equilibrium values. Supplementary tests suggest that smaller firms adjust their ratios to the optimal target more swiftly than large firms. Separating the ratios' <b>total</b> <b>adjustment</b> effect into industry and management components provides evidence that the adjustment rates differ for different industries. On average, the management adjustment is faster than the industry effect. A weighting measure suggests that both industry and-management contribute a significant share to the <b>total</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Tests of the predictive power of the model show that historical control of performance ratios is correlated with future actual performance. Also, firms that were acquired showed better than average control of their liquidity and performance ratios and showed a destabilization of their equilibrium EPS ratios. Finally, comparing the adjustment rate with a sample of firms from an earlier time period shows a stability of the adjustment behavior over time. Information about the existence of equilibrium ratios and their adjustment speeds can help predict future values or events, and identify firms in special categories, for example, firms that will be acquired. It can also help in the evaluation of managerial actions insofar as managers have control over aspects of the financial ratios examined...|$|R

The bulk of the earnings adjustment was driven by a reduction in working hours, as well as a shift away from the better-paid industrial sector.

40|$|Abstract A {{decrease}} in cloud cover over higher latitudes—a {{decrease in}} the extratropical albedo—especially over the Southern Ocean, can result in an extratropical and tropical warming with {{the intensity of the}} equatorial cold tongues in the Pacific and Atlantic basins decreasing. These results, obtained by means of a coupled ocean–atmosphere model of intermediate complexity that allow the prescription of atmospheric cloud cover, are relevant to future global warming, and also to conditions during the Pliocene some 3 million years ago. The mechanisms responsible for the response of the tropics to changes in the extra-tropics include atmospheric and oceanic connections. This tropical adjustment can be interpreted from the constraint of a balanced heat budget for the ocean: A change in the albedo of the Southern Hemisphere causes the ocean to lose less heat there, so that it has to gain less heat in the tropics. As a consequence the cold tongues are reduced, particularly in the eastern Pacific where a {{decrease in the}} zonal tilt of the equatorial thermocline significantly weakens the east-west sea surface temperature gradient. The <b>total</b> <b>adjustment</b> time scale of the equatorial Pacific to the extratropical perturbation is of the order of interdecadal to centennial time scales, and thus represents a new mechanism of rapid climate change...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Water is {{a limited}} and {{unbalanced}} distributed resource in China, with the per capita amount of water resource there is only about one-fourth of the world's average. However, water is an essential resource for people’s lives and economic development. Over {{the past two decades}} China has seen the fruit of its rapid economic growth, nevertheless, a severe water shortage is behind this prosperous scenario and is becoming worse. Efficient water supply is certainly essential for the sustainable development of human beings. This paper analyzes water efficiency by incorporating water as an input as well as using conventional inputs such as labor employment and capital stock. An index of a water adjustment target ratio (WATR) is established from the production frontier constructed by data envelopment analysis (DEA) including water as an input. The water efficiency of regions is obtained from a total-factor framework with both residential and productive water use. A U-shape relation is discovered between the total-factor water efficiency and per capita real income among areas in China. The central area has the worst water efficiency ranking and the <b>total</b> <b>adjustment</b> amount of water use there is around three-fourth of China’s total.

The pre-announcement price drift accounts on average for about half of the <b>total</b> price <b>adjustment.</b> These results imply that some traders have private information about macroeconomic fundamentals. The evidence suggests that the pre-announcement drift likely comes from a combination of information leakage and superior forecasting based on proprietary data collection and reprocessing of public information...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} semilinear partial {{differential}} equation (PDE) {{associated with the}} non-linear BSDE characterizing buyer’s and seller’s XVA in a framework that allows for asymmetries in funding, repo and collateral rates, {{as well as for}} early contract termination due to counterparty credit risk. We show the existence of a unique classical solution to the PDE by first proving the existence and uniqueness of a viscosity solution and then its regularity. We use the uniqueness result to conduct a thorough numerical study illustrating how funding costs, repo rates, and counterparty credit risk contribute to determine the <b>total</b> valuation <b>adjustment...</b>|$|R
