5|$|To be {{eligible}} to vote at a contested election in any constituency, a voter's name must be on the latest certified register of electors for that constituency. The name of the voter {{will be included in}} the register of electors for a constituency if on the cut-off date for the production of the register of electors the voter is a citizen of Singapore, at least 21 years old, and ordinarily resident or deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore at an address that is in that constituency. For the purpose of preparing or revising a register of electors, information stated on a voter's National Registration Identity Card is used to determine that he or she complies with the above requirements, unless <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> shown to be otherwise.|$|E

Time flies by and Dal-po is now a first year reporter at a broadcasting company who struggles with the idea of justice and truth in a world where <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> often hidden. Pinocchio was another hit, with a reported revenue of 6.2 billion won (US$5.62 million) for broadcasting rights in just one year.|$|E
25|$|Li Bai is {{generally}} considered {{to have been born}} in 701, in Suyab (碎葉) of ancient Chinese Central Asia (present-day Kyrgyzstan), where his family had prospered in business at the frontier. Afterwards, the family under the leadership of his father, Li Ke (李客), moved to Jiangyou, near modern Chengdu, in Sichuan province, when the youngster was perhaps five years old. There is some mystery or uncertainty about the circumstances of the family relocations, at the very least a lack of legal authorization which would have generally been required {{to move out of the}} border regions, especially if one's family had been assigned (exiled) there. However, despite much speculation, <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> scant.|$|E
25|$|The body found beside Alistair in the {{original}} investigation was not that of his wife, but that of Dorothea; Margaret had died a month earlier {{at the hands of}} her sister, who fatally injured her as part of a psychotic episode. Before she died, she made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest, to which both he and Zélie concealed the truth by planting Margaret's body {{at the foot of a}} cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died. Dorothea then took her sister's place. While she fooled the servants easily, she could not fool the Ravenscrofts' dog, which could distinguish between the sisters, thus explaining why it bit her. A month later, Alistair murdered her to prevent her from injuring anyone else, making certain she held the revolver before she was killed, and then committed suicide afterwards.

25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but everybody {{will be talking about}} it to everybody else. <b>The</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for it out of her own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E

500|$|The Whistleblower premiered on September 13, 2010, at the Toronto International Film Festival, and Samuel Goldwyn Films {{distributed}} {{the film in}} theaters in the United States. The film was advertised as a fictionalization of events occurring during the late 1990s. Kondracki said that <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> broadly accurate but some details were omitted for the film; for example, a three-week [...] "breaking-in" [...] period for trafficking victims was not shown. The film received mixed reviews. The performances by Weisz and her co-stars were praised, but the intense violence depicted in several scenes was debated by critics, with some calling it exploitative. Kondracki and Weisz responded that what happened in Bosnia had been toned down for the film. The Whistleblower received several awards and nominations, including three nominations at the 2012 Genie Awards. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E

However, the Supreme Court {{partially}} {{backed away from the}} originality doctrine in CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada. [...] Under the CCH ruling, someone may assert protection in a database where <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> themselves not copied from another source. For example, a person may assert protection in a collection of her own recipes, but she may not assert protection in a database of facts about persons and their ancestry compiled from census records.|$|E
2500|$|So did Fearchar {{appear from}} nowhere as a [...] "novus homo"? <b>The</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> {{that we do}} not know what {{happened}} to the Mormaerdom of Ross after the death, in 1168, of the last known Mormaer, Malcolm MacHeth. We might compare Ross with other Mormaerdoms, such as Lennox and Carrick, in which these apparently new Mormaerdoms were merely de iure royal grants to native lords who already possessed kinship leadership and de facto status as provincial rulers. In this view, conferring this style was simply an act of harnessing organic Gaelic power structures to the political, terminological and ideological framework of the regnum Scottorum.|$|E

After some stone-pelting, four coaches of the train were set alight, trapping many people inside. 59 people including 27 women and 10 children were burnt to death, and 48 others were injured. According to J Mahapatra, additional {{director general of the}} Gujarat police, [...] "miscreants had kept the petrol-soaked rags ready for use much before the train had arrived at the Godhra". Martha Nussbaum has challenged this narrative, stating that several inquiries have found that the conflagration was an accident rather than a planned conspiracy.

2500|$|According to Kennedy's Special Counsel Myer Feldman and to Kennedy himself, it is {{impossible}} to reconstruct the precise manner in which Johnson's vice-presidential nomination ultimately took place. Kennedy did realize that he could not be elected without support of traditional Southern Democrats, most of whom had backed Johnson; nevertheless, labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to Johnson. After much back and forth with party leaders and others on the matter, Kennedy did offer Johnson the vice-presidential nomination at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel at 10:15am on July 14, the morning after he was nominated, and Johnson accepted. From that point to the actual nomination that evening, <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> in dispute in many respects.
