5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them to believe the enemy was breaking. Another four or five days, they thought, would be sure <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

She leads the golden armada against Artanis's forces, who holds them out {{long enough for the}} Keystone <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them</b> free from Amon's control. Under Artanis's urging, Selendis severs her nerve cord and urges her fellow templar to sever their cords as well, permanently freeing them from Amon's grasp.|$|E

5|$|The {{other type}} of solids is weak {{molecular}} crystals (e.g., fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are held together essentially by physical forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds). Since these solids are held together by weak forces, a very low input of energy is required <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them,</b> thus they are termed “low energy”. Depending {{on the type of}} liquid chosen, low-energy surfaces can permit either complete or partial wetting.|$|E
5|$|Some time in 1974, on the {{recommendation}} of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club the Hard Rock. Browning had previously managed Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, unsuccessfully trying <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them</b> into the UK market. He did not like their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and Harry Vanda.|$|E
5|$|As the CPP {{required}} a two-third {{majority in the}} National Assembly to form a government, it offered FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), which had come in third place in the elections, to become joint partners of a coalition government. Both Ranariddh and Rainsy, now the leader of his eponymous party refused, and filed complaints against election irregularities to the National Election Committee (NEC). When the NEC turned down their complaints, they organised public protests between 24 August until 7 September 1998, when riot police stepped in <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them</b> up. Subsequently, Sihanouk meditated two meetings in September and November 1998, leading to a political deal being struck between CPP and FUNCINPEC in the second meeting. The deal provided for another coalition government between CPP and FUNCINPEC, with the latter as a junior coalition partner controlling the tourism, justice, education, health, culture and women's-cum-veteran's affairs portfolios. In exchange for FUNCINPEC's support for Hun Sen to become the sole Prime Minister, Ranariddh was made the President of the National Assembly.|$|E

50|$|Quark {{encounters}} Brunt, who {{reveals that}} the entire plan was a set-up designed to help him become the new Grand Nagus. Quark is free to return to Deep Space Nine, but feels too guilty over what he has inadvertently done. The next day, Quark saves Zek by supplying him with enough brilliant advice to turn around the economic situation, but then {{reveals that the}} advice actually came from Ishka. After Quark admits <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>them</b> up, Zek and Ishka happily reunite.|$|R

5|$|Abu Sufyan {{directed}} his effort towards another attack on Medina. He gained {{support from the}} nomadic tribes {{to the north and}} east of Medina; using propaganda about Muhammad's weakness, promises of booty, memories of Quraysh prestige and through bribery. Muhammad's new policy was to prevent alliances against him. Whenever alliances against Medina were formed, he sent out expeditions <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them</b> up. Muhammad heard of men massing with hostile intentions against Medina, and reacted in a severe manner. One example is the assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, a chieftain of the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir. Al-Ashraf went to Mecca and wrote poems that roused the Meccans' grief, anger and desire for revenge after the Battle of Badr. Around a year later, Muhammad expelled the Banu Nadir from Medina forcing their emigration to Syria; he allowed them to take some possessions, as he was unable to subdue the Banu Nadir in their strongholds. The rest of their property was claimed by Muhammad in the name of God as it was not gained with bloodshed. Muhammad surprised various Arab tribes, individually, with overwhelming force, causing his enemies to unite to annihilate him. Muhammad's attempts to prevent a confederation against him were unsuccessful, though he was able to increase his own forces and stopped many potential tribes from joining his enemies.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them</b> up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E
25|$|In many systems, {{redundancy}} in exposing microorganisms to UV {{is achieved}} by circulating the air or water repeatedly.

50|$|It {{is thought}} that this symbol's long lasting {{association}} with the medical profession stems from early use of twigs to draw out long bodied inter muscular parasitic worms by wrapping them slowly around the twig as <b>to</b> not <b>break</b> <b>them</b> or allow them to escape back into the body, a successful treatment still in use today, see Dracunculiasis.|$|R
60|$|So glad were they, and so {{absorbed in}} their occupation, {{that they thought}} not of and cared not {{for the fact that}} a great storm was about <b>to</b> <b>break</b> upon <b>them.</b> It came upon them almost before they were aware, and before the sails could be taken in the boat was almost upset.|$|R
50|$|Cryptography {{properly}} implemented is now {{virtually impossible}} <b>to</b> directly <b>break.</b> Breaking <b>them</b> requires some non-cryptographic input, {{such as a}} stolen key, stolen plaintext (at {{either end of the}} transmission), or some other extra cryptanalytic information.|$|R
25|$|In summary, PDiff is {{more general}} than Diff {{because it allows}} pieces (corners), and one cannot in general smooth corners, while PL is no less general that PDiff because one can linearize pieces (more precisely, one may need <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them</b> up into smaller pieces and then linearize, which is allowed in PDiff).|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} that St Peter's was completed, a style of {{architecture}} was developed by architects who knew all the rules that had been so carefully recovered, and chose <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them.</b> The effect was a dynamic style of architecture in which the forms seem to take on life of their own, moving, swaying and undulating. The name Baroque means 'mis-shapen pearl'.|$|E
50|$|Cadets {{are tested}} by being {{taken on a}} 'hotdog run' into the Cursed Earth <b>to</b> make or <b>break</b> <b>them.</b> This has {{featured}} {{in a number of}} stories, most explicitly in a story of the same name, where Dredd and Giant lead the cadets themselves.|$|R

25|$|The battle began before dawn. The {{first part}} of the battle {{consisted}} of Polish hussars repeatedly charging the fortified Russian positions, attempting <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them.</b> The Polish forces continued to make ferocious attacks, and Samuel Maskiewicz, a witness from one hussar company, claimed that his unit charged eight or ten times. The Polish hussars' attack on the infantry, hidden behind the fences, and using firearms, were not successful.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} match, Orlando Jordan faced Chris Benoit for the United States Championship. The match started with both {{locked up in}} a collar-and-elbow.

Benoit applied the Crippler Crossface to force Jordan to submit to win the match and the title in 25.5 seconds.|$|E

First-aid kits on that train proved empty; a box labelled [...] "Medical Stores" [...] was found to contain only contraceptives.|$|R

25|$|In {{the third}} season premiere, Leonard and Penny finally started a romantic {{relationship}} and had intercourse for the first time. However, the relationship ended after eight months, after Leonard told Penny he loved her and took umbrage at her inability to reciprocate, which led to friction that was exploited by guest star Wil Wheaton who appeared as a fictionalized version of himself, who observed and exacerbated it in order <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them</b> {{up in the middle}} of a bowling match Wheaton's team was having against Leonard, Penny, Sheldon, Howard and Raj.|$|E
25|$|Other {{proteins}} that bind with actin cover {{the ends of}} F-actin in order to stabilize them, but they are unable <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them.</b> Examples {{of this type of}} protein are CapZ (that binds the (+) ends depending on a cell’s levels of Ca2+/calmodulin. These levels depend on the cell’s internal and external signals and are involved in the regulation of its biological functions). Another example is tropomodulin (that binds to the (-) end). Tropomodulin basically acts to stabilize the F-actin present in the myofibrils present in muscle sarcomeres, which are structures characterized by their great stability.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, local {{farmer and}} teacher Ron Purvis adapted the skil-saw concept by {{implementing}} a diamond rotary blade. This enabled the carving {{of the many}} immense jade boulders which line the banks and bed of the Fraser and Bridge Rivers, which were {{on the one hand}} immovable and on the other would shatter or striate if blasting was used <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>them.</b> Purvis' innovation was revolutionary in the jade mining business and larger versions of his saw are at use in the Cassiar region. There are no major commercial jade mines in the Lillooet area today, although local shops still carry polished jade souvenirs.|$|E
