5|$|Millennium {{centers on}} {{offender}} profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who investigates unusual crimes {{as part of}} the private investigative organisation the Millennium Group. In this episode, when Black investigates several killings by a pack of savage dogs, he discovers a strange old man who teaches him more <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> knew about the Group.|$|E
25|$|Kooser {{lives in}} Garland, Nebraska, {{and much of}} his work focuses on the Great Plains. Like Wallace Stevens, Kooser {{spent much of his}} working years as an {{executive}} in the insurance industry, although Kooser sardonically noted {{in an interview with the}} Washington Post that Stevens had far more time to write at work <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> did.|$|E
25|$|Hoover tells Gandy {{to destroy}} his secret files {{after his death}} in order to prevent President Richard Nixon from {{possessing}} them. He visits Tolson, who urges him to retire. Hoover refuses, claiming that Nixon is going to destroy the bureau he has created. Tolson accuses Hoover of having exaggerated his involvement with key events of the Bureau. Moments later, Hoover tells Tolson that he needed him, more <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> needed anyone else. He holds his hand, kisses his forehead, and leaves.|$|E

Here was wealth, indeed, greater <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had <b>ever</b> hoped for. <b>He</b> puzzled {{his brain}} for weeks to {{discover}} how this fairy gift had ever come to him, but he was happier in its possession <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had <b>ever</b> been before in all his life.|$|R

25|$|Drumm was intelligent, shrewd, {{and very}} pessimistic. He saw Charlie {{as the son}} he never had, and offered him the unsentimental advice to regard his Da as his enemy, someone who'd hold him back from {{succeeding}} in life. Drumm advised Charlie to emigrate from Ireland, which {{was no place for}} an ambitious young man. However, Charlie instead took a job as Drumm's clerk. He imagined the job would be only temporary, but he ended up working for Drumm for 14 years. Like his Da, Charlie kept an unprestigious, low-paying job far longer <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> intended to.|$|E
25|$|Nathan-Turner {{had thought}} that he too would finally be leaving the series, but with no other {{producer}} available or {{willing to take on}} the series, he was instructed to remain. As a BBC staff producer, he {{had little choice but to}} either accept this or resign from the Corporation's staff. Not having expected to be producing season twenty-four, Nathan-Turner was left with little time to prepare, hiring inexperienced Andrew Cartmel as script editor on the advice of a friend who had run a BBC Drama Script Unit course that Cartmel had attended, and casting little-known Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel's influence soon changed that. The Seventh Doctor developed into a darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> let on.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{was inaugurated}} as the seventh President of Ireland on 3 December 1990. She proved a remarkably popular {{president}}, earning the praise of Brian Lenihan himself who, {{before his death}} five years later, {{said that she was}} a better president <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> could have been. She took an office that had a reputation as being little more than a retirement position for prominent politicians and breathed new life into the role. Robinson brought to the presidency legal knowledge, deep intellect, and political experience. She reached out to the Irish diaspora (the large number of Irish emigrants and people of Irish descent). She also changed the face of Anglo-Irish relations, when she was the first serving Irish president to visit the United Kingdom and meet Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. She welcomed visits by senior members of the British royal family, most notably the Prince of Wales, to her official residence, Áras an Uachtaráin.|$|E

60|$|Graillot {{resumed his}} seat. He watched {{with an almost}} painful curiosity the changes in Louise's face, which was convulsed by a storm of passionate apprehension. Yet behind it {{all he could see}} the truth. There was {{something}} softer in her face <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had <b>ever</b> perceived before, a tenderer light <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had <b>ever</b> seen in her eyes. He sighed {{and looked down at the}} carpet.|$|R

25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{mounted a}} {{comeback}} {{in the bottom}} of the seventh, when Espinosa led off with a walk and pinch-hitter Chris Heisey followed with a two-run homer off reliever Grant Dayton to cut the Dodgers′ lead to 4-3. When first baseman Clint Robinson followed immediately with a single, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts made the unconventional move of bringing in closer Kenley Jansen to pitch in the seventh inning, something Jansen had not done since 2013. Although the Nats put pressure on Jansen, with Harper singling and Murphy intentionally walked to load the bases, Jansen struck out Rendon for the third out to preserve the Dodgers' lead. Jansen pitched into the ninth inning without giving up another hit, throwing 51 pitches – nine more <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> had before. When Jansen tired {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, walking Harper and Werth with one out, Roberts made another unconventional move, bringing Clayton Kershaw - who had started Game 1 and, on short rest, Game 4 – in for the first save of his career. Kershaw got Murphy to pop out for the second out, and, with no one else left on the bench to face Kershaw, Baker sent rookie Wilmer Difo to the plate. Kershaw struck out the overmatched Difo to preserve a 4-3 win and give Los Angeles a 3-2 series victory. The Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs in the NLDS for the third time in five years, and the Dodgers advanced to face the Chicago Cubs in the 2016 National League Championship Series.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone ranked [...] "Imagine" [...] {{number three}} on {{its list of}} [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time", {{describing}} it as [...] "an enduring hymn of solace and promise that has carried us through extreme grief, from the shock of Lennon's own death in 1980 to the unspeakable horror of September 11th. It is now impossible to imagine a world without 'Imagine', and we need it more <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> dreamed."

500|$|IGN's Brian Zoromski rated [...] "The Merger" [...] 9 out of 10, an {{indication}} of an [...] "amazing" [...] episode. He called the opening sequence [...] "arguably the funniest" [...] scene, and believed [...] "Andy's proven to be an even better source of hilarity <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> was in the Stamford office." [...] Zoromski was unhappy however with the [...] "outright product placement [...] " [...] with Staples, writing that [...] "the show's quality felt a little compromised. It's one thing to see blatant product placement in a reality show like Survivor or American Idol but when it invades a great scripted comedy… well, it kinda drags the show down to the reality level." [...] Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times thought the episode was [...] "funnier than it's been in a while," [...] praising Kelly but criticizing the [...] "fat-guy joke." [...] Elfman cited Michael and Andy's new relationship as a positive element. Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A+.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{watched the}} episode for TrekNation in May 2009. She also {{thought that it}} was a {{pleasant}} episode but that it [...] "never approaches greatness". She felt that D'Sora never achieved the intimacy that Ishara Yar did with Data, and that the subplot was simply something created so that Picard had something to do. She summed up the ending of the episode by saying that [...] "I don't believe that Data can't be hurt emotionally, but he's more invested in his cat <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> seems to be in Jenna D'Sora." [...] Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in May 2012, describing it as a [...] "clunker" [...] and a re-hash of the earlier episode [...] "" [...] but [...] "without the gravitas". He thought that having Picard pilot the shuttle was ridiculous, especially as the character admitted in the episode [...] "11001001" [...] that {{it had been years since}} he had worked the helm of a ship. He summed it up saying that, [...] "ultimately, it's a rehash of a Wesley Crusher episode. A really really bad Wesley Crusher episode" [...] and gave it a score of two out of ten.|$|E
500|$|Affleck {{reunited with}} {{director}} Michael Bay for the critically derided war drama Pearl Harbor (2001). He later characterized it {{as a film}} he did [...] "for money– for the wrong reasons". A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck and Kate Beckinsale [...] "do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars". But Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "the blandly handsome Affleck couldn’t convince that he’d ever so much as been turned down for a date, much less lost {{the love of his}} life to his best friend". Affleck then parodied Good Will Hunting with Damon and Van Sant in Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), made a cameo in the comedy Daddy and Them (2001), and had a supporting role in the little-seen The Third Wheel (2002). He portrayed the CIA analyst Jack Ryan in the thriller The Sum of All Fears (2002). Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt he was miscast in a role previously played by both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin: [...] "Although Mr. Affleck can be appealing when playing earnest young men groping toward maturity, he simply lacks the gravitas for the role." [...] Affleck had an [...] "amazing experience" [...] making the thriller Changing Lanes (2002), and later cited Roger Michell as someone he learned from as a director. Robert Koehler of Variety described it as one of the actor's [...] "most thoroughly wrought" [...] performances: [...] "The journey into a moral fog compels him to play more inwardly and thoughtfully <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> has before." ...|$|E

2500|$|His sheer energy {{helped to}} revolutionise the often stuffy world of Victorian journalism, while his blend of sensationalism and indignation, now so familiar, {{set the tone}} for British tabloids for more than a century. Like many journalists, he was a curious mixture of conviction, opportunism and sheer humbug. According to his biographer W. Sydney Robinson, [...] "He twisted facts, invented stories, lied, betrayed confidences, but always with a genuine desire to reform the world - and himself." [...] According to Dominic Sandbrook, [...] "Stead's papers forced his readers to confront the seedy underbelly of their own civilisation, but the editor {{probably}} knew more about that dark world <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> let on. He held up a mirror to Victorian society, yet deep down, like so many tabloid crusaders, he was raging at his own reflection." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most historians see {{liberalism}} in {{the doldrums}} in the 1950s, {{with the old}} spark of New Deal dreams overshadowed by the glitzy complacency and conservatism of the Eisenhower years. Adlai Stevenson lost in two landslides, and he presented few new liberal proposals apart from a suggestion for a worldwide ban on nuclear tests. As Barry Karl noted, Stevenson [...] "has suffered more at hands of the admirers he failed <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> did from the enemies who defeated him". [...] Many liberals bemoan the willingness of Democratic leaders in Congress (Lyndon B. Johnson and Sam Rayburn) to collaborate with Eisenhower, and {{the commitment of the}} AFL-CIO unions and most liberal spokesmen such as Senators Hubert Humphrey and Paul Douglas to anti-Communism at home and abroad. They decry the weak attention most liberals paid to the nascent Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
2500|$|... 2005 saw an {{improvement}} in Toyota's fortunes. The team retained Trulli for the season but replaced Zonta with race-winner Ralf Schumacher from Williams. During the team's launch for their 2005 car, the TF105, Schumacher {{said that he had}} a better chance of winning the title at Toyota <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>ever</b> did at Williams. The team also supplied engines to the Jordan team. Toyota made a good start to the season, with Jarno Trulli qualifying second at the opening round in Australia and finishing second at the following two races in Malaysia and Bahrain. Results petered away slightly from this point, with Trulli scoring his only other podium with 3rd place at Spain and Ralf Schumacher rewarding the squad with 3rd place at both Hungary and China and a pole position at the Japanese Grand Prix. Nevertheless, the 2005 season was Toyota's most successful Formula One season by far, as they scored points in all but the opening race and the controversial United States Grand Prix, where Trulli qualified in pole position, but like all the drivers using Michelin tyres, retired {{before the start of the}} race.|$|E
